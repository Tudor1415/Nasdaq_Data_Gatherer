The federal government has sent out a huge number of  to get much-needed money into the hands of those in need, and some lawmakers are looking to take .The majority of stimulus payments that the federal government has made came through direct deposit, with a fee-free transfer of money into people's bank accounts. Yet several million Americans have received stimulus payments in the form of a prepaid debit card. That's caused some confusion among those who expected checks, but it's also giving some incremental business to three publicly traded companies: , , and .Image source: Getty Images.Roughly 4 million people had stimulus payments sent to them in the form of debit cards. The federal government chose to use debit cards rather than checks for certain taxpayers who'd had their tax returns processed at specific IRS service centers.The debit cards are issued under the Visa payment network, with Meta Financial subsidiary MetaBank acting as the issuing financial institution. MetaBank acts as the financial agent for the U.S. Treasury Department as part of its Bureau of the Fiscal Service, which is likely why it got the nod to move forward with stimulus debit cards. Fiserv is the parent company of Money Network Cardholder Services, which is responsible for providing customer service to those receiving the cards.With 4 million people getting $1,200 per adult and $500 per child, there's not a huge amount of money represented by these stimulus debit cards. $4.8 billion is just a tiny fraction of a percent of the annual payment volume that Visa handles on its network. Similarly, Fiserv has extensive relationships with card issuers to help with a wide variety of customer service needs, so the incremental benefit of stimulus debit cards isn't likely to be all that large.The story is potentially different for Meta Financial. With a market capitalization of just $730 million, Meta is tiny compared to Fiserv and Visa. Moreover, as issuer, Meta stands to receive fee revenue from the card offering.Admittedly, the fees for the stimulus debit cards are fairly reasonable. The cards allow one free out-of-network ATM withdrawal and one free cash withdrawal at a bank teller window. There are no opening or monthly maintenance fees, and debit transactions are allowed at no cost. In-network ATM withdrawals are always available at no cost, and even once the card starts charging fees, the $2 cost for out-of-network ATMs, $3 for international withdrawals, and $5 for bank teller withdrawals isn't out of line for the industry.Yet debit card companies see working for the federal government as an opportunity to introduce customers to their products. Once someone gets used to using a prepaid debit card to handle their finances, they're more likely to turn to similar products that these private-sector companies offer in other parts of their business -- products that can produce more revenue.Unfortunately, many people were unprepared to receive stimulus debit cards. As they came in plain envelopes to deter mail fraud, some recipients thought they were junk mail or scams and threw them away. The IRS has directed those who did so to contact Fiserv's Money Network customer service for a replacement. The first replaced card comes with a waiver of the usual $7.50 reissue fee.The stimulus payment process has been painful for many Americans, and it could continue to have an impact on \u00a0for the rest of 2020 and beyond. For investors, though, it's interesting to see how Fiserv, Meta Financial, and Visa are ultimately benefiting from stimulus prepaid debit cards.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.\u00a0\u00a0 It's Monday, May 18. I'm your host Jason Moser, and on today's   show, we're going to dig into one of the newer kids on the public markets block -- Bill.com. We're going to take a closer look at what the company does, and what investors should know before considering it as a potential addition to their portfolios. As always, we've got a couple of stocks we're watching this coming week.And joining me, as always, down on Rainbow Row in Charleston, South Carolina, at least virtually, it's Certified Financial Planner Matt Frankel. Matt, how's everything going? Pretty good. We're having some beautiful weather here this week, and not just in the virtual background, but in real life. It's been about 90 degrees, sunny, I took the kids swimming, and things are reopening and it's a good day. Yeah, yeah. I hope that we will start seeing that reopening here. Virginia has entered into that phase one, but Northern Virginia felt like it was still not quite time, and so they delayed Northern Virginia I think a couple of weeks, but people are certainly champing at the bit here. And activity is no doubt picking up. I mean, you can see more traffic on the streets and people around. So, I think, hopefully, we're turning a corner here, and we can get onto a little bit more of business as usual but, you know, we just got to, kind of, wait and see.Anyway, Matt, this week we wanted to jump into taking a look at one particular company, and you know, normally every week we're talking about the news stories and our earnings stories and what not, and earning season is wrapped up and we thought this would be a great opportunity to dig into a particular company, one that is still relatively new to a lot of people, just IPO'd recently, that's Bill.com.And on Dec. 11, 2019, Bill.com said \"hello!\" to the public markets. The stock IPO'd under the ticker symbol BILL. Shares priced at $22 apiece, it raised a little bit over $200 million for the company at the time. And today it is a $5.6 billion market cap. The stock has done very, very well in its short time. Like I said, they priced at $22 per share, it was knocking on the $100 door at one point, but trading in that $70 to $78 range now.It's headquartered in California; it was founded in 2006 by Rene Lacerte. And they've only reported two earnings quarters to-date. And we always like to give these IPOs a little bit more time before we really start looking at them as investable companies. And that's why I think Bill.com is on our radar now.Matt, let's just start with the basics here in regard to Bill.com. They say their mission is to make it simple to connect and do business. So, what exactly does Bill.com do? So, their job is to make the whole payments and billing processes easier for small and medium-sized businesses. They're kind of like a \u00a0 in the sense that they target the smaller end of the market. They do things like, they'll process accounts payable for companies, they'll invoice customers. It integrates with all the major accounts. The Bill.com's cloud-based offerings integrate with QuickBooks and other accounting software and things like that.So, the kind of interesting statistic that Bill.com shared when they first IPO'd is that 90% of small and medium-sized businesses in the U.S. still use paper checks either to get paid or to pay other people. Just kind of fascinating to think about these days, isn't it? Right, because, I mean, large employers employ a lot of us that are listening right now. And large employers generally use direct deposit to make paychecks, but even so, a lot of large employers send paper checks when they're paying a vendor or paying invoices and things like that. So, this is a massive opportunity that was really not being addressed.Paper checks, they take a lot of time, they're costly, you know, postage, things like that ... ... prone to errors, prone to mistakes. Right. Bill.com, really, just kind of simplifies this process. And like I said, they target the small and medium-sized market. Think of the customers Square would target for payment processing and think, you know, that similar ... and there's 20 million small- and medium-sized businesses in the U.S. So this isn't any tiny market. No, not at all. I mean, if you talk about their market, I mean, I've been looking through their S-1 and they estimate their annual addressable market to be globally $30 billion, domestically $9 billion. And when you look at the fact that their trailing 12-month revenue is something like $120 million, that can give you an idea of the market opportunity they see and where they are in it.To go a little bit into the companies that are customers of Bill.com. I mean, I was looking through their S-1, and at the very beginning, they sort of tell the story and they throw some quotes in there from customers and talk about the value that they offer up to their customers. And I just thought a couple of these quotes, it just kind of, it made a little bit more sense about what they do. And so, you had one customer that said, without Bill.com, we would have had to hire at least one more full-time accounts payable person. That was from a company called Spikeball, an athletic equipment company. And there was another quote that said, Bill.com saved us from having to outsource our accounts payable. By not handing it over to an outside firm, we saved about $150,000 last year. And that's from O&M Restaurant Group, which is a franchise operation that runs Burger Kings and Blaze Pizzas and Taco Bells.And so, that just, kind of, gives you an idea, like you said, they're essentially helping make these payments happen and just doing it in electronic form as opposed to paper, it sounds like. Yeah, definitely. And to, kind of, to get back to your point about how small the revenue is compared to the market opportunity. You mentioned it's just a little over $120 million a year is the quarterly run-rate right now. Bill.com trades for 34 times sales. Square and  are in the 6\u00a0times to 7\u00a0times sales range. So, this is an expensive stock that's trading on its future opportunity ... ... and not profitable either, right? And it's not profitable. [laughs] Just to kind of give you an idea of how reactive the stock is, it soared, I think, by 60% the day after earnings a couple weeks ago, not because it made money, but because it only lost $0.04 a share.[laughs] It's all expectations these days, man, it's all about the expectation. Right. And the expectation is for losses for the foreseeable future. But having said that, the economics of the business really makes sense, especially once it starts to scale. Right now, the gross margin is over 75%. So, as the business scales and things get more efficient and they have to start, you know, invest less money, less percentage of the revenue in growth, it'll scale a little bit and that gross margin should help translate to some nice profits, if they can continue to capture a big share of that addressable market we were talking about. Now, those gross margins you talk about. And that really, that is a great feature, that's a nice dynamic of the business, I think. That gets my interest and makes me [laughs] want to learn a little bit more. Let's talk a little bit about how they make money, because this ultimately is another one of those SaaS businesses, right, that Software-as-a-Service business. And so, they make their money mostly by subscriptions. Right. So the bulk of their revenue comes from subscriptions. You know, the companies pay to subscribe to their services. They also make money, it's kind of an insurance model, they make money from the float, money that they're holding for customers. And it's not an insignificant source of revenue, I want to say, it was over $5 million out of their $30 million or so they generated for the past quarter. So it's a significant percentage of their revenue, that they're holding money for customers and until that money is either paid out or paid to the business, paid to their vendors, whatever, they're making interest on that too. And it comes to the tune of $1 million a year. So, it's not just subscription revenue, there's two main revenue streams.And as they get bigger, that number inherently grows as well. As that float gets bigger, that means their little portion of that float does increase. I mean, it may not ever be the substantial portion of the business, but it is something that has the potential to contribute more and more as time goes on. Well, keep in mind that right now it was -- so, that would work out to about 20% of the company's revenue right now. And this is at a time when interest rates are historically low. So, right now it's holding money, making interest, but it's barely getting paid anything. What if the fed funds rate spikes up to 3% over the next couple of years? That revenue stream gets magnified. And that's on top of all the actual growth of the business.So don't think it as just a subscription business -- it's kind of a really neat model where they're getting paid to hold other people's money, kind of like an insurance company. Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that. And I think, there's clearly the potential to grow that customer base, talking about the growth numbers there in regard to revenue. Looking at the most recent quarter that they just reported, they had over 91,000 customers, and that represented 28% growth from a year ago.And then they also talk about the fact that their platform reaches, because of the network, the customers that they use, it reaches a larger network of small- and medium-sized businesses that are in that network for one reason or another. So, you're talking about 1.8 million-plus network members that they refer to. And in the quarter, they processed 6 million payment transactions, that was up 23% from a year ago. So, clearly, they are growing that user base and people are using it, so they're finding value in the platform somewhere. Yes. And 91 million (sic)\u00a0 [91,000] customers out of the 20 million small and medium-sized businesses. 91,000. 91,000 rather customers out of the 20 million small and medium-sized businesses is [laughs] barely scratching the surface. That's it. Yeah. So, you do see the opportunity that exists there. Now, the question I wanted to ask you in regard to this, because you and I both looked into this business. And one of the things we always look for when it comes to these types of companies, the market clearly sees something there and I think you and I both see something with this business as well. But do you feel like this is a business that has a competitive advantage today or do you feel like it's a business that maybe is in the midst of trying to develop a competitive advantage? I think it's still really trying to be developed. I know you have some thoughts on this, so I don't want to steal what you're about to say, because we discussed this before the show.I think you and I both are going to see it the same way. Yeah, no, I definitely think they have a big competitive advantage as far as they're building a network. The network effect is huge in a business like this. It's kind of where I was going to go with that. I mean, look at CashApp or Venmo and we talked about Square and PayPal. I mean, the real value in Venmo right now is that everyone else uses it -- that's the biggest motivation for a guy like me to get Venmo. I mean, when it comes to new technologies, I'm an old guy. I'm still in my 30s, but I'm, like, 65 in technology years. So, the big motivation for me is the network effect, because so many of my friends have it and it makes it a lot more convenient if I have to send them money.So a similar thing will happen here, like you said, they only have 91,000 customers, but you said, 1.8 million people that they're reaching. Yeah, exactly. So the network effect over time can be a big competitive advantage, so that's what I feel like they're still building. Yeah. And I think that's -- with a business like this, I mean, that's why you're going to see a business like this remain unprofitable for the foreseeable future, because they're investing that money into the growth of the business. They know that the only real way to make this work over the long haul is to get bigger, to grow the customers and to grow that network, and to do that, it just costs money.I mean, this is obviously a very competitive industry and this is a smaller company. So I think you're right, they're investing a lot in that network effect, into that network, to benefit from that network effect. But then think about some of the results from a network effect. I think that a company that invests wisely in that over time, you know, companies and customers then start to see more value in being a part of that network and being a customer of Bill.com. And when you see more value in being that customer, you're willing maybe to pay a little bit more over time to do that, to maintain that relationship. So, they have a little bit of pricing power there. Right. That's kind of what's my next point. The network effect, kind of, is what would transform them from losing money to making money. Right now, their acquisition cost is very high, because like you said, they're growing, they're trying to build the business and they're willing to take a loss to do that. As it gets bigger and bigger and the network effect takes over, their acquisition costs will slow down to the point where they can be profitable, and that's the ultimate goal here.And then it, kind of, increases the cost of switching, both, in terms of convenience and money for their customers. Right now, you can't get rid of Venmo if you have a built-up network with it. [laughs]So, I think the network effect is going to be their big competitive advantage. I think right now the big competitive advantage is they're well-funded and willing to take a loss. It's one of their big advantages right now. Exactly. And they're at a point in time, at least it feels like in the market, where the market is more than happy to embrace these types of businesses. The market seems really excited to give a lot of these businesses the opportunity, at least, to prove themselves. And so, they let that price-to-sales multiple that we talked about, you know, they let those multiples get stretched, because they feel like there's that opportunity.They see a big market opportunity; they see technology that's working. And I think that's something that we didn't really mention here, but something that drives Bill.com's platform. I mean, they certainly are using AI, they're using artificial intelligence to their advantage. I mean, this is a business that was built with technology it's not an old-school business that's having to pivot to a new way of doing things, I mean, this is a business that was really built on this idea of things, like, AI and the cloud and being able to serve customers in a different way that they weren't used to being served. Right. And that's a good point. Bill.com is not the only company that does what it does, that's not at all what we're saying here. But they don't have, kind of, a legacy infrastructure or technology that they're working with, this was, like you said, developed from scratch for this purpose and to do it in a modern and efficient way.I was reading on their site that they claim that invoicing can be done in half the time as with traditional methods, because of their AI technology. I know AI is your favorite and I wish I would have listened to you more about it, incorporating it a little bit more into my portfolio. Yep, it's powerful stuff. You're right. Seeing a lot of businesses are taking these tools that technology has given us today, and it's creating a lot of opportunity there in ways to do things faster and for less cost in most cases. But you mentioned the competition there, and I think that's something worth talking about, because, again, when you look at this business, it's market cap is $5.6 billion, something like that; trailing 12-month sales, $120 million.Let's dismiss the market cap for a second, this is a small, small business. And when you look at the competitive space, I mean, I was just looking through CapIQ, for example, and they list companies like  and the big banks. I mean,  and  were listed there. And this even made me think of another company that I've been digging more and more into lately called , which is focused on business management services processes. They have a payments dynamic to the business as well.I think there are a lot of companies out there that see a big market opportunity out there. And I think this is going to be a very competitive space, which is really going to -- that's going to cost Bill.com in the near-term at least. They're going to have to really pay up to keep this business growing. And remember they're focusing on the lower end of the market too, which a lot of the competitors you named are more focused on larger businesses. Especially the small-business realm, a lot of the big players aren't willing to take a loss to recruit small-business companies into their platform. I wonder why that is? I guess, I understand to a degree, but, you know, then all of a sudden it makes a lot more sense why a company like Square came to exist. They saw this void. They saw this small to medium-sized business. I mean, I look back to when I worked at the bank; I worked at one of the big banks for a few years back in the early 2000s, and I remember the merchant services side of that business where essentially banks were representing small businesses in the area.So if you're a small business and you wanted to be able to accept credit cards, you know, you go to the local bank and you'd ask them for the merchant services package and speak to merchant services rep, and they would give you the clunky hardware and the ability to swipe and to take  and  and whatnot. And then you were paying an arm and a leg to be able to do that.And so, you see a company like Square, they see that opportunity and they decided to go ahead and pursue it. And that certainly feels like something to Bill.com is doing as well.I've always just, kind of, wondered why so many are more than willing to, sort of, overlook that space? Well, you know, the small-business market is hard to serve in a profitable way. I mean, look at Square. They target small and medium-sized businesses, and think of how big Square has gotten, and they've just become profitable. So Bill.com is willing to take the hit. And a lot of the big companies -- you know, I think Bill.com's subscription fees start at, I think, it was $36 or $39, I'm not exactly sure which one, but it's a pretty low revenue at first, a low revenue model. You know, this is building up subscription revenue over time, and it's, you know, compared to landing giant clients that are going to spend $100,000 a year on your platform, which is what a lot of these AI software companies are really going after. It's a difficult way to make money until you really scale.Bill.com has almost $400 million in cash on its balance sheet, so when I say it's losing, what is, $2.9 million in the last quarter, it could afford to do that for quite some time with $400 million on its balance sheet.Yeah. And you'd figure, there's probably an enthusiastic investor base out there that's going to be willing to give them a little bit of time, and they'd be able to raise more money in the near term, if they really needed to. Right. So, at the current loss rate, that's you know, what, over a 100 quarters that it could keep this up? And that's assuming the losses don't narrow any over that time. So that's a lot of growth runway where they really don't have to care about being profitable. You figure so. And I mean, to your point about the small and medium-sized businesses, look at what's going on today. I mean, today is a very good example of, there is a higher risk involved with serving those smaller to medium-sized businesses, in that, they don't have the same stability. They are at higher risk for, like, what we're going through right now. I mean, you got to figure that probably some of Bill.com's customer base is probably feeling a little bit of pinch right now and they probably lose a little bit of that customer base in the near-term based on what we've been going through over these past few months. Yeah, well, they gave an update in their earnings call a couple of weeks ago, and said that when the pandemic started, they definitely started to see some churn in their platform. They're doing a great job of working with customers. And I saw that they waived the subscription fees for three months for any struggling customer. Yeah, I saw that. And they're also seeing an inflow of business from businesses who, kind of, want to simplify their payment processes. If you could do something more efficiently and save money over time, at a time when your business is hurting, is a good time to look into those kinds of options. So, Bill is getting a nice little tailwind there from businesses who are maybe hurting but still keeping their heads above water. So they have seen some churn. They did say that the pandemic will affect their revenue, but it doesn't look like it's going to be that big of a hit.And I mean, the fintech companies have been performing fantastically well in the pandemic. Bill.com has doubled since the end of March. And the reason is, because it looks like these companies are not going to be hit as much as you might think. For every negative, for every headwind they're facing, there's a positive tailwind to bring your business back up. We saw that in PayPal's numbers, we saw that in Square's numbers, and we saw that in Bill's numbers, which is why the stock has shot up so much.Yeah. Generally speaking, the government has more or less shown that they're going to try to keep the money spigot open and flowing to the people and the businesses that need it the most. Now, how quickly that gets to them is another story entirely, but it does sound like our government is not going to just leave everybody hanging here. So, that's certainly something to keep in mind for the longer term.Matt, let's talk about management here for a little bit, because you know we always talk about the types of businesses that we like to find in our Foolish universe. We talk about founder-led businesses and companies that are being led by the founder. And this is a business that it falls into that category here. Rene Lacerte is the founder of Bill.com, he is the CEO of the business, and he still owns a little chunk of the company as well, around 4.5% of the shares outstanding. So, he does have some skin in the game, right? I mean, it's not Jeff Bezos' situation, right? He doesn't own 20% of the business.And we've seen that work both ways too. Just because the founder is leading the way, that doesn't mean it's a no-brainer either. I mean, I refer you to , that has turned out to be, obviously, a tremendous disappointment for a lot of folks. And I think you could place a lot of the blame squarely on Kevin Plank. [laughs]But in this case, here you've got a founder who is leading the way here, and it does seem like he has a vision for the business, doesn't it? Yeah. To your point, sometimes founders do find themselves over their head when businesses start to scale. That's kind of what we saw with Under Armour. You know, Under Armour did fantastically well in its first few years of business, but then when it got to the point where it was a big national brand, they just needed somebody else. But having said that, Rene Lacerte -- this isn't his first rodeo, it's worth pointing out. He founded a company called PayCycle that was the first big online payroll solution platform, and it ended up being so successful, Intuit bought it out. I'm pretty sure that became some of what QuickBooks is today.So, he's had success in this before and has shown his ability to scale a business. So, that's a big difference -- I mean, I don't know Kevin Plank's history as well, I don't think he had anything giant before Under Armour. No. I think he just basically, he was in college. He found, sort of, a problem in some of the way some of the clothing that athletes were wearing, and then that was just, sort of, where the idea formed. And so, it was really, that was kind of his first rodeo and he just parlayed ... ... yeah, so, he was, kind of, an accidental founder -- whereas Rene Lacerte is, kind of, an intentional founder in this case. He said, I've done this successfully before, I'm going to do it again; not, here's a problem, how do I solve it and then I'll worry about scaling later. Well, and there is some big ownership there too. And, you know, we talk about Founders owning a chunk of the business, and that's always worth noting. I mean, it is also worth noting, and oftentimes you'll see, when businesses like this just go public, early on you'll see that there are big venture capital and private equity stakes involved here as well, and certainly Bill.com is no exception.I mean, VC and PE firms with greater than 5% stakes in the business, you have four different firms that account for close to 30%, a little bit more than 30% of the actual business. So, that's not a bad thing necessarily. I mean, it shows that there are some partners out there that really believe in the business, but by the same token it also means, at some point down the line, those firms are going to want an exit strategy. I mean, they're investing in this business, they're not long-term investors like we are, they're going to want to cash out at some point. Which means that low float today is going to go up, and more shares are going to hit the market. That's just always something worth keeping in mind, I think. Yeah. As you're saying that, I'm looking this way, because I have another screen this way. I was looking at Bill's board, and virtually every board member is a venture capital partner, which you'll see a lot in these new IPOs. So, to your point. I could see Bill.com becoming an acquisition target, if it keeps growing like this. I could see it being bought out by, like, a Square, because it's a great complement to their small and medium-sized payment processing business. Or another one of the big ones, Intuit themselves, they're not that big to the point where they're, you know, prohibitive for companies to acquire, I mean, a $5 billion company is still within the realm of possibilities for most fintech companies that could be potential acquirers. I could see that more so than most of the other companies we talk about. I think Bill could be on someone's radar. Yeah. And I like that customer base, and focusing on the small to medium-sized businesses as opposed to just, like, you know, the everyday consumer. I mean, you use Square and PayPal. The neat thing about Square is that it has two sides of that work. Bill.com really does have that focus on the small to medium-sized business, and you know, there's a lot of value there. And so, I do like that.And I bet you're right, I bet there will be some big firms out there that look at this business and start thinking that maybe it could plug into their network. You know, Coupa Software was one that just stood out to me as one that could see this as being a nice addition to their business model as well. But, Coupa, again, they're 3 times the market cap, but I mean still, trading in a similar-style multiple, not quite as expensive as Bill.com, but you're talking about a $15 billion, $16 billion company that's bringing in, like, I don't know, $400 million in sales or something like that.So, clearly these businesses are having a moment, and the market is definitely telling us something with Bill.com. So, I guess this is the $10,000 question, Matt, after digging into this company. I go back to how we started the show, this is the type of business, I look at this business and I think, I can make the case for the stock to fall off a cliff just as much as I could make the case for the stock to triple from here. Like, I think, you could flip a coin.Is this the type of business that you feel like you'd want to own or is this the type of business that you feel like, you'd want to watch this play out a little bit, give it a little bit more time to see how they're able to handle life as a publicly traded company? It's definitely going to be a rollercoaster ride. So, that 91,000 customer figure, that's up 28% year over year. If that growth rate were to rise to, say, 40%, you'll see the stock double or triple overnight, nearly. [laughs] If that were to fall to 15%, you can see this come crashing down so fast, because remember, 34 times sales is a huge valuation.So, like any IPO stock, I would say, if it's on your radar, don't put any more than 1% or 2% of your money into it. Having said that, this could turn out to be a big winner, if things go right, so. Yeah. I think you hit on the head there. I mean, there are a lot of companies that we have said this about valuation;  stands out as one,  certainly stands out. We've seen these valuations that can be a little bit scary, but by the same token, you see some winning qualities that start to make a little bit of sense as to why the valuation is that way, and this is the type of company, I think, for me, I'm interested in these types of businesses, I love the market they're pursuing. To me, I think there are probably more reasons to own a business like this than to not, but it is one where I would probably open up with a very small position just to get my skin in the game, to get my interest up there to follow it, because I feel like this is the type of business I wouldn't mind adding to. And I don't have a problem adding to a winner if it's -- you know, if you see if you see some signs that the business is succeeding and the market continues to reward it, I don't mind adding to winners. So, this might be one of those types of businesses, but definitely one that I think investors out there really ought to keep their eyes on.And I appreciate you taking the time to dig into it and talk about it with me today.Before we wrap up this week, Matt, let's just jump into one to watch real quick. What's the stock you got on your radar this coming week and why? I am watching  I've talked about that on our show before, the live viewers haven't heard me talk about it, so I wanted to bring it up again for a good reason. I own the stock, I have no plans to sell it, tomorrow you'll see an article by me coming out that says, \"Here's why Warren Buffett sold Goldman Sachs and I'm not.\"Buffett released 's 13-F filing, which shows his stock portfolio activity, and he dumped 85% of his Goldman Sachs stocks. So that's why Goldman Sachs is kind of underperforming -- I mean, it's still up, because everything is up today -- but it's still underperforming the financial sector quite a bit. I think it has a lot of long-term potential consumer banking-wise. Goldman trades at a 25% discount to its book value right now.And I think that it might be a little too risky for Warren Buffett, which is why he sold it, but I think the risk/reward makes a lot of sense for investors with a little more risk tolerance than Berkshire Hathaway does. I got you there, yeah, I was reading about that. I'm going to keep an eye on Intuit. The earnings are coming out this week on Thursday for Intuit. And I think a lot of people, they think Intuit, they immediately think TurboTax. I mean, this has been a really interesting stretch of time from every angle. And you've seen the tax deadlines extended.I mean, obviously, Intuit being a company that's participating in the Paycheck Protection Program, it sounds like we're going to be seeing more money coming into the hands of consumers and businesses as we try to buy some time to get through this stretch here. So, it does sound like it's going to be a really busy year for Intuit. And a very established and strong business.Now, they did guide down earlier in the month, on May 7. But that said, that's something, everybody is in the same boat there, right. I think it's a really fascinating business, so I'm going to be interested to see how earnings work out for them this coming week. And, yeah, definitely want to keep an eye on there.But I think that's going to do it for us this week, folks. Remember you can always reach out to us on  @MFIndustryFocus or you can drop us an email at IndustryFocus@Fool.com and let us know how everything is going, how you're making it through this tough time, what stocks are you buying, what stocks are you selling and what stocks do you want us to talk about on the show? Let us know, because we always like hearing from you.And, Matt, always like hearing from you, man; thanks for taking the time to join me this week. Of course. Always good to see you. Alrighty. Well, we will see you next week.And, as always, people on the program may have interests in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against, so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear.Thanks, as always, to our man, Austin Morgan, for making all of these moving parts work this week with Zoom and Audacity, the live audience and the podcast. This really worked out well.

The federal government has sent out a huge number of  to get much-needed money into the hands of those in need, and some lawmakers are looking to take .The majority of stimulus payments that the federal government has made came through direct deposit, with a fee-free transfer of money into people's bank accounts. Yet several million Americans have received stimulus payments in the form of a prepaid debit card. That's caused some confusion among those who expected checks, but it's also giving some incremental business to three publicly traded companies: , , and .Image source: Getty Images.Roughly 4 million people had stimulus payments sent to them in the form of debit cards. The federal government chose to use debit cards rather than checks for certain taxpayers who'd had their tax returns processed at specific IRS service centers.The debit cards are issued under the Visa payment network, with Meta Financial subsidiary MetaBank acting as the issuing financial institution. MetaBank acts as the financial agent for the U.S. Treasury Department as part of its Bureau of the Fiscal Service, which is likely why it got the nod to move forward with stimulus debit cards. Fiserv is the parent company of Money Network Cardholder Services, which is responsible for providing customer service to those receiving the cards.With 4 million people getting $1,200 per adult and $500 per child, there's not a huge amount of money represented by these stimulus debit cards. $4.8 billion is just a tiny fraction of a percent of the annual payment volume that Visa handles on its network. Similarly, Fiserv has extensive relationships with card issuers to help with a wide variety of customer service needs, so the incremental benefit of stimulus debit cards isn't likely to be all that large.The story is potentially different for Meta Financial. With a market capitalization of just $730 million, Meta is tiny compared to Fiserv and Visa. Moreover, as issuer, Meta stands to receive fee revenue from the card offering.Admittedly, the fees for the stimulus debit cards are fairly reasonable. The cards allow one free out-of-network ATM withdrawal and one free cash withdrawal at a bank teller window. There are no opening or monthly maintenance fees, and debit transactions are allowed at no cost. In-network ATM withdrawals are always available at no cost, and even once the card starts charging fees, the $2 cost for out-of-network ATMs, $3 for international withdrawals, and $5 for bank teller withdrawals isn't out of line for the industry.Yet debit card companies see working for the federal government as an opportunity to introduce customers to their products. Once someone gets used to using a prepaid debit card to handle their finances, they're more likely to turn to similar products that these private-sector companies offer in other parts of their business -- products that can produce more revenue.Unfortunately, many people were unprepared to receive stimulus debit cards. As they came in plain envelopes to deter mail fraud, some recipients thought they were junk mail or scams and threw them away. The IRS has directed those who did so to contact Fiserv's Money Network customer service for a replacement. The first replaced card comes with a waiver of the usual $7.50 reissue fee.The stimulus payment process has been painful for many Americans, and it could continue to have an impact on \u00a0for the rest of 2020 and beyond. For investors, though, it's interesting to see how Fiserv, Meta Financial, and Visa are ultimately benefiting from stimulus prepaid debit cards.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Meta Financial Group wasn't one of them!

As technology has become more ingrained into every aspect of life - work, play and everything in between - the companies developing and providing those technologies have delivered explosive growth.The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund () has delivered a 139% total return (price performance plus dividends) over the past five years, well more than double the S&P 500's 57% return. The five largest companies trading on U.S. markets are either tech stocks or, as is the case with several of the companies we'll highlight below, technology-intensive companies in other sectors. Think Amazon.com (), a consumer discretionary company, or Facebook (), which is technically a communications stock.Wall Street remains aggressively bullish on tech and tech-like stocks. According to data from , which tracks the industry's leading investment analysts, the pros are still very optimistic about the sector. Of the 573 tech stocks TipRanks includes in the sector, 129 (23%) had \"Strong Buy\" consensus ratings, with another 303 (51%) earning \"Moderate Buy\" ratings.Some of the analyst community's top tech stocks are well-worn names such as Microsoft () and Apple (). But many more tend to get second billing despite having equally exciting outlooks. Here, we'll look at 14 of the best tech stocks and other technology-adjacent companies that you might not hear as much about. Market value: $71.1 billionConsensus rating: Strong BuyAs  in merchant transactions, Fiserv (, $106.19) has become a global giant in online payment processing, which is routed through its cloud-based, point-of-sale processing platform Clover. Fiserv's clients include leading banks, credit unions and merchants. The company significantly expanded its global footprint last year by purchasing First Data, a worldwide leader in payment processing.Canaccord Genuity analysts recently pulled back their price target on FISV a bit, to $135 per share, but that still implies 27% upside from current prices. They also maintained a Buy rating, citing \"accelerating cost synergies to deliver (double-digit) earnings growth this year.\"So far, so good. Fiserv reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) growth of 16% during the March quarter. The company also raised its outlook for post-acquisition revenue and cost synergies.Also during the quarter, Fiserv introduced a PIN-based mobile application that makes smartphones and tablets point-of-sale terminals and expanded its merchant services via the acquisition of MerchantPro Express.Fiserv is one of the best-covered tech stocks on this list, with 20 TipRanks-tracked analysts sounding off over the past quarter. Eighteen of them call FISV stock a Buy, versus two Holds and no Sells. And their current price target implies 15% upside over the next year or so.Market value: $53.2 billionConsensus rating: Strong BuyAnother payment processor that is holding up well despite the coronavirus is Global Payments (, $177.94). This company provides payment technology and software solutions across its Merchant, Card Issuer and Consumer segments in 100 countries worldwide.\"Global Payments needed to deliver a satisfying April update (stabilization with some signs of potential improvement) and identify a degree of cost savings to support near-term margins - the former met expectations and the latter meaningfully exceeded,\" write Credit Suisse analysts, who maintain GPN's shares at Outperform (equivalent of Buy).Global Payment's adjusted EPS rose 18% in the March quarter, and the company added Truist (), the nation's sixth largest commercial bank, as a payment processing customer. A further boost to earnings will come from $475 million of annual run-rate synergies targeted from its merger with Total Service Systems, as well as $400 million in incremental savings over the next 12 months.Global Payments is among the few dividend-paying tech stocks on this list. Its dividend program has been around for years, but GPN put the pedal down in 2019 when it raised its quarterly payout from a penny per share to 19.5 cents. A thin payout ratio of just 12% of profits provides ample runway for even more dividend growth.Market value: $42.5 billionConsensus rating: Strong BuyL3Harris Technologies (, $196.73) became America's sixth largest defense contractor last year via Harris Corporation's all-stock merger with L3 Technologies. While it's typically grouped in the industrials sector, technology is at the very core of its operations. L3 Harris provides battlefield communications systems, night-vision devices, sensors and satellite communications for the U.S. military. It also makes a computer processor used in the F-35 stealth fighter.LHX, whose stock is at breakeven for the year versus a down market, delivered 21% adjusted profit growth during the March quarter, which beat analyst estimates by a wide margin. That came on strength in its aviation systems business. L3Harris slightly reduced its full-year 2020 revenue and EPS guidance but left its free cash flow guidance intact at $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion.Longer-term, LHX looks for $500 million in post-acquisition synergies to drive margin expansion next year while it continues to invest 5% of revenues in R&D - a much higher reinvestment rate than most peers. L3Harris also is streamlining its business portfolio, looking to divest up to 10% of the company. In May, it closed the $1 billion sale of its airport security and automation business.Recent contract wins include $500 million from the U.S. Space Force, as well as an artificial-intelligence contract with the Air Force for an undisclosed amount. The company also achieved a major milestone during Q1 when the Air Force approved its design for a new satellite navigation system.Bank of America analyst Ron Epstein initiated coverage of LHX with a \"Buy\" rating in April. He likes the company's high R&D investment, which he says is \"driving the company to innovate and deliver superior solutions to the customer.\" Overall, an analyst consensus price target of $237.50 implies 21% upside from current levels.Market value: $10.6 billionConsensus rating: Strong BuyDynatrace (, $37.73) offers a market-leading software intelligence platform designed specifically for the cloud. Its platform utilizes AI and advanced automation to monitor the performance of applications, underlying multi-cloud infrastructure, and the experience of the customers' users. Dynatrace's products are used by approximately 2,600 customers in 80 countries across banking, insurance, retail, manufacturing, travel and software sectors.Work-from-home requirements sparked by COVID-19 are putting increased demands on applications and the cloud. That's heightening the role of software intelligence providers like Dynatrace. The company recently recorded its eighth consecutive quarter of 120%-plus growth for its Dynatrace Net platform. Annualized recurring subscription revenues rose 42% in the March quarter, and adjusted EPS jumped nearly fourfold. Better still, 89% of total revenues are , which are more dependable.Dynatrace still should see outstanding growth despite the coronavirus, too. The company expects revenues for the fiscal year ending in March 2021 to grow 17% to 20% year-over-year, with adjusted EPS up 30% at the midpoint of guidance.DT shares have 10 Buy calls versus just three Holds and no Sells over the past quarter, but they've exceeded the average analyst price target of $36.08, so from here, it's important to watch to see whether analysts hike their targets going forward.For instance, D.A. Davidson analyst Andrew Nowinski (Buy) actually calls FY21 guidance \"modestly disappointing\" but writes that Dynatrace \"remains well-positioned to capitalize on the move to the cloud.\" He upgraded his earnings expectations for the company, and raised his price target on DT shares from $34 to $40.Market value: $6.4 billionConsensus rating: Moderate Buy\"(CEO Mark Benjamin and his team have) engineered one of the more impressive strategic/fundamental turnarounds we have seen in decades of covering the technology sector,\" Wedbush's Dan Ives writes about Nuance Communications (, $22.65).Nuance provides conversational AI tools used in automated customer call systems, voicemail transcription and other voice solutions deployed by clients in the healthcare, financial services, telecommunications and retail industries.The company has exceeded consensus analyst estimates four quarters in a row, including a 23% earnings beat for its March quarter. Organic sales growth of 11% was powered by its healthcare and enterprise businesses; the enterprise segment achieved its highest growth rate in 10 years.While Nuance Communications expects COVID-19 to affect its healthcare business, the company is guiding for 2020 adjusted EPS of 76 to 86 cents per share, down 5 cents at the midpoint from previous guidance. Its April launch of Dragon Ambient, a tool for powering virtual exams that taps into the COVID-19 related telehealth boom, should bolster healthcare segment results.While the consensus price target of $22.60 implies flat price potential over the coming year, investors should key in on the fact that recent PTs are rising along with NUAN's share price. The three most recent targets - all on Buy ratings - average out to $23.66, and that includes a $27 call by Wedbush's Ives.Market value: $4.9 billionConsensus rating: Strong BuyScience Applications International (, $88.60) provides tech support and enterprise IT services to all branches of the U.S. military, NASA, DOJ, the State Department and all the national intelligence agencies. SAIC's services include technology and equipment platform integration, maintenance for ground and maritime systems, and logistics, training and simulation support.SAIC has been delivering roughly 10% annual earnings gains over the past five years, including a 9% profit improvement for its fiscal 2020, which ended in January. In February, SAIC agreed to acquire Unisys Federal, a leading provider of IT services to the federal government in an all-cash deal valued at $1.2 billion. The deal expands SAIC's capabilities in government IT areas, builds its customer base and is accretive to per-share earnings.Recent contract awards include $653 million from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), $655 million from the U.S. Air Force and $950 million from the Defense Department. These are in addition to $1.1 billion of national security contracts awarded during the January quarter. And SAIC enters fiscal 2021 with contract backlog exceeding $15.3 billion.The company has plenty of liquidity to offset temporary coronavirus-related funding delays. SAIC generated $437 million of free cash flow in fiscal 2020, up 180% year-over-year, and ended the year with $155 million of cash and $400 million available on its credit line.SAIC is among the dividend-paying tech stocks on this list. It doles out 37 cents per share quarterly, translating to a modest yield of 1.7%. Its conservative payout ratio of 24% supports further increases in the future.Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu is one of eight analysts writing a Buy opinion on SAIC over the past quarter, versus just one Hold. She recently raised her price target on shares from $90 to $95.Market value: $4.3 billionConsensus rating: Strong BuyCurtiss-Wright (, $102.04) is, like L3Harris, another industrial that sometimes is lumped in with the technology sector.CW designs and manufactures highly engineered components for the defense, industrial, aerospace and power generation markets. Its components are found in most fighter jets, drones and nuclear submarines. It also provides pumps, motors, generators and turbines for U.S. Navy ships, as well as reactor coolant pumps and control rod mechanisms for nuclear power plants. The U.S. military is Curtiss-Wright's largest customer, accounting for more than 40% of sales.The company's adjusted EPS rose 3% in the March quarter as strength in its defense segment more than offset COVID-related industrial segment weakness. The company's backlog remained high at $2.1 billion, and it began implementing cost controls that should benefit profits and free cash flow.Curtiss-Wright also pays a modest 17-cent quarterly dividend that yields a mere 0.7% percent. But CW has improved that payout by more than 30% over the past four years, and a low 11% payout ratio leaves cushion for future hikes. Meanwhile, analysts have a $125.75 price target that implies this tech stock will gain 23% over the next 52 weeks.\"We continue to rate Curtiss-Wright Outperform for three reasons,\" write William Blair analysts. \"1) compelling valuation following the stock's 37% correction from a recent high of almost $150 per share in early February 2020; 2) the likelihood that its next China Direct order will not be disrupted by ongoing trade tariffs with China or the impact of COVID-19; and 3) strong prospects that the company will likely disproportionately benefit from continued strong growth for its Defense business, which should account for almost 50% of the company's sales in 2020.\"Market value: $2.6 billionConsensus rating: Strong BuyViavi Solutions (, $11.52) is a global leader in network test, monitoring and assurance solutions for the major telecom carriers. The company also provides 3D sensing products for facial recognition security authentication on mobile devices.As a leader in network monitoring, Viavi Solutions benefits from 5G buildouts, which are increasing the scale and complexity of carrier networks, and the rollout of new 3D sensing technologies for consumer, automotive and industrial markets.Viavi grew adjusted EPS by 8% during its March quarter as effective cost controls more than offset a slight sales decline. According to Viavi Solutions, the counter-cyclical nature of its businesses and its liquid balance sheet should enable the company to manage through near-term economic uncertainties; catalysts from 5G, Wireless, Fiber and 3D sensing will drive long-term profit growth.A few other things to like about Viavi? It manages expectations well, having beaten analyst estimates for four consecutive quarters. The company also has delivered 30% yearly EBITDA growth over the past three years. And the fact that it has nearly as much cash ($534 million) as long-term debt ($596 million) means it should be able to ride out coronavirus-related funding delays until the major wireless carriers resume 5G builds.Six of the seven analysts that have written about VIAV shares over the past quarter have doled out Buy ratings, versus just one Hold. It also is among the best tech stocks to buy based on upside potential, with the pros targeting 31% gains over the next 12 months or so.Market value: $2.6 billionConsensus rating: Strong BuyMimecast (, $40.55), a cybersecurity firm headquartered in the U.K., is one of the few internationally based tech stocks on this list. That said, it derives 52% of its revenues from customers in the U.S., 29% from the U.K., 11% from Africa, and the rest from around the globe. All told, MIME serves 38,100 organizations and 13 million users globally.Mimecast is focused on email security; it specializes in email gateway security, targeted threat protection and data loss prevention. Approximately 98% of the company's revenues are subscription-based.Mimecast added 3,700 new customers during fiscal 2020 ended in March, grew revenues 25% and doubled its adjusted EPS. High rates of customer growth, customer retention and upselling new services to existing customers were key growth drivers. The company is targeting an opportunity of 200 million Microsoft 365 commercial users for future growth and estimates its total addressable market exceeds 1 billion business email users.MIME is expecting a productive fiscal 2021 that should see revenues grow 15% to 17% and adjusted EBITDA to grow by 22%.SunTrust analyst Terry Tillman (Buy) lowered his price target on MIME from $63 per share to $56 in May, which still implies 38% upside from current levels. While the company's revenue guidance was slightly lower than previous estimates, Tillman sees benefits from Mimecast's business positioning, as well as its \"strong financial model that includes sustained strong growth and operating leverage.\"As a group, analysts are looking for 30% upside potential, based on a $52.67 consensus price target for this tech stock.Market value: $1.9 billionConsensus rating: Strong BuyKratos Defense & Security Solutions (, $18.12) is another defense-tech hybrid, this one specializing in unmanned drones, satellite communications, cybersecurity and warfare, microwave electronics and missile defense. KTOS participates in several major military programs involving unmanned aerial drones.March-quarter adjusted earnings were down slightly year-over-year thanks to higher R&D costs. But revenues improved; unmanned systems segment sales were especially strong, jumping 20% year-over-year. Contract backlog remained strong during the March quarter at $646.8 million, up 8% from year-end 2019, and the bid and proposal pipeline held steady at $7.7 billion. And those adjusted profits did beat analyst estimates.Northrop Grumman () in February chose Kratos to be its partner for the U.S. Air Force Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) program. GBSD is a $63 billion, 20-year program for the development of the next generation of missiles to replace the outdated Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles. This weapons program is likely to become Kratos' major near-term organic growth driver.KTOS shares are up marginally in 2020, but it hasn't been completely immune to coronavirus woes. The company has trimmed its 2020 revenue guidance by $20 million to $740 million thanks to COVID-related funding delays. But itThe company trimmed its 2020 revenue guidance by $20 million to $740 million at the midpoint due to COVID-19-related funding delays, but held adjusted EBITDA guidance steady at $75 million at the midpoint, roughly the same as last year.Benchmark analyst Josh Sullivan initiated coverage of KTOS with a Buy rating in March, noting the market leading position for its Valkyrie combat drones and rising demand for military drones as older-generation fighter jets are retired. That's one of five Buy ratings over the past three months - a unanimous consensus among analysts tracked by TipRanks. They see upside potential of 19% based on a $21.50 consensus price target.Market value: $1.3 billionConsensus rating: Strong BuyCubic Corporation (, $41.50) is an industrial-classified company that's nonetheless neck-deep in technology.Cubic provides systems and services for C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) worldwide. Its transportation segment specializes in systems for automated fare payment and traffic management and enforcement. Its defense segment focuses on security for wide-band communication systems serving aircraft and drones and providing game-based military training simulations.Nearly 65% of Cubic's sales are derived from U.S. federal, state and local government. The company has built leadership positions in mobile solutions for mass transit ridership (61% market share) and in air combat maneuvering instrumentation and training.CUB is one of the few tech stocks on this list that actually had a difficult March quarter. It recorded lower sales and an adjusted EPS loss because of the timing of orders and difficult year-over-year comparisons. Still, backlog remained impressive at $3.6 billion, which represents two years of future sales.The company also improved its financial condition last quarter by increasing its borrowing capacity 30%, reducing interest costs and extending debt maturities.Canaccord Genuity analysts acknowledge that timing risk hit the company in its March quarter, but they still expect a strong Q4 and maintain a Buy rating on CUB shares. William Blair analysts (Outperform), meanwhile, wrote earlier in May that \"shares of Cubic trade at approximately 12 times earnings compared with the peer group median of 20 times. Over the next 12 months, we expect this valuation gap to narrow.\"Analysts have a price target of $53.29 on CUB shares, implying the stock could rise 28% over the next 12 months or so.Market value: $1.2 billionConsensus rating: Strong BuyCommunications software supplier Avaya Holdings (, $14.80) is benefiting from increased COVID-19-related demand for video collaboration software and contact centers upgrading their work-from-anywhere capabilities. The company serves more than 100,000 customers, 90% of which are Fortune 100 companies, and is a leader in cloud communications platforms for large businesses.Earlier this year, Avaya partnered with RingCentral (), a leader in contact center communications, to offer Avaya Cloud Office, a new service that combines team messaging, video conferencing, file sharing and collaboration in one solution.Avaya secured $2.3 billion of new contracts during the March quarter and experienced a 200% improvement in subscription revenues, with recurring rising 5 percentage points to 64% of total revenues. Avaya also generated strong adjusted EBITDA of $149 million but recorded a net loss due to non-cash impairment charges.Avaya does have quite the debt load: Nearly $3 billion in IOUs is well more than double the company's market capitalization. But it has a decent $553 million in cash and has generated $229 million in levered free cash flow over the trailing 12 months.AVYA is another one of these tech stocks that merits close watching. That's because the current price target of $14.80 implies no upside - but that's thanks to a 50% run over the past month that has quickly sent it over most analyst targets.The Street still has four Buys against one Hold, so investors should continue to monitor Avaya to see if they raise their estimates ... or tone down their optimism on valuation concerns. A good example: JPMorgan's Samik Chatterjee in April started AVYA shares at Overweight thanks in part because of the company's \"transformation to cloud-based solutions,\" but he also cited its \"inexpensive valuation.\" An update on that opinion should be telling.Market value: $1.0 billionConsensus rating: Strong BuyCerence (, $27.72) is a worldwide leader in virtual assistant software used in today's cars and trucks. The company went public last September when it was spun off from former parent Nuance Communications.Cerence's customers include all of the top vehicle manufacturers: General Motors (), Toyota (), Ford () and more. The company's on-board systems have already been installed in more than 300 million vehicles worldwide. And its virtual assistant platform is capable of interacting with customers in 70 different languages and is protected by 1,250 issued patents, providing a wide moat from competitor threats.As a preferred technology partner to major car brands, Cerence is on the leading edge of high-growth emerging trends like autonomous driving, smart cities, shared rides and e-vehicles.Cerence had a boffo March quarter. Adjusted EPS rose by 39%, and adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) jumped by 55%. Order bookings for the first six months of its fiscal year were a record $535 million and have already exceeded fiscal 2019 full-year bookings. During the quarter, Cerence signed its two largest contracts ever: one for its Edge (in-car AI) technology and another for its cloud-connected services.The company's robust growth has not come at the expense of its balance sheet. Cerence has $96 million and has generated $88 million in free cash flow over the trailing 12 months, versus long-term debt of $238 million. That's an easily manageable situation that gives Cerence plenty of room to fund business development and R&D initiatives.Moreover, analysts see this tech stock rising 18% over the next year, to $32.67 per share.Market value: $411.0 millionConsensus rating: Strong BuyNeoPhotonics (, $8.43) supplies optoelectronic circuits that transmit high-speed digital optical signals for telecom networks. The major carriers already are experiencing bandwidth overloads and demand for more infrastructure to support the cloud, and NeoPhotonics believes demand for its high-performance optics will increase dramatically as data speeds accelerate and the number of hyper-scale data centers increases exponentially.NPTN has enjoyed strong demand for its product already this year, driven by COVID-19-related growth in global Internet traffic as more people work remotely.NeoPhotonics reported a 23% jump in revenues during the March quarter, as well as 17 cents of adjusted EPS - up from 10 cents in the prior quarter, and a 19-cent loss in the year-ago period. NPTN has also beaten analysts' sales and EPS estimates in each of the past four quarters.Needham analyst Alex Henderson thinks NeoPhotonics has plenty of room to grow and raised his price target in May while reiterating his \"Buy\" rating. JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee initiated coverage of NPTN in April with an \"Overweight\" rating. He envisions accelerated adoption of the company's optical technologies because of their ability to deliver higher port speeds for telecom and cloud applications.And NPTN's upside potential of 43%, based on a $12.07 consensus price target, makes it tops among this list of Wall Street's best tech stocks to buy.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["It has been noted ad nauseam that the stock market doesn't appear to reflect the worst economic slowdown since the Great Depression. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down \"only\" 17% for the year to date, while the S&P 500 is off \"just\" 11%.If that bothers you, don't even look at the Nasdaq Composite. This tech-heavy index of Nasdaq-listed stocks is actually positive, albeit barely, for 2020.Whether share prices adequately discount the potential damage caused by the global lockdown and a prolonged recession is a discussion for another time. Besides, investors usually find it more profitable not to fight the tape.With that in mind, we went searching for the Nasdaq stocks that analysts say have the best prospects for outperformance going forward.We screened the Nasdaq Composite for stocks followed by a minimum of 10 analysts. We further whittled the list down to stocks with an average broker recommendation of Buy or better. S&P Capital IQ surveys analysts' stock ratings and scores them on a five-point scale, where 1.0 equals Strong Buy and 5.0 means Strong Sell. Any score of 2.0 or lower means that analysts, on average, rate the stock a Buy. The closer the score gets to 1.0, the stronger the Buy call. Lastly, we dug into research, analysts' estimates and other data on the top-scoring names.The process gave us a host of stocks, from small biotechnology plays to some of the biggest, best-known companies in the world. Have a look at 15 of the best Nasdaq stocks, according to the pros.Market value: $37.9 billionAnalysts' average recommendation: 1.62It's counterintuitive at first, but a few parts of the health care sector are actually taking a beating from COVID-19. Fear is prompting patients with non-coronavirus conditions and illnesses to stay away from medical practitioners and hospitals in droves.That's a challenge for Dexcom (, $410.80), a company that makes glucose monitoring systems for patients with diabetes. Nonetheless, analysts remain optimistic about the firm's growth prospects.\"We remain bullish on the near- and long-term product pipeline, growing (total addressable market), and opportunity for DXCM to deliver significant upside in 2020 despite COVID-19,\" writes Canaccord Genuity, which rates the stock at Buy.Indeed, a rapidly aging and increasingly overweight population should help underpin outsized growth over the longer term. Analysts expect Dexcom to deliver average annual earnings growth of almost 32% over the next three to five years, according to S&P Capital IQ.Of the 21 analysts tracked by S&P Capital IQ who are covering DXCM stock, 13 rate shares at Strong Buy, three say Buy, four have it at Hold and one calls it a Strong Sell. That's after Dexcom's already impressive 88% run year-to-date that puts most Nasdaq stocks to shame.Market value: $10.4 billionAnalysts' average recommendation: 1.6Sarepta Therapeutics (, $132.89), a biotechnology company that engineers genetic medicine to treat rare diseases, is another health care stock that has to overcome some COVID-19 hurdles.And analysts are largely confident that it can.\"Though the COVID-19 operating environment is challenging, we believe Sarepta is well positioned to weather the pandemic with modest impacts to the company's commercial or clinical programs,\" William Blair Equity Research analysts say. \"We continue to view Sarepta as a core midcap holding in the sector and maintain our Outperform rating given its position as a leader in neuromuscular diseases.\"Nomura/Instinet analysts, who have a Buy rating on Sarepta's shares, believe Duchenne muscular dystrophy treatments Vyondys and casimersen will help SRPT double its fiscal 2019 revenues over the next few years. They say shares \"will nearly double\" over the next 12 months, calling any near-term weakness a buying opportunity.The pros broadly have Sarepta among their best Nasdaq stocks right now. Twelve analysts surveyed by S&P Capital IQ rate SRPT stock at Strong Buy, 11 say Buy and two call it a Hold. Their average price target of $188.43 gives shares implied upside of about 42% in the next 12 months or so.Market value: $165.6 billionAnalysts' average recommendation: 1.59Folks locked down at home, ordering goods online (and not necessarily wanting to touch dirty cash), have been a boon to PayPal (, $141.03).Indeed, business is so good at the digital payments processor that it was able to raise billions in the debt market amid the worst economic contraction since the Great Depression. On May 10, PayPal sold $4 billion in 10-year corporate bonds yielding about 2.3%.PYPL shares are up 30% year-to-date versus a loss of 11% for the S&P 500, and analysts think there's more outperformance to come. Canaccord, which rates the stock at Buy, says the company is \"perhaps more relevant now than it has ever been\" and is \"benefiting from (the) full-on e-commerce spigot.\"Of the analysts covering PYPL stock, 24 have it at Strong Buy, 11 say Buy, five call it a Hold and one says Sell. They collectively forecast PayPal will generate average annual earnings growth of 20% over the next three to five years, according to S&P Capital IQ.Market value: $598.6 billionAnalysts' average recommendation: 1.58No surprises here. Facebook (, $210.10) is another darling technology stock that's doing the heavy lifting when it comes to propping up the market. Shares in FB are up a little more than 2% so far in 2020, versus a fractional gain for the Nasdaq Composite and an 11% loss for the S&P 500. It's really shining out of the March 20 bottom, however, up 40% versus 31% for the broader index of Nasdaq stocks.Facebook is one of the world's most widely covered stocks. S&P Capital IQ tracks 51 analysts who follow FB. The breakdown of their recommendations stands at 33 Strong Buys, eight Buys, seven Holds, one Sell and one Strong Sell - a strongly bullish consensus.The pandemic has taken a toll on Facebook's advertising revenue, but the pros say the social network is still charging ahead.\"Although widespread shelter-in-place measures have led to record levels of usage across a number of Facebook's services, advertiser demand has dropped off precipitously,\" says Stifel, which rates FB at Buy. \"We continue to believe Facebook is among the best-positioned digital media companies to navigate this crisis and come out stronger (more market share of a bigger digital market) when the economy returns to normal.\"Analysts foresee average annual earnings growth of 20% for the next three to five years. Their average price target of $238.56 implies that FB stock could have another 14% to run over the next year or so.Market value: $67.1 billionAnalysts' average recommendation: 1.56Uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus crisis led Fiserv (, $100.27) to withdraw its 2020 guidance, but that didn't faze Wall Street in the least.Fiserv is what's known as a core processor. Its technology allows financial services firms to operate debit networks, transfer funds electronically and process credit card transactions, among a host of other critical functions.That centrality to the global economy leaves FISV highly exposed to the ongoing crisis.\"The rapid and widening spread of the coronavirus outbreak, deteriorating global economic outlook, falling oil prices and asset price declines are creating a severe and extensive credit shock across many sectors, regions and markets,\" Moody's writes. \"The outbreak is having a significant adverse impact on Fiserv's financial performance.\"Equity analysts, however, see an opportunity to get a long-term winner at a good price today. Of the analysts covering the stock, 21 rate it at Strong Buy, five have it at Buy, five call it a Hold and one says Sell. Their average price target on FISV stock, which is off about 13% this year, is $120.73, implying a 20% rebound from current prices.Canaccord Genuity, which rates shares at Buy, says accelerating cost savings stemming from 2019's acquisition of First Data will allow FISV to deliver double-digit earnings growth this year.Market value: $3.4 billionAnalysts' average recommendation: 1.53Blueprint Medicines (, $63.33) is among a group of Nasdaq stocks that have flatly not done so well this year. BPMC shares are off about 21% year-to-date, widely lagging the Nasdaq Composite.BPMC is a biotechnology company perhaps best known for Ayvakit, a therapy option for certain people with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration green-lit the drug in January, making it the first therapy approved for patients with a GIST harboring a PDGFRA exon 18 mutation.Although the coronavirus outbreak is playing havoc with pharma companies' clinical trials and sales, analysts remain bullish on Blueprint's longer-term prospects.\"The company has cash into (the second half of 2022), which should not only get the company through nearterm COVID-19 market weakness, but well into the Ayvakit launch, allowing for more financial flexibility,\" says Wedbush, which rates the stock at Outperform (equivalent of Buy) and has it on its Best Ideas List.Out of 17 analysts covering BPMC tracked by S&P Capital IQ, 10 have it at Strong Buy, five say Buy and two call it a Hold.Market value: $438.5 billionAnalysts' average recommendation: 1.53If it isn't yet apparent,  are well-represented among the pros' best Nasdaq stocks. And Voyager Therapeutics (, $11.79), a gene therapy company focused on treatments for severe neurological diseases, is especially popular. Of the 15 analysts covering the stock, 10 call it a Strong Buy, two say Buy and three rate it at Hold.VYGR and partner Neurocrine Biosciences () have teamed up on a Parkinson's disease gene therapy study. The partnership, upcoming data releases on current clinical trials and cheap shares make the bull case for the stock.\"Amidst the recent sector pullback, we see VYGR shares offering attractive risk/reward at current levels with cash ($7/share) and collaboration revenue providing downside protection,\" says Wedbush, which rates the stock at Outperform.Analysts' average price target of $22.64 suggests that VYGR stock can shoot 92% higher over the next year or so.Market value: $1.38 trillionAnalysts' average recommendation: 1.51Shares in Microsoft (, $182.51) are up almost 16% in 2020. Given that it's the largest among all Nasdaq stocks, that has gone a long way toward lifting the Nasdaq Composite into the green.The software and cloud computing giant has been one of the rare beneficiaries of the coronavirus crisis. Workers and students sheltering at home have lifted demand for everything from Office 365 to Xbox games.\"Microsoft's unique mix of cloud-based productivity tools (Office 365), its tightly integrated set of hybrid cloud infrastructure solutions (Server + Azure) and broad-based portfolio of Work/Play From Home products (Windows, Surface & Xbox Live) enabled the company to effectively support its customers during this difficult time and continue to gain share,\" says Stifel, which rates the stock at Buy.At the same time, MSFT is a port in a storm for income investors. The trillion-dollar-plus market value, massive amounts of cash on the balance sheet and gushers of free cash flow make Microsoft one of .Twenty-one analysts rate MSFT stock at Strong Buy, 10 say Buy and four call it a Hold.Market value: $938.7 billionAnalysts' average recommendation: 1.46Google parent Alphabet (, $1,375.18) is taking a hit to revenue from the precipitous drop in spending on advertising. Even so, analysts see the damage as manageable and expect GOOGL to become even more formidable.\"Given Google's sprawling global footprint for its advertising franchise, trying to pin down headwinds against 2Q20 growth on an absolute basis on limited visibility was always going to be a difficult exercise,\" says Credit Suisse, which rates the stock at Outperform. For example, YouTube is benefitting from increased hours of viewership during the lockdown, but search is down 15%.Regardless, \"Google should emerge from this crisis in a stronger position,\" Credit Suisse's analysts say.Stifel seconds that view. \"While the timing of a broader recovery remains unknown, advertising revenue on the platform has historically recovered quickly following periods of economic volatility,\" write Stifel's analysts, who call Alphabet's shares a Buy. \"We are confident in Alphabet's ability to continue capturing advertising market share once conditions normalize.\"GOOGL stock is up nearly 3% year-to-date, helping to prop up the wider market. It also remains one of the best Nasdaq stocks in the analysts' eyes. Of the 46 pros covering Alphabet's share, 30 say they're a Strong Buy, 11 say Buy and five call them a Hold.Market value: $2.5 billionAnalysts' average recommendation: 1.44LivePerson (, $36.24) is another company getting a lift from the pandemic, thanks to so many call center employees working from home.\"Many voice-based call centers have had challenges adapting to the remote work environment,\" William Blair Equity Research says. \"This dynamic, along with a general increase in customer inquiries, has accelerated the use of messaging as a communication channel between businesses and consumers, resulting in a 20% spike in conversation volumes for LivePerson from February to March.\"LPSN helped pioneer live chat in the 1990s and eventually became the dominant player with about 35% market share. But several years ago, the company saw a much larger opportunity in customer service. LivePerson's LiveEngage software platform allows consumers to message with brands through WhatsApp, iOS Messages, Facebook Messenger, websites or smartphone apps.\"The inflexibility and inefficiency of the voice-based call center is even more apparent now than it was pre-coronavirus,\" William Blair adds. \"We believe this environment is likely to result in businesses embracing the messaging channel more and moving it up on the priority list if they have not yet implemented it.\"The breakdown of analysts covering LPSN stock comes to 11 Strong Buys, three Buys and two Holds. Just note that, thanks to a recent earnings-sparked surge in shares, the pros' target price of $38.36 gives LivePerson's shares implied upside of only about 6% over the next year. It's vital to closely watch situations like these, as analysts might move up their price targets to reflect growing optimism ... or lower their ratings now that their targets have been achieved.Market value: $2.4 billionAnalysts' average recommendation: 1.44Rapid7 (, $47.31), a cybersecurity firm, is down a painful 16% so far in 2020. But it has cutting-edge services that should help it stand out in the longer term, analysts say.\"We see Rapid7 as an emerging leader within the Security Operations (SecOps) market,\" writes Stifel, which calls the stock a Buy. \"The company's suite of products address many of the key themes currently impacting the cybersecurity market, including the growing awareness around IT hygiene.\"Post COVID-19, Stifel believes \"interest in agile, cloud-delivered solutions will accelerate while growth in security solutions for new cloud workloads will also rise in more dramatic fashion.\"William Blair analysts, who rate the Nasdaq stock at Outperform, acknowledge shorter-term issues. But they add, \"We believe Rapid7's business, which is more than 90% recurring revenue and targeted toward high growth areas of spending, remains well positioned to benefit from a post-COVID-19 world.\"Ten of the analysts covering RPD have it at Strong Buy, five say Buy and one rates it at Hold. Their average price target of $58.80 gives the stock implied upside of about 24% over the next year or so.Market value: $13.1 billionAnalysts' average recommendation: 1.44Peloton Interactive (, $46.17), the at-home exercise and equipment company, hasn't been able to keep up with a surge in demand as much of the globe shelters in place. Still, it's capitalizing somewhat on the trend, and better still, analysts believe Peloton is hooking new customers for the long term.Canaccord Genuity, which rates PTON stock at Buy, writes about the company's most recent quarterly report: \"Peloton's March quarter results were strong across the board, as COVID-19 has led to what will likely prove to be a permanent boost to connected fitness.\"Supply constraints were a blemish on the quarter; Peloton simply couldn't keep up with increased demand. But PTON is running hard to expand supply capacity by the holiday selling season, Canaccord notes, building a new factory and pushing its own suppliers to add capacity.Something critical that separates Peloton from other exercise equipment manufacturers: It has a recurring revenue stream. Users subscribe to the company's live, online fitness classes.Peloton's shares have climbed a whopping 63% so far in 2020, and analysts still have it among the best Nasdaq stocks for new money. Currently, 17 pros call it a Strong Buy, six say Buy, one calls it a Hold and one rates it at Sell.Market value: $20.2 billionAnalysts' average recommendation: 1.42The coronavirus crisis is painting a mixed picture for IAC/InterActiveCorp (, $237.66). Some of the company's sprawling portfolio of websites are holding up well. Others, not so much.\"While the subscription based businesses like Vimeo and Match are doing relatively well, its ad centric businesses like ANGI and Dotdash are more impacted with advertisers more generally pulling back,\" says Deutsche Bank, which calls the stock a Buy. IAC is expected to spin off Match by the end of the second quarter, Wedbush analysts note.Nomura rates the stock at Buy, citing better-than-expect first-quarter results and encouraging initial trends.The breakdown of analysts' recommendations comes to 13 Strong Buys, four Buys and two Holds, according to S&P Capital IQ. Their average annual earnings forecast comes to 46% over the next three to five years.Market value: $1.2 trillionAnalysts' average recommendation: 1.35Amazon.com's (, $2,356.95) has been busier than ever because of the pandemic.\"(Amazon has seen a) surge in demand for household essentials following the implementation of shelter-in-place restrictions related to COVID-19,\" says Canaccord Genuity, which rates shares at Buy.It doesn't stop with e-commerce, however. AMZN's bricks-and-mortar retail operations also got a workout in the first quarter. \"Physical stores revenue grew 8% (vs. a ~1% decline in Q4) as the company saw increased demand at Whole Foods.\"Lastly, Amazon is experiencing a surge in usage for video conferences, gaming, remote learning and entertainment, Canaccord notes.With projected average annual growth of 39% over the next three to five years, no wonder the Street is wild for AMZN stock. Of the 48 analysts covering the stock tracked by S&P Capital IQ, 35 call it a Strong Buy, nine say Buy and four have it at Hold - one of the best clusters of ratings among Nasdaq stocks.Shares are up an enviable 28% year-to-date. Analysts' average price target of $2,678.60 gives AMZN implied upside of about 14% over the next 12 months or so.Market value: $1.7 billionAnalysts' average recommendation: 1.09Dicerna Pharmaceuticals (, $23.67) develops treatments for diseases involving the liver, including primary hyperoxaluria, and a drug for chronic hepatitis B virus infection.Its score of 1.09 not only gives it the pole position among the best Nasdaq stocks - it makes it , too. S&P Capital IQ tracks 10 pros who cover DRNA; nine call the stock a Strong Buy, while the 10th calls it a Buy.Shares in the biotech firm have gained more than 7.5% year-to-date, and analysts think the stock is just getting started. An average price target of $33 per share implies nearly 40% upside over the coming year or so. That potential makes DRNA one of the tastiest options in the Nasdaq Composite - if you can stomach the risk of a small biotech play.Stifel, which rates the stock at Buy, points to the \"company's continued pursuit of wholly-owned rare disease assets\" and its \"broad strategic partnerships with partners Roche, Novo Nordisk, Alexion, Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim\" as part of the bull case.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["(RTTNews) - Fiserv, Inc.

Fiserv has been in business since 1984, and reported over $10 billion in revenues for fiscal year 2019.On May 7, Fiserv reported two items of great interest to investors. First, the company announced that long-time CEO Jeffery Yabuki will step down as of July 1. He will be succeeded by COO Frank Bisignano. In the second news item that day, Fiserv reported Q1 results. At the top line, GAAP revenues increased 151% to $3.77 billion, and GAAP earnings grew by 2% to 57 cents per share. The balance sheet was solid -- Fiserv reported $888 million in net cash for the quarter, compared to $373 million in Q1 2019.Greene\u2019s assessment of FISV is simple: he rates the stock as a Buy, and believes it has a clear path forward, stating, \u201cFISV has seen steady weekly volume improvement since late March and into May. For perspective, volume declines approximated 30% in late March and have gradually recovered to low double-digit declines; notably better than peer trends, perhaps due to vertical or geographic volume mix. Accordingly, we expect significant but bottoming revenue/profitability pressure in 2Q20 with gradual improvement in subsequent quarters.\u201dAlong with this Buy rating, Greene give FISV a price target of $130, indicating his confidence in a solid 31.5% upside potential.Fiserv has no fewer than 19 recent analyst reviews, including an impressive 17 Buy ratings against just 2 Holds, and making the analyst consensus a Strong Buy. The average price target, $122.37, implies a 24% premium from the current trading price of $98.86. ()Next on today\u2019s list is FleetCor, a major provider of fuel cards and workforce payment services throughout the developed world, with major clients in the US, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany. FleetCor\u2019s client list includes government entities, petroleum companies, and business commercial fleets.For Q1 2020, FLT showed mixed results. Revenues grew, gaining 6% year-over-year to reach $661.1 million. At the same time, net income fell by 15% yoy to $147.1 million. Due to the pandemic, management withdrew previously published full-year 2020 guidance, citing increased uncertainty in future business activity. Shares have slipped 13% since the earnings release.In his review of FLT, Greene maintained his Buy rating, along with a $280 price target that implies a strong upside of 30%. Greene comments, \u201cNotwithstanding near-term COVID-19-related headwinds, FLT remains well positioned to re-capture growth as end client volumes and activity normalize. Additionally, FLT maintains significant capital deployment flexibility, which we suspect could be utilized as we see some evidence of broader growth trends returning.\u201dThe Moderate Buy analyst consensus rating on FLT is based on 13 reviews, including 7 Buys and 6 Holds. The stock is selling for $215.15, and the $270.23 average price target indicates it has room for 26% upside growth over the next 12 months. () The last stock on today\u2019s list is WEX, an interesting company that provides payment solutions for corporate accounts. WEX started out in the 1980s as a fleet card provider, offering gasoline payment processing for corporate motor pools, and has since expanded to offer a wider range of payment processing and information management for commercial and government vehicle fleets.Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, WEX was having a good year. The company saw earnings grow through the first three quarters of 2019, and finished the year with a $2.39 EPS in Q4. The wide-ranging, large-scale economic shutdowns put in place to help fight the pandemic hit WEX hard, however. With so many people under shelter-at-home orders, vehicle traffic declined sharply, as did the need to refuel, service, and maintain those vehicles. WEX reported just $1.62 in Q1 earnings, missing the forecast by over 10% and falling 32% sequentially. The bright spot was the year-over-year change; EPS was up 5.8% from Q1 2019.However, Glenn Greene believes that WEX remains in a solid position, with positive long-term prospects. The analyst noted, \u201cWEX continues to see strong momentum in its US Health businesses, which realized a minimal impact from the pandemic. WEX also instituted near-term cost-cutting measures that should provide $60\u201365M of FY20 expense savings\u2026 We remain optimistic regarding WEX's diversified growth potential LT, however, are cautious regarding recent NT headwinds.\u201dTo this end, Greene maintained his Buy rating on WEX shares. His $175 price target suggests a robust one-year upside of 51% to the stock.Overall, WEX shares have a Moderate Buy rating from the analyst consensus. This is based on 11 recent reviews, which break down to 6 Buy and 5 Hold. Shares are priced at $116.09, and the average price target, $174.90, is in line with Greene\u2019s, indicating room for 51% growth.

[Operator Instructions]At this time, I will turn the call over to Peter Poillon, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. Thank you. You may begin. -- Thank you, Ivy, and good afternoon, everyone. With me on the call today are Jeff Yabuki, our Chairman and Chief Executive; Frank Bisignano, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter, which includes slides on our updated revenue and cost synergy targets announced in March, are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, expected operating and financial results, strategic initiatives and expected benefits and synergies from the First Data acquisition. Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors.Please refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call, along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless stated otherwise, performance references made throughout this call are year-over-year comparisons, and all references to internal revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Also note that non-GAAP financial measures included in our earnings release and supplemental materials include the first quarter of 2019 results for First Data, which have been prepared by making certain adjustments to the sum of historical First Data and Fiserv GAAP financial information.And now I'll turn the call over to Jeff. -- Thanks, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. To say we are living in interesting times is an understatement. As an example, Bob and I are here in Milwaukee, appropriately social distanced; Frank and Peter are joining from separate locations in New York; and many of you are likely at home. We are all adapting to this transitory time as we approach a new normal. We're incredibly proud of how the Fiserv team has responded, protecting your company while executing on our number one priority, keeping associates and clients safe. We activated our business continuity plan quickly, starting in Asia and continued around the world. Today, about 85% of our associates are working remotely, and the remainder are following rigorous safety protocols to protect the health of the team. Additionally, hourly associates whose jobs cannot be performed remotely have received a 25% increase in pay while we navigate the COVID crisis. We are supporting clients by providing them with the leading-edge solutions they need to serve their customers.Our account sales and service teams are adjusting the changes required in this new world, including travel by tech, connecting with clients through individual and team-based video capabilities. The substantial majority of our implementations are progressing as scheduled, and sales in the quarter held up reasonably well, coming in just shy of the prior year. We entered Q2 with a solid pipeline. And in fact, our preliminary sales results for April were up more than 20% over the prior year. We have a strong, resilient business model, which is buttressed by the delivery of mission-critical solutions to financial institutions, corporate clients and merchants around the world. We also believe leadership matters. And having more than our fair share of experienced executives who have successfully navigated the global financial and economic events of the last 30 years will contribute to even stronger results as we navigate these changing economic times. In early March, we communicated meaningful increases to our five year synergy targets, including a 20% increase in revenue to at least $600 million. And on the cost side, we increased our target by $300 million to a total of $1.2 billion which, as you will recall, does not include our sizable interest expense benefits.From day one, we believe that our significant synergies would help mitigate the potential adverse impacts of a recession. In addition to the quantum, we are intently focused on the speed to attain those synergies, all of which Frank will discuss later. The financial results for the first 10 weeks of the year were quite strong, even with some limited weakness outside the U.S. The last two weeks of the quarter got progressively worse as shelter-in-place and other restrictions ramped up around the world. The majority of the business displayed resilience with the largest negative impact in the merchant business, along with pressure in our debit-oriented transaction businesses not seen in previous downturns. The circumstances also spurred some incremental growth across several areas, including payments and digital. Global merchant transactions are generally on the upswing with some variability by country but with meaningful improvements from the lows seen in late March and early April. In the U.S., we've seen early signs of recovery in later April and May to date with comparative transactions down in the low double digits after declining nearly 30% in the last week of March.Since then, we've been seeing continuing, gradual improvement in merchant transaction recovery including into May. U.S. debit transactions were pressured but also showed improvement in the second half of April, finishing the month with low double-digit declines, a substantial improvement from the approximately 20% drop we saw in the last week of March and into early April. Overall, we are quite optimistic about the improvement we are seeing in the current trends and believe we will see further acceleration as shelter-in-place restrictions are eased in the U.S. and around the world. Given the uncertainty around COVID-19, we are withdrawing our previously communicated 2020 financial outlook. Consistent with the trends we have seen, we expect meaningful pressure on Q2's results and anticipate improvements throughout the second half of the year. Given the strength and resilience of our business model, including the significant synergy opportunities, we see a solid, actionable path to achieve double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth again this year. You will recall that we had expected our first quarter's results to be the weakest of the year due to a difficult compare and the ramping of synergies throughout the year.Given that, along with the impact of COVID-19, we produced solid results, including internal revenue growth of 4%, adjusted earnings-per-share growth of 16% and free cash flow increasing to $760 million for the quarter. Our capital allocation strategy was in full force, including closing the sale of a 60% interest in Investment Services, adding to our merchant capabilities through two small acquisitions and repurchasing 8.6 million shares in the quarter. Importantly, we are making excellent progress on integration with a focus on value creation across strategic, operational and financial fronts. The privileged relationships we have in our account processing businesses continue to expand, adding 12 new clients in the quarter, including five on DNA, such as Jeanne D'Arc Credit Union in Massachusetts with $1.5 billion in assets; and Nelnet, an existing output solutions client that selected DNA to support its mission of helping students make their educational dreams possible. Clover gross payment volume started strong, up 40% through February and despite the COVID hit, still ended up 29% for the quarter. Clover devices shipped was up about 25%.And the adoption of add-on software services such as virtual terminal and our new order ahead functionality continues to expand rapidly across the base. We saw important momentum in e-commerce, adding 36 new direct clients globally, including Total Wine & More, the country's largest independent retailer of fine wine; the U.S. Army Installation Management Command; USA Technologies; and Regis Salons, the largest hair salon chain in the world. We also added the German grocery chain Tegut; and MediaMarktSaturn Retail Group, Europe's largest consumer electronics retail chain with over 1,000 stores in 14 countries. E-commerce transactions remained strong in the quarter, up 26% in the U.S. and 20% globally, reflecting our market position and opportunity in digital commerce. Our integrated payments value proposition also continued to expand, growing partners more than 20% in the quarter. Impressively, ISV revenue grew more than 55% even in the face of late March weakness. We continue to see strong opportunities to grow in this important space. Overall, total contracted merchant locations globally grew 12% in the quarter.We also had very strong Zelle results, implementing eight times more clients in Q1 compared to the prior year and payment volumes skyrocketed, up nearly 90% in the quarter, and we saw even stronger growth in the second half of April as people look for new ways to pay in this new environment. We continue to see a significant value creation opportunity at the intersection of cards, DDA-based payments and our merchant scale around the world. Importantly, we remain fully committed to deploying our $500 million innovation investment. We've identified important opportunities in areas such as enterprise digital, card, merchant e-commerce, ISV and Clover. We also see expanded opportunities across the data horizon, including risk fraud and decisioning with a specific emphasis on authorization rates, network innovation and next-generation integration. We will continue to invest in 2020 and over the next several years to ensure that we are focused on where the market is going and what we need to do to win. Lastly, as you have seen, we announced our CEO succession plan earlier today, which elects Frank Bisignano to succeed me on July 1. I will serve as Executive Chairman for the remainder of the year, working closely with Frank to ensure a smooth transition.We will also work closely together to continue advancing our longer-term strategy, which will be heavily based on the well-honed capital allocation discipline which is embedded in the DNA of the company. Given my 15-year tenure, the Board and I have been engaged in deep succession planning conversations for a number of years. It has been my long-held belief that organizations benefit from changes in leadership and have used that principle to maintain a fresh approach over my time at Fiserv including, most recently, through the First Data acquisition. My conviction has gotten even stronger given the current pandemic and resultant need to manage and lead differently. Frank will bring new energy and perspective to the company while fully embracing the strategic foundation of Fiserv's value creation playbook. I've had the pleasure of working closely with Frank over the last 18 months, and it will be two years since the announcement when I ultimately depart. In addition to the things that you know such as Frank being an accomplished executive with vast experience in large, complex organizations, including doing a fantastic job as CEO of First Data, he's further established himself with our team, leading our businesses and integration, exceeding goals on our synergies and working closely with me to establish the foundation for our future success.The Board and I feel great about Frank, and he has our unanimous support as Fiserv's next CEO, only the first fourth person in our 36-year history. I'm incredibly happy for Frank and his family and offer my heartfelt congratulations to him as a business partner and my friend. It has been an honor and privilege to lead your company for what now amounts to one-four of my life. Over that time, we have transformed Fiserv into a global leader in payments and fintech and have been named the world's most admired company for seven consecutive years, all while building a sustaining culture of delivering differentiated value for clients, associates and you, our shareholders. My primary objective has been to leave the company stronger than when I found it. And while some might say we accomplished that objective, I firmly believe that the best days for Fiserv lie ahead.With that, let me turn the call to Frank. -- Thank you, Jeff. Good afternoon. And I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed these 18 months and how much I look forward to all the things we're going to do right here in the future. So first of all, let me say how honored I am to be elected the next CEO at Fiserv, a company with a great history and a bright future. My thanks to Jeff for his partnership and leadership to create one of the world's most admired companies. Jeff's vision for a company which invests for the future growth and allocates capital for the benefit of shareholders is the platform from which the company will continue to execute. This strategy will continue to serve our shareholders, associates and clients extremely well for the long term. We have jointly assembled a world-class team that will continue to drive innovation and excellence, allowing us to be known as the greatest fintech on the planet. I greatly appreciate Jeff and the Board's confidence in me leading the company. I feel privileged and tremendously humbled to serve our clients, our communities, our shareholders and this great company.Now on to business. A lot has changed since our last call. And while we've made great progress on integration, we have put even more focus on ensuring business continuity, protecting the health and safety of our associates and delivering on client commitments in light of the COVID-19 crisis. The team has come together beautifully. And I am incredibly proud of the company. As Jeff mentioned, Fiserv was well prepared to serve our clients through a well-tested and robust business continuity plan and an experienced and seasoned leadership team. A crisis waits for no one, whether moving 40,000 people to remote work environments, securing over 200 global locations, proactively managing credit risk or introducing alternative ways for merchant acceptance. Urgency, certainty and expertise are critical ingredients to a successful outcome. Delivering value to our clients is why we exist. Over the past several weeks, COVID has presented a number of unique opportunities to serve clients with speed, agility and innovation. Let me provide a few examples of how our solutions are helping our clients navigate these uncharted waters.Through both our Clover platform and our financial institution clients, we've processed tens of thousands of loans to enable small businesses to share in PPP funding. We are enabling a variety of expedited use cases through our MoneyNetwork prepaid card solution, including supporting the National Institute of Health's C19 research project and enabling not-for-profits to provide funds for those in need. In Argentina, we're working closely with government-owned banks to enable the distribution of benefit and subsidy payments. We've partnered with NIC to offer a walk-in bill payment services across 28 states to enable payments outside of government offices. Through our SpendTrend solution, we are providing proprietary data and insights to merchants, financial institutions and governments to enhance the understanding of economic implications across business segments and geographies. At Clover, we expedited the delivery of our new order-ahead capability which, since launch in early April, is already being used by nearly 1,800 restaurants.As Jeff mentioned, implementations have generally continued as scheduled as technology agendas for our clients remain very important. One terrific example, using a virtual team's approach. MONETA Money Bank in the Czech Republic recently completed a full migration of the bank's credit and debit card portfolios to our outsourced FirstVision service during a full quarantine period. MONETA Money Bank highlights the new ways to deliver great service, which are emerging in this challenging time. Our focus now, more than ever, is to consistently deliver high-value services. Our engagement model is at an all-time high with an enhanced focus on daily client service requests and prioritizing resources. In March, we communicated significant increases of our synergy targets, moving the cost side up by one-three from $900 million to $1.2 billion or roughly 12% of our total cost base. We also took our revenue synergy target up 20% by $100 million to $600 million over the five year period. While we are pleased with the progress to date, the synergy work is not complete.We remain fully committed to unlocking additional opportunity where possible, across both revenue and cost pools as we work toward being the best fintech and payment company on the planet. The enhanced cost synergies include additional opportunities in vendor efficiencies, contractor replacements, infrastructure and operational leverage. First, we've had great results working with our vendor partners to identify cost efficiencies for the combined company as well as acquiring new capabilities, which will have the dual benefit of avoiding internal investment and reducing capex. As a result, we have increased our expectations on procurement, primarily in technology, by about $200 million. Second, we expect to achieve additional synergy benefits from shifting original First Data's outsourced offshore operations to original Fiserv's captive. The primary savings are from converting third-party contractors, which generates cost arbitrage, improve operational efficiency and most important, no loss of knowledge as we rebadge existing third-party resources.Last, we're identifying even more savings from the consolidation of real estate, data centers and back-office systems. We've also had success extending the sophisticated call center operations of original First Data, including an AI-based virtual agent and enhanced self-service capabilities, all geared to meaningfully improve the overall experience. We have also packaged these capabilities to help supplement our clients while delivering revenue for us. We are moving more quickly to accelerate cost synergy timing as a way to offset some of the coronavirus revenue pressure. Our original expectation was more than $300 million this year. We now expect $500 million of full year synergy savings with an annualized exit rate of more than $700 million entering 2021. We feel great about our progress, and we'll continue to look for ways to add even more value. As we mentioned, on the revenue side, we raised our initial target 20% or $100 million, based primarily on anticipated outperformance in bank merchant and new opportunities in areas such as digital disbursements, payment innovation and much stronger momentum outside the U.S. than we expected.We are seeing continued strength in linking the account processing privilege relationships with our market-leading Clover solution to create unique value for our clients. To that end, we signed 55 new bank merchant clients in the quarter, with 42 of those wins through the end of February. We've now signed 109 new FI clients since the start of the program with competitive takeaways at about 40% and an even higher percentage in the larger bank space. Although sales activity has slowed due to the COVID disruption, interest remains very high with nearly 400 institutions in the pipeline. While we expect the current environment will moderate the pace of near-term revenue realization, we have raised our current expectation 15% to $230 million. In addition, we also signed another 16 institutions to our bank merchant program outside of our synergy efforts over the period, not including the expansion of nonbank partners.Although we have recalibrated the expected timing of our revenue synergies given the current economic situation, we are still expecting $75 million to $100 million of revenue synergy in 2020. Our integration is building an organization that will sustainably provide unique value. This is a critical time for the market. And we believe Fiserv, with highly differentiated market-leading solutions, is the best place for clients, associates and you, our shareholders.Now let me pass the call to Bob for a review of our financial results. -- Thank you, Frank, and good afternoon, everyone. I will discuss our results utilizing our new reportable segment structure included on the 8-K filed on April 1. We have three business segments. Merchant Acceptance, which we may refer to as acceptance or merchant, is primarily the global merchant acquiring business of original First Data. Financial Technology, or fintech, comprises original Fiserv's core account processing businesses, along with digital banking, financial and risk management and other software-oriented solutions. And finally, Payments and Network, or payments, is the most blended segment between the original companies and is primarily global debit, credit and prepaid card issuer processing, print and card production services and electronic payment services such as bill payment, biller and Zelle. As you heard, the company had a very strong performance through mid-March, well above our original expectations, and even with the significant decline in the last two weeks, still achieved 4% internal revenue growth.The results are even better when considering that result was against our most difficult quarterly comparison as Q1 2019 included a high level of nonrecurring and periodic revenue. Revenue synergies were a strong $27 million in the quarter. Adjusted operating income, which includes the grow over impact of the Investment Services Transaction, increased 1% to $968 million in the quarter with adjusted operating margin up 10 basis points to 27.8%. Operating margin was lower than anticipated due to the sharp decline in revenue in the second half of March and expected lower onetime and periodic revenue, partially offset by about $90 million of expense synergies in the quarter. Adjusted earnings per share was up 16% to $0.99 compared to the $0.85 in the prior year as adjusted for the Investment Services Transaction that closed this quarter. Internal revenue growth in the Merchant Acceptance segment was a very solid 6% for the quarter. These results were buoyed by our geographical breadth, diverse industry verticals and broad payment capabilities. North America internal revenue growth was 5% for the quarter after being up double digits through February.Our international business grew 7% on a constant currency basis, even as COVID impacts were seen in Asia and Europe earlier in Q1. We continue to make great progress on the dissolution of the BAMS joint venture. Consistent with our internal revenue growth methodology, beginning this quarter, we are excluding the 51% share of BAMS acquiring revenue from our internal revenue growth calculation due to the planned dissolution at the end of June. We will incorporate our new direct BAMS revenue as we would in any acquired business beginning one year post the close of the transaction. We look forward to continuing to serve this important client. Adjusted operating income in the acceptance segment decreased 17% to $283 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin declined 440 basis points to 21.2%. Two issues drove the unusual margin decline, led by roughly 270 basis point headwind, primarily related to the very sharp COVID volume decline at quarter's end, with roughly two-three of that amount from our higher growth international business.Next, the comparative negative impact of brand assessment fees, along with the expiration of a 10-year deferred revenue item in BAMS, which ended in Q2 last year, pushed margin down by another 200 basis points. Although we were able to outgrow the revenue decline in March, the resulting mix changed, served to compress operating performance in the quarter. We anticipate the segment operating margin to remain under pressure in Q2 due to the COVID-19 impacts. The Payments and Network segment delivered internal revenue growth of 3% in the quarter. Growth was led by card services and output solutions, including revenue synergy benefits, partially offset by lower growth in biller solutions and prepaid as well as the negative impact of the COVID-19 at the end of the quarter. Transactional businesses performed well in the first 10 weeks of the quarter but saw a significant falloff at the finish. Debit transactions were up mid-single digits for the quarter, which includes the impact of double-digit declines in late March which also carried into early April. As you heard, we've seen improvements through April as some markets reopen and stimulus payments hit in the U.S. P2P transactions, which include both Popmoney and Zelle, continued their rapid growth, nearly doubling versus Q1 last year and up 14% sequentially.The number of clients using Zelle has increased nearly tenfold compared to a year ago and is up 44% from Q4 2019. We've also been seeing even stronger performance in Zelle and TransferNow over the last couple of weeks as we believe consumers are expanding their use of safe and secure digital money movement. Adjusted operating income for the segment was excellent, growing 10% to $575 million in the quarter, and operating margin was up 280 basis points to 41.2%. The increase was primarily from growth in high-quality revenue, synergy benefits and productivity gains. The fintech segment saw internal revenue growth of 1% as gains in high-quality recurring revenue was partially offset by the expected decline in periodic revenue. Revenue in this segment tends to be quite resilient and less subject to variation due to the macroeconomics. We saw strong interest in demand for a broad array of digital solutions in the quarter. Mobiliti ASP subscribers increased 9% in the quarter to more than 9.2 million. And Architect, our single digital platform, had year-over-year growth of 34% to four million users. We also saw a measurable increase in digital interactions, along with a greater use of underlying functionality.Adjusted operating income was flat in the quarter at $204 million, and adjusted operating margin was up 30 basis points to 28.3%. The underlying results are stronger than they appear given a meaningful decline in license and termination fee revenue in the quarter. Core performance was driven primarily by higher recurring revenue, along with cost and operational efficiencies. The adjusted corporate operating loss in the quarter improved 10% to $94 million due to the benefits of cost synergies. The adjusted effective tax rate was up 80 basis points to 17.5% due to the combination of lower discrete tax items and reduced stock-based compensation benefits in the current year resulting from the First Data transaction. We continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate of 22% to 23% for the full year. Free cash flow was up 3% to $760 million in the quarter, driven by strong operating results despite an approximate $100 million year-over-year headwind associated with merchant settlement timing. Free cash flow conversion was 111% in the quarter.We repurchased 8.6 million shares for $885 million in the quarter, which included redeploying just over $500 million of net proceeds from the majority sale of Investment Services. We bought more shares than anticipated under our 10b5-1 plan due to the volatility in the quarter and do not anticipate repurchasing shares at the first quarter's level for the remainder of the year. As of March 31, we had 674 million shares outstanding and over 13 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase. Total debt outstanding, which is about 75% fixed rate, was $22 billion, and debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 3.8 times as of March 31. We are on track to return to our historic level of leverage within 18 to 24 months post First Data merger through a combination of debt repayment and EBITDA growth. Additionally, we anticipate refinancing some of our current debt as we have an $850 million bond maturing this quarter.Our balance sheet and liquidity positions are very strong, and we continue to expect we will generate significant free cash flow even in this economic downturn. We repaid $123 million of bank debt in the quarter and expect to repay more than $1 billion over the remainder of the year. While we are uncertain of the full impact of COVID-19 on our near-term business results, the combination of a resilient business model, a well-honed capital allocation strategy, $1.2 billion of anticipated cost synergies and a very experienced management team provides us with confidence that we will create sustained value for clients and shareholders through any economic cycle.With that, let me turn the call back to Jeff. -- Thanks, Bob. Given the crisis, we are pleased with our sales results for the quarter, down only about 1% to the prior year as travel limitations and pandemic actions took center stage. We are seeing very few deals being canceled but did see a bit more deal slippage than normal. We are pleased to see how quickly our sales and account teams have adopted virtual selling and how well market engagement has held up in this unique time. Our pipeline is solid with good visibility into Q2, including a number of recent COVID-related opportunities. We are also seeing our larger deals in the pipeline continue to progress as clients remain completely committed to their technology agendas. For example, on April 30, we expanded our relationship with OXXO, the largest and fastest-growing chain of convenience stores in the Americas, with presence in Mexico, Colombia, Chile and Peru. In Mexico, OXXO is, by far, the convenience store leader with more than 19,000 locations, and these stores also offer bill payment, money transfers and a financial inclusion product used by millions of people. Our significantly expanded relationship will begin with their Mexico-based fintech business providing account and card processing services through our first API and FirstVision solutions. We are very excited to partner with OXXO to help them even better serve their customers. As mentioned, we are withdrawing our 2020 outlook given the uncertainty in the environment. And although we don't provide quarterly guidance, we expect meaningful pressure on Q2 revenue and earnings results compared to the prior year. However, given our strong business model and accelerated cost synergies, we see a solid path to achieve our 35th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth.This path generally incorporates two COVID-19 macroeconomic assumptions: first, that April and, therefore, Q2 are the transaction and volume low points, followed by a measured recovery through the balance of the year; and that we are not subject to a sweeping second wave of social distancing and shelter orders, which create further economic duress. While we don't have enough clarity to call this formal outlook, we expect far more visibility at our second quarter call, and we'll provide further directional clarity on our full year financial outlook. Your company is performing well in the midst of this once-in-a-century event. We are enhancing our already resilient business by accelerating integration, enhancing services for clients and developing strategies that will allow us to lead the industry regardless of the economic environment. We will also invest to ensure that we not only win now but emerge from this transformational time stronger and better positioned to deliver value for many, many years to come. Let me also say thank you to the 44,000 people of Fiserv, who have made us all so Fiserv proud, navigating this unprecedented time with a single focus, to serve clients with excellence and commitment each and every day. It's an honor for all of us to work with you.With that, let's open the line for questions.[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from David Koning from Baird. -- Hey Jeff, sad to see you go, but congrats to everybody. -- Thanks, Dave. Really appreciate it. -- Are you thinking of running for President? I'd vote for you. -- Dave, right now, I just want to I want to do a great job on this quarterly call. -- There we go. All right. Well, I guess my first question, just on the merchant segment. When we think about some you gave a lot of really good metrics, clearly doing well. It felt like you were saying maybe low double digits were kind of the trend in the last couple of weeks in revenue. Is that kind of what you're saying? -- In transaction volume, we're seeing an improvement from kind of think about it in the 30s and has improved by about two-three. And we've continued to see improvement really that started toward the end of April but really since then has continued up to and including yesterday. And we're kind of seeing that gradual improvement happening. -- Great. Okay. And then I guess just my follow-up. Maybe if you could talk a little more about in the merchant segment, revenue was flattish year-over-year, just on a pure reported basis. Obviously, you grew better than that, organic. But EBIT was down, I think, $60 million. You talked a little about periodic revenue. There's also probably a lot of benefits from synergies. So maybe you could just parse out why EBIT was down $60 million or so. -- Yes. Dave, it's Bob. I think we try to give some color in the prepared remarks around that. From a synergy standpoint, recall that the Merchant Acceptance segment is largely is comprised of the original First Data merchant business. And so you're not seeing a lot of straight natural synergies, of overlap that you might first of all, in the corporate segment as well as in our Payments and Network business, where you see more of the synergies particularly in the early stages post merger. -- Thank you, very muchNext, we have Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. -- Hi, Glad to hear you doing OK, and congrats also, Frank and Jeff to both of you. -- Thanks, Darrin. -- Yes, thanks. -- Listen, I wanted to just hone in for a minute on the merchant segment because it clearly outperformed what we've been seeing across the industry. And curious if you could just give us a little bit more color on the mix. When we think about the trends, 6% for the quarter, it clearly shows like the end of the quarter was better-for-you guys than others. And then you're talking about reaccelerating to some degree as well. Clover, I know you commented on. And then, I guess, the mix on discretionary versus non. Any further color you can give us would be great. -- I would Darrin, let me take a shot at it, and then Frank and Bob will add as needed. I would say that one of the things that's most interesting in all of this crisis is there are macro factors that really matter. So where are you what geographies are you operating in and what is going on in those countries. And then probably at least as important, what are the industries in which you are serving and where may you have concentrations. And so if you are highly concentrated in industry verticals like travel, right, airlines, things like that, you're obviously going to see a different mix than if you are, say, serving retail, grocery, those kinds of things.And the same thing applies even in e-commerce, right? E-commerce, the idea, it still depends on where it is you are laid out. And I think one of the things that's important is because of where we sit geographically, even in some of the early stages of this that we were seeing around the world when it was starting in Asia and moving around, we our concentrations are such that we weren't getting beat up as bad early as we were seeing in some other places. I think the second thing is our vertical coverage in the most impacted areas is probably more favorable for us. And so we don't have those high concentrations.And then the third piece that I would throw in there is we've continued to grow in ISV, continue to grow in e-commerce in some of the digital areas. We talked about the wins that we had. And last year, we had 80-or-so wins. And that all creates an aggregate benefit. And then lastly, some of our larger merchants, if you look at our top merchants, they tend to be more resilient or maybe less impacted on a relative basis than others. And so all of that, I think, has added up to us having better results. By the same token, we obviously have SMB exposure in Clover that we were impacted in ways that were similar to others. I think based on some of what we were hearing, we might be seeing slightly better improvements over the last few weeks. And we're looking at it very closely every day to see how it's coming together.But it's all speculation, not knowing what's inside of other people's books. We're pretty certain about what's in our book. We like the way it's trending. And we are seeing absolutely when states or countries open up, you can literally see the lights come back on in places where they were not on before, and that's a benefit to our numbers. And again, we're tracking that very closely, sometimes it feels like every minute of every day. -- Yes. All right. That makes a lot of sense. When we and just my quick follow-up is really structural. I mean I think when we look at Clover, e-com, integrated or even on the fintech, on the core banking side, I mean, where do you think you come out of this pandemic where you gained market share because of your technology differentiation? And maybe just touch on the inbound demand for some of those fintech offerings versus what you would have seen before the pandemic. -- Sure. Thanks, Darrin. I would say that one of the things that we think is most differentiating about Fiserv versus some of the other companies is we are not just a merchant business, we are not just a fintech, and we are not just a payments. We happen to have leading market positions in each of those verticals as well as a very well-structured geographic presence that, prior to this crisis, was growing very significantly. And we believe and we're continuing to invest because we believe that's going to come back on that basis. But we were seeing toward the end of April, we were seeing a pickup in Zelle. We were seeing a pickup in TransferNow. We were seeing a pickup in RDC. So all of these things that are digitally oriented, we have found to be quite valuable.The other thing that's interesting, and this is not meant to cast aspersions on fintechs because we love the fact that innovators are continuing to create what's going on, but there's been very little discussion about fintech lately and much more discussion about scale, about certainty, about making sure we're there for the customers of our clients when it's needed most. I would say that other that idea, that idea of scale, if you take a microcosm like the merchant business, which is a very fragmented business with companies like us and others of our peers, all the way through independent service organizations, smaller providers, and in those cases, whether they are long-established ISOs or brand-new innovators, scale matters, the ability to make good decisions on onboarding, how do you manage risk in a time like this, that's all very important. And we think that the team that we've assembled, combined with the assets, is going to leave us in a place where we will be a share gainer, or we should be a share gainer, in this time, and we're certainly focused on making sure that happens.That's one of the reasons why we remain committed to $500 million of innovation, including spending money this year, which we think is very important when maybe others are putting the money back on the shelf. -- Got it thanksNext, we have David Togut from Evercore ISI. -- Thank you, and Congratulations, Jeff, on a great 15-year run. -- Thank you, David. -- And congrats to you as well, Frank, on the big promotion. I'd just like to start there, if I could. Obviously, you've worked together for 18 months or so. Frank, what do you think you would do differently as you take leadership of the company from what Jeff has done historically? -- Well, it sunk in that I'm the fourth CEO in a storied history. And I think if you look, we've been the world's most admired company most of 90% of this decade and before that, too. And what I've seen here and learned is a whole bunch of things. So I don't see us veering from any item that we were strategically driving. The innovation, we're very committed to that $500 million. Our capital allocation strategy, which is tried and true, is aspirational for most companies and was something that I saw when I came here and fully subscribed to it.Jeff and I have worked really, really closely together. I think we brought the team together very well. And I think really it's about continuing the client initiatives, being in the client's office and continue to innovate. Our innovation really is coming from our clients. So I don't there's look, this has been an honor and is a bittersweet moment to not be doing it with Jeff, to be honest with you. And so I don't sit here and say and never once said, said to each other, well, we're going to do that different. It's more about how we're just going to continue. And this team has really come together fabulously. So I think it's going to kind of really our best days are in front of us. So I don't there's no big changes happening here. -- Just as a follow-up, could you put some guardrails around the growth trends you're seeing in Financial Technology, Payments and Network Q2 to date? I think these segments historically would be seen as being more defensive in a downturn. How should we think about the range of possible outcomes around revenue for these two segments going forward? -- So David, I would say that the big difference in this economic dislocation versus anything that at least I've seen in my career is the manner in which the economic dislocation occurred, right? It wasn't a slant a slanted line, it was a cliff. And what we have never seen is an ability or an inability for people to use their cards or use their phones to pay for things. So we did see more impact in the debit and credit space than we would have expected. And had this been \"normal\", which is probably an unfair way to say it, normal recession, not that there's any such thing as that, I think we would have seen the normal hold up there that we had seen previously. And again, we're seeing that same recovery that we were talking about earlier happening in this area, but that's primarily because if you most of us here have been working at home largely for the last six or seven weeks. I don't fill my gas tank up very much when I don't drive it. And so it's just things like that, that people don't have the opportunities to use their debit cards and maybe their credit cards a little bit less. So you have that.In the financial segment, you or the Financial Technology segment, we're seeing exactly what we've always seen, David, and that is that's a transactionally oriented business. People are still using their they're still processing transactions, things still getting posted to the GL. I think interestingly, I think we just did a quick scan, and there are literally hundreds of thousands of PPP loans have been boarded in our core systems, and that those are new accounts. That will be part of the ecosystem. So all of those things will continue to create the stability, debit will come back. So we feel very comfortable that we still have a business of which the substantial majority of the business is highly resilient, think back to the '08, '09 days. -- Understood. Congrats again. -- Thank you.Next, we have Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. -- Thanks for taking question just want to ask about cost controls. Any additional controls you guys are putting in place to manage the margins, especially in this second quarter where the impact will probably be the greatest? -- Yes. I mean we've talked a lot about what we're doing on synergies and acceleration of synergies. But we obviously have taken other measures inside the company. And I think you'll see them come through as we go forward. I mean we stopped the 401(k) match, as an example, which was a significant effort in the company. And you probably saw us still filing on the stock plan. But more importantly, it's I think during this horrible crisis, we've been able to have tremendous focus on every element of the company. So we're continuing to spend to innovate. I think we'll or we see more development hours, not less, going on, but them going on in a very, very measured way, delivering for the client in a different manner.So as you know, both Jeff and I have always had a good eye on the cost, and we'll continue that. The synergies are forever, and we're very, very committed to those. And we as you hear us talk about them, you could see how confidence continue to build. So I think you'll see us continue to do both very well. And stay, number one, focused on our clients and revenue. -- And Bryan, I would say that we evaluated, should we take steps that would try to better align against Q2, because to your point, Q2 is going to be a rough quarter. But we believe that as the economy opens back up, we will see that kind of slower but a gradual improvement. And doing things that damage the business for a quarter, we don't think makes sense. I'm sure you don't think they make sense. But there is a lot of discretionary opportunity to, as Frank said, reallocate effort, make sure that we are only doing things that are needed right now and potentially redirect to places that we may have a better opportunity in the future. Again, on balance, we see a very solid actionable path to double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth this year. And so we're taking the steps to kind of center on that and being ready for the economic recovery. -- And Bryan, the one thing I would add to kind of follow on and echo Frank's comment. One of the things we've talked about the last six months is should we end up in a recession, having now $1.2 billion of cost synergies ahead of us gives us an opportunity to pull levers harder. And you heard us talk about original expectation of $300 million of cost synergies, now grown to $500 million with an exit run rate of $700 million, that's permanent cost-out. That is not damaging the business. That is executing an integration plan a little bit faster than we had initially planned, given the opportunity that we have to do that, and reallocate resources. So we feel quite good about our ability to mitigate the downside during the COVID crisis but, more importantly, come up much stronger on the other side as we exit 2020 and exit 2021 and beyond. -- Got it. And just a follow-up to that is on the merchant segment. Just thinking about the cadence of improving margins. Is that as simple as just as volumes come back, we can get to more stable to potentially improving margins in the future? -- The short, easy answer is yes. It's this business is a very intriguingly fixed cost business where you there are little, nano economics to costs to process that next transaction. But when you need to add a mainframe or you need to take down more bytes in a cloud or whatever, whatever technology metaphor that you want to use, you're buying that in bulk. And so from that perspective, we've got to make sure that I'm sorry, so from our perspective, as the revenue comes back on, it will flow through at a very high level. I think Bob talked about 270 basis points of impact in the quarter from that last very, very sharp off-the-cliff decline. And the other thing is the first quarter had the onetime kind of these onetime assessment items and other things that aren't we won't have to grow over. When we had given guidance, Bryan, we knew that, that was an issue. It's one of the reasons why we said, \"Hey, Q1 is going to be weaker.\" So we knew that was there. We knew it was coming. And so as things come back, we will absolutely see the benefit. I would just throw one other thing in there.We have had lots and lots of conversation around what can we do systemically to better manage, not in a short-term way, but what are the transformational things that we can do to get better leverage and flexibility in the cost structure, right? The beauty of this of not wasting a crisis is what can you learn. And we are seeing ways in which we think we can switch some of the cost structure from more fixed to variable, do different things so that when the revenue comes back, that, over time this is not a 2020 thing, but over time, we'll see an even bigger pickup in long-term margin accretion, which, as you know, is something that Fiserv has been famous for, for a long, long time. -- Thanks appreciate itNext, we have George Mihalos from Cowen & Company. -- Thank you, and congrats to both of you, Jeff and Frank. -- Thank you, George. -- Thank you. -- I guess, to start off, Bob, if we can go back to that commentary in merchant around the transaction volume now down, I think, sort of low double digits, so a big improvement there. Is the right way to think about that from a revenue impact that revenue will be down somewhat higher than that given that, I would think, there's more of a shift to sort of larger merchants versus SMBs? Is that the appropriate way to be thinking about it? -- Yes. I would say nominally higher, relatively close. And of course, the other impact is relative Q1 to Q2. Q1, we saw that rapid decline in just the last two weeks where we're dealing with the improvement over a longer period of time. So we didn't bounce right back after just two weeks. Although we've seen some nice improvement, we're still down that low double digits in the quarter. -- George, I think where you might see more impact is less on the differential between transaction and volume. And I think you'd see that maybe play out more at the margin line only because these very large merchants are going to be priced in a different way. But again, that's all accounted for when we think about how the recovery is structured and what the puts and takes are in that as we think about what do we need to do to achieve double-digit EPS growth. -- Okay. That's very helpful and very impressive, frankly. One more question, if I may, just on the old issuer processing business within First Data. I'm just curious, are you guys seeing any sort of a push or early signs of any of your FI partners kind of pushing an account or card purge going on? Or are things just sort of steady as they go? -- Yes. George, we have seen purges going on in different places. As you would expect, I mean, banks and FIs are managing their cost structure just as tightly, if not more tightly, than we are. But again, I mean, bankers are usually pretty good at this. I think the increment is not substantial, at least not for what we've seen so far. And we expect that as we start to see a little bit more stability, that you're going to see less of that because the last thing you want to do right now is purge away for an FI to make money. -- Thanks very helpfulNext, we have Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. -- Hey, Hope you're doing well. Congratulations to both of you. I wanted to just come back to the commentary around the line of sight to the double-digit EPS growth this year. Maybe we can just talk a little bit about the algorithm, the rough algorithm to get us there. In other words, how much top line pressure can this absorb and still get to those levels? I guess it kind of comes back to those base case macro assumptions that you laid out near the end of the prepared remarks. And try and give us a sense of what sort of rough revenue growth range that would yield. -- Yes. It would be difficult to do that. I'm even though I'm appropriately social distanced from Bob, I think he would throw something at me or slap me if we gave that kind of detail in the algorithm. I think we'll be in a better place in July when we announced Q2 to provide that data.But I will give you some qualitative. So we have been looking at scenarios since very early April. And the scenarios have stayed fairly constant up until the last probably 10, 15 days probably 15 days, where you started to everyone was a little tentative as you started to see improvements, and you'd see up and down and up and down. But now we're seeing that trend come together. And one of the reasons why we pushed our call out, in fact, the primary reason why we pushed our call out, was we wanted to have April data by the time we got together. And I would say that April outperformed where we thought it was going to be even as recent as two weeks ago. And so from our perspective, we feel like we are taking a realistic trend to how the revenue will come in. But I would also caution us all to say we are living in unpredictable times.So we think we have a fair level of assumptions that are not incredibly aggressive, but they don't imply that we stay where we are right now for the remainder of the year, right? It's that kind of moderate, gradual improvement that gets us nowhere near where we were in the first 10 weeks of the year and nowhere near where we were last year in terms of growth rates, right? So we've taken that way down. We think it's fair and conservative. But the real reason why we're able to do this is, as Bob mentioned and Frank mentioned, we took our synergy targets up $300 million in March. And we had been working on that for quite a while, that was not new. And for us to, on a nontemporary basis, take our cost synergies up from more than $300 million to $500 million, with an exit rate of $700 million, while that took a lot of hard work at the team and it's going to continue to take hard work at the team, we did not recreate the wheel.All we did was accelerate our synergy plans, make sure we were doing the things that we need to do. And as Frank mentioned, we have another layer of things that we're looking at. We're not done. We snapped the line. We took a picture. But we will continue to do that. And as the world evolves, we'll do everything in our power to make sure that we are moderating our cost structure to the extent that revenues do things that maybe we don't think they should be doing, or we'd like them to be doing.So I apologize, Jason, for the longer answer. But that's at least the way we're thinking about it philosophically. And again, we wouldn't have made the statement if we didn't feel like we had a good, solid path and an actionable path to get there. -- Okay. That's a good, thoughtful answer. Just a quick follow-up on Clover. Wondering if you're seeing any significant uptick in terms of chargeback risk as you think about the prospects for churn at the very low end, any qualitative or quantitative observations there would be great. -- No, we don't. I mean relative to Clover, we won't see chargeback risk. And I think you heard us talk about what we did in terms of using technical expertise to get that restaurant app out there pretty quick. I mean, we've also had tremendous growth right prior to what you saw at the end of March. But I think what you'll see in Clover is us continuing to invest in it. And you should expect us to have that continue to grow very nicely and the clients with a high satisfaction level. So a full commitment, we don't see look at small businesses struggling, and we're continuing to bring functionality that helped them through this difficult period. -- And Jason, I think we would also add, from our perspective, and you heard this a little bit in the prepared remarks, we have people who have been through all kinds of cycles. And one of the things that was so incredibly heartening to me is not only do we have people who work for us today, but Frank, through his very powerful Rolodex I'm probably too old to use that word but through his powerful Rolodex, brought back people who have incredible G2 incredible experience, and we were able to very quickly get our arms around the exposures in the company. And we have been paying a lot of attention to what's going on, whether they be around industry verticals, refund levels, chargebacks, those kinds of things. And we feel like we are very appropriately reserved for where we are today, especially in Clover. In terms of the kind of exposures you have in areas like that are not nearly as meaningful as you would in merchant acquiring for industries that are on a deferred delivery basis. And most of what Clover does is a kind of right now or very near-end kind of service delivery. -- Thank you,Next, we have Brett Huff from Stephens Inc. -- Hey Frank, we're looking forward to your leadership. And Jeff, you'll be missed. -- Thank you, Brett. -- Two questions. One is, Jeff, you kind of alluded to this, and I kind of think about it as an arms race, the $500 million pot of gold that you have that only a select few of fintechs have. You mentioned some priorities in terms of investments, and I think we're all familiar with those. But has anything really changed? Or has anything really popped up where you said, you and Frank talking about this said, in this new environment, we're going to press our advantage in X and really throw some more time and effort and money after this vertical, this product, whatever, because that's the thing where we can move the needle most coming out of this? Is there a big change? Or is it just kind of more of the same? -- I would say, at least right now, we have not seen new innovations this may be a little bit unfair, but new innovations yet that we would say, let's shift our focus from this basket to this basket. However, I would say that there are several things that we have been working on that we are quite excited about that we had planned to talk a little bit about at Investor Day, but areas that we think there's really significant opportunity. And we at some point, we'll be able to talk about it, but we don't necessarily think it would be prudent to do that right this second. But Brett, there are some really interesting opportunities out there, overall, probably in shades of the things that we've talked about before but could have a real impact on revenue, margin growth but, most importantly, client value. -- That's helpful. And then follow-up, and I'm not sure if this is answerable, but as you stand now, you talked about last 10 days outperforming in April versus what you thought just 10 days ago. So pretty remarkable changes between then and now. Knowing what we know now, and you have a lot of great data from Clover to big clients and etc., where do you guys fall on the V versus U versus W versus swoosh? Do you if you had to describe your base case, where would that fall in that kind of range of recovery? -- I would say it probably not exactly sure what the economic variability is in a swoosh model. But if it stands for kind of a slow, gradual, moderate recovery over time, I would say we're more there than we would be any of the others. However, the difference is I think it likely is going to be more stair stepped. I think you're going to see jurisdictions open. You'll see kind of a small amount of lift-up. It will feel like a V, and then it will plateau, and then it'll feel like a V, and it will plateau. And it will feel more stair-oriented than any of the other examples. And I don't think any of us yet know this was a comment about a second wave. I just don't think we understand yet how might that impact us and how will this fall out. But we do believe that we will ultimately get back to a place where people are going to work, right? And if people are going to work, they'll probably eat something, they'll probably stop at the convenience store, they might even buy gasoline, and maybe one day, they'll take vacations. So we think over time, we're going to get back, but none of us know yet what that new normal is going to be. -- Thanks for colorNext, we have Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. -- Thanks appreciate you squeezing me in here toward the end. Frank, you bring up you brought up Clover a few times, and I the world, at the point of sale, seems to be changing pretty quickly. Can you talk about some of the ways perhaps you're driving revenue beyond merchant discount, thinking about other sort of software solutions and stickier offerings that you may be able to bring to bear, given the advantage of owning the technology? -- Well, I think one of the ways to think about it is specifically what we talked about. As we bring in software apps to do things like dine ahead, that's a perfect example, and you see such a great pickup in it, I think we've been very, very successful in adding apps and SaaS fees. So I think there's a great desire. We hone that skill over time, and we've built a lot more there. But what you also find is the power of our data and information and clients' ability to use it, very, very powerful. So I think that Clover was always designed to be much more of a platform than be a point-of-sale only. So we feel very good about it. We've invested more there, and we see the application take-up rate, very, very high. I think you're watching a change. And I think that change is pretty powerful. You see our virtual terminal expansion, very, very high. You're seeing our ability to move more businesses to be online and physical than ever before. And I think you'll see that conversion continue. And we've seen very, very good strength on it. -- I would say the other thing we're doing is I mean, we one of the things that we are quite interested is, given the assets that we have and the partnerships that we have, we see real opportunities to create ecosystems that create more value for the Clover merchant. So expanding, kind of going beyond point-of-sale and starting to create the idea of a control panel for the SMB or the business owner to better run their overall business. So we see, as we have proprietary access to solutions that allow customers to move money, to transfer, pay bills, all kinds of things, we think there's an interesting ecosystem opportunity there, which, over time, we expect to grow. It's one of the reasons why we went direct to Clover to Clover users to help them apply for PPP, the PPP program and things like that. So just think about it as an ecosystem. We think there could be real value there both in retention as well as incremental revenue on a per terminal basis. -- Okay. That's helpful. And if I may, as we see also what might be an accelerating transition to fintechs, especially around stimulus and PPP, do you have a sense of urgency feeling a sense of urgency from your bank customers to perhaps accelerate their investments in technology? -- Yes. It's a good question, Andrew. I think the answer is yes. We do see people, especially over the last few weeks, if you think back to it's hard to gauge time anymore. If you think back to mid-March or the third, call it, the third and a half week in March when things really started to hit, there was a lot of focus on the digital experiences, right, no matter what size institution, everyone was very focused on that. And we've seen that continue. We've seen more usage of mobile deposit, we've seen more usage of digital transfer, we see more usage of Zelle. So all of that, I think, stokes the desire for institutions to do more. At this stage, we are being a little bit more measured in believing that will turn that demand will necessarily turn into incremental revenue this year because if you look at interest rates, you can see that there's real pressure at the FIs, and so there's a balance. And so on one hand, we aren't seeing people abandon their technology agendas; on the other hand, I am hard-pressed to see people really decide to substantially increase their level of investment. So we're watching. We like the fact that projects are going. We're able to implement things virtually. We're actually learning a lot there. That could be quite an interesting way for us to change our expense structure but, more importantly, get technologies installed faster. So we'll just keep watching and monitoring what's going on. -- Thank you, for your timeAnd our last question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. -- Hi, Jeff and Frank, congratulations to both of you. Maybe I can state both my questions upfront. The first one is, as we exit this sort of bottom here, that's for me, what does normalized growth look like in each segment? And then the other question I had was, as you look at the various synergies, and I kind of like the categorization that you've kind of given, are there things that kind of hit nearer term versus further out in terms of just the timing as you think of what hits this year versus, say, later on in that five year time frame? -- So Ashwin, let me take the normalized growth question, and then Frank and Bob can add on to that, and then we'll have Frank and Bob take the synergy timing question. On the normalized growth, I think the probably the short answer to that is when will things be normal, and I think it's way premature to call what normal is going to be. I don't think we have any belief that normal this year is going to feel like the growth rates that we saw last year on balance. I think given what we've already seen in Q2, I think it's not at all likely that, that will happen. I think it's going to depend on things that are out of our control from a macro standpoint. Do we have good antibody testing? Do we have a vaccine? I mean until we see those kinds of protections in place that allow people to be more knowledgeable, I just think it's going to be hard to call normal.From our perspective, we expect we do expect to be able to, over time, see continue to win share and continue to execute better than or I'll just say, execute well. And I think that will turn into a good solid growth for us as a company.Frank, why don't you take the synergy timing question? -- Yes. Thank you. I think, first of all, maybe we should start with the we Jeff and I saw the path to 900, very, very clearly and even more opportunity, and we probably made that clear as we were talking through it to you all over time. And as we peel the onion, and the teams came together, and I'd really say our ability to get stuff done from a team approach here has been very, very large, and I think the team saw the path to many more opportunities than Jeff and I actually saw with the initial group of players. And that was how we were also going to bring the best of both companies together. And people say that many times, but this is really where we're bringing that capability together. You heard it around the captive. And Jeff and I knew that one early. We didn't really know that it would go quite as well as it is. We also think about the tools we have to manage the company. You heard about the call centers.You even look at other tools. And they've allowed us to accelerate and to also allow us to be able to increase and recognize, as you could hear in our voice, that there's more opportunity as the team keeps digging in. So we feel very, very good about that. I think it's important to recognize the revenue side of it because as you see on the bank merchant, you have to look at that and see us as the partner of choice, one that gets generally picked in most situations and that people see Clover as a tremendous opportunity. But what we're seeing there is the teams, once again, are digging in, is bringing the cross-section of the company together to even get more opportunity. And I would think about us continuing to expand on that. So time is getting compressed because our leadership is able to do that, and our teams are very committed. The opportunities have gone larger. And we see a very, very good set of opportunities in front of us going forward. -- Yes. I think the only thing I would add is we've seen, as you saw in our results and in our projections, move from $900 million to $1.2 billion over the five year period, quite quickly ratcheted up the revenue synergies back in early March when we announced both the improvements. And you see in the Q1 results, for example, corporate expense is down 10% year-over-year. We assumed all along that the duplicative corporate structure would be kind of the \"easiest\" to get at. And we've certainly seen that. We've seen nice improvement and acceleration in technology as well as in the operational efficiencies. If you look at our slides that we included in the release today, we've already executed, actioned $565 million of cost synergies. So almost half of the $1.2 billion is actioned, and that's really across all three buckets, getting that quickly. The leadership team grabbing hold of the opportunity and driving hard, particularly in light of the COVID crisis, to Jeff's earlier comment, not wasting the crisis, getting at the opportunity as quickly as we can. -- Well, thank you, Ashwin, for the final question. Thank you, everyone. I know this call went a little bit long. There's obviously lots to talk about with the world and the place that it is in. Be safe and healthy. Thanks for your support, and we look forward to talking to you soon.

Bisignano, currently president and COO, is succeeding Jeffery Yabuki as CEO of Fiserv (Ticker: FISV), whose shares have dropped more than 13% since March. Yabuki will be executive chairman for rest of 2020.Fiserv, with headquarters in Brookfield, Wis., provides payments and financial-services technology to banks, thrifts, credit unions, and securities broker dealers. The management change comes as Covid-19 has caused businesses across the U.S. to close to stem the spread of the virus. Millions of people are working from home, resulting in a rise in e-commerce and online delivery. Fiserv is seeing \u201ca great acceleration in digital. We\u2019re seeing it in serving our thousands of institutional clients,\u201d Bisignano said in an interview from his home in New Jersey. At the same time, \u201cpeople physically being with each other is decelerating quite a bit.\u201d Covid-19 will alter the payments landscape, but Bisignano isn\u2019t sure how. \u201cNo one has a crystal ball to figure out what is going to be the new norm,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be changes.\u201d In January, Fiserv observed what the pandemic was doing in Asia and prepared for the virus\u2019s spread to other countries where it operates. By mid-March, 85% of its roughly 44,000 employees were working remotely. About 4,800 hourly employees who must staff Fiserv\u2019s operational centers to serve clients have received a 25% pay raise, Bisignano said. During the Sept. 11 terrorist attack, police and firefighters were considered essential workers, he said. With the Covid-19 pandemic, nurses and doctors, as well as workers that keep America going, are considered essential. \u201cWe have our fair share of them.\u201d Bisignano is well known on Wall street, having been a top lieutenant at JPMorgan Chase (JPM) under CEO James Dimon.He also isn\u2019t new to managing during difficult times. Bisignano turned around First Data, the payments company acquired by KKR (KKR) in 2007. The $29 billion deal, one of the largest during the private-equity boom of 2005 to 2007, was completed right before the financial crisis of 2008. It turned out to be an albatross.First Data struggled with a huge debt load\u2014most of it attributable to the leveraged buyout\u2014and was unprofitable for several years. It went through several CEOs before Bisignano joined in April 2013. KKR valued First Data that year at 70 cents on the dollar, Reuters reported. (KKR invested $7 billion equity in the original deal, and followed up with $300 million in 2013.) Bisignano pushed new products at First Data, including cloud-based software for small and medium-size businesses. It acquired Clover, a payments startup, in 2013, and then CardConnect in 2017. First Data became profitable in 2015 and went public that October.\n            The turnaround was complete in 2019 when Fiserv announced a $22 billion deal to buy First Data. It was among a trio of large payments-company transactions that year, including Fidelity National Information Services buying WorldPay for $35 billion. Global Payments also bought TSYS for $21.5 billion. Bisignano declined to discuss possible merger and acquisitions for Fiserv, saying only: \u201cFirst Data is Fiserv.\u201d Fiserv, he said, remains committed to investing $500 million in innovation and technology, which will go to organic investments. Bisignano pointed to Clover, the point-of-sale system that helps businesses accept payments, as a leader and one of the places Fiserv will invest in and build. \u201cThe world wants innovation, the world wants creativity,\u201d Bisignano said. \u201cWe are completely committed to it. We\u2019ll see how it all shakes out. We will be the leader in fintech and payments.\u201d \n                Write to Luisa Beltran at luisa.beltran@dowjones.com\n            The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Looking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at , one standout is the iShares Russell Mid-Cap Growth ETF (Symbol: IWP) where we have detected an approximate $49.3 million dollar outflow -- that's a 0.5% decrease week over week (from 76,900,000 to 76,550,000).

One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 239 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the FISV options chain for the new December 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $85.00 strike price has a current bid of $8.50.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $85.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $76.50 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of FISV, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $96.11/share today.\n\nBecause the $85.00 strike represents an approximate 12% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 71%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 10.00% return on the cash commitment, or 15.27% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Fiserv Inc, and highlighting in green where the $85.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $100.00 strike price has a current bid of $11.30.  If an investor was to purchase shares of FISV stock at the current price level of $96.11/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $100.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 15.80% if the stock gets called away at the December 18th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if FISV shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Fiserv Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing FISV's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $100.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $100.00 strike represents an approximate 4% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 47%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

However, adjusted to evaluate the company's operating performance on a combined basis with First Data,\u00a0EPS rose about 17% to $1.13. Image source: Getty Images.Fiserv expects to generate $500 million in incremental revenue over the next five years from the First Data merger through various channels, including Clover, bank merchant services, credit processing, biller services, and network innovation. It also forecasts substantial cost savings over the next five years -- about $900 million -- through eliminating overlapping corporate structures, streamlining the technology infrastructure, increasing operational efficiencies, optimizing the footprint, and improving processes. The acquisition is expected to add about 20% to EPS\u00a0in the first full year and 40% once the synergies are realized. Furthermore, the combined company anticipates $4 billion in free cash flow after the third full year. The company added a lot of debt from the acquisition, but it plans to refinance approximately $17 billion of debt from First Data. The free cash flow will be used to reduce the company's  ratio to historical levels. Fiserv is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings May 7.

At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the FISV options chain for the new May 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $95.00 strike price has a current bid of $5.90.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $95.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $89.10 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of FISV, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $96.88/share today.\n\nBecause the $95.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .

If an investor was to purchase shares of FISV stock at the current price level of $96.88/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $100.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.90% if the stock gets called away at the May 15th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if FISV shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Fiserv Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing FISV's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $100.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $100.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

[Operator Instructions]At this time, I will turn the call over to Peter Poillon, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. -- Thank you, Ivy. Good afternoon, everyone. With me today are Jeff Yabuki, our Chairman and Chief Executive; Frank Bisignano, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer.Our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter and full-year are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results, strategic initiatives, and expected benefits and synergies from our recent acquisition of First Data.Forward-looking statements may differ materially from actual results and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. You should refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors. Please refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call along with a reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measures. Unless stated otherwise, performance references made throughout this call are year-over-year comparisons and all references to internal revenue growth are on a constant currency basis.Also note that non-GAAP financial measures, included in our earnings release and supplemental materials, include the fourth quarter of 2018 and full-year 2019 and 2018 results for First Data, which have been prepared by making certain adjustments to the sum of historical First Data and Fiserv GAAP financial information. For additional historical combined financial information, please refer to the Form 8-K which we filed on October 3rd.As a reminder, we'll host an investor conference on March 25th in New York City. We expect the presentation to run from about 8:30 AM to noon and we'll also host a launch following the program. We look forward to seeing you at this important event.And now I'll turn the call over to Jeff. -- Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon. It's wonderful to be here today discussing the creation of new Fiserv through best-in-class integration. We are making great progress serving clients, enhancing our growth profile through revenue synergies and moving the needle on cost actions.At the same time, as you can see from our strong 2019 results, we remain focused on profitably growing our existing business to deliver shareholder value. We were excited to start the new decade by being named as a Fortune Magazine World's Most Admired Company for the seveth year in a row. This recognition is a testament to the hard work, dedication, and commitment of our associates around the world. I'm personally very proud to be part of this team.As you know we set initial five-year target of at least $500 million of revenue synergies and $900 million of cost benefits. The punch line remains that we are highly confident in achieving these targets and continue to identify ways in which we can overachieve in terms of both quantum and timing.We continue to advance a growing list of revenue synergies designed to deliver additional client value and incremental revenue growth. These initiatives represent a solid mix of near- and long-term opportunities, which should enable us to serve clients in a way that will drive enhanced growth and profitability for Fiserv over the next decade.We continue to see better-than-expected results in our bank merchant program for Fiserv account processing clients. We signed 44 new clients in the fourth quarter, more than tripling the signings in Q3 and signed over 50 for the year. We are seeing a good balance between de novo programs and competitive takeaways which are running about one-third of the signings, higher than anticipated at this stage.We exited the year with more than 300 institutions in the pipeline and continue to believe we will exceed the $200 million revenue synergy target for this very important initiative. In addition to bank merchant services, there is a large opportunity to cross-sell solutions around the world where one or both of the original firms has an influential relationship. Examples include CheckFree, Dovetail payment hub, DNA, credit card processing, and Output Solutions. We continue to be bullish on the revenue synergy opportunities emerging from network innovation. The combination of STAR and ACCEL as the third largest debit network in the US provides us with significant opportunity to differentiate with issuers and merchants.Importantly, we are on track to deliver at least $100 million of revenue synergies in 2020 and are well on track to meet or exceed our initial $500 million revenue target. We are also making excellent progress against our cost synergy objective of at least $900 million. Our initial focus is to streamline our cost structure through enhanced efficiency, increased operational rigor, and a significant focus on our $4 billion of annual vendor spend.We attained $46 million of cost synergies in 2019 and are continuing to grow a level of annualized run rate savings. We expect incremental cost synergies of more than $300 million in 2020 and given the combination of visibility and actions to date also anticipate very strong cost synergy performance in 2021. We are pleased with our performance to date and have increasing confidence in our objective to exceed the original synergy targets over the five-year period. We will provide a full update of both cost and revenue synergy targets at our March investor conference.Since the time of the transaction announcement, we have gotten questions on how the original Fiserv operational effectiveness program would intersect with the cost synergy program. We see a number of opportunities to operate our business more efficiently, while enhancing our client experience through innovation, such as RPA, cloud, and process reengineering, which we believe will also provide additional economic opportunity beyond the cost synergy program.An important 2020 priority is to continue working collaboratively with Bank of America on the joint venture dissolution which is slated for June 2020. The discussions are progressing very well, and both parties are focused on ensuring the delivery of great service to our shared clients. We continue to believe that the financial impact of the BAMS separation will be generally accretive to our results over the next few years.Overall, there is nothing more important than delivering on the promise of new Fiserv. Our unifying purpose across the enterprise is to build an extraordinary company for our clients, associates, and shareholders.With that let me turn the call over to Bob to provide detail on our financial results. -- Thank you, Frank, and good afternoon. Let me start off by saying that we feel great about our financial performance and have confidence in our ability to create sustained value for clients and shareholders.Internal revenue growth was 5%, as expected in the quarter, and 6% for the year. We were pleased to see modest contributions from our revenue synergies, which we believe will accelerate to at least $100 million in 2020. Adjusted operating income increased 7% to $1.2 billion in the quarter and was up 8% to $4.3 billion for the year, which includes an early contribution from synergies.Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was up 100 basis points to 31.4%. The improvement was driven by a combination of continued revenue growth, the lapping of prior year's tax reinvestment, and the early benefits from synergies, partially offset by the expected lower periodic revenue compared to the fourth quarter of last year. Adjusted operating margin for the full year was up 100 basis points to 29.7%, driven by improved revenue growth, cost efficiencies, and a modest impact from early synergy realization.Adjusted earnings per share was up a very strong 18% to $1.13 in the quarter and increased 16% to $4 for the year, which also marked our 34th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. These results include a negative impact from foreign currency of $0.02 and $0.11 per share for the quarter and full-year, respectively. As you know, we intend to modify our segment structure in 2020, and we'll report our future results on that basis. We expect to file an 8-K in March that will provide the new segments along with comparable financial information on a quarterly basis for 2018 and 2019.Now on to the segments. Internal revenue growth in the First Data segment continued to be strong at 6% in the quarter and 7% for the year. This performance included outstanding results in the former GBS segment, delivering 9% growth in the quarter and 10% for the full year. Internal revenue growth in GBS North America was a very solid 6% in both the quarter and year. And as we mentioned in our Q3 call, we don't intend to provide this level of subsegment detail beginning in 2020.Global merchant acquiring, both at the physical point-of-sale and in digital markets were important contributors to our 2018 growth with strong performance in India, Brazil, and Argentina. Additionally, we saw solid performance in our domestic business, including continuing strength in our digital commerce solutions. Our ISV partners grew by more than 25% for the year translating to almost 25,000 new ISV merchant locations. Importantly, the number of global contracted merchant locations in 2019 expanded by double digits.We also continued to expand our leadership position in card issuing with worldwide accounts on file up solidly in the mid-single digits for the full year. Segment adjusted operating income increased 6% to $708 million in the quarter and was up 5% to $2.7 billion for the year. Adjusted operating margin in the segment was up 50 basis points to 31.9% in the quarter and 30.7% for the year, driven primarily by strong revenue growth.The original Fiserv Payments segment delivered the internal revenue growth of 4% in the quarter and 5% for the year impacted, as expected, in the quarter by lower periodic revenue. We saw strong segment growth performance in card services, output solutions, and some early network revenue synergy benefits.Adjusted operating income for the segment was excellent, growing 12% to $353 million in the quarter and up 11% to $1.3 billion for the year. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was outstanding, up a very strong 250 basis points to 39% and was up 70 basis points to 36.3% in the year. This increase was generally from growth in high-quality revenue, the reduction of last year's tax-funded investments, and the benefits from productivity and early synergy performance.Transactional businesses performed well with debit transactions up in the high-single digits for the quarter and year and Mobiliti ASP subscribers increased 11% in the quarter to more than $9 million. P2P transactions, which includes both Popmoney and Zelle, continued their rapid growth, doubling versus Q4 last year and up 18% sequentially. Zelle transactions tripled in 2019, and the number of live clients increased tenfold compared to a year ago. Zelle signings were also very strong for the year, almost doubling to more than 360, which included 112 in the fourth quarter alone.Internal revenue in the Financial segment for the quarter was flat, as expected, driven by much lower periodic revenue, partially offset by gains in high-quality recurring revenue. For the full year internal revenue growth was up a solid 3%, led by our account and item processing businesses. Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was flat in the quarter at $207 million and was up 1% to $805 million for the year. Adjusted operating margin was up 40 basis points in the quarter to 34.1% with the benefit of growing recurring revenue and operational effectiveness more than offsetting the impact of lower periodic revenue. Adjusted operating margin for the full year was up 20 basis points to 33%, which is the highest level attained in the last several years. The adjusted corporate operating loss in the quarter was flat to the prior year at $100 million and down 11% to $414 million for the full year, primarily due to a combination of cost synergies and operational efficiency benefits in both original companies.The adjusted effective tax rate came in slightly better than expected at 22.8% for the quarter and 21.4% for the year, primarily due to higher-than-expected benefits and stock-based compensation. Due to the transaction close, we expect this benefit to be reduced in 2020 and become a bit of a tax rate headwind with the largest impact likely in Q1. Accordingly, we expect our adjusted effective tax rate for 2020 to be in the range of 22% to 23%.Free cash flow of $984 million in the quarter was driven by a combination of strong operating results and some benefit from settlement timing in our merchant business. Full year free cash flow was up a very strong 16% to $3.3 billion and free cash flow conversion was 118%. We expect to see continued free cash flow benefits from the utilization of the First Data tax NOL in 2020. We repurchased 2.2 million shares for $238 million in the quarter and 4.2 million shares for nearly $400 million in the year. We are pleased to have reentered a more regular cadence on share repurchase, which should carry into 2020. As of December 31st, we had 680 million shares outstanding and 22 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase.Total debt outstanding, which is about 78% fixed rate, was $21.9 billion and debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 3.8 times as of December 31st. We repaid nearly $600 million of debt in the quarter, and we remain committed to returning our historic leverage level within 18 to 24 months through a combination of debt repayment and strong EBITDA growth.In December, we announced an agreement to sell a 60% interest in our Investment Services business to Motive Partners. Along with entering into a joint venture, we expect to receive approximately $510 million of net after-tax proceeds from the sale, which will be primarily redeployed to share repurchase. Overall, the net expected dilution from our four [Phonetic] 2019 divestitures should be about $0.05 in 2020.We will continue to use our portfolio management discipline to ensure we have the optimum mix of businesses to deliver sustained client and shareholder value in your company. In conjunction with the First Data merger, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge in the GAAP results in the quarter associated with an international core account processing platform. Lastly, using the midpoint of our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance, we will have already achieved, approximately 25% accretion from the First Data transaction. We will remain on track to meet or exceed our commitment of more than 40% accretion over the five-year synergy period.With that let me turn the call over to Jeff. -- Thanks, Bob. As we mentioned upfront, market momentum continued in Q4 with a 15% increase in sales for the second quarter in a row and with strong performance across several areas, including bank solutions, card services, merchant solution, and biller. The Q4 results are even more noteworthy considering original Fiserv sales results in the comparable period were at a record level. On a combined basis, sales was up 10% for the year and our pipeline remained strong. We are seeing synergy opportunities grow as the market explorers the benefits of new Fiserv, which we believe will lead to incremental revenue growth in 2020 and beyond.For original Fiserv, integrated sales was up 41% sequentially and up 5% for the year. During the fourth quarter, we achieved $11 million of operational effectiveness benefits and $47 million of savings in 2019, which completes our five-year $250 million program one year early. As you know, we provided a preliminary view of 2020 performance in Q3 and our actual 2020 outlook is right in line with that preview.We expect constant currency internal revenue growth of 6% to 8% for the year with growth rate acceleration coming from continuing strength in our global merchant business, the cumulative impact of sales and implementations, and the achievement of in-year revenue synergies. We expect 2020 adjusted earnings-per-share growth of 23% to 27%, or $4.86 to $5.02, after [Phonetic] revised 2019 result of $3.95, which reflects the net divestiture impact Bob mentioned earlier. Our outlook also contains negative FX impact of approximately $0.07 to $0.08 per share, which is incremental to the decline in 2019. We expect adjusted operating margin to expand by at least 250 basis points and that free cash flow conversion will be greater than 112% for the year.For modeling purposes, we expect our Q1 results to be pressured by the comparison against last year's strongest quarter, which also had a high level of non-recurring and periodic revenue. Additionally, we expect revenue growth and earnings to build sequentially throughout the year as action plans are executed and cost and revenue synergies fold into our results. Overall, we expect the quantum of these benefits and the impact to our P&L to be sustainably higher in the second half of the year, which should also provide a strong jumping-off point as we enter 2021.2019 was a watershed year for Fiserv. We were again named a World's Most Admired Company, achieved our 34th consecutive year of double-digit earnings-per-share growth, and most importantly acquired First Data in a market-defining transaction that significantly advanced our aspiration of moving money and information in a way that moves the world.We're excited to enter a new decade of growth and opportunity. We believe we have assembled the strongest client-centric solutions in the industry, the best associate team, and are focused on delivering above-market returns for you, our shareholders. As we close, let me thank our more than 40,000 talented associates around the world who work relentlessly to serve clients and to deliver Fiserv at our best.With that Ivy, let's open the line for questions.[Operator Instructions] Our first question in queue is Brett Huff from Stephens. Your line is open. -- Just quick questions on, as we look and kind of enumerate, and, Frank, you talked a little bit about this, as you think about the various categories of revenue synergies, you mentioned network synergies, card issuing, things like that. Would you order the priority of those for us and now that you've kind of been at this for six months or so, and give us a little bit more color on each of those buckets? -- Well, bank merchant and the merchant opportunity we would put at the highest level. And you see that performing and how we're signing it up. And when Jeff and I thought about this, we always thought that we would have a strategic advantage with the Clover platform, and that'll create a privileged position in core processing, account processing, and along with our deep bank relationships.Second, the bringing together of the used two networks is a very, very unique opportunity that takes us -- we were already, in some cases, number three when you put it together, we're a powerful number three. But we have this merchant business is that affords our clients opportunity. So you're watching the client centricity of these opportunities that are good for our shareholders and good for our clients. And then the ability to take the privileged positions both companies had with the long list of assets, Output is a very strong product. We know that we can have CheckFree and our payments of Dovetail, all those are very strong opportunities and the cross-sell.And as Jeff talked about, the market reaction is every time we're together with the client, we get this very deep feeling of even more we can do for them. And we look forward to Investor Day talk in more deeply about that. -- Yeah. Brett, I would say, I think Frank is exactly right. The only other thing I would say is as we continue to have the privilege of spending more time together, we are identifying more and more unique opportunities. We currently have more than 80 different revenue synergy opportunities in play, and that list continues to grow.And so the beauty of this is not only do we see opportunities to deliver value, as we've talked about, whether it's in the bank merchants and network and Output, kind of, some of the nearer-in opportunities. But the ability to drive continuing value through the wonderful solutions and people that we have in the organization, we're increasingly bullish, and again, we'll spend more time on that in March. -- My quick follow-up is the longer -- the bigger picture, longer term idea of owning both the funding account and the merchant point-of-sale. That was I know one of the things on the list that intrigued you about the combination. Again, as you're six months into this, what is your view on that? Has it changed? Has it evolved at all? Gotten more concrete. -- And I would say that it continues to evolve. We believe that there is again kind of an even more increased privileged position where you can have access to the transactional account with all of the evolution that's happening in the payment space around real-time money movement. And we continue to see that as a very interesting future opportunity and that would be incremental to the kinds of opportunities that we see today. And so we continue to be very excited about that.Next, David Koning with Baird. Your line is open. -- I guess my first question. When we think of 6% to 8% growth, I mean that's very encouraging. And is it both segments, both Fiserv and First Data, accelerating? Like is Fiserv is going to be 5%-ish and First Data 7% to 9%. Is that kind of what we should be thinking of? -- Yeah. So, Dave, I would say that, as Bob talked about, we will be moving away from our traditional segment structure and we'll move to new segmentation, and we would expect each of those areas to continue to grow. I would say, if you went back to the old kind of the original structures, we would expect to see our payments -- our payment segment have incremental growth really driven by strength in our digital and mobile capabilities in Zelle, in network, some of those areas. So around card -- sorry, around card processing on balance. So we would expect that to grow.As we've talked about before, we would expect to see some level of improvement in the traditional financial segment. But as you know, that segment both produces good solid returns and margins on a stand-alone basis, but also does the double duty of being a hub for us to deliver future and integrated value through other solutions, whether it be bank merchant, card, or any of the other capabilities that we have. So a longer answer, but yes, we would expect to see acceleration in each of the different traditional segments on balance. -- And just a quick follow-up. Free cash flow incredibly strong, over 112% I think is what you said you're guiding to. And I know that include a little bit of NOL. Is there a way to think of what that is without the NOL maybe on a longer-term basis? Is it still like 105% or something like that? -- I would say -- and Bob will certainly add in here, there is no reason to believe that our free cash flow performance will be below what it had been historically. -- Okay. Okay. -- Which is in that range. -- Yeah, absolutely right way to look at it. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, Dave, we've got the NOL benefit repeating, reoccurring in 2020, and have expectation of at least 112% long-standing above 100% for the company going back many, many years. Expect to see that going forward. -- Yeah, I would say, Dave, the only other caveat to keep in mind, and it's not an annual caveat, but it's a quarterly caveat in that depending on the days that the quarter's end and everything else, you could have some merchant settlement moving up and down. So you'll have a little bit more of that between quarters. But on an annual basis, we are absolutely committed to running free cash ahead of normal earnings.Next we have Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. -- I just want to start off, the Q4 results, if you normalize for the periodic revenues you talked about, I guess what would you -- what kind of impact that had on the quarter's internal growth of 5%? And then just thinking about the outlook, the 6% to 8% range. I mean, what would go right for the top end of that? What do you expect to be -- are you just being conservative for the 6% part of? Just a little bit more color would be great. -- Sure. So if you think about the -- it's hard to talk about it in terms of the entire business because obviously a fair amount of the periodic revenue comes out of the traditional or the original Fiserv business. But in the original Fiserv business, it's kind of a little bit more than a point of revenue growth. We gave up because of the periodic revenue. And we also have had a drag most of the year in our biller solutions business where we had a large client grow over from the prior year.And so those kinds of negatives are running through -- certainly running through Q4 and did have an impact. Again, consistent with what we laid out in Q3, but on an absolute basis, that would have been the case. Going into 2020, we feel really good about where we sit. We had 15% sales growth in Q4. We had 15% sales growth in Q3. And one of the great things about that is we were worried what might happen when the market frees up and what we saw is very strong growth. And so that 30% growth in the last six months of the year, we'll start to see some of that roll in. And one of the levers that could move us up on the continuum is faster implementations, faster growth of those clients. As you know, almost all of our clients end up ramping up.I think the other thing would be, do we see higher levels of performance outside the US than we're planning for today. I think that could move us up on the continuum. And I think the last thing would be faster realization of revenue synergies. And so as Frank talked about, whether it's bank merchant, network, output, those kinds of areas could all conspire to have higher growth, kind of move us up to the top end. But nothing has changed from where we sat at Q3. We think this range is prudent, but our perspective, this is still the same as it was in Q3. -- Just one quick follow-up. The 40% growth in Clover, I mean, that continues to be extremely strong. And is that still just the organic trend of follow through from what First Data has already built or are you starting to see some benefit from cross-selling through the Fiserv banks or any other cross-sell on that front. -- I would say that there has been exactly no impact on the Clover GPV growth. In fact, each of the quarters for the year Clover grew above 40%, really stellar performance, and annualized run rate in excess of $100 billion. So we feel quite good about that. And while we're excited about the progress that we've made on bank merchant, there's really been no contribution yet. And really, I don't think we'll start to see any movement in contribution until the second half of next year. And even that will take time to ramp, as you've seen it up in Clover. Historically it was the great work that Frank and the team has done. But we do believe that's going to be a meaningful tailwind to growth over the next several years.Next we have David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. -- As you sit down with your bank and credit union CEOs to discuss 2020 spending priorities, first, what would you characterize as the top spending priorities for your bank and credit union clients? And how does your solution set match up against those.And then number two, how would you characterize the overall demand environment for 2020 in the core Fiserv financial sector based upon your conversations with the bank and credit union CEO. -- I would say that the priorities for financial institutions in the US are continuing as they were. I would say everything digital, whether it is on the consumer side, the small business side, the commercial side, that's really job one, continuing to make the institutions more efficient through straight-through processing, right, digital really requires a straight-through processing. We're seeing a lot of discussion around money movement. Frank made reference to the Dovetail Payments Hub as one of the interesting cross-sell opportunities that we have as a result of the combination. That's really illustrative of modernizing the back office. So we continue to see that as a important priority.And then third, I would say, it's all about cyber, making sure that banks are doing everything they can to solidify their position around safety and soundness, right, which is instrumental to the banking system. So I would say, those would be the top 3 priorities. We're also seeing some modernization going on behind the scenes around the infrastructure that's required to operate in a digital kind of a -- think about a digital real-time 24/7 world. But that is still secondary to the first three items that we talked about.So that trend continues. We think we are very well positioned in what we are doing today around digital. We've been talking about it for a while, whether it's around Mobiliti, our Architect solution, it's helping to reenergize the account processing, the core banking space, both in the bank and credit union side. We're making a lot of progress in our security solutions and some of our other solutions that are around safety and soundness. So again, good progress there. And third, payments have been a big deal for us. And so we continue to make progress overall.I would say that on balance the spend environment, if you would have asked me six months ago given where interest rates were moving, I would have thought that we would see a more muted spend environment. The spend environment has actually held up. I think part of it is we're getting used to a lower spread world, and banks realize they have to continue to spend. You, of course, are seeing discretionary spending being pulled from places that may not be in the top priorities, but on balance, we remain bullish going into 2020 on the spend front with that segment of the base, including the synergy work, bank merchant, and other areas, we are bullish and optimistic going into the year.Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays, your line is open. -- I wanted to ask about the competitive takeaways specifically on the merchant services cross-sell into the banks. How can you kind of characterize the sort of secret ingredient to picking off those relationships? Is it Clover? Is it more just focused sales attention? Is it bundling with other services? Like what's giving you the sort of torque in those negotiations in order to sort of pick customers? -- So I would say that we have for years talked about the importance of the core processing as a hub to a strategically privileged relationship. And so I would say, at the top of the house is that relationship that we have with clients. However, it's really been complemented beautifully by the technological innovation that Clover brings to the party and offers banks an opportunity to bring Apple-like innovation to their commercial clients, to their small businesses. So from that perspective, those two items have been very important.Thirdly, because of the privileged position we have, we've been driving deeper integration, integration into digital capability, integration into commercial cash management. And we're working on innovation into our Notifi alerting hub. We're working on innovation that's going to allow banks to have deeper relationships with these small businesses and commercial customers.So from that perspective, I would say that combination is what's allowed us to get off to such a good start, both as Frank talked about, in the de novo space as well as in the competitive space. So on balance, good. And we're also seeing -- I would have anticipated or I did anticipate that we would see smaller banks take the lead. And while they have, almost 20% of the conversions are institutions that are greater than $1 billion of assets. So from that perspective, we feel good about the place and the reaction from the market. -- And then in light of some of the recent divestiture activity, how would you describe the collection of assets that you have now under the combined companies? Is it sort of where you want it to be, or should we expect kind of a steady stream of incremental divestitures as we move forward? -- Yeah. Ramsey, we're still in the process of reviewing strategic fit and really making sure that we have the bandwidth to put effort into some of these businesses. So if you take the investment services business which was obviously the large divestiture we announced in the fourth quarter, we think that's a fantastic business. We think with the right leadership and the right capital that that is a wonderful business, which is why we kept 40% of the business. But we believed it needed additional management and the opportunity cost for us was too great given everything we have that Bob and Frank and I have been talking about.So from that perspective that was important. I would say that while you may see us do some trimming over time, we're not sitting here with a list of big divestitures that are coming. We're really looking and we like our portfolio a lot. I think we talked about it. We think we actually have the best solution set in the industry in terms of growth capability, but really most important around client centricity and the ability to move our clients forward with our solution.Jeff Cantwell from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open. -- Jeff, you just touched on this, but wanted to ask you on something about what you're seeing right now on the Fiserv side of the platform. And clearly, you seem to have made a number of moves over the past couple of years, which position Fiserv quite well to capture market share. And so I was just wondering if you could frame something for us. Where are you seeing the most significant change in client demand over time? Is it coming to you from smaller financial institutions, is it coming from mid-size FIs? Maybe it's coming from larger FIs. I was just curious if you can help us figure that out because we're just trying to figure out who's capturing share in each of the buckets. Looking at it like that. So would be great if you could give us your thoughts on where you think you're taking share. -- I would say that we are taking share on balance in the areas where we have market strength, and I use that descriptor because it's less about is it in the small-end of the base or in the large end of the base, and when I say the base, I mean the market, sorry. And instead, it's in places where we have solution strength that delivers value for clients. So if you are a small commerce merchant or a very large e-commerce merchant, and I think we indicated we signed roughly 80 new e-commerce logos during the year. Some of those are smaller and some of them are very important household names that we're all familiar with and so and so what we're seeing is more consistency around that decision making is being made in the market. So really looking for quality more than any segment will accept something that isn't quality. So from that perspective, whether it be a solution like the CheckFree RXP or Dovetail or our ISV solution or e-commerce solution or Clover you're seeing, you're seeing choices being made based on the quality of the solution.As it relates to kind of deeper into the segments, I would say I feel right now across the enterprise that we're doing well, gaining share in the places that matter to us strategically and that we're well positioned to continue to do that, especially as we bring things together. Probably the most important trend that we're seeing is if you think about the below the top 60 or 70 banks, you're just continuing to see more move toward outsourcing, right. We have fantastic capabilities as an outsourcer that got even better through our combination with First Data. And so we're seeing more and more capability.In fact, some of the more interesting opportunities that we have synergistically are in fact bringing things together with solutions that the original Fiserv had that we didn't offer on a hosted or ASP basis. -- And then I think you said in your prepared remarks that you're growing by 25% in integrated, if I heard that correctly, which certainly sounds strong. So could you talk to us a little bit more about that, maybe tell us what's driving that and also about the -- maybe a little bit about the go-forward picture for yourselves and integrated. I'm just curious as to whether there's any specific verticals, for example, where you're seeing the strongest momentum and how sustainable you feel that growth is overall. -- Sure. So, Jeff, let me quickly give you the data and then I think Frank can add a little bit more color on that. In the ISV and integrated payment space, I think we said, we increased the number of ISV merchants by 25% and transaction growth was -- sorry, revenue growth was up 60%, right. So, a very strong year in that space. We continue to make it a priority, kind of taking on the way First Data that Frank and his team had done. We see lots of opportunity to grow. But let me have Frank give a little bit more color on that. -- Yeah. In ISV, it's a very, as Jeff said in the earlier point, it's a very technical product. It is not a vertical attempt here. There is not a look at one single vertical. It's really across -- and it's really the technology solution. So I feel very comfortable that our solution plays in all spaces and we are winning across all spaces from car washes to retailers of different sizes and shapes. So it's not a vertical-specific capability.Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. -- I wanted to ask about the Fiserv stand-alone. I know Fiserv started the year guiding to 4.5% to 5% internal revenue growth, but there's been some moving pieces with divestitures and obviously acquisitions came in. So just hoping to get a report card on how Fiserv stand-alone did versus original expectations. -- Yeah. Thanks, Bryan. I would say that on balance, it was probably slightly lower than we would have anticipated at the beginning of the year. The comparables are a little bit more difficult because upon the combination, we made some changes that had an impact to some of the revenue recognition and therefore some of the growth. So we had some impact there, but I would say, on balance, slightly less than we would have expected.I would also say that when we closed in July, we've made a series of decisions around allocating resources to places that we didn't have in our sights originally. And so from our perspective, we thought it was most important to make sure that we were getting the integration right, that we are focused on laying the track for synergies, both on the cost and on the revenue side, and then third, just making sure that we're continuing to invest and have these capabilities ready to drive more growth this year, which we think they will. -- Got it, got it. Helpful. And then wanted to ask on the adjusted operating margin expansion of at least 250 basis points. How much of that is from the core companies versus the synergies? Is there a way to break that out? -- I will also tell you that embedded in that are investments that we are making that are required to drive revenue synergies that are kind of consuming some of the gains in margin. So that $300 million is not a net number of all of the investments we have to make up. But again, to get to your exact question, a large part of that would be coming from the synergies but we, as a normal entity, would continue to do the things that we would do to drive margin, if you think about our original Fiserv greater than 50 basis points per year. -- Right, right. And just to be clear, the $300 million in cost synergies, is that up from previous expectations? -- We have never guided in any year. We've said we expected to do $900 million over five years. And so we did $46 million -- I think we did $46 million in the first five months that we were a combined company. We've said in our prepared remarks, we'll do at least $300 million this year, and after 17 months we'll be roughly at least $346 million.Jason Kupferberg, your line is open, with Bank of America. -- Just wanted to follow up on I think it was Darrin's question earlier, just on the outlook for the 2020 organic. I think last quarter you had said at least 7%. Now we're refining it maybe around the edges a little bit and I guess 6% is in the equation here. Just any particular reason why 6% is part of the guidance? Because it kind of sounds like you're thinking at the high end, the 8%, is a lot more likely than the low-end at 6, but just wanted to understand the nuance there in terms of how the commentary evolved incrementally from last quarter. -- I would say, and we've tried to make this point clear in the prepared remarks that nothing has changed from our preliminary view that we gave in Q3. We continue to be confident in the numbers that we provided, we do believe it's prudent to have a range that is that encompasses kind of 2 percentage points and therefore we thought 6% to 8% made sense. The center point is not accidentally 7%. And so we feel good about where we are. And 7% is a very healthy gain over where we ended this year, and we feel like we -- if we execute well, and we believe we will, that we will not only increase our internal revenue growth rate this year. But we will be well positioned jumping off into 2021 given our commentary about how synergies will lay in and stronger performance in the second half of the year. -- Okay. No, that's very helpful. Just a quick follow-up. Digital distribution initiatives for Clover, any metrics you might be able to share there in terms of the percent of new activations that are may be coming through digital channels now versus through physical bank branches, how that mix is kind of evolving? I know that was a big focus for First Data heading into the merger? -- Yeah, I would say we still are very bullish on digital distribution as an opportunity for us and we actually think that opportunity grew in the combination of Fiserv and First Data because of the fact that we now have not only more digital distribution points through the cash management and retail digital capabilities of the banks and credit unions that we will sign up and the ability to be more targeted on the data that we would use.So we continue to believe that all makes sense. However, I would say that as we sit here today, the results of digital are quite low, probably immeasurable relative to the successes that we have had in other parts of the business. And so we will continue to grow that, and the results at least for the next couple of years are not contingent on us dramatically increasing digital distribution. We see that to be a journey. We're early in the journey, and we'll continue to work it and knock it down.Andrew Jeffrey from Suntrust, your line is open. -- Jeff, a lot of good stuff in terms of where you're investing in and where you think the sweet spot is and I just wondered if I could get your perspective on sort of the competitive environment. There are a few things I think that have emerged of late. Temenos launched a new solution for neobank, a SaaS-based solution. We saw the Worldline-Ingenico deal yesterday. We saw BigCommerce tap Barclaycard for payments, also the rest of world developments for the most part, should, may be coming us domestic. I just wonder you kind of kicked off this consolidation trend and now it seems like there are some new entrants. Can you just frame up your strengths and investment priorities against the competitive backdrop? -- I'm not sure we can take credit for kicking off this entire trend, but I do think we can take credit... -- You were first, so. -- Well, thank you. But I do think we can take credit for understanding between Frank and me and the rest of our team that the world was changing and that we felt like getting on the train early would be good for us, good for our clients, and obviously good for our shareholders. And so, the things that are happening right now are generally consistent with what we would have expected in terms of the overall transformation.When we think about this transformation that's going on, we see some things happening around the fringes, we see people coming together to create more -- in some cases, more capacity to invest, in some cases more unique partnerships, all of that recognizing the change that's going on. And it's part of why we earmarked $500 million in incremental innovation to make sure that not only could we generate a significant amount of free cash flow so that we could allocate that to acquisitions and other inorganic uses of capital, but that we would be very focused on investing, while we are restructuring and reshaping the company for the future.So we actually take a fair amount of comfort in the things that are going on in the market, because they do confirm for us that the world is changing. And I think you will see us look for our inherent competitive advantages. So we think we have a treasure trove of data. And so whether it's around fraud or better authorization rates or better ability to know your customer, better ability to make decisions on the basis of transactional data, we think that's quite important, investing in and advancing our e-commerce capabilities, whether it is some of the voice that we talked about today, but really leveraging the unique strengths that we have because we have the ability to take advantage of the platforms that we're operating today and making them better. So whether it is moving to the cloud or using AI and RPA as ways to get there faster, we have all of that capability. We're quite excited to do it. And I think we'll be able to share some of that in March, but I do think we're going to continue to see announcements that talk to the fact that the world is changing, and it's incumbent upon us to make sure we're staying in front of that change, but really focused on the areas where we have strong competitive positions, and that will make us stronger.George Mihalos from Cowen, your line is open. -- Just had a follow-up question as it relates to the ISV channel and all the progress you're making there. Appreciate the commentary on the revenue growth being up I think 60% you said. But can you actually size that business for us in terms of revenue dollars? I think the last time that First Data did that was back in 2018 when I think it was around $50 million or so. -- Yeah, I would say, George, that compared to the $14.5 billion or so of revenue that we have, it's certainly a small -- it's certainly on a relatively small base. But that relatively small base is growing quite comfortably, and we're excited about that. And we're also excited about using some of the differentiated -- sorry, the competitively differentiated services that they have across other parts of the ecosystem. So it's, again, a relatively small base but growing in a very, very nice clip. -- And as you know, the space on balance, relative to merchant acquiring globally, is still quite small. -- Yeah. Appreciate that. And then just a quick follow-up, a housekeeping item for Bob. The nickel of dilution from the Investment Services' majority sale that is net of the $500 million being redeployed in buyback, right? -- Yes, that's correct. But more importantly, that's actually an aggregation of four divestitures in total. So Investm ent Services being part of that, but yes, the capital redeployment is included in that calculation.And Chris Shutler with William Blair, your line is open. -- Just one quick one. Really good sales numbers again. That 10% for the year, would you confirm that that is a annual contract value, not TCV? And if so, could you give us the comparable numbers for the last couple of years? I think you previously reported it on a TCV basis. -- Yeah. You're right, Chris. We have changed our methodology to align with how First Data had talked about and reported sales. And so -- but we have not talked about the quantum. We've always only talked about percent growth. But I would say that that percent growth is obviously up 10% for the year, but importantly, up 30% over the last six months.Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research, your line is open. -- Jeff, I wanted to just ask a little bit about First Data SMB portfolio, especially in the US. I know, Frank, in the past you've talked about attrition or retention rate of that portfolio. And I'm just wondering where it stands today and just your opportunity to maybe improve the yield in that portfolio. -- Yeah, as you probably remember the long journey that we took. But today, we're in a much different place than when we started on the journey. I think we talk about being a gainer of share and growing our portfolio here, and I think when you look at what attrition rates have done versus when we first started on it, they're practically in half. So we are a much different portfolio than when I talked to you years ago. And I think you see it in the growth in the merchant numbers that we have in total. -- And I think, Kartik, one of the things that's interesting when you dig in and look at the data is you -- not only is Clover really an attractive vehicle in the acquiring market, but the fact is that we see better retention. And the beauty there is it's a platform, right. So we have add-on services that we talk about, so better retention, more services, happier clients. So it really is both sides and it's one of the things that the First Data team -- the original First Data team had done quite well. -- And then just one last one, Jeff. Just as far as use of capital is concerned, I know you said you're going back to buying back shares. I'm wondering what your thoughts are on repaying debt in 2020 or maybe if you have a goal or something in mind for the debt for the company as we end this year. -- So, Kartik, I would say that we've been very consistent since the time we announced that we were going into this transformative combination that we would repay debt and grow EBITDA at a healthy clip to get our to debt-to-EBITDA ratio down to our historic levels. And I think we said we would do that over an 18- to 24-month period. We ended the year at 3.8 times, Bob paid down $600 million of debt in the fourth quarter. And so we'll continue to move down that path. The good news is, is we were able to move back to our programmatic buying at the very beginning of the fourth quarter. And so we think we have the firepower to do both and certainly we'll meet our commitments to the agencies.Next we have Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open. -- I think you mentioned that you've signed 80 new direct-to-merchant e-com wins for the year and 23 in the fourth quarter alone. This isn't a metric that First Data historically reported. So is this kind of growth a change from the historic win rates on direct-to-merchant e-com? And if so, I assume it is, what are you doing differently and do you -- are you executing against a specific strategy to diversify away from processing for payfacs and going more direct-to-merchant in that business? -- I would say that while we have not shared that metric previously, as you know well, we think it's important that people understand that not only do we have strength through our very important joint venture partners, but that on a direct basis, we are able to win business worldwide. And we think the fact that we won 80 logos for the year and this is 80 new logos to the firm, which I think is quite important, again, 24 in Q4, a range -- granted a range of size of merchants, but some very important names.So from that perspective, I would say it's a continuation of the strategy that Frank and his team started, but we have been putting more -- and what I mean me, I mean the collective company, just putting more focus and energy. A part of it is having a stronger technology platform, part of it is more focused on innovation, part of it is more sales focus, part of it is better service through existing clients. And so, it's the entire gamut that Frank and the team started. We're continuing to make it a high priority. As you and I've discussed, e-commerce and technology-based acquiring on balance is a very high priority for the company, just like SMB is and everything else, but obviously this space is important. And being a consistent share gainer is our absolute objective. -- And then maybe my quick follow-up. On the issuer processing businesses, realizing there is still sort of split in the current reporting across a couple different segments. Can you just provide a little bit of color on how the combined issuer processing businesses are doing? And specifically, combined revenue growth trajectory and how you're tracking so far on these synergies that you've been expecting across those two businesses as well, both domestically and internationally? -- So, Lisa, I would say that it probably will make more sense to cover this in-depth -- in a little bit more depth in March, but at a high level, we are not -- we have not combined our respective original issuer processing businesses. They run different platforms. They're different value propositions. We are looking to combined capabilities and move them more ubiquitously across platforms where it makes sense. We're looking to make sure that we have the right clients on the right platforms where it makes sense. And so we like the fact that we now, both sides of the original organizations, have more tools in the tool chest to go out and serve clients and win business.I would say that on the traditional, the original First Data issuer processing business, specifically on the credit side, we're seeing some really interesting opportunities in the market. It's one of the places that that you will see us invest kind of thinking about more as next-gen capabilities there. So very important specifically on the credit side. And also we're seeing a better-than-anticipated responsiveness in the Fiserv original clients both domestically and internationally in providing those kinds of capabilities, whether they be more integrated into the core systems in the US but outside the US sold into our larger Signature or other relationships. We're seeing that to be a little bit better than we would have expected at this point.And thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon. We appreciate your support. We're excited for the future.

Square can still expand its merchant and consumer businesses. But customer acquisition costs could skyrocket as the market becomes crowded.Square has its work cut out for it. Yet, the company could be an ideal bolt-on acquisition for a larger financial services company. Potential acquirers like Visa or Mastercard come to mind.

If businesses and customers pivot toward fintech startups in lieu of legacy payment processors, Visa can still win by owning Plaid. Visa could also leverage its ownership of Plaid  Plaid\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s existing clients.Square  to buy Plaid in 2018. Unfortunately, they couldn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t get their hands on this hot asset. Doing so would\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve given them in edge against both startup rivals, as well as legacy payment providers.SQ stock currently trades for  estimated 2019 earnings, and 71.5 times estimated 2020 earnings. In contrast, payment rivals PayPal trades for 38 times 2019 earnings, and 33.3 times 2020 earnings. Their other main rival, Fiserv, trades for 30 times 2019 earnings, and 23.6 times projected 2020 earnings. Square\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s faster growth rate does justify a valuation premium. But with risks growth could decelerate, paying 71.5 forward earnings doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t look like a smart move.Could Square grow into its valuation? It could. But even Square\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s high projected earnings growth of 23% implies it would take a while. In the meantime, investors may start giving Square a lower earnings multiple, sending shares to lower levels.So what\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s the solution? As InvestorPlace\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s Josh Enomoto recently wrote, the company\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s Square Capital lending business  long term.

On one hand, you have new startups that could outfox Square via innovation. On the other hand, deep-pocketed rivals to use scale to hamper Square\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s growth plans.That\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s not to say that Square will be muscled out of business. Yet, growth above expectations seems less likely. With this in mind, it seems SQ stock is more likely to come down valuation-wise than go higher thanks to expectation-exceeding growth.Square has much potential to further disrupt financial services. However, I do not believe the company\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s valuation premium to payment peers like PayPal is sustainable. If February\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s  indicates further growth deceleration, SQ stock could fall to a valuation closer to that of peers.Square\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s move to become a fintech \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cfinancial supermarket\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d further cements the argument that the company is not comparable to a SaaS name like Shopify. Square deserves a growth premium to PayPal, Visa and others, but not a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 71.5.So what\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s the call? Stay away from SQ stock. The company could surprise come February. But chances are Square shares tread water at best in the coming year.As of this writing, Thomas Niel did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Investors in Fiserv Inc (Symbol: FISV) saw new options begin trading this week, for the September 18th expiration.  One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 240 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the FISV options chain for the new September 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $120.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.20.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $120.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $112.80 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of FISV, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $122.24/share today.\n\nBecause the $120.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.00% return on the cash commitment, or 9.13% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Fiserv Inc, and highlighting in green where the $120.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $125.00 strike price has a current bid of $8.40.  If an investor was to purchase shares of FISV stock at the current price level of $122.24/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $125.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.13% if the stock gets called away at the September 18th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if FISV shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Fiserv Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing FISV's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $125.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $125.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 49%.

Over the past decade, fintech has reshaped the financial industry in a myriad of ways, and this year was no exception. In 2019, big tech companies continued to encroach on the financial industry's turf, traditional financial companies merged to form larger companies, emerging markets were exposed to more technological services than ever before to assist with financial tasks, and a wave of consolidation swept the payments industry.All of this led to the revelation of the ultimate winner -- you! The average consumer now has access to faster, superior, more secure financial services than ever before. Let's take a closer look at the most important takeaways for investors from the world of fintech over the past year.For investors, any conversation centered on fintech in 2019 has to begin with the massive wave of consolidation in the space, with three of the four  ever completed happening this year.The year's biggest acquisition -- and fintech's largest ever -- took place when   acquired Worldpay for $33.5 billion. This  combined one of the largest issuer processors, Fidelity National, with one of the largest merchant processors, Worldpay, a theme echoed with many of the year's other large deals, including '  $22.1 billion acquisition of Total System Services and 's  $21.8 billion deal with First Data. \u00a0While all three deals cited significant cost savings and revenue synergies that would result from the pairings, fear of disruption from newer entrants in the market was also expressed in the conference calls following the announcements of the deals.Fiserv CEO Jeffery Yabuki specifically called out\u00a0 ()\u00a0for causing fear within the banking industry, saying, \"I mean, a lot of banks, especially in the community spaces, are worried about companies like Square.\" FIS CEO Gary Norcross also noted the intense competition within the industry, saying, \"[T]here's a lot of innovation going on. There's a lot of modernization going on. Our clients need to continue to look to compete in this very aggressive market. You've got disruptors coming in\u00a0.\"One of the biggest fintech stories of the year, was  , in conjunction with \u00a0and , releasing its long-awaited . Many of the card's details were decidedly consumer-friendly, but hardly revolutionary, including features such as no annual, international, or late fees, weekly spending reports, and generous cashback rewards for those who use it within . The Apple Card even features a real-time interest calculator that shows cardholders how much interest they will pay based on their payment amount\u00a0.The biggest advances introduced with Apple's card, however, are its advanced security features. The card number is not displayed on the card, making it harder to steal. Rather, it is generated and locked away entirely on one's iPhone. Every purchase requires that number along with a one-time security code (similar to how  work), which can only be authorized by users' Face ID or Touch ID on their iPhone.The new Apple Card probably represents big tech's ultimate effort this year to lure consumers away from their traditional financial institution.In June,   announced Libra, its version of a cryptocurrency powered by blockchain technology. The program was backed by major e-commerce and payments platforms when it was first announced, though many have since backed out over , including , , Mastercard, , , Stripe, and .\u00a0The currency will be backed by a basket of fiat currencies from around the world, including U.S. treasuries, which will theoretically reduce volatility. While Facebook has rightfully not earned the benefit of doubt from the public, there is reason to believe the eventual creation of such a currency would benefit , many who are still un- and underbanked.Maybe the biggest stamp fintech had on 2019 was making investing more accessible than ever before as  at most major brokerages dropped to zero, allowing investors to buy and sell stocks for free. While fintech start-up  has existed as an app-only brokerage offering $0 trades for several years, Square began offering bitcoin trading and free stock trades on its popular  earlier this year.That's when the dominoes really began to fall.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $110.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $107.85 (before broker commissions).

Added convenience, new features, and shifting consumer preferences led to the fast rise of e-commerce and digital money management along with it. Many stocks in the industry turned in  as a result.Fintech could be just getting started, though, especially in developing markets around the globe where cash is still by far the preferred method of doing business and traditional banking services are scarce. With a new year and new decade now here, adding fintech stocks to the portfolio is a resolution worth considering.Even after big returns the last few years, fintech is still a fast-growing industry. According to various researchers, spending on fintech is expected to grow in the low 20% range each year through the next few years, topping $300 billion by 2023. Emerging economies in Asia and Latin America are expanding the fastest. That should bode well for companies like  and  that have a stranglehold on the market in China, and fast-growing outfits like and  in Latin America. However, that doesn't mean investors need to get too hung up on geographic positioning. Developing countries offer the highest growth, but fintech has momentum around the globe. E-commerce continues to be a leading driver of the movement, helping spur on digital payments expansion and other digital banking technology. \u00a0Thus, outside of regional fintech plays, payment processing companies ,  , and   are some of my favorite stocks and one of the easiest ways to play the fintech boom. Well established around the globe and benefiting from steady adoption of  and digital finance services, all three should continue to post more than respectable growth in 2020 and beyond.Image source: Getty Images.One drawback that may stop some investors from buying into fintech, though, is that valuations for many appear to be stretched. However, high growth always comes at a cost. Let's take digital payments leader Visa as an example. Trailing one-year and expected one-year forward price-to-earnings ratios are at 35.4 and 26.0, respectively. That's a steep premium over the current 25.2 and 19.6 trailing and forward P/E ratios for the  index. But, as a result of a , Visa was able to convert an 11% increase in revenue into an 18% adjusted earnings-per-share gain during its 2019 fiscal year. Those kinds of returns for Visa and its peers likely aren't over. Within the broader fintech universe, digital payment processing should increase in the mid-teens percentage range over the next five years -- according to tech researchers Mordor Intelligence and Grand View Research. Premium pricing should come as no surprise, then, for companies like Visa, Mastercard (forward P/E of 33.0), and PayPal (forward P/E of 31.1). Should double-digit expansion for the top and bottom lines continue, the current high price tags won't be an issue. In spite of torrid growth, fintech has seen rounds of consolidation recently. Point-of-sale providers like  and  in developed markets have  as growth has slowed. Operators of payment networks like Visa and Mastercard have been , adding cross-border money movement technology and security services to their portfolios.

Shares have climbed above the $60 price level, and closed yesterday at $67.42 a share. As SQ stock inches closer to the $70 price level, is now the time to buy?\tMaybe not. True, the company\u2019s Nov. 6 earning releasecame in better than expected. But with shares trading at a rich valuation and competitors stepping up their game, it\u2019s important to note that Square stock is rife with risks. However, with last summer\u2019s beat-down of the share price, upside is also a possibility.Let\u2019s take a closer look, and see why all bets are off with SQ stock.For the quarter ending Sept. 30, 2019, SQ sales were up 44% year-over-year, to $1.27 billion. But, this was only a slight boost from the prior quarter ($1.17 billion). Adjusted  came in at $131 million, up 85% from the prior year\u2019s quarter. Square reported adjusted revenue figures, but after an SEC comment letter, will . That adjusted revenue number consisted of revenue net of transaction and bitcoin expenses. The company used this figure to make it easier to compare results to peers.The company\u2019s Seller Ecosystem continues to grow, albeit at a slower clip. Sales were up 27% YoY. Square built its reputation by offering a seamless payment platform for small businesses. But now, other major payment players are looking to offer compelling alternatives to Square\u2019s Seller Ecosystem products. (NASDAQ:) . With increased competition, Square\u2019s sales and marketing costs are projected to . As a result, this competitive pressure could hurt margins, and make it tougher for Square stock to deliver prior rates of growth.But on the business-to-customer (B2C) side, SQ stock may have a catalyst in play. Square\u2019s growth driver this quarter was the Cash App platform. Cash App revenue grew 115% year-over-year, to $123 million. But Cash App also faces heavy competition from deep-pocketed peers.  (NASDAQ:) Venmo is Cash App\u2019s main competitor.  (NASDAQ:) recent launch of its Facebook Pay application could also impact Cash App\u2019s growth. whether Facebook Pay is a threat. RBC analyst Dan Perlin sees it as a negative for PayPal and Square stock. But MoffettNathanson analyst , seeing Facebook Pay as a facilitator of e-commerce, rather than a \u201c\u201d like Cash App.The jury\u2019s out whether the emerging competition will hinder SQ sales growth. Analysts project sales of $2.85 billion in 2020, up from $2.24 billion in 2019. That means approximately 27% growth for the coming year.High growth is required to justify the valuation of Square stock. Shares continue to trade at a substantial premium to peers. Square\u2019s forward non-GAAP price-to-earnings ratio (non-GAAP forward P/E ratio) is 86.1. In contrast, competitor PayPal has a forward non-GAAP P/E ratio of 34.1. Square\u2019s EV/EBITDA ratio is a staggering 360.7, compared to just 36.2 for PayPal.Looking at traditional payment processors, the valuation premium for Square stock is more substantial.  (NYSE:) trades at 29.2x forward non-GAAP earnings. Its EV/EBITDA ratio is 25.5.  (NYSE:) trades for 37.1x forward earnings, and has an EV/EBITDA ratio of 30.Even with challenges to its business, Square stock remains overvalued. While the company\u2019s growth somewhat justifies a high valuation, compared to peers the stock is irrationally priced.How long can SQ stock trade at such a premium? I see one of two things happening to the shares in the coming months. Either the company takes another dive on missed expectations and greater competition. Or shares remain stagnant, as the company attempts to \u201cgrow into its valuation\u201d.Either way, there\u2019s limited upside with SQ stock. But the company could surprise me. The success of Cash App shows Square can move from one success to another. Perhaps the company can innovate again, create another next-level financial service the moves the needle. Cash App is  into commission-free trading, startup  turf.It\u2019s tough to predict whether Square can parlay its payments processing success into becoming a fintech financial supermarket. But at the current valuation, I\u2019m not willing to take that risk. All bets are off where Square stock will trade in 2020.

If an investor was to purchase shares of FISV stock at the current price level of $116.30/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $120.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.50% if the stock gets called away at the February 2020 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if FISV shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Fiserv Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing FISV's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $120.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $120.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.32% boost of extra return to the investor, or 14.36% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 24%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 23%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $116.30) to be 23%.

Both the company and the owners of SQ stock have been benefiting from the disruptive shift from physical money to digital financial services and products.In 2019, the SQ share price is up about 15%. In the wake of the Q3 results, I believe that the owners of Square stock may have to reset their overly optimistic growth and share price expectations for the rest of the year. In the coming weeks, I\u2019d be a buyer of SQ stock below $60, especially if Square stock approaches or goes below $55. Here are the important fundamental and technical issues that are affecting SQ stock.Square\u2019s Q3 revenue and earnings came in above analysts\u2019 average outlook. However, the company lowered its full-year guidance.Its total revenue increased 44% year-over-year to $1.27 billion. Its earnings per share, excluding certain items,\u00a0 was 25 cents, beating the average forecast of 20 cents.The company\u2019s quarterly gross payment volume (GPV), or the total volume of payments the company processes, increased 25% YoY to $28.2 billion.Management noted that Square Terminal and Square Register, SQ\u2019s newest hardware solutions, are enabling the company to cater to larger businesses, helping drive up Square\u2019s GPV. When SQ reports its Q4 results, investors are likely to continue to pay attention to this number.The Q3 report once again confirmed that SQ stock is growing rapidly, thanks to its seller ecosystem and Square Cash, the company\u2019s consumer digital money transfer service.In general, growth stocks are far more volatile than market indices or mature companies. Whenever investors feel expectations for growth names need to be toned down, they sell the companies\u2019 stocks first and ask questions later.For fiscal year 2020, SQ\u2019s management expects low-30% YoY adjusted revenue and gross profit growth. That was viewed as\u00a0 disappointing by investors.Therefore, SQ stock is likely to be choppy in the next few days.By analyzing the price action of SQ stock, we can obtain a better view of what to expect from the shares in the coming weeks.SQ stock went on a big tear during the summer of 2018, baking in plenty of euphoria. As a result, the shares have been weak since reaching their all-time high of $99 in late September 2018. Yet, by late December 2018, SQ was hovering around $50.After a highly volatile first half of 2019, on Aug. 1 Square stock hit a recent high of $83.20.However, the rest of August was not a good month for Square stock. That was partly due to its weak Q3 guidance, which surprised investors. On Sep. 24, the shares hit a recent low of $54.41.On Nov. 6, prior to the release of its Q3 earnings, Square stock closed at $61.34. Now the shares are hovering around $65.From a technical\u00a0 perspective, I\u2019m not expecting Square stock to make another significant leg up any time soon. In the next few weeks, SQ stock is likely to be range-bound between $60 and $67.5.The next rally will occur only when long-term investors feel that\u00a0 the price of SQ stock is justified by its future growth expectations. Consequently, investors need to be careful about chasing Square stock at this point.Although the recent decline of SQ stock has made its valuation more attractive, the shares are still .While SQ already serves many small businesses, Wall Street  about whether it can maintain its growth. Especially if the  Square\u2019s growth may start to decelerate rather quickly.SQ\u2019s competition has also increased.

On the other hand, the forward P/E ratios of PYPL, V and FISV stocks are about , \u00a0.Similarly Square stock\u2019s current price-sales ratio is over Analysts prefer a low P/S multiple, ideally below 1x. However, a P/S number between 1x and 2x is more common. To put the metric into perspective, the  average price-sales .In short, investors are still paying a hefty premium to own SQ stock. Thus, I do not think there is much room for Square stock\u2019s valuation to head higher in Q4. Sooner or later, SQ stock\u2019s valuation and its revenue growth will be more balanced.Fintech is still developing rapidly in terms of total market capitalization as well as the products and services it offers. And the fintech app revolution is quickly changing the way traditional banks, credit-card issuers and mobile-payments companies work with businesses as well as with their retail customers.Therefore, over the long-term, I would not bet against SQ stock. The shares have generated solid long-term returns, especially for those who invested early in SQ. The company is likely to\u00a0 grow further as the fintech market matures.In the short-term, though, the owners of SQ stock shouldn\u2019t expect smooth sailing. I believe the markets are likely to be volatile in the rest of November. Like many momentum plays, Square stock will probably be a battleground between two camps: investors and traders.SQ stock has a . The stock market has a beta of 1.0. SQ stock\u2019s beta measures its volatility in relation to the market. In other words, SQ rises more than the market in bullish conditions and decreases more when markets are falling.Short-term traders should exercise caution if they want to participate in SQ stock\u2019s wide daily swings. The hype surrounding fintech stocks, including SQ, can easily cause them to rise quickly and become overvalued.It is likely that Square stock may fall toward $60 or even $55, At that point,\u00a0 I\u2019d expect SQ stock to start to stabilize and then trade sideways until its next earnings release, expected to occur in early February.In other words, I\u2019 wouldn\u2019t rush to buy Square stock yet. However, I\u2019d get ready to initiate a position in SQ as the price declines further towards $55.At the time of writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at , one standout is the iShares Russell Mid-Cap Growth ETF (Symbol: IWP) where we have detected an approximate $65.4 million dollar outflow -- that's a 0.6% decrease week over week (from 75,200,000 to 74,750,000).

The decade post-financial crisis will go down in the books as a bull market fraught with all sorts of uncertainty, but investors who stuck with it have been handsomely rewarded. Investors in  -- companies that specialize in digital payments and transaction processing -- have been some of the biggest beneficiaries. E-commerce has played a big role in the advance, as have emerging markets where hundreds of millions of under-banked consumers have flocked to digital payment platforms for money management solutions. With 2020 right around the corner, here are the top five best-performing war-on-cash stocks, and what it means for investors in the next decade.All data as of market close Dec. 3, 2019. Data source: YCharts. \u00a0Sitting atop the industry are Visa and Mastercard, both sporting massive gains that easily outpaced the 's total return (which includes reinvested dividends, as measured by ). The two firms were able to outpace the broader market in spite of their size as demand for their global payment and transaction processing networks surged higher. And the businesses are simple: When a transaction is processed on either network, a fee is charged. It's a  that these two card issuers pioneered and have mastered.Though neither company has ever been much of a dividend play -- Visa and Mastercard currently yield just 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively -- never underestimate the power of a rising payout. Visa grew its quarterly paycheck to shareholders by over 800% in the last decade, and Mastercard by nearly 2,000%. When reinvested, those cash infusions added dramatically to both stocks' total return. With the big two out of the way, let's move on to the less familiar. Fiserv put up impressive numbers in the last 10 years with its technology and payment processing systems for merchants and financial institutions. Acquisitions have been a big part of that strategy. In 2011, the company took over money movement and account aggregation outfit CashEdge for $465 million; ATM and debit card management company Elan Financial Services for $690 million in 2018; and a massive all-stock $22 billion merger with merchant point-of-sale provider . Acquisitions have been an important part of merchant point-of-sale provider Global Payments' growth as well. After several smaller takeovers in the years before it, Global acquired former rival Heartland Payment Systems for $4.3 billion in 2015. A , the big $21.5 billion merger with  came, helping the two payment processors save on operating costs and combine forces to drive sales growth. And finally there's Jack Henry & Associates, by far the smallest top performer here. The technology and computer systems provider for thousands of small banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions has benefited from the war on cash as consumers have steadily demanded more online access to their bank accounts and other financial services. Along the way, the firm has also made some deals, although nowhere near the scale as the megamergers and takeovers listed above. Although not a big dividend payer (currently a 1.1% annual yield), it has raised its cash cut to shareholders by over 360% in the last decade. When reinvested, the payday has raised the stock's total return by almost another 100%. Image source: Getty Images.Consolidation of digital payment processing and networks was a notable theme in the 2010s. Another big one worth mentioning was '  . Valued at $43 billion when including Worldpay's debt -- which itself was involved in a  back in 2017 -- FIS' deal is currently in the record books as the largest in financial technology history. FIS' stock is up \"only\" 484% over the last 10-year stretch. \u00a0It wasn't all mergers and acquisitions in the last 10 years, though. War-on-cash investors were treated to a few new stocks to choose from.  spun off  over the summer of 2015, and  had its IPO later that autumn. The two digital payment newcomers are both up triple digits since their debut, with PayPal sporting a nearly 200% gain and Square over 400%. Multiple e-commerce stores and tech giants have also gotten in on the action, launching payment processing\u00a0 systems and other digital pay options to help consumers and merchants.\u00a0Even after a decade of huge returns, the war on cash isn't likely to end anytime soon. E-commerce -- that between businesses and consumers as well as business-to-business sales -- is still growing by double digits. Consumers in emerging markets continue to skip the bank and make use of digital money movement systems. \u00a0is also in the mix. Combined, those trends are creating a powerful tailwind with digital payment processors and digital systems. Various research reports expect digital payment volume to grow in the mid-teens percentage range for the foreseeable future. The good news is that, after plenty of consolidation, there aren't that many war-on-cash stocks left. I recommend buying a little of each of the aforementioned stocks and letting them ride for the next 10 years -- if you have that kind of time to wait. The industry is still in flux, but all indications are that war-on-cash stocks have plenty of gas left in the tank.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In recent years, \u201cfintech\u201d has become one of the most popular buzzwords in the markets. Although it started as a payments company, Square has in recent quarters introduced a range of software, hardware and apps to service small businesses and individual clients.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\tIn 2019, SQ stock is up about 14%, but lately has taken . Square shareholders are now wondering if they should consider buying the stock prior to the earnings release.I do not think long-term investors should rush to buy into the shares just yet. When SQ stock reports earnings in a few weeks, Wall Street will be able to better gauge the financial health of the company. Here is why:On Aug. 1, the payment-solutions company  that were better-than-expected. Its total net revenue increased 44% year-over-year to . And on an adjusted basis, earnings were 21 cents per share, beating Wall Street\u2019s expectation of 17 cents per share.Its payments processing business, also referred to as \u201cpayments as a service,\u201d has been a game changer in serving small businesses. Square\u2019s subscription and services-based revenue increased 87% to $251 million. Primary drivers behind the growth include the Cash App, Square Capital, and Instant Deposit. Cash App\u2019s quarterly revenue of $135 million especially impressed the Street.Gross payment volume (GPV) of $26.8 billion increased from $21.4 billion year-over-year. Square\u00a0\u00a0as the\u00a0total dollar amount\u00a0of\u00a0all card payments processed\u00a0by\u00a0sellers using Square,\u00a0net\u00a0of\u00a0refunds.The quarterly report once again confirmed that SQ stock is a high-growth equity. Such shares in general are far more volatile than market indices or mature companies. Whenever investors feel growth expectations need to be toned down, they sell the stock first and ask questions later.Investors were especially concerned by the company\u2019s lower-than-expected Q3 guidance. Its Q3 adjusted-EPS guidance of 18 cents to 20 cents trailed the average estimate of 22 cents. Square management now expects Q3 adjusted revenue to be between $590 million and $600 million as opposed to the consensus of $599 million.Square stock\u2019s losses on the bottom line are also projected to be higher than expected. And many shareholders have likely felt that for the rest of the year, SQ stock may face a rising tide.According to a recent  paper by Juan Cortina and Sergio Schmukler, \u201c\u2026 the trend toward digitalization and technological innovation will likely reshape the global financial sector and the ways in which financial companies interact with their customers.\u201dSquare\u2019s rather sticky ecosystem combines software with hardware to especially enable sellers to turn their mobile devices into point-of-sale (POS) solutions. Through various growth initiatives, management is now aiming to make the company a major player in the \u00a0sphere.The global payments industry is a\u00a0. Such a big industry inevitably attracts both domestic and global competition. SQ stock faces competition from many companies, including the global online payments group \u00a0(NASDAQ:), transaction processing leader\u00a0(NYSE:) and\u00a0\u00a0(NASDAQ:), which is shaping up to become a\u00a0 as well.A growth stock like Square trades on forward sales as well as the momentum provided by future expectations. While Square currently enjoys a head start in serving small businesses, Wall Street\u00a0 as to whether the group can maintain growth quarter after quarter. If the U.S. economy slows, Square\u2019s growth may start to decelerate rather quickly. Therefore, throughout the year, the SQ stock price has been extremely volatile.Furthermore, Square is not yet profitable. Its net loss was $7 million in Q2, compared to a net loss of $6 million in the year-ago quarter. The company has reported net losses in five of the last six quarters.Efforts to attain profitability are taking time. Moreover, not every area Square expands into will necessarily produce easy profits. And unless it\u00a0, Wall Street may take down the high valuation of SQ stock.Following the initial public offering of Square stock in late 2015, its price surged from $9 to an all-time high of $101.15 in October 2018. Yet over the past year, SQ stockholders have noticed a decline in the growth rate of its gross payment volume. Between July 2017 and the end of June 2018, GPV grew about 30%. Now growth hovers around 25%. Wall Street tracks this metric widely.As growth has declined, so has the share price. Now the shares are hovering around $64. Although the decline in Square\u2019s stock has improved its valuation, the shares are still .Most SQ stock holders are well aware that the shares do not trade at bargain-bin valuation ratios, especially compared to its competitors. For example, SQ\u2019s forward price-to-earnings ratio is over\u00a0. On the other hand, forward P/E ratios for PYPL, V and FISV stocks are about , \u00a0and\u00a0\u00a0respectively.Similarly Square stock\u2019s current price-to-sales ratio is over\u00a0. Companies generate revenue from the sale of goods and services. Analysts prefer a low P/S multiple, ideally below 1x. However, a P/S number between 1x and 2x is more common. To put the metric into perspective,\u00a0\u00a0average price-to-sales\u00a0.In short, I do not think there is much room for Square stock\u2019s valuation to head higher in the final quarter of the year. Sooner or later, SQ stock\u2019s valuation and revenue growth will be more in balance.Let us briefly remember how the Square stock price has acted over the past year.SQ stock went on a big tear during the summer of 2018, baking in plenty of euphoria. However, it had a rough patch after reaching the all-time high in October. By late-December 2018, SQ was hovering around $50.In 2019, although SQ stock is up about 15%, August has seen the start of a downtrend in the stock. That\u2019s of course due to the weak Q3 guidance.Before this, shares had been up over 45% for the year ahead of the Q2 quarterly results release. On earnings day, Square stock closed at $80.98. The next morning, SQ shares gapped down to open at $70.80. By Sept. 24, the stock saw a low of $54.41.From a technical perspective, I\u2019m not expecting Square stock to make another significant leg up prior to the earnings report. In the next few weeks, shares are likely to be range-bound between $60 and $65, a range where SQ stock has strong support. However, if any negative headlines flash that affect the technology or fintech sectors, then shares may easily go below $60.Square stock will need to stabilize and build a base again before a long-term sustained leg up can occur. Consequently, investors need to be careful about chasing shares at this point, especially prior to the earnings report.The so-called fintech revolution is changing the way traditional banks, credit card issuers and mobile-payments companies work with businesses as well as retail customers. Square is providing merchants with a wide range of tools and services to start, run, and grow their businesses.Therefore, over the long term, I would not bet against Square stock. In the short-term, though, stakeholders shouldn\u2019t expect smooth sailing.Square is a high beta stock at . The stock market has a beta of 1. SQ stock\u2019s beta measures its volatility in relation to the market. In other words, Square stock rises more than the market in bullish conditions and decreases more when markets are falling. Short-term traders should exercise caution if they want to participate in SQ stock\u2019s wide daily swings.The upside momentum can build up only when long-term investors feel that the SQ stock price justifies the future growth expectations. Thus Wall Street would want to see the next quarterly results to judge whether the current investor skepticism is warranted.Analysts are likely to pay special attention to metrics that would indicate Square stock\u2019s potential to continue growing sales and earnings over the next several quarters. I personally would not take sides as to whether the share price will go up or down when the group reports earnings soon.Investors with a 2-3 year time horizon may consider any further price decline in Square shares as a good buying opportunity.At the time of writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["nvestors in Fiserv Inc (Symbol: FISV) saw new options begin trading this week, for the June 2020 expiration.  One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 241 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the FISV options chain for the new June 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $100.00 strike price has a current bid of $6.70.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $100.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $93.30 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of FISV, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $103.70/share today.\n\nBecause the $100.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 63%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.70% return on the cash commitment, or 10.15% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Fiserv Inc, and highlighting in green where the $100.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $105.00 strike price has a current bid of $8.80.  If an investor was to purchase shares of FISV stock at the current price level of $103.70/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $105.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.74% if the stock gets called away at the June 2020 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if FISV shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Fiserv Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing FISV's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $105.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $105.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 46%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 8.49% boost of extra return to the investor, or 12.85% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 29%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 27%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $103.70) to be 25%.

For additional historical combined financial information, please refer to the Form 8-K which we filed on October 3rd.Finally, please mark your calendar for our Investor Day to be held on March 25th in New York City. We look forward to seeing you for this important event .And now, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. -- Thanks, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased to be with you today as we share our first quarter of combined results, along with our insights and enthusiasm for the future of your company. Financial performance is off to an excellent start following the July 29th close of the First Data transaction, led by strong internal revenue growth, expanding adjusted operating margin and growing free cash flow. Synergy work is progressing well and sales momentum continues to be strong. This performance contributed to increasing our internal revenue growth guidance to 6% for the year and adjusted EPS growth of 16% to 17%, setting us up for an even better 2020.Although we are a larger more dynamic enterprise, we remain fully committed to delivering upon the key tenants of shareholder value that have underpinned our performance for more than a dozen years, high quality revenue growth, operating margin expansion, strong free cash flow and disciplined capital allocation are alive and well in new Fiserv.Along those lines, we reinitiated our share repurchase program late in the third quarter under a 10b-5 plan. We are confident in our ability to both meet our debt repayment commitments and repurchase shares. The integration of First Data is top of mind as we focus on building a great company. Yesterday was day 100 of this transformational merger, and we're really excited about the road ahead. Energy is high, teams are coming together and our integration activities are progressing well. Creating success for our clients is number one on our integration agenda and foundational to the promise of this combination.As I mentioned upfront, we're off to a great start financially with internal revenue growth in the quarter up more than 6%, led by a very strong 10% in our GBS merchant business and adjusted earnings per share was up 17% to $1.02. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was up 130 basis points to 29.8% and free cash flow was more than $800 million. For the year-to-date, Internal revenue growth was also 6% with GBS up again 10% for the period. Adjusted earnings per share was up 16% to $2.87 and adjusted operating margin was up 100 basis points to 29.1%.Free cash flow through September 30th was 13% -- was up 13% to just over $2.3 billion, and free cash flow conversion was excellent at 116%. We continue to be intensely focused on growing high-quality free cash flow and allocating that capital in a way that optimizes value creation on both an overall and on a per share basis.Now before I turn the call to Frank to update you on integration and synergy progress, let me share a few proof points on how the combination extends and enriches our strategic position.Account processing is a critically important business, which also provides a strategic hub to further distribute high-quality solutions in a cost effective manner, such as our new offerings around merchant services. Along those lines, we were pleased to sign another 14 core account processing clients in the quarter, including six on DNA and assigned 41 clients year-to-date. We will continue to invest in enabling our account processing clients to serve their customers in a real-time digitally focused world.Unlocking client value and expanding growth across our market-leading merchant acquiring business is one of our highest priorities. Our cloud-based point-of-sale platform Clover crossed the $100 billion threshold in annualized payment volume in the quarter, a more than 40% gain over last year. Add-on Clover services are growing rapidly and payment devices shipped is up 25% through September 30th.We're also seeing significant growth opportunities across our e-commerce merchant business, which on top of strong sales grew transactions more than 30% in both the quarter and year-to-date. Additionally, our integrated payments ISV Partners expanded by more than 20% in the quarter. We're incredibly optimistic about the future growth potential in these digitally centric merchant businesses.A key strategic focus is to extend our position as the largest merchant acquirer in the world. The combination of a highly advantaged bank merchant opportunity, rapidly accelerating growth in digital commerce, global distribution and the continued strength of our Clover platform positions us to further expand market share in this important space.The market continues to embrace payments innovation as the new norm. We believe our scale with more than one billion payment cards in force, a leadership positions in areas such as card network, electronic bill payment, ACH and Zelle combined to create meaningful growth today and optionality for tomorrow.Last, we have a significant opportunity to meaningfully participate in global franchise growth. Whether looking at cash to card payments in India, gaining acceptance share in Brazil and Argentina or enabling more e-commerce in Europe, we are more holistically participating in the long tail of global growth.As a complement, we've identified a series of meaningful revenue synergy opportunities outside the US, further leveraging the solution breadth and processing scale of the combined company.With that let me turn the call over to Frank. -- Thanks, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone. It's great to be here as part of the new Fiserv. As we mentioned earlier, we are only 100 days into this transformational merger of two great companies, and I am even more energized today as we dive into the business and see the wide range of opportunities ahead.Let me first start by stating that the power of this new company has far greater reach than I imagine when we decided to put it together. That conclusion is derived from the many senior level client meetings we've had, and how well the value proposition comes together in the client's office. We've established business units led by exceptional management teams comprised of leaders from both companies. As you can imagine, Jeff and I carefully considered each of the leadership positions across our businesses and put together the team, which we believe will drive great results around the world.As you may know, I, along with the senior members of our team, have had the firsthand opportunity to work on some of the more transformational mergers in the financial services industry, and we're utilizing those experiences to help ensure we execute extraordinarily well. The team's engagement model and partnership is at the very highest level I've ever seen and with a clear determination to build a great global company for the long-term benefit of clients, associates and shareholders.When two large and complex companies come together it's essentially associates. The lifeblood of the company is highly engaged on two fronts: the business-as-usual operation of the company and successful execution of the full set of integration activities. We are thrilled at how well the people of both companies have come together to focus on what matters. We are pleased with our progress on revenue synergies and have confidence that we will at a minimum meet the $500 million target, including nearly $100 million of synergy revenue next year.Currently, we have 78 work streams in process across the company, focused on delivering additional client value. In addition to near term value, we're also thinking about how the payments industry may evolve over the longer-term, and how we, as an industry leader, can use a unique combination of assets to drive sustainable, profitable growth beyond the synergy work to-date.As we mentioned, one of the most important revenue synergies is to better serve the account processing client base of the original Fiserv through distributing high-quality merchant-acquiring solutions. Enabling technologies such as Clover to be distributed digitally and through the physical branch network of original Fiserv clients is a significant opportunity, which is literally being validated daily.We have already signed more than 20 core account processing clients with about half being competitive takeaways. Of the competitive wins, five had assets ranging from $1 billion to $6 billion, and there are more than 200 financial institutions in the pipeline, enabling clients to enhance the relationship with their most important clients while delivering much-needed fee revenue is resonating as a very compelling value proposition. Based on the market reaction, we now expect to exceed the $200 million revenue synergy opportunity we originally identified for this initiative.We're also making excellent progress on our network routing and card issuing revenue opportunities, which is extending existing card and network relationships, along with identifying ways to create incremental market differentiation. The combination of Star and Accel further enhances our position as the third largest network in the US with important issuer and merchant clients. In addition, with more than 1 billion active credit and debit cards globally, we have an opportunity to innovate in new and unique ways.We have identified a meaningful number of revenue synergies outside the US, which go beyond original revenue thesis. In addition to delivering merchant and issuing services globally, we're seeing momentum in areas such as payments modernization, core banking, digital solutions and risk with important emphasis in providing hosted solution throughout scaled infrastructure throughout the world.We have also identified numerous opportunities to provide additional solutions to clients, in which one or both of the original firms has an influential relationship. As I mentioned, we've had the pleasure to meet with a number of clients and in each meeting, there has been substantial discussion about how Fiserv can deliver additional value as a result of the combination.We have completed an in-depth white space opportunity analysis for our largest clients and are very optimistic about what the future holds for delivering incremental client value and revenue growth.Moving to cost synergies. We are making excellent progress against our objective of at least $900 million over the first five years, which as you know does not include interest savings. Like revenue, our internal objective is to surpass that goal in terms of both dollars and time to achieve.Our initial focus has been to identify duplicate costs across the company with an emphasis on our corporate and technology functions. We're off to a great start with high visibility and action plans in place to achieve our objectives. Our goal is to streamline our overall cost structure, while delivering more compelling and even higher quality solutions to our clients.We are also leveraging the global product development captive Fiserv built to extend the productivity of our resources while reducing overall cost. One of the larger cost synergy opportunities is design efficiency and effectiveness across our more than $4 billion of annual vendor spend. We are methodically meeting with our suppliers and engaging in productive conversations which we believe will contribute meaningfully to our cost synergy objectives.We have created a strong focus in governance structure to ensure we achieve our synergy objectives. We have actioned over $200 million of annualized saves against our $900 million cost target. Importantly, we expect that level to grow every week increasing the probability of outperformance over the period.As you've have heard, we are highly confident in achieving our synergy targets and have additional focus on overachieving in terms of quantum and diamond. We will supply a full update including any increases to our targets at our March Investor Day.We also are evaluating the best way to deploy the incremental $500 million innovation investment pool to create market differentiation and drive additional revenue growth beyond synergies. We are evaluating a variety of opportunities in areas such as digital commerce, card payments, risk and fraud solutions and network innovation. We will also share more on this important initiative with you in March.Let me also provide a quick update on our progress with BAMS joint venture. As we discussed on our July 30 call, we are working with the bank collaboratively through a well-defined contractual process to dissolve the JV in June 2020, and ensure we deliver great service to our shared clients. We continue to believe that Fiserv's results will be accretive over the next few years as we leverage the significant scale within the company.With that, let me turn the call over to Bob to provide detail on our financial results. -- Thank you, Frank, and good afternoon. Let me start by calling your attention to four items included in our reported results and reflected in the Form 8-K filed on October 3rd.First, internal revenue growth will be reported on a constant currency basis, consistent with the First Data methodology. For clarity, we have not made any FX adjustments to EBITDA, which is different than how FTC we had reported nor to operating income or adjusted EPS.Next, First Data previously added back stock-based compensation and reporting its adjusted earnings metrics. We now conform to our practice of including stock-based compensation in the adjusted income statement.Third, First Data had previously reported adjusted revenue for its joint ventures using proportional consolidation. Beginning with this quarter, results from minority-owned joint ventures will mirror GAAP and no longer be reflected in adjusted revenue and adjusted operating income.Our share of the net income from these JVs is reported as income from investments and unconsolidated affiliates. We will continue to report bands using proportional consolidation as we believe that approach best reflects how we will report the results of this business upon dissolution.Finally, we're reporting our adjusted results across four segments. First Data, which reflects First Data's historic business segments: Payments and Financial, which our original Fiserv's two business segments.And last, we combine both companies' corporate segments into a single item. We will report our results in this fashion for the remainder of the year and expect to roll out a new segment structure beginning in 2020. We feel great about our performance for both the quarter and the first nine months of the year and are well positioned to achieve strong full year financial performance.Adjusted revenue was up 5% to $3.6 billion in the quarter and 4% to $10.7 billion year-to-date. Internal revenue growth was a strong 6% in both the quarter and year-to-date driven by all three business segments delivering higher growth through September 30.As expected, revenue synergies were modest in the quarter and will accelerate over time. Overall, internal revenue growth performance through September 30th is slightly ahead of our expectations for the year. Adjusted operating income increased 10% to $1.1 billion in the quarter and is up 8% to $3.1 billion through the first 9 months of the year.Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 29.8%, up 130 basis points versus the prior year. As you know, we had expected stronger margin performance in the second half of the year in the original Fiserv business as we lap much of the prior-year tax reinvestments. Operating margin also benefited by increased revenue growth and some limited benefit from cost synergies, partially offset by the Elan acquisition.Year-to-date, adjusted operating margin was up 100 basis points to 29.1% with each of the segments showing increases. Given the July 29 close actual synergy benefits realized in the quarter were modest. Revenue synergy action plans are on track to achieve our year one target of nearly $100 million and we've already actioned annualized run rate cost synergies of more than $200 million. We are highly confident that we will meet or exceed both the revenue and cost synergy targets.Now keep in mind that interest savings are not included in the $900 million cost synergy target. The total of target cost synergies and the expected interest savings is in excess of $1.1 billion annually. Adjusted earnings per share was up 17% to $1.02 in the quarter and increased 16% to $2.87 year-to-date. These results included a negative impact from foreign currency of $0.02 and $0.08 per share for the third quarter and year-to-date respectively.Overall, we are very well positioned to achieve our 34th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. In the First Data segment, adjusted revenue was up 3% to $2.2 billion for the quarter and up 2% through September 30th to $6.4 billion. These results for both periods include headwinds from last year's Q3 divestitures. Segment internal revenue growth was a strong 7% in both the quarter and year-to-date and is up more than 100 basis points compared to last year.This performance included excellent results in the former GBS segment recording 10% growth for both the quarter and year-to-date. These results also include 7% growth in the quarter for GBS North America and 6% growth for the year-to-date. The primary drivers of our strong growth are digital commerce, ISV Solutions, Clover and global merchant acquiring. For example, ISV revenues have grown more than 60% year-to-date and we've added more than 18,000 new ISV merchants.Overall, contracted merchant locations globally, both digital and physical, have expanded low-double digits this year. In card issuer processing, we are seeing solid trends in global credit card accounts on file, which grew mid-single digits in the quarter. This growth was driven primarily by the on boarding of new clients and growth in existing portfolios. FTC had previously treated plastics resell revenue as a pass-through item. Given that original Fiserv provides plastics production, this is now included as adjusted revenue. This reporting change created a headwind in Q3 and becomes a bit more pronounced in the fourth quarter.International growth continues to be a bright spot, delivering high teens internal revenue growth in the quarter and year-to-date and growth has come from a combination of new issuing and merchant business with strong payment macros in places such as Brazil and India. The First Data segment adjusted operating income increased 5% to $667 million in the quarter and is up 4% to $1.9 billion through the first nine months of the year.Adjusted operating margin in the segment was up 20 basis points to 30.7% in the quarter, driven primarily by strong revenue growth and cost containment offset by pressure from foreign currency. Year-to-date, adjusted operating margin was up 50 basis points to 30.3%. As we enter 2020, we don't plan to separately report the former First Data segment or sub-segment growth rates. As we provide new segments, we'll supply the key financial and business metrics, which we believe best align with our strategic plans and expected financial results.Moving to the Payments segment, which is original Fiserv only, adjusted revenue was up 11% in both the quarter and year-to-date to $861 million and $2.5 billion respectively, including the benefit of the Elan acquisition. Internal revenue growth was 6% in the quarter, up more than 100 basis points sequentially and a 5% year-to-date, led primarily by strong performance in our card services, electronic payments and output solutions businesses.Adjusted operating income for the Payments segment grew 16% to $309 million in the quarter and 11% to $899 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 35.9%, up 150 basis points over the prior year and adjusted operating margin for the first nine months was up 10 basis points to 35.3%. Results in the quarter and year-to-date benefited from additional revenue growth and the reduction of last year's tax funded investments, partially offset by the impact of the Elan acquisition, which anniversaried on October 31st.Debit transactions grew high single digits in both the quarter and year-to-date. Mobiliti ASP subscribers grew 14% in the quarter to 9 million and Mobiliti business clients increased 18% as the US continues to embrace digital banking services. P2P transactions, which includes both Popmoney and Zelle continue to show strong results doubling versus Q3 last year and up 15% sequentially. Zelle transactions alone nearly tripled in the quarter, buoyed by the number of live clients nearly doubling sequentially. We signed 130 Zelle clients in the quarter, more than the first two quarters of the year combined and almost 3 times the number signed in Q3 last year.For the Financial segment, adjusted revenue was up 4% to $596 million for the quarter and up 1% to $1.8 billion year-to-date, including the lending transaction, which anniversaried at the end of Q1. Internal revenue growth in this segment was 4% in the third quarter, up more than 100 basis points sequentially, and as 4% year-to-date led by our account and item processing businesses.Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment grew 5% to $196 million in the quarter and is up 1% to $598 million through the first nine months of the year. Adjusted operating margin in the segment was up 20 basis points in the quarter to 32.9% and up 10 basis points year-to-date to 33.3%. The results in the quarter and year-to-date are stronger than they appear, given a reduction in periodic revenue, which has been more than offset by the benefit of high-quality recurring revenue growth and operational efficiency.The adjusted corporate operating loss, which includes the combined corporate expenses of both original businesses, was $93 million for the quarter and $314 million year-to-date.Now we expect the fourth quarter corporate expenses to be generally consistent with that of Q3. The adjusted effective tax rate was 22.2% for the quarter, and is 20.8% for the first nine months of the year. And we expect our fourth quarter tax rate to be 24% and our full year adjusted tax rate to be about 22%. You may recall First Data has a meaningful tax NOL, which should create a -- continue to create a lower cash tax rate for the next several quarters. Free cash flow was strong in the quarter and is up 13% to $2.3 billion year-to-date with free cash flow conversion of 116%.As a result of our normal portfolio management process, we reached agreement to divest two small product lines for $133 million in the quarter. These businesses represent about $8 million of revenue per quarter and both closed in October. We issued 286 million shares on July 29th to complete the First Data transaction. And in late September, we began repurchasing shares in line with our long-standing capital deployment strategy. We repurchased 341,000 shares for about $35 million in the quarter and 2 million shares for approximately $156 million year-to-date. We have 24 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter.We remain fully committed to returning to our historic leverage -- level over the next 18 to 24 months through a combination of debt repayment and strong EBITDA growth. Total debt outstanding as of September 30th, which is about 75% fixed, was $22.5 billion and debt-to-EBITDA was 3.9 times.With that, let me call it -- turn the call back to Jeff. -- Thanks, Bob. We begin our new Fiserv journey with a far larger opportunity to deliver value to the market. Combined sales performance was up 15% in the quarter and is up 8% year-to-date. We had a number of important wins in the quarter such as signing the California DMV and its 180 locations to the Clover platform.We also had larger competitive wins in the integrated payment space such as Dash platform, Smart Service and MRI. And we added all the north and all the south to global supermarket chain store with locations across 19 markets to our e-commerce solutions. We were also pleased to expand our relationship with Golden 1 Credit Union in the quarter with a bundle of new value, including ATM Managed Services. We signed Western Alliance Bank with more than $25 billion in assets and TBK Bank with nearly $5 billion of assets to our dovetail payment hub.And last, DNA momentum continued in the quarter signing six new clients and competitive processes, including Landmark Credit Union, Wisconsin's largest credit union with more than $4.2 billion in assets, and Verve, a credit union with about $1.3 billion in assets.Our sales pipeline remains strong and importantly, the weighted pipeline of revenue synergies is approaching $100 million of annual revenue. We expect the synergy pipeline and related sales to grow as the market experiences the new Fiserv. For those tracking the original Fiserv, integrated sales was up 46% in the quarter and 17% through September 30th. Operational effectiveness performance remained on track with $11 million achieved in the quarter and $36 million of savings year-to-date.Now on to guidance. We expect constant currency internal revenue growth of 6% for the year with the fourth quarter coming in around 5%, due primarily to a slightly better-than-expected Q3, a tough prior year compare, including lower periodic revenue in our Financial segment and some purchase revenue adjustments.We expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.98 to $4.02 for the year, growth of 16% to 17%, which includes more than 300 basis points of negative impact from FX on our full year adjusted EPS growth rate. We expect adjusted operating margin to expand by at least 100 basis points for the year, and that free cash flow conversion will be approximately 115%.Although we are in the midst of our 2020 planning, we will provide a very preliminary view into our expected performance. For full clarity, this is not official guidance or outlook. Those data will be provided in our February call.As of today, considering the strong performance of the existing business, expected synergies and the current view into the continuing headwind from FX, we anticipate 2020 internal revenue growth of at least 7% and that adjusted earnings per share will grow plus or minus 25% over 2019's actual performance.This has been a monumental year for Fiserv. We were named the World's Most Admired Company for the sixth year in a row, celebrated our 35th anniversary and, most importantly, combined with First Data to help achieve our aspiration of moving money and information in a way that moves the world. And while others have followed our lead, we are even more confident today that our solution set, global scale and significant investment capacity underpins an unparalleled opportunity for clients, associates and shareholders.Let us also thank our 44,000 associates around the world for their commitment and enthusiasm to building our new enterprise while continuing to serve clients with excellence. Each of you working together are truly Fiserv at our best.With that, Michelle, let's open the line for questions.Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Koning with Baird. You may go ahead, sir. -- Yeah. Hey, guys. Congrats, incredible performance. -- Thanks, Dave. Appreciate it. -- Yeah. And maybe to start out, I mean, to have guidance over 7% for next year, what seems like is happening is First Data has kind of gone from a few years ago losing share to actually -- it seems like they're gaining share now. And you guys kind of called out digital ISV Clover Global Solutions all that fast growth stuff. Is North America actually kind of in an acceleration mode? Maybe how big is the really fast growth part now? Has that gotten to scale that it can accelerate the total North America growth now? -- So Dave, there's a lot of questions that are in there. Let me take the first part of it, and then have a Frank fill in the blanks and perhaps Bob will have something to add to it as well. I would say that if you start kind of at a little bit more of a macro level, you'll remember when we got on the phone in January 16 and announced the transaction, that it was our belief that there was a mismatch between what was going on in the company and how investors were thinking and what we were seeing.And what we are seeing was that Frank and the management team had really put the company on the right path that they were making fantastic progress. And I'll let Frank talk about that. And it's an incredible testament to what the team has done to have delivered 10% growth both in the quarter and the year-to-date. But it was our belief that technologies such as Clover right with over $100 billion in annualized GPV growing at 40%, which is actually an increase from the prior year's growth rate. And then you think about Integrated Payments and ISV, and e-commerce growing 30% in transactions that these pockets were moving absolutely in the right direction. But don't forget, there's still a big partner solutions business.There's lots of other pieces of the business that continue to just move in the right direction. So, I think, we have a lot of room to continue to run and we'll be focused on that. The e-commerce business signed 30 new logos this year alone. So, we're taking the right steps and we're moving forward. And I think we believe that it will continue to grow. And also obviously, we have our international businesses that have been growing quite well. Frank, why don't you... -- I think -- I think the only other thing I would add is, these are technology-based businesses. Our acquisitions going back in time to us buying Clover -- fully integrating Clover into the company, but letting it thrive as a Silicon Valley entity. Then the acquisitions in the ISV business, which is beginning to really show up, which were CardConnect and BluePay, and bringing that technology integrating it in an integrated company and bringing technology on top of that to bring the best solutions that we thought technically were in the market.And then, e-com is a constant investment for us and you can count on us having continued investment in all three of these to continue a growth trajectory in those businesses. And international has been a star for us, but that was something that we started out with very little market share. And you see that as a strong double-digit grower for us. But the technical business, the partnership in this new company, will just help this. I mean, if you want to ask about North America, you hear us talking about the privileged position that Fiserv had with its great core clients. And the reason why we've been able to go in, and I think you got to absorb that 20 wins in a 100-day period of time, that's from start of discussion to signing. And when you have $6 billion institutions and competitive takeaways, it's about the privileged position that Fiserv had with these clients. And I think Jeff and I have thought about good ways to bring it together, ways always that the clients are delighted with. -- Great, guys. Thanks. And I'll just ask a very short follow-up. I know free cash flow and buybacks are so important to you guys. What do you think the Q4 share count is going to be just because it's confusing right now with partial quarter in Q3? -- Yes, David, it's Bob. We bought -- we started buying back in late September. We talked about we'll have some modest buyback under that 10b5 program. The way to think about it, if you look in our press release, there's a couple of tables in there. We're about 695 million shares overall is the way to think about it. -- Great. Great job. Thanks guys. -- Thanks, Dave.Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. -- Hi. Good afternoon, guys. -- Hi, Lisa. -- Congratulations. Hi. Can you talk a little bit about is now you've got all of you guys together converged entity about international, a place where legacy First Data has had a lot of success. Not -- and historically a focus area for Fiserv, but as you're looking into sort of the investment priorities of the combined entity, what's the role of your international expansion? What are the priority geographies? How should we be thinking about that? Thank you. -- Thanks, Lisa. I think, first of all, you -- I know that you've watched the international growth of First Data, and it was very, very targeted. And countries that we believe had a good payment economies had lots of runway in cash to cashless, and our ability to bring our skill sets and tools there, and partner with great banks also.When we looked at the company, we found that the ability to take both institutions, put them together, run a very, very integrated business in each country and in each region, and then begin talking to our clients. That is one of the favorite things we like to do, visit clients, talk to them, talk to them about the solutions. So as we said before, I think there's great opportunity for us to bring merchants and issuing product into old Fiserv clients.And we think there's great opportunity to take many of the good products we have everywhere from dovetail to the way we could have hosted solutions for institutions which we have great relationships with. And I would say international, if you went to where we originally started, it's a much brighter spot and opportunity in totality, and our regional heads have been often running and doing a great job in integrating this company. -- Lisa, I would only add, when Frank and I and the teams were going through the combination analysis and looking for where were the big opportunities, we, to some extent, put international off to the side, because we had in the original Fiserv such a small international presence. And even though we had a fair amount of country diversity and maybe a larger amount of product diversity, we didn't necessarily think we would have the scale.And one of the things that we've been pleasantly surprised by is because of the infrastructure the scale that First Data brought to the party, we're able to take our solutions. host them for clients and run them and create recurring revenue. And there's been a lot of energy. If you're in a local jurisdiction, you want product, and we had a lot of product. There are a lot of relationships. And so, we've got a lot more energy going back and forth. And we will now, because of the combined company, we have reasonable scale. We will certainly look to deploy capital outside the US where it makes sense strategically and for the rest of the benefit of the company. -- Thank you. And then, maybe my follow-up slightly related on e-com, 30% transaction growth, obviously a fantastic number. Can you give a sense for where in that extremely hot and hotly contested market you're winning? Is that -- should we be thinking this is a multinational omni-channel? Is this platforms where you're the back-end processor behind some of the big platform players. Is this small business USA? Give us a sense for sort of where you're seeing those wins? Thank you. -- Well, there's been a -- Jeff talked about the number of new logos, and that implication is large and accurate, which are the large institutions. You should think of them as large players who are brands that you aspire to have this business with. So we've been very, very fortunate to have notched a bunch of wins of large institutions who are heavy e-com players. And I think of it in that manner.I think also you can see us having a larger tax rate in our ISV business and other avenues where we're attaching more e-com to our small business and medium-sized ISVs. And yeah, we do have a somewhat privileged position as being a processor for some large players also, but I think when you look at the totality of what Jeff talked about in the winning space, it's been more at the front of the shop not at the back of the shop. -- Yeah, it's really been quite impressive. The list of names that the company has been able to bring into this table over the last couple of years, including a number of important names this year, as Frank said to some extent, aspirational names in industries that we are aware of. But there's also a fair amount of middle market, most of what we're seeing right now is in the OmniPay space, but in that middle market. So we're making great progress there.And we're building out a model where we're delivering incremental services so that we're able to create more value on a per transaction basis. So, it's early. We've had this conversation, but the momentum is, I think, far greater than certainly we understood, but as important I think more than the outside world is understood. -- Terrific. Thank you. Thanks, guys. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. You may go ahead. -- Hey. Thanks, guys. -- Hey, Darrin. -- Hey, guys. I just want to touch on -- look, if we hone in a bit more on the First Data growth, given the source of strength and upside versus prior rates. I mean again, you mentioned the strength in GBS continuing to trend well. If we could just break that down a little further on perhaps even in the US of the Partner Solutions business, the direct business, JVs, it seems like the Partner Solutions continues to really holding their strong. And then, maybe just to add on to that, if you've seen any cross-sells on -- maybe has the Clover cross-sell into the digital banking side or just through your bank channels started yet, how has that been going? -- So let me start and Frank will again add in -- will play off of each other on that. To answer your latter question first, we've seen exactly no revenue to-date from the bank channel. Lots of energy, as Frank talked about, 20 wins in 100 days and a large pipeline and lots of interest, which is particularly important now in a time where fee revenue is increasingly important and we're obviously looking to help our clients. So lots there.We are making real progress in deeply integrating the Clover technology into the digital solutions in which we control with our development shop. And so we don't have to deal with some of the exogenous factors that can get in the way of digital performance. So, from that perspective, that's all good. But again, to reiterate that's not in the numbers at this stage. It's really across the Board in merchant. Obviously, the things that we like to talk about are the digital commerce technologies and the things that are \"a little sexier\" than maybe some of the others.But Partner Solutions continues to be incredibly important. Whether it is our business consultants who are out signing up merchants every day or signing a new ISV provider or a new e-commerce solution, it all comes together. And I think Bob in his prepared remarks talked about the fact that that merchant locations overall are up double-digit year-over-year. And I think that really just talks to all things of what we're doing and how we're focused on driving the business in kind of one important vertical at a time. -- All right. That's helpful. And just one quick follow-up is on the bill pay cross-sell opportunity. Our checks are suggesting there's a pretty amount of white space in some of your enterprise clients at First Data still. Have you seen further evidence around that? -- You heard Frank talk about the number of meetings that we've had with clients and talking about the power of the influential relationships. I mean, I think at this stage, the best way to frame it is, we're having a number of conversations that I don't think either of the original businesses will be having without having done this combination. So, we're bullish about that, but we also don't want the card ahead of the horse. We need to keep moving the processes along. But again, the conversations and the interest levels are quite high. -- Okay. That's great to hear, guys. Thank you. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. You may go ahead, sir. -- Hi, guys. This is Ben Budish on for Ramsey. I wanted to ask a follow-up on an earlier question on the share repurchases. So it's nice to have the confidence to kind of start doing that immediately. Just wondering what kind of pace should we expect while you're paying down debt should be kind of more of the historical norm of quarterly repurchases or maybe I'm more muted into the debt to further pay down? And kind of as a follow-up to that, given that kind of confidence in your cash flow generation, should we maybe expect to see incremental M&A perhaps earlier than expected? -- Yeah. So, I would say, one of the things that was in our prepared remarks is to make sure that we pointed out that we're buying under a 10b5 plan. And so -- which means that we would expect to be regularly in the market. I would say that we will not be in the market at the pace that we were at before. We are absolutely committed to making sure that we meet our leverage commitments to the agencies and we will for sure do that. And that will come from a combination of cash flow generation, debt repayment and growing EBITDA.So, from that perspective, I think we will pace it well, but cash flow is strong and we feel good about that. We also had a couple of smaller divestitures in the quarter. And so, we'll be looking to create as much opportunity as we can to deploy capital as we have historically.I would say that M&A itself is not a particularly high priority, differentiating and winning in the market is. And so, where there are opportunities for us to deploy capital for M&A and it's meeting our normal disciplined capital allocation deployment, then we're fine. But again, I think our number one priority is making sure that we meet our commitments from a leverage perspective. And then we take it from there. -- Okay. Thanks very much. -- Thank you.Thank you. David Togut from Evercore ISI. You may go ahead, sir. -- Thank you and congratulations on the new Fiserv. -- Thanks, David. -- You called out 46% integrated sales growth in the quarter, Jeff, which I believe is the highest integrated sales growth we've seen at least for Fiserv stand-alone. Are there any major drivers to call out behind that? Is this a pickup in bank IT band, specific solutions gaining more traction? -- Yeah, it really has to do more with the level of investment that we have been making in our solution sets over the last few years and building product and having that product come to market. And that product has been a combination of internal builds as well as some small M&A that we've done that is enhancing our overall value proposition, specifically in some of the not surprisingly in the digital arenas.So, from that standpoint, it is really just about products that we've built. And I don't know that I would count it to be around growth in bank IT spend, but I do think it is the -- it talks to the importance of making sure you're building solutions in the places that matter most for clients. It's also around areas like deposit transformation, risk, fraud, the normal areas, mobile, digital as we talked about. And then, we believe wholeheartedly that the merchant solutions that we're going to bring the integrated solutions that Frank talked about through Clover and others will even further enhance that. -- Understood. And then, as a follow-up, the preliminary 2020 outlook, can you give us any broad outlines in terms of what you're thinking about for First Data organic versus payments and financial, and then how you're thinking about the cadence of revenue and cost synergies flowing in, in 2020? -- Sure. I would say that at this stage a couple of things. Number one, this is not meant to be guidance and the more detail that we give, the more Bob will not be happy with me. So I think we're going to keep it at a pretty high level. The second thing I would say is, remember that we intend to resegment the company. And so, when we give guidance, we'll be giving it across a new segmentation model. And so, I think again getting ahead of that wouldn't make sense.At the higher level, I can tell you that we feel quite comfortable that the kinds of growth that is being delivered in the company is sustainable. And so, there's always going to have ranges around that sustainability. But generally, if you think about the former GBS segment of First Data, 10% growth in the quarter, 10% growth for the first three quarters. To us, that feels like a level of sustainability around that. And we think that each of our segments will continue to grow. You'll remember that it was important for us to look for how could we continually and sustainably step-up internal revenue growth, and so we'll look to do that.And then, the last piece is around the synergies, right? And synergies understand that -- as you know, synergies have to get sold and implemented. There are some things that come on faster than others. That's what I would say as, we would expect that to be more back-end loaded as some of the revenues come on. But again, we'll have to see how that all looks when we give guidance in February. -- Understood. Thank you very much. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Brett Huff with Stephens Incorporated. -- Good evening, guys. Congrats on some good results. -- Thanks , Brett. -- Thanks, Brett. -- Thank you for the preliminary goalpost around the '20 outlook. One thing that I'd like to know is, give us a sense of where there you could maybe do better than that, where there are kind of the tougher parts that you have to kind of perform better on it. Can you give us any -- just for instance is on the kind of upside downside drivers? -- Sure. Again, Brett, remembering that we're not giving guidance, we'll give you -- we'll kind of try to give it to you at not the goalpost level, but maybe at the stadium level. So, we had talked about the fact that we expected revenue growth to be at least 7%. And there's a reasonable amount of variability as you start to move across the 50-odd line of the 7%. And that is, how does synergies come on, how quickly do they come on, how do sales go, how do implementations go.Probably the most important thing for us to lay out is, as we sit here today, a lot of things have to go right as always, but everything doesn't have to go right. And that we really thought a lot about what was going to be the right way for us to give this early visibility to '20. And so, we feel like this is a good solid number and that there'll be ways to outperform it. And as Bob will remind me later, there will be ways for us to underperform it. But we do feel on balance that we are in a pretty good place in terms of that -- in terms of the 7%. -- Great. That's helpful. And then the follow-up is just more drilling down a little bit into the First Data segment. You told us about the NA GBS [Phonetic], which is really helpful. Any thoughts on the growth differential just qualitatively between the kind of the big JVs versus the more broad referral arrangements and kind of the longer tail of the bank channel. Can you give us any sense there on growth and maybe even profitability performance? -- Yeah. It's Frank. I think you got to think about what we're doing today as continued investment and still getting better growth, right? And the JVs are always a good discussion to have. But I think you got to move to a bigger discussion, which is ISV growth, how long is that runway which is huge. This investment we made in Clover and the hundreds of people that we had developed it out that has us delivering as you heard caught in the $100 billion GPD mark and growing at 40%. So, I think it's all the elements of it, and then what you heard us talking about in e-com.So, a little bit, I'd move away from the dialogue about a JV or a bank channel and move more. And yes, we love the bank channel. You hear us talk about 20 wins in 100 days through the privileged position that Fiserv had. But I would not try to understand each one of those. I would understand the macro trends of ISV, e-com, Clover and digital distribution. -- Yes. And I think Brett the thing that's important here is, remember, as we move to more of a GAAP methodology for recognizing the revenue, we were able to unshroud some of the underlying performance in certainly in GBS in the subsegment, formerly known as GBS North America. We were able to unshroud that. Now there are contributions that come in. And I would say that we have had growth contributions from the JVs that are better than they were last year. I would also guess that that is the smallest of the contributors.0And to Frank's point, the other pieces of the business are growing faster and will be faster growth vehicles not because as Frank said the banks -- the bank channel and the JVs are not important, they're critically important and we're going to do everything we can to grow them. But we think that the seeds that have been planted in First Data for the last three or four years, whether it be Clover or BluePay or CardConnect or a lot of original or internal development that it takes time for those products to be built and come to market and so that's really -- those are really the bigger drivers, just to reiterate Frank's commentary. -- Great. Appreciate the details guys. Congrats again. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. You may go ahead, sir. -- Hi, Jeff, Frank, Bob, congratulations on the good start to the combined journey here. -- Thank you, Ashwin. -- Yeah. So, the question I have is the velocity at which you went from start to finish was remarkable for the bank wins you mentioned. Would be great to kind of get a little bit more granular on the -- on what's feeding that pace and urgency? And is it kind of limited to this subset of clients or prospects you're speaking with? Or can we make any broader suppositions about bank IT spending from there? -- Yeah, let me start, Ashwin, on that. It's a couple of things. I mean, when Frank and I got together and we talked about this, one of the many points of serendipity was Frank had believed that having an access to be able to get deep integration to a core processing system was really important. And then, we are the largest core processor in the US and really in the world. And so that -- the ability to drive integration, different levels of integration and access to information will allow banks to create a more compelling integrated merchant experience for their customers, and also because these are revenue-sharing partnerships be able to create fee revenue. And you know Ashwin that fee revenue right now is really important. And so you've got a convergence where we love the fact that we not only are -- we have these great relationships with clients, but we get to pay them. And that -- we think that actually works quite well.And it speaks to the 20 wins in 100 days. I just think it speaks to the fact that as we had talked about historically, especially at the smaller end of the ranges that Frank was talking about, you have banks that really haven't paid a lot of attention to it and they see this as a great opportunity to go out and serve their customers and to create some additional fee revenue. And Frank, I think I would say, it's going a little bit better than I anticipated. -- Yeah, I mean, off to a great start. Off to a great start. -- Great. And then a clarification I have is what portion of the 2019 outlook raise is due to synergies for 4Q -- within Q4 forces the components themselves they seem to be doing better at this point? -- Yeah. I mean, the synergies, Ashwin -- the synergies are very low for this quarter. There'll be something less than very low in the next quarter. But as you know, we talked about the fact that we have actioned annualized run rate synergies of a couple of hundred million dollars. But the substantial majority of that is going to pop in next year. I would say that synergy the idea of synergies in our numbers for 2019 have not had any meaningful impact on how we have set our guidance. They're an important part of next year. And I would say that probably the biggest single driver of what some people consider synergies would be interest expense saves in our numbers vis-a-vis the prior original companies. -- Got it. This is good stuff. Thank you, guys. -- Thank you.Thank you. Glenn Greene from Oppenheimer. You may go ahead. -- Thanks. Good afternoon. Congrats on the good start and the very encouraging 2020 outlook, Jeff and Frank. -- Thank you. -- I guess, the first question, it sounds like -- maybe I'm reading into this but it sounds like you're increasingly confident in the $500 million revenue synergy number. You've talked a bit about it but maybe the areas where specifically you see the upside opportunity relative to what you thought or incremental opportunities that you had are really fully appreciated early on that gives you more confidence in that $500 million? -- Yeah. I mean this privileged position that we have with the banks, until you go visit them and actually can talk to them, you're not really sure how it's all going to turn out. Now, we knew that we both had deep love of financial institutions and they were our lifeblood. But whether it would turn out this way wasn't all that clear. So, we feel good about how that's going to come out and over the long haul, be worth to heck a lot of money.I'd say, secondly, you heard us talk about international. That's probably something that most people and it's all only put the two together that we would be so bullish on. And I don't think we initially had it in our base case, so to speak, when we thought about it. Maybe we thought we'd save some money. But I think the revenue opportunity there is pretty large. And then, when you move to the spaces like our credit business and putting these two together, it becomes very clear.I'd like to say the biggest proof point for us has been the client's office, right? There's no better thing than Jeff and I have had the benefit of doing multiple client meetings together, and then obviously we do things separately. But it's so clear the power of the franchise and we always come out with more opportunities and more thought. Network will obviously, like credit will be big for us. Output is a tremendous opportunity. So, 100 days in, we feel better than we did when we saw it on the journey. -- Yeah. -- And Glenn, we are -- I mean, I think you heard we have good confidence in the $500 million. And we also think it's prudent for us to wait until our Investor Day to really layout in detail how we see it coming together and where we may see opportunities to do a little bit better. -- Okay. And then, just a follow-up question will be the bread selling environment. I mean I heard the 15% bookings growth in the quarter, but just some context on what you're seeing at a high level across the businesses. Your peers are obviously seeing really good results too. So it's kind of curious, a lot of concern about the macro economy, but a lot of companies in the sector are not seeing it. So I'm just curious what you're seeing? -- Sure. So, I would say that you if you think about -- you have to think about at least for us -- for us original Fiserv people. We've had to open the aperture and we're happy to do it. We're not just serving primarily financial institutions anymore. We're serving really everyone who does something in the world of payments, commerce, money movement and fintech. And so, from that standpoint, when you think about the entire ecosystem, there's a lot going on. And what's happening in financial institutions is -- financial institutions are biasing their spend to areas in which it's most -- where it is most visible to their customers. So whether it's digital -- sorry, whether it's consumer or commercial by things that are digital, abilities to serve clients in an Amazon-like way that's really where you're seeing money go.And then, just money movement payments that entire space is just fraught with energy and innovation and everyone is looking to make sure that they're on the way. And because of the breadth of the company and the investments that we collectively have been making over the last few years, I think, we're fairly well-positioned. What we have to make sure that we continue to do is that we meet our commitments and deliver for our clients because that's really what they need most right now. -- Okay, thank you. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta from North Coast Research. You may go ahead. -- Good afternoon. Jeff, I think, I know the answer to this based on all your commentary for 2019 guidance and your outlook in 2020, but just wanted to get your thoughts. As you have conversations with banks and interest rates are moving all over the place and they're getting pressure on their net interest margin. I'm assuming that's not having an impact on their spend at least as far as you can see and that's the reason for your confidence in 2020. Is that kind of fair? -- I would say -- I would say, it's probably too bold to say it's not having any impact on their spend, it is. But what we're seeing and we've seen this before is institutions are making choices. Perhaps their discretionary spend is going down or they're spending less on older systems and more on newer systems again where the institution meets the customer in the places that matter most. So, I do see that going on. And the conversations are how do we do more, and in times like this where you are a full-scale provider, you have opportunities to go in and win more business. And so, we're certainly hoping and building strategy around the fact that we think the suite that we bring on balance is the best in the market. And so, we're looking to Frank's point about how we have client conversations and there's more interest in doing things. There's a lot of opportunity to see, can you do things more efficiently and effectively as one larger enterprise. And so, that was one of the things, Kartik, that we liked about this transaction is, yeah, on one hand, there are some that say it's best to be pure play. We think being broad and the ability to put things together and integrate in new and innovative ways gives us a bit of a market advantage. -- And just one last question for you, Frank. As you look at Clover customers today versus a year ago, is there been a change in the type of customers that are using Clover? And as you see Clover evolve over the next, let's just -- for the sake of our conveersatake about 12 to 18 months, is that changed at all? -- I think the breadth of Clover continues to see it larger. I think if you go back in time, we talked about dining solutions and delivering to restaurants. So, our breadth that what our development teams are doing is continuing to build functionality that gives us more vertical depth. We've gone outside the US. You see us in Canada. You see us in Europe. You should expect the releases in Latin America. We've been tremendously advantaged as we were strategic in Argentina and how to capitalize on that change, and Clover was part of that strategy. I would also say as we continue to build out functionality with the combination of our ISV solution in Clover, the ability to bring the two together for a best-in-class solution for merchants who use integrated software is what you'll see happen. So, the answer -- the short answer is yes, and the rest was the description of how and where. -- Thank you very much. Appreciate it. -- Thanks, Kartik. And thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. We really appreciate your support. If you have further questions, please don't hesitate to contact our Investor Relations team.

At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the FISV options chain for the new November 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $95.00 strike price has a current bid of 90 cents.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $95.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $94.10 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of FISV, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $106.02/share today.\n\nBecause the $95.00 strike represents an approximate 10% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .

From its humble beginnings when it offered a simple way for small vendors to accept credit cards, SQ has now become one of the biggest financial technology (fintech) companies in the world. And the SQ stock price since 2015 has reflected this growth.\nSource: Shutterstock\n\tHowever, Square stock is off its recent highs, as the shares got penalized following its  report in August. The current economic and political environment in the U.S. and globally poses plenty of questions for market participants.And the owners of Square stock may have to reset their growth and share price expectations. If Square\u2019s revenue growth decelerates, then the price of SQ stock will also . In the coming weeks, I\u2019d be a buyer below $60, especially if it approaches $50.Here\u2019s what investors should know before buying into SQ stock.Square  on August 1 after market close. Notably, the payment-solutions company posted better-than-expected earnings and revenues.\u00a0 Its revenue increased 44% year-over-year to $1.17 billion.And on an adjusted basis, earnings were 21 cents per share, beating Wall Street\u2019s expectation of 17 cents per share.Square\u2019s subscription and services-based revenue also increased 87% to $251 million. This growth has been driven by its Cash App, Square Capital, and Instant Deposit. Analysts were especially impressed with the Cash App whose quarterly revenue came at $135 million.The quarterly report once again confirmed that Square stock is a high-growth equity. Such shares in general are far more volatile than market indices or mature companies. Whenever investors feel growth expectations need to be toned down, they sell the stock first and ask questions later.Investors were especially concerned by the company\u2019s lower-than-expected Q3 guidance. Square management projected higher-than-expected losses on the bottom line. And many shareholders have likely felt that for the rest of the year, SQ stock may face a rising tide.On earnings day, Square stock closed at $80.98. The next morning, SQ shares gapped down to open at $70.80. Now the shares are hovering around $64.Square was co-founded in February 2009 by Jack Dorsey, who is also the CEO of  (NYSE:). This innovative financial services company has expanded quickly, with its unique dongles for mobile phones that enable virtually everyone to accept credit-card payments.The global payments industry is a\u00a0. While SQ currently enjoys a head start in serving small businesses, Wall Street\u00a0\u00a0about whether it can maintain that growth. If the U.S. economy slows, Square\u2019s growth may start to decelerate rather quickly.Furthermore, Square is not yet profitable. Its net loss was $7 million in Q2, compared to a net loss of $6 million in the year-ago quarter. The company has reported net losses in five of the last six quarters.Efforts to attain profitability are taking time. Moreover, not every area Square expands into will necessarily produce easy profits. And unless it\u00a0, Wall Street may take down the high valuation of SQ stock.For example, during the earnings release, Square announced the surprising sale of its Caviar foodservice platform to . Some believe this exit is premature, considering the evenue potential. On the other hand, others believe that this sale enables Square to leave a low-margin business where competition is fierce.Square is now able to partner with DoorDash which has a much larger platform. In other words, it can further integrate its payment processing system to other foodservice platforms. Nonetheless, analysts agree that the surprise factor Caviar\u2019s sale has raised eyebrows.Finally, the expansion of Square\u2019s ecosystem also means that SQ will face increased competition. Square\u00a0\u00a0with many well-capitalized companies, including the global online-payments company\u00a0(NASDAQ:), transaction-processing leader\u00a0(NYSE:) and\u00a0\u00a0(NASDAQ:), which is shaping up to become a\u00a0.Let us briefly remember how the Square stock price has acted over the years.Following the initial public offering of Square stock in late 2015, its price surged from $9 to an all-time high of $101.15 in October 2018, as the company became a darling of long-term investors.SQ stock went on a big tear during the summer of 2018, baking in plenty of euphoria. As a result, shares have been weak since reaching its all-time high on Oct. 1, 2018. By late-December 2018, SQ was hovering around $50.In 2019, although SQ stock is up about 15%, August has not been a good month for shares. That\u2019s of course due to the weak Q3 guidance.From a technical perspective, I\u2019m not expecting Square stock to make another significant leg up any time soon. In the next few weeks, shares are likely to be rangebound between $60 and $70.Further, SQ stock has strong support between $60 and $65. However, if any negative headlines flash that affect the technology sector or the fintech sector specifically, then shares may easily go\u00a0.Plus, the daily volatility of Square stock is high, giving it a broad trading range, so short-term traders should proceed with caution. Expect SQ to be choppy at best in the near-term.Square stock will need to stabilize and build a base again before a long-term sustained leg up can occur. Consequently, investors need to be careful about chasing shares at this point.The fintech app revolution is quickly changing the way traditional banks, credit-card issuers and mobile-payments companies work with businesses as well as with their retail customers. Therefore, over the long term, I would not bet against SQ stock. In the short-term, though, stakeholders shouldn\u2019t expect smooth sailing.At the time of writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Markets have been so volatile this summer on U.S.-China trade tensions that investors might not have noticed: Tech stocks are absolutely red-hot in 2019.Indeed, the technology sector of Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is leading the broader market by a mile this year, with a year-to-date gain of 29% through Aug. 21.

Although pivoting to software-as-a-service is rarely pain-free - VRNS' revenue fell 4% in Q2 - such transitions boost margins over the long haul.At the same time, VRNS is benefitting from new regulations on digital privacy such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), stricter compliance requirements and the \"ominous threat environment,\" write Wedbush analysts, who rate shares at Outperform (equivalent to Buy).\"In the numerous software business model transitions we have seen play out over the past decade, we can never remember seeing a company so quickly ramp subscription revenues in the course of a few quarters, which speaks to a massive success story so far for the company (and its investors),\" Wedbush writes.Of the 14 analysts covering the stock tracked by S&P  Intelligence, seven rate VRNS at Strong Buy, two say Buy and five call it a Hold.

It's then able to bundle the software services it picks up through M&A. Most recently, the firm bought cloud-based software provider Cimpl on Aug. 22 for $23.1 million in cash and a $2.6 million cash holdback payable in 12 months. (It also announced a guidance upgrade in concert with the acquisition.)\"Our acquisition pipeline is robust, and we are actively pursuing additional opportunities to build out our solution suites,\" said Jack McDonald, Upland chairman and CEO, in a press release.William Blair analysts, who rate the tech stock at Outperform, note that enterprise customers increasingly want bundled software, and UPLD enjoyed \"record expansion and major customer growth\" in Q2. Of the eight analysts covering Upland that are tracked by S&P  Intelligence, five rate the stock a Strong Buy, and three rate it at Buy.\nMarket value: $1.1 billionDividend yield: N/AAnalysts' average recommendation: 1.29Shares in Virtusa (, $35.35) were down 17% for the year-to-date through Aug. 21 - vs. a 17% gain for the S&P 500. Analysts spot a bargain.The company - which provides IT, business consulting and application outsourcing services - posted better-than-expected quarterly results in early August. The firm also gifted investors a share repurchase program of up to $30 million over the next 12 months.Wedbush analysts rate shares at Outperform, citing Virtusa's potential to take market share and improving margins at its Polaris subsidiary in India. \"We continue to expect a combination of pipeline strength, expanding digital mix, and record level pipeline growth in FS vertical to generate above-sector growth this year,\" they write.VRTU also wants to make strategic, niche acquisitions, Wedbush notes.Of the seven analysts covering Virtusa tracked by S&P  Intelligence, five call the stock a Strong Buy and two call them a Buy. Their average price target of $51.50 gives VRTU implied upside of about 46% over the next year or so. Analysts also expect the company to be a profit-growth machine. They forecast average annual earnings expansion of 18% over the next three to five years, according to S&P  Intelligence.\nMarket value: $7.4 billionDividend yield: N/AAnalysts' average recommendation: 1.94Dropbox (, $17.92) remains in most analysts' good graces, despite what has been a disappointing run for the cloud-storage service ever since its March 2018 initial public offering.Indeed, shares were off more than 12% for the year-to-date through Aug. 21 and now sit below their $21 IPO price. DBX beat Wall Street's quarterly profit and revenue estimates in early August, but shares still tumbled as much as 14% on the report. Weaker-than-expected billings were blamed for the selloff.Although the stock appears to have recently stabilized, it's been a tough run for the bulls.\"It's frustrating to face nearly ceaseless negativity and middling performance of the stock, but it is more frustrating to try to argue against arguments that the missing of some unguided number or deceleration of a favorite metric reflects anything other than the normal stochastic nature of real-life business operations,\" write Canaccord Genuity analysts. \"We're willing to stick with this name with a Buy rating and push back on the negative knights who say Ni.\"The broader analyst community is mixed but lean bullish. Eight analysts tracked by S&P Global Market Intelligence rate DBX at Strong Buy, and three have it at Buy. But three say it's a Hold and another two say to sell Dropbox. Overall, however, their $29.64 target price gives DBX whopping implied upside of 65% - among the highest on this list of tech stocks. Earnings growth is projected to grow an average of 34% annually for the next three to five years.\nMarket value: $6.6 billionDividend yield: N/AAnalysts' average recommendation: 1.54Proofpoint (, $117.60) easily topped the Street's profit and revenue estimates when it posted second-quarter results in late July. The cybersecurity company, which enjoyed a 17% increase in billings, is seeing increased benefits from bundling cloud-based services for clients.\"We see Proofpoint as the leading cloud email security vendor, offering customers a best-of-breed messaging security solution,\" write Stifel analysts, who rate shares at Buy. \"In addition, the company has been one of the more successful acquirers within the group, leveraging M&A to drive sustained greater-than-market growth.\"Proofpoint is outperforming tech stocks as a whole, up about 40% so far in 2019 versus 29% for the sector. The pros expect more performance ahead. Their average target price of $144.50 gives PFPT stock implied upside of about 23% over the next year or so.Analysts expect Proofpoint to grow profits at 26% annually on average over the next three to five years. Twenty-nine analysts are covering PFPT at the moment - 18 rate it a Strong Buy, seven say it's a Buy and the remaining four call it a Hold.\nMarket value: $3.2 billionDividend yield: N/AAnalysts' average recommendation: 1.50Viavi Solutions (, $13.88) specializes in testing and monitoring various types of communications networks, such as broadband, copper, Wi-Fi and fiber optic. Analysts are bullish on its growth prospects, thanks partly to the rollout of next-generation (5G) wireless networks.\"We continue to believe the company's wireless and fiber test businesses are in the early stages of a multi-year investment cycle as (original equipment manufacturers) and service providers begin their transition to 5G and fiber is deployed deeper into networks,\" write Stifel analysts, who rate VIAV at Buy.The company is forecast to generate average annual earnings growth of more than 12% over the next three to five years, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Analysts average price target of $15.35 gives VIAV implied upside of about 10% over the next year or so - that small relative upside is largely because the stock has been quickly sprinting toward that price target, up 37% year-to-date. Analysts may soon need to re-evaluate and adjust.Seven analysts rate VIAV at Strong Buy, one says Buy and two have it at Hold, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nMarket value: $4.6 billionDividend yield: N/AAnalysts' average recommendation: 1.31Lumentum Holdings (, $59.71) makes optical communications devices that help power telecom networks and data center communications equipment, among a wide range of other products. But it's perhaps best known as the company that makes the 3D facial-recognition sensors for Apple's () iPhones.The relentless growth of cloud-based services bodes well for the data-center businesses of tech stocks such as LITE, as does the build-out of 5G networks. And thanks to last year's acquisition of optical-components maker Oclaro, Lumentum is set to make the most of its chances.\"Our Buy rating on shares of LITE is based on our expectation that the newly combined Lumentum + Oclaro is better positioned for continued growth in its core telecom optical market, should see improving economics in the datacom market with greater scale and the entry of new lower-cost high-speed products and long-term growth opportunities in 3D sensing,\" Stifel analysts write.All 16 analysts surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence are bullish on this tech stock - 11 call it a Strong Buy, with the other five at Buy. Their average price target of $71.39 suggests LITE will gain 20% over the next 12 months or so.\nMarket value: $32.1 billionDividend yield: N/AAnalysts' average recommendation: 1.76Autodesk (, $145.95) is by far and away the Big Kahuna when it comes to software that allows architects, engineers, manufacturers - you name it - to design complicated projects in three dimensions.Investors are getting a bit hinky about the slowdown in the global economy, but these macro concerns haven't put a damper on analysts' enthusiasm for ADSK stock. At least not yet. We'll get more clarity after the computer-assisted design company posts quarterly results, currently slated for Aug. 27. Generally, a slowdown in manufacturing is not good for Autodesk.Keybanc analysts recently surveyed Autodesk's North American resellers. The takeaway was that the software company should hit its quarterly numbers. Keybanc reiterated its Overweight (Buy) rating on shares. Longer-term, Stifel, which calls shares a Buy, likes ADSK's opportunities in 3D printing and increasing use of digital design in the architecture, engineering and construction industries.Out of 25 analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence, 14 rate ADSK at Strong Buy, four say Buy, six have it a Hold and one says Sell. Their average target price of $184.29 gives shares implied upside of 26% over the next year to 18 months.\nMarket value: $129.2 billionDividend yield: N/AAnalysts' average recommendation: 1.75To say PayPal (, $109.82) garners a lot of interest on the part of Wall Street analysts would be an understatement. More equity research shops keep tabs on the digital payments company than Microsoft (), the world's largest publicly traded company by a wide margin.Fully 40 analysts cover PayPal, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. They're bullish: 21 rate PYPL at Strong Buy, nine say Buy, nine have it at Hold and one says Sell.Shares in PayPal have tumbled about 9% after hitting an all-time high in late July. The culprit? The company cut its full-year revenue outlook when it posted second-quarter results. Shares had been a white-hot tear heading into the earnings release, which set them up for a significant drawdown on anything less than a perfect report. (The broader market's tantrum didn't help.)Analysts aren't fazed. If anything, the recent drop makes PayPal even more attractive. Wedbush rates the stock at Outperform based on \"continued hyper growth from mobile payment transactions,\" the ramping up of Venmo digital wallet and contributions from Xoom money transfer service.With an average target price of $127.51, PYPL stock has implied upside of 16%. Analysts expect earnings to grow at an average annual pace of almost 19% over the next three to five years.\nMarket value: $73.4 billionDividend yield: N/AAnalysts' average recommendation: 1.64Digital payments, payments processors and pretty all things to do with financial tech are hot these days. Even Berkshire Hathaway (), whose CEO and Chairman is the typically tech-averse Warren Buffett, is making multimillion-dollar investments in fintech.Fiserv (, $107.56) is not a  as of this writing, but it does exemplify much of what Buffett likes about companies that facilitate financial transaction processing - ample opportunities for growth and economies of scale.FISV, which recently acquired First Data in a $22 billion all-stock transaction, certainly has the scale part working in its favor.\"We specifically like the company's positioning, acting as a strategic partner to large and small community banks undergoing dramatic transformation in their business model (shifting to digital-like services),\" write Wedbush analysts, who rate FISV stock at Outperform.Of the 25 analysts covering FISV tracked by S&P Global Market Intelligence, 16 rate the stock at Strong Buy, four say Buy, four call it a Hold and one holdout says it's a Strong Sell.\nMarket value: $1.06 trillionDividend yield: 1.3%Analysts' average recommendation: 1.46It's no surprise that sitting atop this list of analyst-loved tech stocks is Microsoft (, $138.79). The folks in Redmond, Washington, have been killing it for some time now. The software king's cloud-computing business has propelled a long-sleepy stock into the stratosphere.As noted above, Microsoft is the world's biggest publicly traded company and the only one with a market value of at least $1 trillion. No. 2 Apple, a massive stock in its own right, trails MSFT by around $100 billion in market capitalization.Canaccord Genuity analysts, who rate shares at Buy, write the \"juggernaut is set to continue\" thanks to Microsoft's arsenal of growth drivers that include Azure cloud computing, Office 365 and the Xbox gaming ecosystem.\"When we hear investors get jumpy because MSFT continues to advance in 'beast mode,' we suggest they relax and enjoy what looks to us to be several more years of above-average growth and price appreciation,\" Canaccord Genuity writes.Of the 35 analysts tracked by S&P Global Market Intelligence, 23 have MSFT at Strong Buy, 10 say Buy, one calls it a Hold ... and one bear is hanging on to a Strong Sell call. Perhaps most impressively for a trillion-dollar company, earnings are forecast to grow an average of more than 12% a year for the next three to five years - not an easy feat for such a gigantic corporation.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Over the past decade,\u00a0\u00a0(NYSE:) has become a dominant player in the mobile payments and financing sphere. And the SQ stock price since 2015 has reflected the company\u2019s exponential growth.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\tHowever, Square stock is off its recent highs, as the shares got penalized following its\u00a0 report in August. Year-to-date, the SQ stock price is basically flat. Now may be a good time to ask why Square shares have been falling and what we can expect in the final quarter of 2019.I believe that the owners of Square stock may have to reset their growth and share price expectations. In the coming weeks, I\u2019d be a buyer below $55, especially if the price approaches or even goes below . Here are the must-know fundamental metric and price levels for SQ stock.Square was co-founded in February 2009 by Jack Dorsey, who is also the CEO of  (NYSE:). Its payments processing business, also referred to as \u201cpayments as a service,\u201d has been a game changer in serving small businesses. To the delight of early investors, this innovative financial services company has expanded quickly and become a disruptor.SQ stock  on Aug. 1 after market close. Notably, the payment-solutions company posted better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Its total net revenue increased 44% year-over-year to .And on an adjusted basis, earnings were 21 cents per share, beating Wall Street\u2019s expectation of 17 cents per share. A year ago in Q3, Square stock\u2019s adjusted earnings per share came in at 13 cents.Square\u2019s subscription and services-based revenue also increased 87% to $251 million. Gross payment volume of $26.8 billion increased from $21.4 billion year-over-year. This growth has been driven by its Cash App, Square Capital and Instant Deposit. Analysts were especially impressed with Cash App \u2014 quarterly revenue came at $135 million.The quarterly report once again confirmed that Square stock is a high-growth equity. Such shares in general are far more volatile than market indices or mature companies. Whenever investors feel growth expectations need to be toned down, they sell the stock first and ask questions later.Investors were especially concerned by the company\u2019s lower-than-expected Q3 guidance. Its Q3 adjusted-EPS guidance of 18 cents to 20 cents trailed the average estimate of 22 cents. Square management now expects Q3 adjusted revenue to be between $590 million and $600 million as opposed to the consensus of $599 million.Square stock\u2019s losses on the bottom line are also projected to be higher than expected. And many shareholders have likely felt that for the rest of the year, SQ stock may face a rising tide.The U.S. stock market has had several big winners in the past year. However, Square stock has not been one of them. Over the past 12 months, SQ shares are down about 36%.Let us briefly remember how the Square stock price has acted over the years to have a better view on what to expect in the coming weeks.Following SQ stock\u2019s IPO in late 2015, its price surged from $9 to an all-time high of $101.15 in October 2018, as the company became a darling of long-term investors.SQ stock went on a big tear during the summer of 2018, baking in plenty of euphoria. As a result, shares have been weak since reaching its all-time high on Oct. 1, 2018. By late December 2018, SQ was hovering around $50.After a highly volatile first half of 2019, August has not been a good month for Square shares either. That\u2019s of course due to the weak Q3 guidance which has underwhelmed investors.On earnings day, Square stock closed at $80.98. The next morning, SQ shares gapped down to open at $70.80. Now the shares are hovering around $58.From a technical perspective, I\u2019m not expecting Square stock to make another significant leg up any time soon. In the next few weeks, shares are likely to be rangebound between $50 and $55.Plus, based on options trading, many bets are being placed that Square shares will see $50 before too long.The upside momentum can build up only when long-term investors feel that the SQ stock price justifies the future growth expectations. Consequently, investors need to be careful about chasing Square stock at this point.Although the decline in Square\u2019s stock has improved the valuation, the shares are still .While SQ currently enjoys a head start in serving small businesses, Wall Street \u00a0about whether it can maintain that growth. If the U.S. economy slows, Square\u2019s growth may start to decelerate rather quickly.Furthermore, Square is not yet profitable. Its net loss was $7 million in Q2, compared to a net loss of $6 million in the year-ago quarter. The company has reported net losses in five of the last six quarters. \u00a0And unless it , Wall Street may take the high valuation of SQ stock down even further.The expansion of Square\u2019s ecosystem also means that SQ is facing increased competition. Square \u00a0with many well-capitalized companies, including the global online-payments company\u00a0(NASDAQ:), transaction-processing leader\u00a0(NYSE:) and  \u00a0(NASDAQ:), which is shaping up to become a\u00a0.Most SQ stock holders are well aware that the shares do not trade at bargain-bin valuation ratios, especially compared to its competitors. For example, SQ\u2019s forward price-to-earnings ratio is over . On the other hand forward P/E ratios for PYPL, V and FISV stocks are about ,  and \u00a0respectively.Similarly Square stock\u2019s current price-to-sales ratio is over . Companies generate revenue from the sale of goods and services. Analysts prefer a low P/S multiple, ideally below 1x. However, a P/S number between 1x and 2x is more common. To put the metric into perspective,\u00a0\u00a0average price-to-sales\u00a0.In short, I do not think there is much room for Square stock\u2019s valuation to head higher in the final quarter of the year. Sooner or later, SQ stock\u2019s valuation and revenue growth will be more in balance.The fintech app revolution is quickly changing the way traditional banks, credit card issuers and mobile-payments companies work with businesses as well as with their retail customers. Therefore, over the long term, I would not bet against SQ stock. In the short term, though, stakeholders shouldn\u2019t expect smooth sailing.I believe the volatility and selling in the markets will continue in September as well as in early October. Like many momentum plays, SQ stock is likely to be a battleground between two camps: investors and traders.Square is a high beta stock at . The stock market has a beta of 1.0. SQ stock\u2019s beta measures its volatility in relation to the market. In other words, Square stock rises more than the market in bullish conditions and decreases more when markets are falling. Short-term traders should exercise caution if they want to participate in SQ stock\u2019s wide daily swings.It is likely that Square shares will fall toward $50, where I\u2019d expect SQ stock to start to stabilize and then trade sideways until the next earnings release, expected in .Indeed, Square stock may become one of the first momentum stocks to test the lows it saw between $49-$50 in December 2018, hence making a double bottom in technical charts. Only then the twice-touched low may become a more reliable long-term support level.In other words, I\u2019d not rush to buy Square stock yet. However, I\u2019d get ready to initiate a position as the price declines further, toward $50.At the time of writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Bulls got a taste of victory Friday and returned from the weekend wanting more. With stocks jumping over 1% across the board this morning, the backdrop could be set for profitable long trades. Today we\u2019ll look at three stocks to buy offering breakout chart patterns.One development emboldening buyers is the weakness finally striking bond prices. It was bound to happen sometime given their meteoric rise and is easing the panic. The past month has seen a mad dash into fixed-income due to pessimism over economic growth and lower inflation expectations.Fortunately, the companies highlighted in today\u2019s gallery haven\u2019t cared one bit about plunging interest rates or inverted yield curves. They all boast super-strong trends and earnings growth that continues unabated.Behold, three breakout stocks to buy for the week. (NYSE:) is a medical equipment company based out of Irvine, California. EW stock price has been virtually untouched during the recent ruckus and popped to a new record high Friday. The culprit for its extraordinary strength is the variable that always allows a stock to buck the general market trend: earnings.If Edwards Lifesciences continues to post record earnings numbers, why should it could up in the trade war and inverted yield curve drama?\n\t\n\t\tSource: ThinkorSwim\n\tSince its mid-July pole vault, EW stock has spent the last month building a textbook high-base pattern. The consolidation allowed the stock to digest its gains and build a foundation for its next ascent. With Friday\u2019s rally to the upper end of its range, an upside breakout looks imminent.Buy the November $220/$240 bull call spread for around $8.30.Though it hales from a completely different sector, the story behind  (NASDAQ:) mirrors that of EW. Strong earnings lifted the Wisconsin-based provider of financial services technology to new heights last month, and we\u2019ve since seen the formation of a textbook high base pattern.\n\t\n\t\tSource: ThinkorSwim\n\tBroad market weakness prove impotent in knocking FISV stock from its well-deserved perch. The few down days cropping up over the past month haven\u2019t been able to push FISV below its rising 20-day moving average. The 50-day and 200-day moving averages are also rising loyally beneath and reflect buyers\u2019 dominance across longer time frames.This morning\u2019s up-gap could be the breakout spectators have been waiting for. Buy the October $110/$115 bull call spread for around $1.80.The final member of today\u2019s trio is  (NASDAQ:). It\u2019s on pace for a banner year, currently up 50% for 2019. It too has wholly sidestepped the drama playing out in the market. We have seen sporadic down days but nothing powerful enough to breach even the 20-day moving average.And that\u2019s saying something given the bloodbath elsewhere.\n\t\n\t\tSource: ThinkorSwim\n\tThe holding pattern seen since last month\u2019s mighty earnings gap is a welcome development setting up a more sustainable breakout. While some time may be needed yet before SBUX stock is ready to run again, it\u2019s worth putting on your radar now. $100 is the level to watch. Once broken, buyers should come running.Upside call vertical spreads are a low-cost way to play here.

The company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) grew 9% to $0.82, which also beat analysts' estimates by a penny, sending shares up after the release. Fiserv also reaffirmed its full-year guidance for 4.5% to 5% revenue growth and 10% to 14% adjusted EPS growth, not counting the effect of the First Data acquisition. To cap off the month, Fiserv closed the First Data acquisition on July 29. After the acquisition, the company expects to achieve $900 million in cost synergies and $500 million in revenue synergies, though Fiserv's management \u00a0that the combined companies could exceed both targets. In fact, due to the recent plunge in interest rates, Fiserv's refinancing of First Data's debt added another $120 million in interest cost savings.

A fund making a bearish bet against a stock by shorting calls, for example, might also be long some amount of stock as they trade around their overall bearish position.  This long component could show up in a 13F filing and everyone might assume the fund is bullish, but this tells only part of the story because the bearish/short side of the position is not seen.\n\n\t\tHaving given that caveat, we believe that looking at groups of 13F filings can be revealing, especially when comparing one holding period to another.

We then compared that number to the sum total of FISV shares those same funds held back at the 03/31/2019 period, to see how the aggregate share count held by hedge funds has moved for FISV.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session begins, following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Tiffany Willis, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. -- Thank you, and good afternoon.

We're pleased with our financial performance in the second quarter against our most difficult comparison of the year. We delivered better-than-anticipated results in the quarter and the first half, and are well on our way to meet our full year financial targets.Now, before we talk about the financial results, let me provide a brief update on the First Data transaction. We've received all required regulatory approvals and plan to close the transaction on July 29, well within our original expectations of closing in the second half of the year.As anticipated, we received all of our approvals without any conditions. We continue to prepare for day one and are focused on moving from integration planning to actual integration. We've announced a number of our senior leadership roles and the entire organization is ready to kick off the new Fiserv. Clients and prospects are excited about the opportunities they see for us to deliver differentiated value and build their businesses in new and unique ways.We've been working on meaningful incremental growth opportunities such as bank merchant, credit solutions, biller services, network and international. We believe that integrating the solutions of our two leading companies will create incremental opportunities for clients to better serve their customers, generate additional revenue, operate more efficiently and better manage risk.Our client first focus should translate to more revenue for Fiserv and may ultimately allow us to exceed our $500 million revenue synergy target. We've made strong progress on cost synergy planning with a focus on delivering more efficiently for clients and with higher quality. Our teams are focused on the absolute dollar value of the opportunities as well as increasing the pace and timing of those savings. Upon closing, we will fully deploy our teams with a targeted outcome of exceeding the $900 million target.One of the unique benefits of this transaction is our commitment to increase organic solution investment by $0.5 billion over the next five years. We are acutely aware of the potential competitive advantages to making the right investments in this time of transformational market change. We're in the early stages of scoping the first round of these investments, which we believe will ultimately further accelerate growth and profitability. We recently raised funds to refinance First Data's debt in a more favorable interest rate environment than we anticipated at the time the acquisition was announced. At today's rates, this translates to additional annual savings of approximately $120 million ahead of our original expectations.All of this taken together reinforces our belief that the combination will produce more than 20% accretion to adjusted EPS in the first 12 months, and more than 40% accretion at the full synergy run rate. We're thrilled to be on the precipice of closing this transaction and moving forward together. We're even more convinced that this transformative combination will extend leadership and value for clients, create important opportunities for associates and deliver above-market returns for shareholders for many years to come.Now, back to the financial results. Internal revenue growth was 4% for the quarter and adjusted earnings-per-share growth was 9%, both against a very difficult prior year compare. For the first half of the year, internal revenue growth was 4% and adjusted earnings per share was up 11%. Momentum remains strong as sales increased 17% in the quarter and is up 14% through June 30. We fully expect to achieve our sales objectives for the year.We held our annual client conference Forum 2019 in May, posting over 6,000 professionals at keynote addresses, solution showcases, thought leadership sessions and numerous client networking events. We also had nearly 400 prospects in attendance and lead generation on site was nearly double the total contract value compared to last year. We believe Forum is becoming the must-attend client event of the year.With that, let's review performance against our 2019 key shareholder priorities, which are, first, continue to build high quality revenue, while meeting our earnings commitments; next, to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and third, to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients.As mentioned, we're pleased with our second quarter's performance and strong position exiting the first half of the year. Company internal revenue growth in the quarter was 4%, including 5% growth in the Payments segment and was up 2% in the Financial segment even in the face of a very difficult compare. Adjusted earnings per share was up 9% in the quarter and 11% year to date. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was flat to the prior year, which was better than our expectations given the license revenue grow over.Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was up 50 basis points sequentially as we began to see the early signs of the tax reinvestment abating, continued scale benefits of our high-quality recurring revenue and positive impact of our operational effectiveness program. Free cash flow -- free cash flow through June 30 was up a very strong 23% to $602 million and our free cash flow conversion was 91%. Our second priority to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. The demand for Fiserv account processing solutions continue to be strong with 13 wins in the quarter, six on D&A, which included a strong showing with larger credit unions.For example, world [Phonetic] credit union with $1.6 billion in assets, expanded their Fiserv relationship by selecting D&A and other complementary solutions, including teller capture, item processing and Nautilus to support their growing commercial and mortgage portfolios. In addition, highway credit union with over $1 billion in assets and velocity credit union with over $800 million in assets, both selected D&A in the quarter to utilize our modern and open technology platform to enhance their members experiences. Card solutions continued their strong sales, signing First Mid Bank & Trust with $3.5 billion in assets to our debit processing solution in the quarter.We also added Alabama Credit Union with nearly $1 billion in assets, who selected a full suite of debit, credit and card production services to facilitate a more integrated and enhanced member experience. JD Bank with more than $800 million in assets enhanced their Fiserv relationship by selecting ATM Managed Services. One of our newest card capabilities coming from the Elan acquisition. This service will allow JD Bank to update their ATM fleet to the forefront of upcoming software and compliance mandates and better serve their customers.We've signed seven clients for ATM Managed Services and have added more than 250 institutions to the pipeline since the transaction closed last October. Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. Payments modernization continues to be top of mind for progressive financial institutions, which translated to five Dovetail payment hub decisions in the quarter, including Sterling National Bank for nearly $30 billion of assets. We also signed Eastern Bank, which is one of the largest and oldest mutual banks in the country, with over $11 billion in assets and locations, serving communities in Eastern Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Rhode Island. We signed a very large bank in the Middle East, which selected Dovetail to advance their capabilities through a single platform to process payments transactions globally.Lastly, First National Bank of Pennsylvania, with nearly $34 billion in assets chose our Dovetail payments platform along with our Immediate Funds solution as another way to drive value to their customers by supporting demand for real-time access to funds and improving the overall deposit experience. We remain bullish about the strength and leadership of our full complement of end to end payments capabilities, both now and into the future.With that, let me turn the call over to Bob, to provide more detail on our financial results. -- Thank you, Jeff and good afternoon. As Jeff mentioned, we feel good about our performance for the first half of the year and are in a strong position to achieve our full-year goals. Adjusted revenue was up 7% to $1.5 billion in the quarter and 6% to $2.9 billion year-to-date as a result of growth in high quality recurring revenue and new revenue from the Elan acquisition. These quarterly results were particularly encouraging, given the significant prior year license revenue compare.Internal revenue growth was 4% in both the quarter and year to date, led by strong performance across our card services, electronic payments, output solutions and account processing businesses. Foreign currency negatively impacted internal revenue growth by 20 basis points in both the quarter and year-to-date periods. Adjusted operating income increased 7% to $470 million in the quarter and is up 5% to $927 million through June 30. Our year-to-date results include a headwind from our lending transaction that closed in Q1 of last year.Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was flat at 32.4%, which is better than our internal expectations. The expected the decline in license revenue, the Elan acquisition and continued investments that we described in Q1 had a collective 90 basis point headwind on adjusted operating margin in the quarter. Sequentially, adjusted operating margin improved 50 basis points on stronger operating performance and lower investments. Year-to-date adjusted operating margin was down 40 basis points to 32.1% compared to last year and was better than our internal expectations for the period.The first-half results include headwinds of more than 80 basis points, including more than 50 basis points from investments and 30 basis points from the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. The investments in client implementations and the tax reinvestment carryover expense, which we described during our first quarter , began to abate this quarter and will further moderate in the second half of the year. The acquisition impact will anniversary in the fourth quarter.Adjusted earnings per share was up 9% to $0.82 in the quarter and increased 11% to $1.66 year to date, positioning us well to achieve our 34th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth. The Payments segment adjusted revenue was up 11% to $855 million in the quarter and 10% to $1.7 billion year to date. Internal revenue growth increased sequentially 120 basis points to 5% in the quarter and is up 4% year to date, led primarily by our card services, electronic payments and Output Solutions businesses.Adjusted operating income for the Payments segment grew 12% to $303 million in the quarter and 9% to $590 million year to date. Adjusted operating margin was up 140 basis points sequentially to 35.4% in the quarter and increased 40 basis points over the prior year. The year-over-year improvement was due primarily to continued high quality revenue growth and gains in productivity, partially offset by a 60 basis point negative impact from acquisitions.Adjusted operating margin for the first six months of the year was down 50 basis points to 34.7%, which includes pressure from the Elan transaction and the impact of first half investments which will subside in the second half of the year. Debit transactions grew high-single digits in both the quarter and year to date. Mobiliti ASP subscribers grew 16% in the quarter to nearly 9 million as consumers continued to embrace digital banking services.We also saw mobility business clients increase 2% as commercial customers also migrate to digital experiences. P2P transactions, which include both Popmoney and Zelle were up 120% in the quarter, and grew 21% sequentially. Zelle transactions again nearly quadrupled in the quarter and the number of live clients more than doubled sequentially. We also signed nearly 60 clients in the quarter and remain enthusiastic about the growth prospects for Zelle and the positive impact it should have on the banking system.For the financial segment, adjusted revenue was up 2% to $604 million for the quarter and for the year to date was generally consistent with last year at $1.2 billion, which includes the Lending Transaction impact which anniversaried at the end of Q1. Internal revenue growth was 2% in the quarter and 4% year to date, led by our account and item processing businesses. These results include the very difficult license revenue compare in the quarter, which shows the benefits of underlying processing revenue growth.Adjusted operating income in the Financial segment was up 1% to $203 million in the quarter and for the first six months was consistent with prior year at $402 million. Adjusted operating margin was down 30 basis points to 33.7% in the quarter primarily due to the tough compare from prior year's strong license revenue.Adjusted operating margin through June 30 was up 10 basis points to 33.5% due to growth in revenue -- growth in recurring revenue and solid operational execution, partially offset by product investments and the difficult compare in the license revenue. The adjusted corporate operating loss was $36 million for the quarter and $65 million year to date, which is in line with our expectations.The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.6% and 18.8% for the first half of the year. We've seen some additional tax benefits in the first half of the year and accordingly now expect our full year tax rate to bias toward the lower end of our adjusted effective tax rate guidance range of 22% to 23%.Free cash flow was strong in the quarter and was up 23% to $602 million through June 30, an increase of more than $100 million versus the prior year. Fee cash flow conversion was 91% for the first half of the year, which was pressured a bit by tax payments, along with the timing of capital expenditures, which were planned a bit heavier in the first half of the year. We continue to expect our free cash flow conversion to be at least 105% for the year.As you know, our share repurchase program remains deferred in conjunction with the First Data transaction. There were 393 million shares outstanding and 24 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at June 30. As Jeff mentioned, we have raised the funds to refinance First Data's debt with $12 billion in senior notes in June and July across multiple currencies. We raised $9 billion of US dollar debt, $1.7 billion in euro-denominated notes and $1.3 billion in sterling-denominated notes. These senior notes have an average tenure of 11.6 years. Including the impact of hedges, the combination of the public debt, along with $5 billion term loan leads to combined interest rate of 3.47%, which is roughly $120 million lower than the expected annual interest cost at the time of the First Data transaction announcement.Total debt outstanding as of June 30 was $13.8 billion, which includes the proceeds from the US dollar portion of the debt raise. The additional $3 billion raised in Europe was not completed until July 1. Upon closing, we expect 75% of our debt to be fixed. We had a pro forma debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.4 times after netting the proceeds received in June against our total debt balance.With that, let me turn the call back to Jeff. -- Thanks, Bob. Sales performance was up a strong 17% in the quarter and is up 14% year to date. We saw solid performance in several areas, including our account processing businesses, card solutions and Dovetail. Sales performance has been increasing significantly, up 22% over the last nine months, which we believe is especially meaningful in light of the First Data transaction. The domestic pipeline also remains strong and up 3% in the quarter and 11% sequentially. Integrated sales was up 22% in the quarter and is up 4% in the first half of the year, reflecting the compelling Fiserv integrated value proposition.We continue to demonstrate our operational effectiveness competency, achieving $13 million of benefits in the quarter and $25 million of savings year-to-date driven largely by procurement and labor initiatives. We are on track to meet our $50 million target and close out our five year $250 million program, a full year early. As per guidance, we're on track to achieve our full year financial commitments, buoyed by a stronger than anticipated first half of the year. We continue to expect our full year internal revenue growth rate to be in a range of 4.5% to 5% and that second half growth will be moderately higher than the first.We continue to expect adjusted earnings per share to increase between 10% and 14% in a range of $3.39 to $3.52 for the year with a bias at or above the midpoint of the range. We also expect adjusted operating margin to expand by at least 50 basis points for the year and that free cash flow conversion will be more than a 105%.Lastly, as a reminder, our 2019 guidance does not include or anticipate any impact from the First Data transaction, which we expect will close Monday. However, we will provide updated guidance for the combined company, along with a very preliminary look into 2020 when we convene our third quarter call. We also expect to provide historical financial information in mid-September, using our go-forward accounting treatment for the combined company. For modeling it close, we suggest you combine the guidance provided by both Fiserv and First Data in today's earnings releases and incorporate adjustments such as stock-based compensation for First Data, which as you know, we include in our numbers, lower interest expense and also include a modest estimate for synergy benefits for the last five months of the year.We expect synergies to ramp through the balance of 2019 and deliver a much larger P&L impact next year. For Fiserv historians you may know that on July 31, we will celebrate our 35 anniversary. We're fortunate to have been part of the proud history of Fiserv and are even more excited for what we believe will be an amazing next chapter for the Company. The opportunity to partner with our clients to help them serve their customers is a compelling reason to exist.And at the same time, we've created meaningful value for shareholders, delivering a more than 33,000% return since going public in 1986 and as good as that sounds, we know our success is a result of the thousands of associates who have contributed to Fiserv over the years, along with the more than 24,000 current associates who come to work each day singularly focused on delivering excellence to clients. We can't wait for the next 35 years to start.With that, operator, let's open the line for questions.Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open. -- Hi, good evening guys. And great to be joining your call for the first time. I wanted to ask a question about the rollout of contact list in the US. It looks, I guess, tentatively like that might actually be coming. Can you just comment on how your bank customers are thinking about the rollout of contactless, meaning do they have specific plans for issuing contactless cards and on what timeline and then how do you expect that to impact your business over the next six to 12 months? Thank you. -- Sure. Thanks, Lisa and great to have you. We are actually seeing -- starting to see an uptick in demand for contactless or dual interface. We had not planned very much for that in our numbers in 2019, thinking that we would start to see that tick up in 2020 and 2021. And having contactless available in places like the New York subway, we think is helping that and obviously, the brands are focused on that. So we issue about 100 million or so payments cards -- produced 100 million or so payment cards per year. We think that could actually be impactful. We don't see it having a significant impact in 2019, but we're optimistic that we'll see that roll in, certainly in 2020 and 2021 as we see that move throughout the system.The other thing that we're seeing just as interestingly is we also do a fair amount around the prepaid providers and we're seeing the prepaid providers start to issue EMV and we believe that a number of them will actually jump straight to contactless. So we're feeling good about that. We like that as a tailwind and we'll -- we'll continue to monitor that. -- All right. Terrific. Thank you. -- Thank you. -- Thanks.Our next question is coming from Dave Koning with Baird. Your line is now open. -- Yeah, hey, guys. -- Hey, Dave. -- Thanks. Nice job. -- Thank you. -- So, I mean as a historian looking back at the last 10 years, it seems like both you and First Data are putting up some of the best core underlying growth that you have. And I'm wondering a lot of it seems company specific, both of you are doing well in the market, signing well, how much of it's just the backdrop getting better and maybe what is driving that right now. -- Yeah, thanks, Dave. I mean we're -- obviously we are both continuing to run our companies separately and we'll continue to do that until -- until Monday morning or we expect to continue to do that until Monday morning. I mean, we know that First Data has been making a number of investments both inside the US and outside the US. We're just as pleased as everyone else to see GBS North America post a nice 5% number and the rest of the world is looking quite strong and I think that's just a matter of seeing the cumulative effect of the work that Frank and his team have done. And it's one of the things that we talk about, as you know, Dave, we really thought that there was a mismatch between the work that the team had been doing and the way that investors have been looking at that. So from that perspective, we see that coming together and we believe that as you put us and them into a single integrated company, focused on driving innovation and excellence for clients, that will drive incremental growth to the extent of the -- at least $500 million of synergies, and hopefully more.And then -- and then you're seeing on our side just the continuing aggregate effect of bringing on high quality revenue and then having some nice successes in the sales area, whether it be D&A, architect card and then the entire digital ecosystem. So Mobiliti continues to do well, and we talked about Zelle. We're seeing real momentum in Zelle and we're excited about that and we believe that will continue for the next -- probably for the next six to eight quarters. -- Okay, great. And just -- and just one, I guess, follow-up. This is kind of just a financial question, but included in the guidance for stand-alone Fiserv, are you including that month of $12 billion or so of extra debt or is that almost like you're not including that in the $3.39 to $3.52 guidance? -- Yeah, Dave we are not including that. That's a transaction-related cost that you will see that adjusted out of the non-GAAP results. -- Got you. Great. Well, thanks guys. Nice job. -- Thanks, Dave.The next question is from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. -- Good afternoon and congratulations on the strong results and thanks for taking my question. I guess if you, I mean Jeff you articulated several areas on the revenue synergy side. Most of which you talked about before, but in the time you've had to contemplate the transaction over the last six months, which is maybe one or two revenue synergy items that you are most incremental excited about or that you didn't really anticipate before, I think international, you mentioned is one, which I don't recall you're talking about before, any color on that would be helpful. -- Sure. Thanks, Jim. We have been very pleased with the work that the teams have done in identifying a large categories of synergies, everything from expanding the way technology such as point of sale lending will look, focused on how do we help merchants get their money faster, the use of data in terms of thinking about how to -- how to make better -- better decisions around fraud and the like. And then outside the US, we -- one of the things that because we were pretty small in Fiserv outside the US and First Data is much larger, we've been able to take a number of the solutions that we have and move them through the -- sorry not move them through, but look at how do we move them through the First Data distribution system or the First Data network outside the US. So we think that's going to be interesting and also looking at where we have some larger clients where First Data may not trying to leverage those kinds of relationships. So I don't see us creating a lot of new innovation in terms of putting the international businesses together per se in the base business, but we do see interesting ways that we'll invest there in the future. -- That's helpful, thanks. And then maybe sort of a macro comment in terms of your bank clients and what they're telling you right now. Just wondering if the A, the change in the interest rate environment and the reversal there and or B, any change in the M&A environment is impacting their spending plans as you see it heading into the back half of this year and 2020? -- Yeah. And it's a good question, Jim. I mean we obviously know banks are not excited about the fact that the fed has changed their stance on interest rates. I think it was a little bit of a foregone conclusion or has been at least for the last quarter or so. That said, we are not seeing any change in the demand structure for the institutions that we're serving and that's showing up both in terms of -- of the -- the large event Forum that we hosted back in May, we can see it in our pipeline. And then the manifestation of course in sales and the fact that we're going to -- we believe that we will achieve our full year objectives.So that's all to say that the need to spend money on technology is not changing. You can see that in how the large banks talked in their -- in their calls and we see it and we continue to see money shifting from supporting legacy technologies to trying to do some of the newer call them digital based or front-end kinds of experiences. So right now for what we can see, we continue to feel like the spending environment remains consistent for now. We're obviously watching it closely and so that, that looks in good shape. And then on the M&A front, we continue to see, generally the same amount of activity as when rates come down a little bit, you see banks looking more for scale and that's certainly happening. -- Thank you. -- Thank you.The next question is from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. -- Hey, thanks guys. -- Hey, Darren. -- Congrats on the approvals on the deal closing, first of all, but like you just alluded to the strong growth at First Data, especially in the merchant acquiring side and again I touched on this last quarter, but are these trends the type of growth rates you guys anticipated in your deal accretion and pro forma run rate, are they coming in better than you thought? And then just while I'm on the topic of First Data, is there anything you can update around the JV relationship with BAM just given how much noise there has been in the market around it? -- Sure, sure. So I would say that when we put our original models together and thought about it, I don't know that we were deeply focused on what would be happening in 2019. It was our belief that First Data had been doing things, both organically and through the allocation of capital that would, that would show up. And then we didn't believe that that investors were giving First Data all the due that they should. And I think we're seeing that manifest now, and we're hopeful and strategically focused on making sure that we make the right decisions, so that will continue. So we -- we feel -- I would say that we feel quite good about the performance that we've seen to date, as well as the guidance for the remainder of the year.As it relates to the JV, I mean obviously we've had lots and lots of questions about the JV, which expires next June. Both Fiserv and First Data have long-term multi-solution relationships with Bank -- with Bank of America and we have every reason to believe that's going to continue. And we know that First Data and Bank of America are continuing to work on a plan that makes sense.What I can say is, during the diligence process, we put a lot of time into understanding all of the outcomes or the likely outcomes at least that we expected could come through the JV. And since that point, we've continued to make sure that we're working with the bank to understand, what's going on and we're quite comfortable with all of the different scenarios. And what I can't say, and I think this is really important is that, currently we don't anticipate a financial outcome that creates any meaningful negative impact to First Data's earnings and free cash flow for at least the next three to five years. And there are actually some scenarios in which a structural change could be accretive to the numbers once you get past that point in the future.So from that standpoint, we feel pretty good about that. From a timing perspective, we do expect this issue to be better understood in the third quarter. So we think that the parties are coming together to create a situation that makes sense. I would also say, very importantly, that the Bank of America JV, the different outcomes that we can see the scenarios are fully factored into our transaction accretion estimates, which as you know is 20% to adjusted EPS in year one, and 40% at the full run rate. So, Darren. We think that we've done the work, we think we understand the risks, the pluses and the minuses and we just don't see it having a meaningful negative impact, post closing. -- That's really helpful, Jeff. Thanks. Just one quick follow-up is just one of the exciting parts of these synergies we are hoping for is that Clover would be cross-sold through the banks pretty quickly, given I think sort of the cloud-based approach where you guys manage the -- banks help manage the bank's websites. And just curious if you still think that can happen soon in terms of maybe even second half '19 where Clover starts to be distributed in the near term? -- Yeah. And, Darren. We are -- we said at the time and our planning teams have been working well together on the idea of bank merchant. I would say we are actually a bit more bullish today even and we were pretty bullish then, but we're even more bullish today. And it's really on two vectors. The first one is the traditional in branch enablement of Clover and then we're also doing some really interesting things on the digital enablement front and we fully expect that after we close on July 29 that we will be in the market and see proof points come in the second half of the year, about the power of the combination. In terms of providing value to the merchant customers of the banks. -- Okay, that's great. Thanks guys. -- Thanks, Darren. -- Thanks, Darren.The next question comes from Brett Huff with Stephens, Inc. Your line is now open. -- Good afternoon, guys and congrats on getting closer on the deal. -- Thanks, Brett. -- Thanks, Brett. -- Question on the mix of front and back office tech spending, we kind of heard over the last 18 months, I think you guys have seen this too. Folks, certainly not ignoring the back office and trying to untangle the spaghetti there, but definitely shifting more toward switching this on-boarding on the front, you mentioned a little bit about that, could you illuminate [Phonetic] any acceleration on that side? Or any changes in how people are perceiving this? Specifically, are there more and more banks that are now in the category of, they need to do better digital on boarding and kind of how fast is that evolving? -- Yeah, Brett. There is no question that the majority of the emphasis at -- in really all sized institutions have been focused kind of at the -- the edge of the bank, right. So at the point of intersection between the customers and the financial institution and creating whether it be digital on boarding or any kind of digitization of the variety of financial experiences that customers engage in with their institution. So that's been a big piece of the focus.What we are seeing is, and we announced one of the proof points of it today was around our Dovetail or our market leading payment hub technology. We had, I think five signings in the core -- in the quarter. And that's really about enabling pieces of the back office. So think about it as payments modernization to keep up with -- what the real time right now world that's happening at the edge.And so we are seeing a lot of exploration into that call it the end-to-end that's necessary to ultimately deliver those experiences to the retail and the commercial customers and the small business customers of the bank. So, we are seeing that happening. If you said, is it more about the using your words to spaghetti or more about the experience, it's more about the experience, but I will say that the need to bring the solutions together is making its way back into some of the infrastructure and turning -- turning kind of some of the legacy into more modern systems. And that's going to take a long time to get done, but that's where we see people into RFPs and taking a look at what do we need to do at Fiserv, you see more -- more end to end on that front. -- That's helpful. And the follow-up, another kind of product question is, I and I think others are excited about having a couple of the big mega deal companies kind of own if you will the relationship, both on the funding account, on the consumer side, the DDA, and then the merchant point of sale and things and maybe some interesting near term easy wins to make transactions more frictionless or maybe also little more science fiction down the road, can you -- now that you've studied this combination for a while, can you talk any more about how you're seeing those opportunities evolve? -- So and Brett obviously, you've noticed for a long time, you know that's one of the areas that we've been focused on really since back to 2012 when we bought CashEdge to really accelerate our focus on P2P through Popmoney and obviously now Zelle. I mean we're very, very excited about the opportunity to use the -- you call that the funding account, the transactional account as a way for consumers to interact -- interact with -- with any of their providers in a -- in a more frictionless way. And I think that's going to manifest in a variety of different forms over the next several years.And for us, we just want to make sure that we're in this, we think the scale of First Data with kind of roughly 40% of the merchant footprint and the scale of Fiserv with over 100 million transaction accounts, we like that, we like the optionality and we're excited to work with our partners, with financial institutions and ultimately with some corporates to see what's out there that can deliver better service.I think for now, we're really studying that. We'll be able to study it a lot closer once we close, but we're very excited about that and we're going to continue to plant flags around areas like Zelle because we think that is one of the differentiators to make some of that, what I think you call that science fiction some of that actually happen. -- Great. That's all I need. Thanks for the time. -- Thank you. -- Thanks, Brett.And the next question is from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is now open. -- Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about revenue synergies, more in the context of timing. Now that you've had a little time to dig in and look under the hood, what is your kind of most updated thinking on which specific opportunities are most kind of realizable or in the near term sort of quickly realizable understanding that your -- the bulk of the benefit we'll see probably in '20 rather than '19, which opportunities feel the most sort of readily achievable? -- Yeah, I mean it is when we -- when we had talked about this originally, we talked about kind of the payments and network innovation opportunities playing an important role in the near term call it over the next 12 to 18 months. We are going to be very, very focused on the -- on selling. I mean we're excited to have a chance to get out of the blocks a little bit faster than we thought. We think bank merchant is a very good opportunity in the near term and the reality is, is that we have businesses like our biller solutions business where we do a little part of the -- the overall acquiring with the -- with these providers and being able to bring First Data in and having them be able to bring us and we see a lot of, we call it integrated sales, but a lot of real high value cross sell that can move pretty quickly.Again, we won't know until we hit. The problem that we have to the extent that there is a timing problem is, as you know, Ramsey, we have to shell it and then we have to implement it and then it has to go live. We like bank merchant. We think some of those things going to happen quickly. Some of the network and payments opportunities we think can happen quickly. And so we see those to be a little bit faster than the others, but we're going to be focused on that and you'll hear us talk about how we're doing on that each and every quarter. -- Great. I want to just -- one follow-up I wanted to ask about the industry more broadly. It just seems like the universe is scaling up your M&A, what's your view on how this broader processing industry looks into five years? Do you think the space just continues to really dramatically pull up. So even players with the scale that you guys are sort of amassing will get larger and larger and larger or do you think there is some measure of stability that we've achieved with these kind of specific deals kind of having been consummated recently? -- Yeah. It's a really great question and I fear that we won't have time to go fully back and forth. I would say that if you would have asked many of the industry participants that you're referring to five years ago, if they would have thought that five years later that the industry would have taken the steps it had taken, I suspect that people would say no and certainly if you have asked how quickly, if at all changed, I think you would get an absolute, you've got to be kidding me.From our perspective, we see opportunities to deploy capital every single day. But it's important for us to stay really focused on one of the key drivers to the more than 33,000% return we've had over the last 33 years as a public company, and that's making sure we're allocating capital to drive value for shareholders. So we're going to remain focused on the -- with the capital allocation strategy that we've used and if occasionally, there is something meaningful to do, we'll certainly consider it, but we see lots of ways to drive value without having to do major scale transactions. I think we'll have to see how they come together over the next few years. We're just really, really focused on how do we drive as much cash flow for shareholders that we can and make sure we deploy that capital to build the most value possible. -- Very helpful, thanks. -- Thank you.The next question is from Daniel Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. -- Thanks, good afternoon. -- Hi, Dan. -- How you doing? -- Good. -- I had a question about the kind of fintechs and payments and really other areas increasingly becoming these kind of quasi deposit gatherers. And here, I'm thinking like Square's debit and Venmo's debit card, were there clearly trapping cash now where they used to let it kind of be more of a straight-through process with these -- with these entities. And so I'm just wondering Jeff, when you look at your portfolio, what are the -- what are the products or services that you've created to help kind of come back as competitive threats for your bank today? -- Yeah, it's really, it's an interesting time and whether -- whether you're talking about the Chimes or the N26s and lots of other things are going on, whether they be traditional banks are non-traditional banks, PayPal of course and -- and I put Venmo as the hero example of what has to happen to make sure that the Payments -- I'm sorry that the deposit balances are being trapped in the banks. So I think that's one of them.I think to the extent that we can make sure that we are enabling more commerce to happen at point of sale and whether that be through better decisioning models or point of sale lending right credit are being available at the point of thought, those kinds of things so that consumers don't go to other places. I think the whole intersection of digital experience better decisions based on data. I think we'll see that become very important.Venmo is a little bit of a -- of a capsule. And what can you put in it and around it to make sure not Venmo, I'm sorry, Zelle what do you put around that to make sure that it's driving value for the financial institution clients and then the other thing is, I think you'll see us as part of the $0.5 billion that we're going to invest. I think you'll see a fair amount of that go to the points of intersection between financial experience, commerce and making sure that banks are winning with their -- with their deposit gathering. -- That's great. The follow-up question I had is the $120 million of interest savings that you just talked about on the financings. Just philosophically, how should we be thinking about that. Are you planning on letting that flow through into the pro forma model early or are you viewing that opportunity as a way in which to invest more quickly in this transaction's integration? Thank you. -- Yeah, Dan, it's Bob. I would look at it as an opportunity to grow our earnings per share from a standpoint of invest back in the Company. We're certainly planning to appropriately invest as needed to get at the synergies as well at both on the cost and the revenue standpoint and that's fully baked into the model. As Jeff pointed out in the prepared remarks, we're very comfortable that we will achieve the -- at least 20% earnings accretion in year one, and 40% at full run rate synergies. That $120 million of lower interest certainly helps with that. It also generates some cash flow, allows us to pay debt down faster and get back into share repurchase. -- Fantastic. Thank you. -- Thank you.The next question is from Matthew O'Neill with Autonomous Research Company. Your line is now open. -- Yeah, hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. My only question at this point is really just a follow-up, I think to Darren's question earlier around the BAM's JV and how that process is going. I know it's still a little premature for you guys to talk about it. One thing Jeff that you said that I was hoping I could just glean some more color from with that there'll be no impact for three to five years. Is there any kind of read through to that, there is this view that the ownership percentage might come down and maybe some discussion on the exclusivity ending and so certain merchants might be rolling off as their contracts kind of expire over that sort of three to five year phase? Or is that just, this is how far we can sort of confidently see into the future for now and we'll update you more as we hear how the deal progresses? -- Yeah, Matt, I mean, and thanks for asking the follow-up. The -- what I was trying to say is, for at least the next three to five years, and it really is a matter of, it's hard to look that far into the future in a scenario that is not fully baked, but there's no cliff at the end of that. It's just a matter of saying, we think that should give investors confidence that there is nothing to really worry about at this stage and that as the ultimate facts come to light, we'll work very cooperatively with and no matter what the scenario is, to make sure that both sides are being optimized in what they're doing. And I do think one of the unique things here is, this is not -- this arrangement no matter how it ends up playing out, It's not a win lose scenario, It's going to be a win-win scenario and everyone feels like that's been the case. Obviously, we haven't been in the direct conversations, but that's really the outcomes that are being driven here. -- Got it. Thank you very much. And then just as a final follow-up on that, if I can. Has there been any sort of cross discussion on Bank of America regarding the CheckFree relationship, which I think is next up and maybe 2023 I suspect not, but just figured out too. -- Yeah, and we just to be even more blunt, we have not had any direct conversations with the bank. We are operating as separate companies on the joint venture discussion and there hasn't on for Fiserv, there hasn't been any specific conversation pointing out that. We have a very good relationship with the bank on that front and we're always looking to make sure that we're helping Bank of America to continue to be the number one digital bank in the US and that's an important part of it strategy. -- Thanks a lot. I'll leave it there. Appreciate it.And the next question is from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is now open. -- Hi. Good afternoon. Good to talk to you. Jeff, you mentioned and highlighted Dovetail as part of Fiserv's real-time payments, infrastructure offerings and efforts. BillPay is a product that or service that is back in the news these days. And I wonder if you can just elaborate on how you think that market's evolving, whether or not the consolidator model maybe can clawbacks some share from biller direct and to what extent, if any, the merger maybe adds value, and helps you accelerate that shift or drive more bill pay volume across your platform? -- Yeah. Thanks for the question. That's actually one of my favorite topics. It is an interesting thing because your point of it's a little bit, kind of a little bit in the rear view in terms of people talking about it. It's so interesting because you see all kinds of people trying to get into the business and you wonder, well, why are they trying to do that? And I think they're trying to do that because we all understand that the ability to facilitate payments for a consumer or for a small business, especially through this consolidated model, is way more convenient than website hopping to make that happen.The key is, is how do you bring in the biller and merchant information to make that experience top notch. The other piece of it is ultimately having real time, money movement, real time payments that you can consistently and constantly use across all kinds of billers, is I think the next big twist and the next big point that's going to change that value proposition. And so again, we're working with a number of our partners. It's one of the things that we're very excited about the work with First Data. We think they've got a lot of interesting connectivity to make that happen. And I do think that it may take longer than people understand, but you're going to see bill payment be at the front of real time consumer payments.And so whether you're using your illustrative hypothetical wallet to make a bill payment in real time, or to engage in commerce in real time, or to make a P2P payment in real time, I think you're going to see that come together. And it's one of the reasons why technologies such as Dovetail are so important. As you see new clearings coming online especially here in the US. -- And as a follow-up to that, I always appreciate your insight on the subject. As a follow-up, do you see debit cards generally, or even in specific verticals playing more of a role in bill payment? Or do you think sort of direct ACH BillPay is going to be the -- is still going to be sort of ubiquitous? -- Again, this is a little bit of the world according to Jeff and I want to make sure that I'm clear about that. If you think about the card space as a pan-based space, right, the 16-digit number, and then you think about the transactional account as an account number model. I see them both having pluses and minuses. The connectivity to the debit card implies speed, real time, safety and securely [Phonetic] and I think that matters. And so figuring out how to bring them together, I think is an interesting way to look at it. -- Thanks a lot. -- Thank you.The next question is from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. -- Hey Jeff. Hope you're well. Jeff, I wanted to ask you a little bit about share repurchase. When you look at after the companies combined, are there benchmarks that you're looking as in, is it strictly a leverage ratio issue? Is it that you've achieved a certain amount of cost savings? Is it that you've invested so much money? Is it what the economy is doing? What's the decision point for you to go back in the market and kind of do what Fiserv has always done, which is return a ton of capital back to shareholders? -- Yeah. Thanks for asking that question, Kartik primarily because this was the first quarter, I think in my entire tenure where we were unable to buyback a share of stock. And I don't -- for people who know Fiserv and know me, that's not what we aspire to do. So our objective is to look at our leverage ratios, to pay down debt to grow EBITDA and to deploy the capital that we're going to create, the $4 billion or so of free cash flow that we're going to have a few years out, so that we can make sure that we're building shareholder value in a way that we have -- consistent with how we have over the last, at least the last 14 or 15 years.And it'll also obviously depend on our valuation and everything else and we'll continue to use the same methodology that we have historically. And so the real answer is, we'll do it as quickly as we can. As you know, we did not suspend our program. We deferred it, and so I would expect us to get into the market as soon as we have the right level of comfort that we've met our commitments to the rating agencies and that we can build shareholder value effectively and efficiently and consistently. -- And there's just one last one, Jeff. As you look at your community and regional bank customers, as you know, they're dealing with the net interest margin squeeze possibly, but they're also dealing with investing in all these digital solutions, but unable to get rid of some of the other legacy solutions cost continued to increase for them. How do you see them managing that and do you anticipate that the investment that they're continuing to make will -- that they will be able to do so in the future? -- Yeah. I mean it's a -- there is a bit of a squeeze in the community bank space whether they be banks or credit unions in the community financial institutions space for the reasons that you're mentioning. And I think one of the opportunities for us is to build products and solutions that will allow these institutions to take advantage of digital, which is a more cost effective way to interact, but also to build revenue.It's one of the reasons why we're even more excited today about the bank merchant opportunity because we think we can see a lot of white space out there, where community-based financial institutions are not optimizing the amount of merchant revenue that they can create. And we're looking at how do we help systemically using our technology to better optimize revenue.So it's a combination of how do we create more revenue, there are certainly going to be -- there's going to be always pressure on costs as there have been for the entire 35 years of our existence. And then lastly, it really is about how do you use this digital ecosystem to be more efficient? I think that's the trifecta that we're at least focused on. -- Thank you. Appreciate it. -- Thanks, Kartik.The next question is from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is now open. -- Thanks. My questions have actually been answered, asked and answered, so thanks and congrats on the close. -- Thanks, Glenn. -- Thanks, Glenn.The next question is from Timothy Willi with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. -- Thanks and good afternoon. Just a housekeeping question around the balance sheet and sort of a discussion around debt and interest. So I think you said you did $12 billion of notes across variety of currencies. First Data had roughly $17 billion, could you just sort of any insights around that $5 billion gap in terms of that that's where the priority to pay down first or if there's possibly some other activity that will happen regarding that we should think about? -- Yeah, Tim. Thanks for the question. We have arranged a $5 billion bank term loan that will round out the $17 billion we need to refinance. So the combination of that $5 billion term loan and the $12 billion of notes that we raised in late June, early July will cover the full $17 billion needed. -- Okay, awesome. Thanks so much for clarifying that. -- Thanks, Tim.Our last question will be from Vasu Govil with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Your line is now open. -- Hi, thanks. I appreciate you guys squeezing me in last minute. I wanted to extend my congratulations for getting all the approvals. -- Thank you. -- Jeff, I just wanted to follow-up on the discussion regarding international synergies before. Can you elaborate a little bit on what type of products you are focused on there? Are we thinking about potentially selling core banking products into First Data's distribution outside or more on the payment side? And then if you could also talk about what kind of capital investments might be acquired to enable that? -- Sure. So I would say -- right now we have one core banking platform called Signature that we sell outside the US. We also have a -- we also sell that inside the US. And so we'll continue to focus on that. But really we're most excited about leveraging the existing First Data footprint to try to go-to-market with some of our digital products, which we have a good footprint around the world.Dovetail, we're very excited about Dovetail, payment hubs. The modernization of the payments ecosystem is happening actually more rapidly outside the US and inside the US and Dovetail was a UK company, when we acquired it with most of their presence outside the US and so for us, gaining more distribution is a great example.We also have some strong cash-oriented products, risk products, some fraud products, data warehousing, a number of different products that we can just add on or hopefully add onto the relationships that we have and we don't see those being significant investments. The other thing that we have is First Data has a nice footprint of data centers outside the US. We don't have data centers outside the US and the ability to take some of our products and not just deliver them on a licensed basis, but deliver them on a hosted basis, will allow us to build not just revenue, but really the high quality recurring revenue that we strive to deliver. -- Thank you. That's very helpful. -- And thank you everyone for joining us today. We are -- we always appreciate your support and we're really excited to come Monday to close the transaction with First Data, and start the new Fiserv. So thanks everyone.

The company reiterated its full-year guidance of 5% to 6% organic revenue growth and 6% to 8% adjusted  growth.Image source: Getty Images.At the time of the acquisition announcement, Fiserv was paying the equivalent of $22 billion for First Data, roughly a 29% premium. First Data's shareholders will receive .303 shares of Fiserv for every share of First Data owned, meaning that investors will now be invested in the combined efforts of both companies. After closing, Fiserv will own 57.5% of the combined company, with First Data shareholders getting 42.5%.Each company has large market share in its complementary side of the payments processing industry. Fiserv generally serves banks and financial institutions with digital and electronic processing capabilities, while First Data is focused on the merchant side, acquiring merchant customers and providing them with digital tools such as , First Data's digital point-of-sale terminal.There are a few overlapping businesses between the two companies, such as First Data's Star debit card service and Fiserv's Accel, which could provide fodder for cost synergies.

As such, some may wonder if the acquisition was done out of defensive necessity amid new competitive threats.As part of the deal, Total System Services will get 0.8101 Global Payments shares for every share of Total System Services, which equates to an equity value of $21.5 billion.

The combined company will be battling against the other two major merged players as well as fintech upstarts such as  and Europe's . That's a tall task, and at least one analyst isn't so bullish.Dan Dolev of Nomura Instinet thinks the acquisition is a bit desperate, and points to Square's cash app and new debit card potentially threatening Total System's Netspend service for the underbanked. In addition, Dolev points out that Total System's revenues were up only 4.8% and North America network fees were only up 3% in the first quarter, compared with network operator  having 8% volume growth, showing Total System may be lagging the industry for some reason.That, combined with the fact that the Global Payments-Total System Services tie-up was the last of the big payments megamergers, makes me cautious on Total System and Global Payments for now, with a preference for either the payments disruptors or the earlier mergers in the space.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Of course, the report could have a major impact on SQ stock.Source: \n\tThe global payments industry is a\u00a0. And the financial technology (fintech) apps revolution is quickly changing the way traditional banks, credit-card issuers and mobile-payments companies work with businesses as well as with their retail customers. Therefore, over the long term, I would not bet against , the fintech payments company that is regarded as a disruptive force in the sector. In the short-term, though, SQ stock is likely to be choppy.Square was co-founded in February 2009 by Jack Dorsey, who is also the CEO of \u00a0(NYSE:). This innovative financial services company has expanded quickly,\u00a0 with its unique dongles for mobile phones that enable virtually everyone to accept credit-card payments.Square has come a long way since its more humble beginnings. Although SQ started as a payments company, in recent quarters it has introduced a range of software, hardware and apps for small businesses and individual clients. Square\u2019s ecosystem also includes business loans, payroll services, point-of-sale solutions, and omnichannel commerce.For example, SQ\u2019s peer-to-peer mobile payments product,  has more than 15 million monthly active customers. Square charges businesses that accept Cash App payments 2.75% per transaction.Management would like to see  become more like\u00a0 whose core customers are small businesses as well as individuals. As the younger generations especially are making a drastic shift to using electronic payments, Square would like to benefit from that growth.Indeed, SQ has recently applied to become a traditional bank. Becoming a bank could jump-start Square\u2019s long-term growth, eventually driving SQ stock higher.In other words, through various growth initiatives, SQ is now aiming to become a major player in the \u00a0sphere as well as a small business platform that offers a wide range of services.When Square acquires a new client, it may be able to sell other services to the client.\u00a0 Therefore, the future of SQ stock is partly dependent on the number of new clients it can attain and partly on the range of services it can offer.Released on May 1, its most recent earnings report and\u00a0provide a good overview of the growth of its service offerings. Square\u2019s business model is evolving as the global payments space develops.Clearly, SQ is expanding its services and merchant ecosystem across different channels, and many growth investors are bullish about the long-term outlook of Square stock. However, they need to examine how each business that Square is now creating will contribute to its bottom line.While SQ currently enjoys a head start in serving small businesses, Wall Street\u00a0 about whether it can maintain that growth. If the U.S. economy slows, Square\u2019s growth may start to decelerate rather quickly.As a company that was founded in 2009, Square has not yet lived through an economic downturn. In other words, if the U.S. economy stalls, investors do not yet know how Square\u2019s management will respond. Additionally, since most of Square\u2019s customers are small businesses, which tend to be more vulnerable to economic hardships,Wall Street does not yet know how SQ stock may react if the economy sours.Moreover, not every area Square expands into will necessarily produce easy profits for the company. And unless SQ , Wall Street may not be too forgiving of the high valuation of SQ stock. Therefore, I\u2019d urge long-term investors to be cautious about Square stock at its current levels.In investing, it is not enough to personally like a potential product or service offering; instead, investors should also search for companies that have catalysts which can drive the value of their stocks higher.But many analysts are now expressing doubts over Square\u2019s \u00a0and questioning whether SQ is taking on too much risk.Another area of potential concern is the\u00a0, which still generate the majority of its revenue. Square\u2019s shifts toward subscription and services revenues may not make up for the decelerating growth of its transaction fees.Square\u2019s most recent earnings report showed that the company\u2019s gross-payment volume grew a relatively modest 27% year-over-year (YoY) to $22.6 billion, causing Wall Street to become concerned about the outlook of Square stock. However, Square\u2019s gross revenues increased 43% YoY to $959.36 million.Yet SQ stock\u2019s quarterly net loss was $38 million, or 9 cents per share, compared with a loss of $24 million, or 6 cents per share a year ago.Moreover, management\u2019s subdued outlook disappointed the market, and investors penalized SQ stock in the wake of the news.Finally, the expansion of Square\u2019s ecosystem also means that SQ will face increased competition. Square  with many well-capitalized companies, including the global online-payments company \u00a0(NASDAQ:), transaction-processing leader (NYSE:) and\u00a0\u00a0(NASDAQ:), which is shaping up to become a\u00a0.Therefore, the owners of SQ stock need to decide whether the company has potentially diversified way too much away from its core business of payment processing.Let us briefly remember how SQ stock price has acted over the years.Following the initial public offering (IPO) of Square stock in late 2015, the price of SQ stock surged from $9 to an all-time high of $101.15 in October 2018, as the company became a darling of long-term investors.SQ stock went on a big tear during the summer of 2018, and lots of euphoria became baked into the stock price. As a result, Square stock has been weak since reaching its all-time high on Oct. 1, 2018. By late December 2018, the stock was hovering around $50.In 2019, although SQ stock is up about 30%, April and May have not been good months for the shares. The company\u2019s  has triggered the recent volatility of Square stock.However, in June, Square stock participated in the stock market\u2019s rally and went up from an intraday low of $59.89 on June 3 to an intraday high of $74.55 on June 20.From a technical perspective, I am not expecting Square stock to make another significant leg up any time soon. In the next few weeks, possibly up until its earnings report in early August, SQ stock is likely to be rangebound between $65 and $75.SQ has strong support between $60 and $65. However, if there are any negative headlines that affect the technology sector in general or the fintech sector specifically, then Square stock may easily go .I do not expect SQ stock to reach the $100 level in the coming weeks, as the market may be starting to value the earnings growth of the stock more realistically.The daily volatility of Square stock is high, giving it a broad trading range, so short-term traders should proceed with caution. Expect SQ to be choppy at best in the near-term.Square stock will need to stabilize and build a base again before a long-term sustained leg up can occur. Consequently, investors need to be careful about chasing the stock at this point.Square stock has fallen meaningfully in recent months. In the coming weeks, I would be a buyer of the shares of the payments company around $60 or lower, especially between $55 and $60.Investors who already own Square stock might want to stay the course and hold their position. That said, the owners of SQ stock who are worried about short-term profit-taking may, within the parameters of their portfolio allocation and risk/return profile, consider placing a stop loss about 3%-5% below the current price point, to protect the profits they\u2019ve made so far.Experienced options investors may also consider using a  with approximately a six-week time horizon. In that case, they may, for example, buy 100 shares of SQ stock around its current price of $72, and at the same time, sell, for example, a SQ Aug 16 $75 call option.The $75-strike option offers downside protection in case of volatility and a decline of SQ stock. The strategy would also allow investors to participate in a potential price increase of Square stock. This call option will stop trading on Aug. 16 and expire on Aug. 17.Such a covered call would provide breathing space until the markets potentially calm down. Then, after earnings season, investors can decide on the best course of action for their portfolios, with less anxiety than those who are unhedged. The owners of a growth stock like Square need to regularly assess their views based on updated earnings results and developments that affect the company and the economy.The current economic and political environment in the U.S. and globally poses plenty of questions for market participants. And the owners of Square stock may have to reset their growth and share price expectations. If Square\u2019s revenue growth decelerates, then the price of SQ stock will also go down.I would consider buying SQ stock if\u00a0 its price declines towards the $55-$60 level. I think the long-term\u00a0 owners of SQ stock will be well-rewarded within three or four years as the company increases its ecosystem for small and mid-sized businesses and capitalizes on the potential of its Cash App.As of this writing, the author did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.\u00a0The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at , one standout is the iShares Russell Mid-Cap Growth ETF (Symbol: IWP) where we have detected an approximate $1.8 billion dollar inflow -- that's a 16.2% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 76,450,000 to 88,800,000).

Salesforce needed a solid analytics tool that went well beyond their existing capability. Tableau was that tool,\u201d  Tim Crawford, head of Avoa, a strategic CIO advisory firm. In 2018, Tableau generated almost $1.2 billion in revenue. Joining a company whose market cap is nine times its own, Tableau will have the financial chops to grow more quickly while giving Salesforce agnostic analytics that works on any platform.

Total System ranks as a top third-party processor for U.S. credit card issuers, while Global Payments is a top-five provider of tools to handle card payments for merchants. The companies are chasing a bigger share of the nearly $100 billion in annual merchant swipe fees.Upon closing, Global Payments said it would process more than 50 billion transactions annually in 38 countries physically and over 100 countries virtually, serving nearly 3.5 million merchant locations globally.Image source: Global Payments/Total System Services May 28 investor presentation.Payment processing until recently was a predictable, stodgy business. But the arrival of upstarts, including , that are able to gather data from both sides of a transaction and offer  and tools for lenders and merchants, has sparked incumbents to go on the offensive.\"The combination ... establishes the leading pure play payments technology company with unparalleled vertical market and payment software capabilities and e-commerce and omnichannel solutions, operating at scale in fast-growing markets globally,\" Sloan said in a statement.\u00a0\"This transformative partnership accelerates our technology-enabled, software-driven payments strategy and provides exposure into attractive and complementary businesses, while enhancing our financial strength and flexibility.\"Global Payments and Total System Services said they expect to extract about $300 million in annual cost savings, and generate $8.6 billion in annual adjusted net revenue and $3.5 billion in adjusted . Post-deal, Global Payments expects about $2.5 billion annual free cash flow, enough it says to keep its investment-grade credit rating and preserve Total System's higher dividend yield.There had been some thought that even after the two large deals announced earlier in the year, Global Payments had the wherewithal to sit back and take a \"wait and see\" approach to consolidation and whether combining the two sides of the transaction really would yield the strategic value the companies are seeking.By moving now, both companies can lock in a high-quality partner instead of risking that one goes off in another direction. They are also eliminating some antitrust risk relative to their peers. It is possible that regulators could greenlight the Fidelity/Worldpay and Fiserv/First Data deals but then have regrets, making it harder for follow-on deals in a few years' time. This way, all of the deals will be considered together.This could be the last of the megamergers in payments for now, but the three large deals could put pressure on companies including , , , and  to either bulk up or find deeper-pocketed partners.Make no mistake: This deal, like the two previous large transactions, is reactionary based on the way technology is changing the payment industry and the new competitors those changes are creating.

The merger is expected to create a more holistic company that handles both sides -- the merchant's and the bank's -- of every card payment transaction. The combined company will have a worldwide customer base of 3.5 million merchants, 1,300 financial institutions, and 600 million cardholders, and will facilitate approximately $50 billion of transactions per year. \u00a0Global Payments shareholders will hold 52% of the combined company, and CEO Jeff Sloan will still hold the position after the merger is finalized. Image source: Getty Images.Under terms of the arrangement, Total System Services shareholders will receive 0.8101 shares of Global Payments for every share. The deal values TSYS at approximately $21.5 billion, representing about a 20% premium to the company's value before the merger was made public. Upon completion of the merger, Global Payments shareholders will own about 52% of the newly combined company and TSYS shareholders the remaining 48%.\u00a0If it is finalized, it will be the third-largest  of all time, according to .The 12-member board of directors will be evenly split between Global Payments and TSYS members, with Global Payments CEO Jeff Sloan keeping his role at the new company and TSYS CEO Troy Woods becoming chairman of the board. For the time being, at least, both companies' headquarters, about 100 miles apart in Georgia, will remain in operation. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the calendar year.The rationale given for the merger by both management teams was the significant revenue and cost synergies the deal would help the new company realize. Management projects that the agreement will result in annualized cost savings of $300 million and create $100 million in annual revenue synergies.Global Payments CFO Cameron Bready stated the cost savings will be achieved \"primarily by aligning merchant business operations and go-to-market strategies, streamlining technology infrastructure, eliminating duplicative corporate and operational support structures, and realizing scale efficiencies.\" Bready said the two companies have areas where there is \"significant overlap,\" creating opportunities to cut costs with little risk. He expects the company to recognize its annualized cost savings goal of $300 million in three years. The $100 million in annual revenue synergies should also be recognized within three years and will largely be created by cross-selling opportunities within each legacy company's customer base. Most of these opportunities will come from leveraging TSYS's relationships with banks, especially those in foreign markets, to create joint ventures or use as referral partners to capture additional merchant-acquiring business. Bready added, however, that there was also the matter of cross-selling each company's strengths into the other's merchant base:But I also don't want to lose sight to maybe the smaller, more tactical opportunities that exist to cross-sell products and solutions across our existing book of SMB [small and medium businesses] customers ... Our ability to sell complementary products that we each have strength in across those base of business customers today is very exciting. Those are small-ticket items each individually. But when you aggregate it across almost 2 million merchant locations in the United States, the numbers start to add up very quickly...The price tag places this as the  ever. The crazy thing is that three of the largest four such deals have taken place in the first half of 2019. In January, \u00a0 and  announced a , and then in March, \u00a0 agreed to  \u00a0for a whopping $35 billion. All of these deals featured players in the payment processing arena, both on the merchant and financial institution side. More important than even the mammoth sizes of these mergers and acquisitions is why they're all happening now.TSYS shareholders will own 48% of the combined company. CEO Troy Woods will continue as the chairman of the board of the newly combined entity. Image source: Total System Services Inc.Noticeably, the technological disruption the industry is seeing was called out in all three conference calls following the deals, with \u00a0 being specifically called out twice. \u00a0Fiserv CEO Jeffery Yabuki, when talking about the new company's priorities, said:I mean, a lot of banks, especially in the community spaces, are worried about companies like Square. And what do you do where Square has a growing -- a rapidly growing point-of-sale lending business? And that's going to take money out of the revenue line of the banks.Fidelity National CEO Gary Norcross talked about the disruption the payments industry was seeing:I mean, there's a lot of innovation going on. There's a lot of modernization going on. Our clients need to continue to look to compete in this very aggressive market. You've got disruptors coming in.In both prior instances, the companies involved talked about the technological change the industry was seeing as an impetus for their deals. When Square was mentioned by Global Payments CEO Jeff Sloan, the tone was subtly different:So I don't know who came first in doing this, whether it was us or someone like Square, but we've been selling payroll to merchants for a very long time. Today, you can walk into a small merchant ... and using your phone, can underwrite that merchant, you can offer payroll services today. You can also offer lending. The difference with us, it's not on our balance sheet and we're not taking credit risk, but we tap into APIs to 60-plus lenders, and we're making loans on that today at Global Payments ... So it's very much an ecosystem.In the case of Global Payments, Sloan sees the company as a coconspirator in bringing technological disruption to the payments industry, with the TSYS deal being a part of the company's attack, not a defensive reaction to change. He could be right.Global Payments has successfully pursued a strategy of embedding its  into software vertical stacks for niche industries via acquisitions, partnerships, and internal development. This essentially makes Global Payments a payments ecosystem, not just a provider of a commoditized payment processing service.Several times during the company's conference call announcing the deal, management reinforced that the all-stock merger would allow the balance sheet to remain solid enough for the company to continue its software acquisition strategy. With the deal being immediately accretive to earnings and seemingly keeping Global Payments' strategy intact, the combined company looks well-positioned in the constantly changing payments industry.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Therefore, today I\u2019d like to discuss the short and long-term outlook for \u00a0(NYSE:), the mobile-payments company.\nSource: \n\tFintech is an evolving and growing industry. And the global economy is gradually shifting from cash to cash-less payments. With its strong small business focus and proactive management, Square stock is likely to weather the long-term ebbs and flows of the industry. However, there might be further weakness in the SQ stock price \u2014 after losing 9.2% in the past month \u2014 in the near-term that potential investors should anticipate.Although it started as a payments company, Square has in recent quarters introduced a range of software, hardware and apps to service small businesses, individual clients and act more like a traditional bank. Its most recent earnings report released on May 1 and  provide a good overview of the growth in service offerings.Square\u2019s ecosystem combines software with hardware to especially enable sellers to turn their mobile devices into point-of-sale (POS) solutions. In other words, through various growth initiatives, SQ management is now aiming to make the company a major player in the  sphere as well as a small business platform that offers a wide range of services.For example, SQ\u2019s peer-to-peer mobile payments  has more than 15 million monthly active customers. Square charges 2.75% per transaction to businesses that accept Cash App payments. It also makes money through individuals using the app.Management would like to see the Cash App become more like  whose core customers are small businesses as well as individuals. As the younger generations especially are making a drastic shift to using electronic payments, Square would like to capture that growth.In October 2018, the group announced Square Installments, which lets customers pay in monthly installments. Previously, Square had also launched Square Capital, which provides short-term loans to small businesses that use its service to process credit card payments.Clearly, Square is expanding its services and merchant ecosystem across different channels and many growth investors are bullish long term on Square stock. However, they would need to pay special attention to how each business that Square is now chasing contributes to the bottom line.While Square currently enjoys a head start in serving small businesses, Wall Street\u00a0\u00a0as to whether the group can maintain a sustained growth quarter after quarter.The global payments industry is a\u00a0. And the fintech apps revolution is fast changing the way traditional banks, credit card issuers and mobile-payments companies work with businesses as well as retail customers.Such a big industry inevitably attracts both domestic and global competition. Square  from many well-capitalized companies, including the global online payments group \u00a0(NASDAQ:), transaction processing leader\u00a0(NYSE:) and\u00a0\u00a0(NASDAQ:), which is shaping up to become a\u00a0.To be sure, not every area Square expands into will necessarily translate into easy money. Unless Square , Wall Street may not be too forgiving about the SQ stock price. Therefore, from a valuation point of view, I\u2019d urge long-term investors to exercise caution with the current price levels.For example, many analysts are expressing doubts over Square\u2019s  and questioning whether the company is taking on too much risk.Another are of potential concern would be , which still provide the majority of revenues. Square\u2019s shifts toward subscription and services revenues may not be enough to make up for the decline in transaction fees.The May 1 earnings report showed that the group\u2019s gross payment volume (GPV) grew to $22.6 billion, at a relatively modest rate 27%. Yet Wall Street was concerned about this growth rate.In other words, shareholders would need to decide whether the company has potentially diversified way too much and away from its core business of payment processing. Therefore, they\u2019d need to regularly re-assess their views based on company and sector developments as well as earnings statements.Let us briefly remember how SQ stock price has acted over the years.Following its initial public offering (IPO) in late 2015, the price of SQ stock surged from $9 to an all-time high of $101.15 in October 2018 as the company became a darling among long-term investors.With such high return on initial investments, many investors look at the future through rose-colored glasses as they tend to assume growth rates will accelerate for many years. That\u2019s how recent IPOs usually become momentum stocks. However, if growth decelerates, then the stock price usually suffers. In other words, a  trades in line with\u00a0revenue growth trends and expectations.Despite the euphoria in the first three years, SQ stock price has been exhibiting price weakness since all-time high on Oct. 1, 2018. This year, although the stock is so far up 16%, April and May have not been good months for shareholders. The  issued during the Q1 conference call triggered the recent downtrend.If you are looking for an entry signal to buy SQ shares, from a technical chart perspective, I am not expecting the stock to make a significant leg up any time soon. Square stock will need to stabilize and build a base again before a long-term sustained leg up can occur.And, I do not expect the SQ stock price to reach the $100 level any time soon; the market may be starting to price the stock with a more realistic and fair view.The daily volatility of Square stock is high, giving it a broad trading range, so short-term traders should proceed with caution. Expect nearer-term trading in SQ to be choppy at best.I believe the volatility and selling in the markets will continue in May as well as in June. Like many momentum plays, SQ stock is likely to be a battleground between two camps: investors and traders.Depending on news headlines, Square stock may trade sideways for several days, only to continue to pullback toward the low-$60\u2019s level, where it is likely to find initial support.If the support around $60 level does not hold, then it may fall further to $50 level, where I\u2019d expect SQ stock to start to stabilize and then trade sideways until the next earnings release, expected in late July.Indeed, Square stock may become one of the first momentum stocks to test the lows it saw between $49-50 in December 2018, hence making a double bottom in technical charts. Only then the twice-touched low may become a more reliable long-term support level.In other words, I\u2019d not rush to buy Square stock yet. However, I\u2019d get ready to initiate a position as the price declines further, toward $50.\u00a0I\u2019d also consider buying\u00a0 in conjunction with going long on SQ shares.If you already own the shares, you might want to stay the course and hold your position. That said, if you are worried about short-term profit taking, then within the parameters of your portfolio allocation and risk/return profile, you may consider placing a stop loss at about 3-5% below the current price point, to protect your profits to date.Stocks suffer during times of uncertainty and the current political and economic fundamentals offer plenty of questions. Therefore, I\u2019d encourage potential new investors to wait for a few weeks until the smoke clears from the markets and until buyers are definitively back in control in Square shares.Until that time, Square is likely to be a one-step forward, two-steps back kind of stock until it reaches low $50\u2019s level. On a final note, if the SQ stock price declines further amid a subdued earnings season, the company could very well become a .As of this writing, the Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["nvestors in Fiserv Inc (Symbol: FISV) saw new options become available this week, for the August 16th expiration.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $90.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $86.90 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of FISV, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $90.49/share today.\n\nBecause the $90.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .

If an investor was to purchase shares of FISV stock at the current price level of $90.49/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $95.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.86% if the stock gets called away at the August 16th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if FISV shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Fiserv Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing FISV's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $95.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $95.00 strike represents an approximate 5% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 69%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

One interesting put contract in particular, is the September put at the $80 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.55.  Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 1.9% return against the $80 commitment, or a 5.2% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost).\n\n\n\nSelling a put does not give an investor access to FISV's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised.  And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $80 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price.  ().  So unless Fiserv Inc sees its shares fall 7.9% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $78.45 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.55 from $80), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 5.2% annualized rate of return.\n\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Fiserv Inc, and highlighting in green where the $80 strike is located relative to that history:\n  \n\n   \nThe chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the September put at the $80 strike for the 5.2% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks.

Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).  Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.\n\n\n \nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Picking up where they left off on Friday, traders lifted the market to another record close on Monday.

All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session begins following the presentation. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Tiffany Willis, Vice President of Investor Relations at Fiserv. -- Thank you, and good afternoon. With me today for the call are Jeff Yabuki, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Hau, our Chief Financial Officer. Please note that our earnings release and supplemental presentation for the quarter are available on the Investor Relations section of fiserv.com.Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements about, among other matters, expected operating and financial results, strategic initiatives and the anticipated combinations with First Data, including expected benefits, financial projections, synergies, financing and timing of and the ability to complete the transaction. Forward-looking statements may materially differ from actual results and are subject to a number of risk and uncertainties. Please refer to our earnings release for a discussion of these risk factors.You should also refer to our materials for today's call for an explanation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call, along with the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest applicable GAAP measure. These non-GAAP measures are indicators that management uses to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current results and prior reported results and as a basis for planning and forecasting for future periods. Unless stated otherwise, performance references made throughout this call are assumed to be year-over-year comparisons.As a reminder, prior-year adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share amounts in the press release, supplemental materials and comments are adjusted for the sale of a majority interest of our lending solutions business, which closed in March 2018.And with that let me turn the call over to Jeff. -- Thanks, Tiffany, and good afternoon everyone. Our financial performance carried the momentum of last year into the first quarter, highlighted by 5% internal revenue growth and 12% adjusted earnings-per-share growth. We also the followed record sales in last year's Q4 with one of our highest first quarter sales totals ever, further validating the demand for our market-leading solutions. Our better-than-anticipated start to the year has us well positioned to achieve our full year financial commitments.In addition to serving clients, engaging associates and delivering strong financial results, we are also focused on integration planning for our First Data combination. Along those lines, shareholders overwhelmingly approved with more than 99% support the issuance of Fiserv shares in connection with the merger. As you know, we received the second request for information on our transaction from the Department of Justice and are working cooperatively to achieve clearance. We continue to believe the transaction will be approved, business divestitures will not be required and we will close in the second half of the year, all completely consistent with our original expectations.Upon close, our number one priority is to provide even more differentiated value to clients of all shapes, sizes and industries. For example, we've made great progress in identifying ways to further enable the offerings of community-based financial institutions and the variety of customers they serve. We see a number of client and customer advantages, which we will further evaluate upon closing to determine the absolute best way to bring these to market.The integration planning teams are working well together across multiple work streams centered on delivering incremental client and shareholder value, ensuring we have the best talent and identifying ways to sustainably exceed our synergy targets of $500 million of recurring annual revenue and $900 million of run rate cost benefits. We have a shared desire to advance the market and to redefine the way in which payment and FinTech services will be delivered. Along those lines, we also announced a commitment to invest in incremental $0.5 billion in solution innovation on top of the significant investments each of our companies make today. We expect this investment to create multiple sources of client and customer value, which should lead to even stronger results, none of which has been incorporated in our financial projections.With that let's review performance against our 2019 key shareholder priorities, which are first to continue to build high quality revenue, while meeting our earnings commitments; next to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions and third to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. As I mentioned, we are pleased with our strong financial results in the quarter, including 5% internal revenue growth, led by 6% internal growth in the financial segment and 4% in the payments segment. We saw good performance in the quarter across our recurring revenue businesses along with some acceleration of license revenue in the financial segment.First quarter adjusted earnings per share was up 12% over the prior year due to higher revenue growth, better-than-planned adjusted operating margin and some benefit from lower taxes. The change in adjusted operating margin was primarily from a combination of ramp in client implementations, carryover from last year's tax reinvestment programs and dilution related to acquisitions and divestitures, all of which, Bob will discuss in more detail. These investments are focused on driving additional client value and should contribute to a continuing step up in our internal revenue growth rate over the next several years. Free cash flow conversion of 90% was generally consistent with our expectations for the quarter and the full year, given the cadence of expected investments throughout 2019.Our second priority is to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payments solutions. As you will recall last quarter, we signed the largest new account processing client in our history, adding New York Community Bank with over $50 billion of assets. We continue to focus on growing our core account processing client base, signing 14 institutions in the quarter, including six on our market leading Premier platform.Also during the quarter, Aite Group issued its US core banking system evaluation, which named Fiserv as the sole best in class provider. This is based on a robust evaluation of all qualified market participants and is primarily based on vendor strength, market reputation and breadth of product portfolio. We are very pleased with this award and recognition. We also signed six DNA clients in the quarter with four having assets greater than $1 billion, including a competitive takeaway of Nassau Educators Federal Credit Union with $3.2 billion in assets who selected DNA, along with several important surround solutions.We also completed seven new client implementations in the quarter. I expect that total to build throughout the year. Increasing digital engagement with customers remains a top priority for financial institutions. Along those lines, Mobiliti ASP subscribers grew nearly 20% in the quarter to just under 8.5 million. Importantly, the average app store rating for this multi-institution solution, a critical barometer of digital experience, has now achieved average star rating of 4.7 out of 5.These strong results reflect our commitment to digital differentiation and enhanced user experience and expanded features such as integrated notifications, card controls and enhanced biometrics. We continue to see meaningful opportunities to help clients increase their revenue through expanded debit, credit and network programs. We signed 21 clients in the quarter, including Atlanta Postal Credit Union with over $2.1 billion in assets, which selected both debit and credit card processing to service their more than 100,000 members across the United States. Atlanta Postal Credit Union, who is not a core account processing client, also selected our credit advisory subscription service to provide additional support across their account and fraud management process.Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients. Building on Q4's momentum, we continued to see clients select Fiserv as the market continues its move toward meaningful payments innovation. In a competitive process, a top 35 banks selected Dovetail, our leading payment hub technology, to meet their evolving commercial and international business needs.We expect to see payments modernization continue for the next three to five years and believe our growing position as a front to back payments provider creates opportunities to create unique network value for our clients. In addition to payments, we're seeing growing traction in our commercial digital solutions as banks look to enhance the services to their most important customers. Commercial Center, which we acquired a couple of years ago, has added nearly 50 new institutional clients due to their market leading functionality and capabilities.In fact, we had eight clients go live in the first quarter alone and the pipeline remains very strong. Another example of commercial services growth can be seen in our Mobiliti business commercial digital solution. Financial institution clients grew 24% year-over-year and the number of end business clients utilizing the service was up a very strong 65% over the prior year and 11% sequentially. We expect the digitization of commercial services to drive important value for clients and enhanced revenue growth for us.Our enthusiasm and commitment for Zelle continues to expand not just in terms of our clients, but for the market as a whole. We believe the network benefits of Zelle will enhance the service's financial institutions delivered to their customers. First Citizens Bank, with over $35 billion in assets, selected Zelle in a competitive replacement. This replacement decision was driven in part by their ability to utilize our value-added Zelle fraud and risk management capabilities. We also signed a leading online financial services provider to our turnkey Zelle solution in the quarter. We expect to meaningfully expand our Zelle leadership position this year as the market more fully embraces this important opportunity.With that let me turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results. -- Thank you, Jeff and good afternoon everyone. As shared upfront, we're pleased with the start of the year, driving results ahead of our internal expectations. Adjusted revenue, which includes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, grew 5% in the quarter to $1.4 billion with internal revenue growth up a strong 5% as well. We saw solid execution across many of our businesses in the quarter, along with some timing benefits of license revenue in the financial segment. Overall termination fees in the quarter were essentially flat. First quarter adjusted operating income increased 3% to $457 million and was negatively impacted by the lending transaction. Adjusted operating margin was down 60 basis points to 31.9% in the quarter.Margin performance, which was actually ahead of our plan, included more than 60 basis points of pressure from higher client implementation costs in our digital and payment solutions and some carryover of the expenses originated from the 2018 tax reinvestment program. We also had a 20 basis point headwind from acquisitions in the lending transaction in the quarter. These results were fully anticipated and incorporated in our adjusted operating margin guidance of at least 50 basis points expansion for the year. Adjusted earnings per share was up 12% to $0.84 compared to the prior year. This strong start positions us well to achieve our 34th consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth.Our payments segment adjusted revenue grew 10% in the first quarter to $845 million, which includes the Elan debit processing acquisition. Internal revenue growth was up 4% over the prior year, led by electronic payments, card services and biller solutions. Our segment growth rate was a bit lower in the quarter due primarily to the timing and mix of card services revenue, which we expect will reverse later this year. Importantly, debit transaction growth remains strong in the high-single digits for the quarter. And we expect the payment segment internal revenue growth rate to accelerate for the balance of the year.The integration of the Elan debit processing acquisition is progressing very well. In addition to serving clients were seeing early traction in revenue synergy opportunities such as ATM managed services and Money Pass, our expanded surcharge free ATM network. Elan's result will be incorporated in our internal revenue growth calculation beginning in November. Adjusted operating income for the payments segment grew 6% to $287 million in adjusted operating margin was down 140 basis points to 34% in the quarter. Segment margin performance was negatively impacted by more than 150 basis points from increased implementations and investment costs, business mix and compression from Elan acquisition. As the tax reinvestment projects roll off and implementations come on line in the second half of the year, we expect segment adjusted operating margin performance to improve.Mobiliti ASP subscribers grew nearly 20% in the quarter to just under 8.5 million as consumers continue to reinforce the importance of the mobile channel. In addition, Architect, one of our newer solutions, which delivers a unified experience across all-digital channels, continues to gain traction. We have signed nearly 70 clients in this platform since the acquisition. And after achieving the 50% subscriber growth in 2018, we expect to nearly double the number of architect digital subscribers this year. P2P transactions, which include both Popmoney and Zelle were up 100% versus the prior year quarter. And Zelle transactions alone nearly quadrupled versus last year. We expect to bring a significant number of new Zelle clients live this year and even more acceleration in 2020.We continue to focus on enabling our clients to navigate deals evolving payments market. Adjusted revenue in the financial segment was down 3% to $598 million for the quarter due solely to lending divestiture which anniversaried in March. Internal revenue growth was a very strong 6% in the quarter, led by strength in our core account and item processing businesses, along with the timing benefit to license revenue in the quarter. As you may recall, we had a disproportionately high periodic revenue in last year's Q2, which will provide the basis for a tough compare in this year's second quarter. Adjusted operating margin (ph) in the financial segment was down slightly to $199 million due to the lending transaction. Adjusted operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 33.3% due to growth in recurring revenue and the timing benefit of license revenue offset somewhat by higher product investments.Overall, we're very pleased with the financial segment performance in the quarter. The adjusted corporate operating loss was in line with our expectations and the prior year at $29 million for the quarter. The adjusted effective tax rate was better than expectations at just under 16%. We had a timing benefit of about $0.02 (ph) in the quarter due to some anticipated discrete tax items which favorably impacted our adjusted effective tax rate. And we continue to expect our adjusted effective tax rate for the year to be between 22% and 23%. Free cash flow was $302 million down 4%, following a very strong Q4 and also reflects the negative net impact of acquisitions and divestitures for the quarter.Free cash flow conversion of 90% was pressured primarily by the timing of working capital expenditures and negative working capital, which includes timing of commission payments related to a very strong Q4. Looking ahead, we continue to expect our free cash flow conversion to be at least 105% for the year as CapEx normalizes and timing of working capital reverses. We repurchased 1.6 million shares in the quarter, returning $120 million to our shareholders prior to announcing the First Data transaction. We had 392 million shares outstanding with 24 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at quarter end. And as announced, we have deferred our share repurchase program until the transaction closes. Total debt outstanding as of March 31 was down to $5.9 billion and our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA was 2.6 times.With that let me turn the call back to Jeff. -- Thanks, Bob. As we mentioned upfront, sales momentum has been excellent and we are well positioned to meet or exceed our sales target for the year. Importantly next week we will host a record number of clients and prospects at our annual event Fiserv Forum, which we expect will create additional opportunities throughout the year. We followed our record fourth quarter sales performance with one of our best first quarter totals ever, which also translated to a 10% increase over last year. We saw strength across a number of areas including account processing, card solutions, output solutions and Dovetail.Our domestic pipeline is higher than last year and we are confident we will achieve our sales goals. Integrated sales in the quarter was down slightly after a very strong fourth quarter and as is typical, we expect integrated sales to build throughout the year and that we will again achieve our full year objective. We continue to demonstrate our strong operational effectiveness (inaudible) as we look to close out a five-year $250 million program a full year early. Our first quarter results are on track achieving $12 million of savings across multiple areas against our $50 million target for the full year.Before we wrap, let me provide some perspective on the environment. We've seen a significant amount of M&A this year in both technology providers and financial institutions, which we generally expect will continue. The prevailing themes appear centered on scale investment capacity and innovation. From our perspective, we believe the First Data combination, provides the differentiated solutions, investment capacity and necessary scale to partner for the long-term across the evolving financial and payments landscape. We're seeing platform investments at digital enablement, security and payments all taking lion's share. Market participants are evolving, competitiveness for core deposits remains very high and stakes are rising for digitally enabled retail and commercial services.Last, we're seeing a slow but steady number of de novo applications and approvals of which we have won half since early 2018 and expect a number of these new institutions to be more technologically savvy than in the past. However, these trends -- overall these trends remain aligned with our strategic focus and further positions your Company for long-term success.As for guidance, we're on track to achieve our financial commitments for the year. We expect our full year internal revenue growth rate to be in a range of 4.5% to 5% with higher growth in the second half of the year. We continue to expect adjusted earnings per share to increase between 10% and 14% in a range of $3.39 to $3.52 for the year.Although we don't provide quarterly guidance, it's important to remind you that we had very high periodic revenue in last year's Q2, which will create a difficult compare this year. As such, we anticipate the second quarter will be the low watermark for both internal revenue and adjusted EPS growth with strong acceleration into the back half of the year.We also expect adjusted operating margin for the year to expand by at least 50 basis points and that free cash flow conversion will be more than 105%. Lastly, our guidance does not include, or anticipate any impact from the First Data transaction. We're pleased with our start to the year, delivering strong financial and sales results, while investing in the strategic solutions of your Company. We are bullish about the significant number of opportunities to deliver client and market differentiation, while building meaningful incremental shareholder value through the First Data combination.Lastly, let me thank the 24,000 Fiserv associates around the world who worked tirelessly to serve our clients with excellence and purpose each day. You are the great differentiator that has powered us to success for the last 35 years and will move us forward well into the future.With that, let's open the line for questions.(Operator Instructions) Excuse me, our first question comes from the line of Dave Koning of Baird. Your line is now open. -- Yeah, hey guys, congrats. -- Thanks, Dave. -- And congrats to the First Data team, it was as a great quarter too. And I guess, first of all just -- you talked a little bit about the financial -- I'm sorry the payments segment was a little weaker in Q1, you talked about mix. And I'm just -- and I think you maybe talked about processing days and maybe Easter like there were some things that happened I think across the payments landscape. Is that a little bit what happened and why you think growth will accelerate the rest of the year? -- So from a segment margin standpoint or a growth rate standpoint, you're asking? -- Yeah, from a growth rate standpoint. -- Yes. So it was a little bit lighter than what we've seen over the last few quarters came in at about 4%. One of the keys that we pointed out in the opening remarks is that the underlying debit volume was high-single digits. So consistent with what we've seen, there was a bit of timing around some payment merchant and card fees that we expect to get in the latter part or the rest of this year and so we do think it was largely timing and it will come back on a full year basis and provide typical meaningful growth for us on a full year basis. -- And Dave as you know, you always have the day-to-day comparisons each year and with Easter falling where it did this year versus last, you always have those things that obviously will work themselves out throughout the year. -- Got it. Now that's good. And then I guess the second thing is the margins, you did a nice job kind of laying out some of the headwinds that hit Q1. Maybe you could talk about what the underlying growth in Q1 is and if you expect margins to go up, I think each of the remaining 3 quarters, is that fair to say? -- So Dave, let me start with and then Bob can certainly add in. I would say that you know as between the divestitures and the acquisitions that we've laid in some of the tax-oriented investments. I think Bob indicated in his prepared remarks that it was more than 150 basis points in the payments segment along. We had some growth in the financial segment. So if you think about it in the area of 100-ish basis points, I think that gives you a comparative sense.We also said, in our remarks, we had very high periodic revenue last year in Q2. I actually think we'll have a hard time getting over that mountain in Q2. So, we'll have a little bit of degradation again and then have a bunch of growth coming in in the second half of the year, when the tax program reinvestments abate, the implementations come on line. The investments begin to abate and the periodic revenue is more normalized. -- Got it. Yeah, that's really helpful. Thank you and yeah, good job. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. -- Thanks guys. Nice job. Let me just start in terms of feedback from clients now been at least a few months obviously, any incremental color that has given you more conviction or different confidence around the synergies -- the revenue synergies potential on the deal? And then -- and Jeff the First Data results were strong. I mean was that kind of run rate in your plan as well in terms of just the type of growth? -- So the -- let me take the first question. And we had talked a little bit on our Q4 call about the positive impressions and the positive responses that we were getting from the market and certainly that's continued. And we've been able to begin working together on our integration planning and putting specific energy on both the cost side and on the revenue side. And in fact, on the revenue side, based on a combination of the ideas and the focus that we have or that we've built as part of the acquisition process, but also in taking end market feedback, we actually have 10 teams of people across both companies focused on more than 40 discrete areas of revenue opportunity, ways to deliver client value that will turn into revenue for us, which is actually broader than we anticipated we would be at this stage.Now clearly not all 40 of them going to turn right now, but there is a lot of really interesting ideas that teams are putting together and we'll have plenty to pursue as we get through closing and begin to work together, but it's really been quite positive from that perspective. -- Alright, that's helpful and then just on the First Data side, I mean again the trends seem sound as well there I mean is that in line with what you would have expected I guess? -- Yeah, I think I mean -- what I would say is I would point back to the original call that we did in January where we said we don't think the market fully understands and embraces First Data, the performance that Frank and his team have put together and the fact that this is a good solid growing business with great market share and great products and great opportunity. So, we feel good about those results, and we're excited to get the closing and begin working together. -- Just thank you just as very quick follow-up. Digital banking in general. I mean, it still seems to be a big driver for you guys as, I mean, is that still been showing the acceleration, the kind of driver you saw last couple of quarters. Anything (inaudible) that you could call out or I mean to us it's an area of focus that we think the whole industry is potentially reaching inflection on further? Thanks. -- Yeah Darrin obviously you're fan of that and you're doing -- you've done a lot of work. One of the things that you heard in our prepared comments is often when we talk about digital, we end up talking about retail and we're seeing just as much focus, frankly, if not more focus on the business and commercial side of the house and it's one of the reasons why we're quite excited about Clover and some of the other merchant capabilities within First Data because we think the intersection of those capabilities and digital enablement will create a very attractive commercial and small business solution that will allow banks to -- our client banks to compete in a more fulsome way. So I think you're exactly right. That's going to continue. And I also like the intersection of digital commercial services and payments modernization. -- That's really helpful. Thanks guys. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays. Your line is now open. -- Hi guys. This is Damian Wille on for Ramsey. So I guess maybe on D&A, good to see you guys six new more wins this quarter and obviously last quarter with the big win on the larger asset size institution. Maybe if you could just kind of profile what the pipeline looks like there and the size of the institutions that you're looking at? -- Yeah, I mean, it continues to be quite strong. We had mentioned in Q4 that we've been slowly and intentionally moving up the ladder of asset size and so we think once we get New York Community Bank live that will be a fantastic proof point of not just D&A but the full differentiated surround suite that we can deliver, whether it is Dovetail, commercial center, mobility, all of the other fraud risk products that go into the solution. We think that will be a strong message.So the pipeline reflects the growing interest. I also talked a little bit in my environmental comments about platform decisions. Clearly, we're seeing the market recognize the need to move to real-time, or at least consider moving to real-time and when major decisions are being contemplated we tend to be in the mix. We certainly don't always win, but we're in there, and we're fighting and one of the things that we talked about today is Aite gave us the best-in-class core provider designation, the only one of any US provider, and again we think that recognizes the combination of the strength of the company, the strength of the client base and the strength of the platforms. -- Okay. And maybe I think I know the answer to this question, but is there any update that you can give us on the approval process from the regulator, specifically on the second request, maybe any color on what they're focused on and just in general, the approval process there? -- Yeah, I mean, like I said -- like we said in the prepared remarks, we are working cooperatively with the Department of Justice to secure the necessary HSR approval. There has been nothing in the process to-date, which is inconsistent with our original expectations. We said today, we still believe we will close in the second half of the year. We don't expect any divestitures of our businesses, and we believe we will get through this in a manner, again consistent with our original beliefs, I believe. -- All right. Thanks so much.Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. -- Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. It's good to see the sales momentum continuing on the client side. But maybe you could provide us an update, Jeff, just in terms of where client, their heads are at in terms of overall spending priorities, maybe just talk about whether you're seeing any kind of further acceleration or urgency, especially among some of your smaller bank clients. And then maybe on the flip side of things, how are people viewing the BB&T SunTrust merger in terms of the overall backdrop and wanting to accelerate technology spending or maybe put a hold on it? -- Yeah sure. Great question, Jim. So I would say from a perspective of the market overall, we're continuing to see a focus in digital security payments. We're seeing a more holistic view of the implications of broader platform investments. So that's absolutely happening with the energy on Zelle that is a another proof point around payments modernization. So we've got all of that going on.There's really a fight for deposits. And so even areas such as bill pay, which haven't gotten attention over the last number of years, there is an absolute understanding that your primary bill pay account is the one that carries the majority deposits. So you're seeing new solutions get chosen out of the basket to try to make sure that banks are winning the funding game. And so that's gotten energy and attention and we think that will level, absolutely continue to happen. So -- and then also on the commercial side, just making sure that it's not just retail digital but commercial digital as well.As it relates to BB&T and SunTrust I mean we've heard this half a number of times where large banks have gotten together and said we need scale, we need the capacity to invest and that is sending the message across the landscape. Most of that gets allocated not into the back office, but into the front office and to client facing solutions, again, digital payments and some of the platform solutions.Also, the whole area of risk and fraud continues to be important as fraudsters have had to go learn to go to different places. I think that's out there. And then the last thing I would throw out is we're starting to see a little bit of a crack in contactless, and so we have some level of comfort that, that our confidence, that we'll start to see contactless start to rise. We think the introduction in the sub -- the New York subway is important. So the more acceptance that we see at that level the more we think that'll drive in contactless the idea actually links quite beautifully into digital and digital enablement. -- That's helpful color. Thanks. And then maybe as a follow-up. Clearly, since you announced your combination with First Data, we've also seen the announced proposed transaction between FIS and Worldpay. Maybe comment on how, if at all that's changed your view of the competitive landscape, and how difficult or easy it will be to penetrate your bank clients with additional cross sell services going forward? -- Sure. So listen, I think the real point here is that the markets are changing, and they're changing fast. And the providers who don't change run the risk of having their relevance diminish over time. And we believe that the combination with First Data gives us a far broader solution set than any other combination in the industry could have created because First Data is not just a merchant acquirer, but they are a the global leader in merchant acquiring.They are the global leader in issuer processing and they have the incredible bench of data risk solutions, fraud solutions. There hasn't been a payment conversation in the last 50 years that hasn't included First Data somewhere in that combination.So we are quite excited about the combination and what it brings, but we also recognize that there is a need to have more of this type of combination happen over time. Our goal was to lead that change and we absolutely believe we've done that. -- Thank you. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Brett Huff of Stephens Incorporated. Your line is now open. -- Good evening to you guys. -- Hey, Brett. -- Competitive question, there is more consolidation going in a smaller scale in the Biller Direct business. I think the number three share are looking to buy the number two share. How do you guys look at that, does that change the competitive dynamic or is it something that you've kind of seen coming for a while. Any update on that front? -- Yeah, I mean that -- to your point, that really is not -- I mean there's been lots of Fintech -- well funded Fintech players trying to grab that space. In the on-demand space where we compete we see much more focus from those kinds of players. It really just validates the opportunity that we see to bring it all together to get the kind of more robust forms of distribution out there. So not just the direct channel, but a bank channel, an ISP channel, which we think are quite important from those perspectives.And then of course just continuing to build out the e-commerce capabilities. We think that combination the leadership positions that we both bring upon closing will allow us to do more than anyone else. -- That's great. And then another one. I recall that -- I mean several years ago, you guys talked about a launch of a combined payment product. I think it was Fiserv now? -- In our network. Yes. -- And how does that fit in with the potential changes that may come from the First Data deal, is with that kind of a precursor of thinking about greater -- dreaming a bigger dream that might combine -- that kind of things you can do with Fiserv or how does that fit into the new product portfolio. Thanks. -- Thank you. And Brett. I like the way I like the way you said dreaming a bigger dream. That to some extent encapsulates. The purpose of the now Network was really to function a little bit like a super gateway and again we think that what we didn't have the access to was really at scale direct down to the merchant. We have a lot of the back office, a lot of the DDA connectivity and so the opportunity. One, there are any number of the 40 opportunities that have to do with how do you think about the movement of money in a real-time ecosystem and now we think will be a big part of the ultimate solution. -- Great, thank you. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Cantwell will of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open. -- Hi, good afternoon. -- Hi, Jeff. -- Hey, thanks for taking my question. Jeff, can you maybe give slow spot-check on the temperature of your financial institution clients in terms of how your conversations are going with them and how they generally view the economic outlook over the next call it 12 months to 18 months. We heard one of your competitors, they talked about optimism some advisor is (ph) showing as far as the outlook for the next 12, call it 12 to 18 months sounds fairly optimistic about budgets and spending on technology, really that growth, I suppose you can talk to us a little bit about that. -- Sure I -- we are obviously in lots of conversations and we're going to have an opportunity next week to talk with a record number of clients and prospects at our annual Fiserv Forum event. So we could certainly grab more feedback. But the feedback that we're getting is there is opportunity out in the market. There is some belief that the beauty of the credit cycle probably will start to feel pressure at some point but that is offset by this real focus on deposits, focus on digital, the focus on commercial lending.So I would say it's a pretty good time -- I actually feel better now than I did, even when we gave guidance in Q4 results back in February. So I'm feeling like the trend is in the right direction. We are seeing a fair amount of M&A, as you can see every day. But I also like the fact that we have new do novos. For the larger clients the larger institutions and the larger -- and not just a financial institutions, but merchants as well. I think there's still a belief that the economy is in good shape.The larger institutions are putting more and more money into digital experience. And so that connects quite well with our strategies, especially when you think about money movement. So it's a -- it is a good time right now. -- Appreciate it. And then just a related one, I know there's a lot of puts and takes and that's early days, but just like to hear how some of that quite cautious optimism could potentially translate into your sustaining 5% top line growth next year. Might seem like a low bar given what your status (ph) during this quarter. So would appreciate comments or context that you can give us there. Thanks. -- Sure. I would say that all of the context that we've talked about in the market, all of the statistical backup that we try to give in the quarters is all about linking back to our strategy of sustainably increasing our high quality revenue growth, and turning that into free cash flow and then allocating it to investors to build -- our shareholders to build. I'm sorry, allocating it to build shareholder value.So from that perspective that continues. I think we had about 70 basis points of lift last year. I think our trailing growth rate has been has been hovering in this 4.5% to 5% level, 5% again this quarter and our guidance for the year was 4.5% to 5%. And assuming that we do that, we would expect to have -- we're not giving guidance, Bob, we're not giving guidance, but we would expect to see a step-up in our internal revenue growth rate next year as well.And that is part of our thinking, and that is all stand-alone Fiserv. When you layer on First Data, and to your point they certainly they certainly had good performance in the quarter. But when you layer on the synergy opportunities, along with that, along with the growth that we've had, we do expect to have a stepped up internal revenue growth rate, generate more free cash flow and allocate that to shareholders to build value. -- Great, thanks very much. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Mihalos of Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. -- Great. Hi, this is Allison Jordan in for George. Just one quick question from me, I was hoping you could provide an update and a little more color on client discussions as the First Data deal's being digested and really just your confidence level in renewing some of the larger partnerships that First Data has in place today. Thank you. -- Sure. So again, it's important to note that we continue to operate as separate companies and we'll do that until close. But the feedback that we've heard is that First Data, clients feel as good about this as Fiserv clients do. And we have every reason to believe that, that will actually create more incremental value, not less in all size clients of First Data and certainly our objective is to make that happen. -- Great , thank you. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Neill of Autonomous Research. Your line is now open. -- Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question. (multiple speakers) could dovetail on that last one and put a finer point on it, with respect to one of First Data's our largest partner and also I believe one of Fiserv's serves large partners as well. At Bank of America there been a lot of consternation around the renewal of the JV there. And while probably a more appropriate question for First Data's management, I'm going to ask you guys if there is any discussion or any incremental ways to think about it.And maybe one take is just it given that you have your own relationship with them. But you are still two discrete companies. Is there any involvement or any kind of back and forth even at a high level with respect to that particular relationship. -- Sure. So Matt, again, as you know, we will continue to operate as separate companies until closing. But to your point, we have a very long term and important relationship with Bank of America, First Data has a very active relationship with the bank and together, we have an even larger more important relationship and a long history of being an important partner with Bank of America. And we fully expect that that's going to continue for many years. -- Great, thank you very much. I'll leave it there. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open. -- Hi, this is Drew Gutman on for Joe. I was wondering if you could touch on, just looking at longer-term margins just touching on some of the levers you guys have to keep the expansion going. -- Yeah, Drew it's Bob. Ultimately, we pointed out during the first quarter prepared remarks here that we've got some headwinds in the current quarter and we saw some last year from the tax. So these are discretionary investments we're making. They were significant -- more significant last year really in the second half of the year. We've got some trailing off of that in the first half of this year.The acquisition anniversaring the lending transaction in first quarter and the Elan transaction that will anniversary in November. All of those combined to give us an opportunity for a nice lift as we progress really into the second half. That tax reinvestment is a pretty meaningful change that you'll see in the second half of the year where we spent order of magnitude about $25 million or so, second half of last year.We've got some trailing of that in the first half that will dwindle down. So you will see some meaningful margin improvement, that gives us that confidence of delivering at least 50 basis points margin expansion for the full year.And going forward our continued commitment to grow top line, getting to 4.5% to 5% this year, so upwards of 50 basis points. Revenue growth after 70 basis points revenue growth last year, we're very focused on high quality recurring revenue growth. That means, good margin and helps us deliver that 50 to 100 basis point margin improvement over multiple years into the future. -- I would add, if you take a step back and kind of think about the multi-year margin trend, one of the things that we pay a lot of attention to this. We don't see anything, anything systemic at all, we continue to deliver really strong operational effectiveness (ph) growth -- I'm sorry, operational effectiveness results, continue to grow recurring revenue. One of the things that does happen when you are growing your recurring revenue up, especially around new products, that revenue tends to come on at lower margin and then it builds in over scale.There are two other things that if you -- again on that step back, if you think about the business more year-over-year, if you think about the combination of the lending divestiture last year and the acquisitions that we've done over the last 12 to 18 months, that's somewhere in the area of -- in fact a little bit more than 100 basis points in the net effect on margin. And then the tax reinvestment program that we've talked about is in the neighborhood of, I don't know, 40-ish basis points.So those two things we've had to consume over the last 18 months, we'll wrap through it this year. But when you combine that kind of unusual set of items, along with the growth that we're getting, the operational effectiveness and the scaling up of these new solutions we feel really good about the underlying performance of the margins, given that I think last year even through all of this, margins were down kind of minimally 30 basis points or so. And that means the underlying margin is actually growing at a quite a healthy clip. -- Great, thank you for that. And then just a quick one on Zelle, I know you mentioned a couple of big wins recently. How does the pipeline look for that? -- Fantastic. I mean the pipeline in terms of the number of institutions, the pipeline has never been stronger. We expect, again assuming that there are not systemic constraints, we will bring multiples of the number of clients that we had live at the end of 2018, we'll bring them up this year and we think it will even be higher next year. So we're feeling really good about Zelle and where it's going. -- Perfect, thank you. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. -- Hi guys. I had just two clarifications, probably for Bob, just on financial, maybe you could help us quantify the impact of those license sales. It sounds like they boosted a little bit. So I just want to make sure we have that and maybe what that impact rolls through the second quarter and throughout the year for license sales.And then secondly on payments, the timing of the card services, not exactly sure what that is and why that necessarily picks up in the back half of the year because it sounds like that was down a little bit but does get back through the back half of the year? Thanks. -- Sure. The financial margin we are up 50 basis points overall for the quarter. We did see, as you point out, some benefit of recurring -- actually of the periodic revenue, license revenue was up a little bit. That was actually offset by some of the product implementation investments that we've talked about overall. So those two really are canceling out each other and giving us a nice underlying 50 basis points improvement on the 6% top line revenue growth.In terms of the payments, the point we tried to make on the card services, merchant fees, there is some timing of those, those come in periodic. So there can be some lumpiness to that. It's not based on underlying transactions. We made the point that the underlying transactions were up high single digits again this quarter, and we've seen the payment segment order of magnitude about 5% every quarter, and it came in at 4% this year -- this quarter. That will turn for the balance of the year and we'll see good overall internal revenue growth for payment segment full year basis. -- Got it. Helpful. And then just on financial that -- I think you gave it to me on the margin side. What about on the revenue side, the boost that license sales or periodic revenue had in the quarter? -- Yeah, it was overall kind of low single digit millions. -- Got you. -- High single-digit millions, we're up $5 million, $6 million. -- Helpful. Thanks guys. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is now open. -- Hey guys. I appreciate taking the question. -- Yeah, of course. -- Jeff, the emphasis of course appropriately is on Community Financial institutions, and even as you move up market just traditional banks, I guess generally investing in digitization and all the things they need to do, perhaps a little belatedly to stay competitive. But how do you position Fiserv, especially as you combine with First Data to address FinTechs in particular. Is there a plan by which your technology can perhaps begin to make some inroads there, or how do you balance. I guess the existing constituency with opportunities with some of the challenger banks and new players in the market? -- Yeah, I mean, that's a great question. I think -- and the question around, I don't know if this is specifically Andrew, around community-based institutions. But I think overall there will end up being over time, a cooperative relationship between providers of financial services, whether they be small organizations or very large. A small sub-segment of the FinTech community, which delivers product that needs to get integrated back through and companies like us.And in some cases we will create solutions that don't require a FinTech, but in some cases FinTechs will build stuff that clients want and we'll integrate it, and we do that today, all the time. So I do see it being a cooperative system. I don't see it being an either/or. I think as you start to get into the more important solutions around money movement, around real fully and fully enabled digital. that's a much longer part for FinTech. And I think that we will continue to invest. We will continue to create unique and differentiated functionality that will help all size financial institutions and frankly all size merchants win over the longer-haul. -- Okay, that's helpful. And then when you talk about commercial solutions, just to be clear, as I want to understand... -- Yeah, -- How you're viewing it. Are you talking specifically about SMB acquiring and Clover and software and kind of all the things that First Data is addressing today? Are you contemplating an expanded suite of commercial solutions? -- Yes. So today, if you think about our commercial center solution, we're enabling some of the largest banks in the US to serve very large sophisticated commercial clients. As you think about our mobility business solution we're digitally enabling all size cash management. So whether they be SMBs, or up into the kind of the mid-tier, we have the solutions that go across the entire ecosystem.So we see opportunities, whether it be in Clover, think about it as bank merchants, whether it be an ISV, or whether it be in the largest global e-com provider, to create a new ecosystem that creates very unique value for the industry participants. And so we're quite excited about that opportunity. The one that we talk about the most, because it's the nearest in, is clearly bank merchant. So how do we enable a technology such as Clover to be distributed either digitally or through the physical network, into our clients and integrating them into cash management and other kinds of solutions.So but we do see that broad view into the ecosystem, and some of the 40 work streams that we talked about, that are focused on driving revenue are touching those kinds of opportunities. -- Okay, appreciate it. Thank you. -- Sure. Thank you.Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. -- Good afternoon, Jeff and Bob. -- Hi, Kartik. -- Hey, a question -- a question for you, Jeff. And then one for you, Bob. Jeff, I'm assuming the conversations you're having as it relates to your combination with First Data with big banks and community banks is probably a little bit different. And I'm wondering, as you look at community financial institutions and the conversations you've had with them, what do they see as a positive about this merger, and are there any -- do they have any concerns because of the merger? -- Yeah, it's interesting. The substantial majority of community-based financial institutions don't view the merchant relationship as wholly integral to how they serve the market. Part of it is because it is quite a fragmented market, part of it is that they've got other things to do.And so the opportunity for us to bring the technology platforms together once we're closed and working is something that the institutions very quickly see how that could be valuable, and are quite excited about the different things that can be done, thinking about the data, that's in the merchant system and the data that's in the core (ph) system and the digital enablement, kind of the digital solutions, commercial cash management real time alerts and notifications, I mean it kind of goes on and on.So literally the banks, the bankers, they'll sit and talk about it quite excitedly for a reasonable period of time, and then what they say is well, let's make sure you do this and let's make sure you stay focused on what you've always been focused on. And so I don't see it as being kind of negative or on the other side of that positive coin. I see it staying -- I see the institutions wanting the confidence that they can rely on us to do both. And obviously we would not have done this if we did not think we could do both. -- And then just a clarification, just what are the headwinds in revenue that you are anticipating in the second quarter because of periodic revenue? -- Yeah. So if you recall, second quarter of last year we had a benefit. So we had significant internal revenue growth in the second quarter, driven from the timing of license revenue. -- Partially. -- Partially. And so what you're seeing is that the reverse timing effect where Q1 last year saw some license revenue slide into Q2. We actually saw some benefit of Q3 going into Q2 and then this year, we saw that pick up in Q1 coming out of Q2. And so kind of a dual effect of that taking place in second quarter. -- So from a dollar standpoint, absolute dollar standpoint, Bob, are you able to give a range of what you expect to be the headwind in the second -- this year's second quarter. -- Yeah, the one thing I'd point to you is Q2 of last year we talked about the timing benefit of that license revenue being about mid-teens impact, in mid-teens -- millions, sorry. -- Thank you. Thank you both, appreciate it. -- Thanks Kartik and thank you everyone for joining us. We look forward to continuing discussions. If you need anything please don't hesitate to call -- to contact our Investor Relations team.

And with Friday's breakout, a retest is now just around the corner. To profit from the market's continued ascent, today we're looking at three of the top stocks to buy right now.Earnings season has begun, and if the positive behavior out of banks like  (NYSE:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) is a sign of things to come, buyers should continue to dominate. With this bullish backdrop, my weekend scanning revealed ample opportunities amid uptrending stocks. Some boast high-quality breakout patterns while others offer buy-the-dip setups.The recurring theme among today's trio is the low risk and high potential reward available. With proper execution, these could deliver the dough.Behold, three top stocks to buy. (NASDAQ:  ) launched to a new all-time high after last month's earnings release. With the retailer's recent growth, today's traders have proven willing to pay a higher price than any of their predecessors. That's bullish and reveals just how much LULU stock has going for it right now.The 20-day, 50-day and 200-day moving averages are all rising in support of the 2019 uptrend. The past three weeks have seen LULU in base-building mode to digest the large gains had after the earnings release. With the 20-day moving average now just about caught up, the time is at hand for LULU stock's next breakout.Watch for a break $173 resistance, then pull the trigger on bull trades. I like buying the June $170/$180 bull call spread for $4.45.The long-term trend in  (NASDAQ:  ) has been glorious to behold. This year's behavior isn't half-bad either. FISV stock sits a stone's throw from record highs, complete with rising 20-day, 50-day and 200-day moving averages.Last month's breakout and run to unseen heights resulted in profit-taking which has since seen a retracement to the 50-day moving average. Friday's reversal candle suggested buyers are emerging to defend their turf. A break above Friday's high could signal the next upswing has begun.Fiserv is slated to report earnings on April 30, so consider bailing before then if you don't want to brave the uncertainty.March's earnings report lit a fire under  (NYSE:  ), delivering a breakout which ultimately resulted in a visit to its record highs. Since then, we've seen a garden-variety pullback occur. The profit-taking has been benign thus far with zero signs of scary distribution arising to signal institutions are abandoning ship.We are closing in on the old resistance zone at $113, which should give traders a second chance to scoop up shares at the scene of last month's roaring breakout. If DRI stock toes the technical analysis line, old resistance should become new support.This morning's weakness shows sellers still hold the upper hand. Wait for DRI to turn higher, but when it does, consider deploying bullish plays.

As disruptive upstarts offer more traditional financial services, and legacy financial companies invest more in technology, the industry is experiencing unprecedented consolidation, with partnerships, deals, and acquisitions being made at a near-dizzying pace. Just since the beginning of 2019, three of the eight largest fintech deals of all time have been announced, according to  -- including the biggest ever.With so much happening, it can be hard to keep up, so let's briefly review, in order, the five largest fintech deals of the past two years before taking a step back to see if we can determine why this activity is so prevalent in the industry today. \u00a0Data source: Legacy financial service companies have had to think strategically as they react to disruptive fintech upstarts shaking up the industry. Image source: Getty Images.Not only have all five of these deals taken place recently, they also make up five of the eight largest fintech deals ever. The list doesn't even take into account the dozens of smaller deals being made by the industry's larger players, such as 's\u00a0big  in 2018 or 's\u00a0consistent use of  to bolster its services-based revenue.While not all these mergers and acquisitions can be painted with broad strokes, it does appear many are defensive moves, specifically taken as a reaction to the disruption that technology is bringing to the financial services industry. For instance, in the conference call following the announcement of the Fiserv and First Data merger, Fiserv CEO Jeffery Yabuki specifically called out   for causing fear within the banking industry, serving as a catalyst for the deal.I mean, a lot of banks, especially in the community spaces, are worried about companies like Square.FIS CEO Gary Norcross, while not calling out a specific company, also noted the intense competition the industry is facing from fresh innovators on the call announcing his company's acquisition:[T]here's a lot of innovation going on. There's a lot of modernization going on. Our clients need to continue to look to compete in this very aggressive market. You've got disruptors coming in.I am certainly no soothsayer, and would never invest in a company solely based on hopes that it would be acquired, but , , and \u00a0would seem to be prime candidates to be a part of a future deal. Global Payments, the largest of these companies, sports a market cap of under $22 billion and has recently been successfully executing a  of acquiring software vertical stacks serving niche industries.I wouldn't expect to see this consolidation in the industry to slow down anytime soon. Newer players, such as PayPal and Square, are much more digitally savvy than the industry's legacy participants, and continue to introduce innovative solutions that disrupt the old way of doing business. To fight back, companies are joining forces. With disruption showing no signs of abating, don't expect the industry's consolidation to cease, either.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Business schools, research and professional business firms, and professional associations alike are writing about\u2014and attempting to quantify\u2014the value and qualities of good governance. One of the world's largest independent  firms\u2014\u2014has taken a novel approach to analyzing the strength of corporate management teams by assessing companies' stewardship of investor capital.\u00a0Nasdaq recently spoke with Brett Horn of Morningstar's Equity Research team to find out more about the purpose and methodology behind Morningstar's Corporate Stewardship Rating Program and what it takes for a company to achieve \"exemplary\" status.A: Morningstar's corporate Stewardship Rating assesses management's stewardship of shareholder capital. Essentially what we're trying to answer when we look at stewardship is whether the actions and strategies of corporate management are well suited to drive long-term shareholder value\u2014or not.\u00a0\nWe have three stewardship ratings: exemplary, standard and poor. The majority of companies included in our stewardship coverage earn a \"standard\" rating. What we are doing with \"exemplary\" and \"poor\" ratings is identifying companies that we think are outliers in terms of the strength or weakness of management.\u00a0\nWhile we believe that stewardship is a material factor that investors should consider, it is just one component of evaluating investment potential. A company with exemplary stewardship could still be a \"poor\" investment even if the evaluation is correct, and vice versa for a company with a poor stewardship rating.\u00a0\nA: Capital allocation is the primary factor Morningstar evaluates when rating companies on stewardship.\u00a0\nWe review management investment strategy and valuation, both external and internal. A company with \"exemplary\" stewardship will be one that has an M&A history of making investments and acquisitions that support its competitive advantages and core business, while divesting underperforming or non-core businesses. We assess whether the company is paying a reasonable price for acquisitions. We determine if management is investing sufficiently to take advantage of all the value creative opportunities that are in front of it. We also evaluate whether management is over-investing and moving into areas where the returns are not going to be sufficient relative to the company's cost of capital.\u00a0\nWe analyze how companies approach balance sheet structure to determine if they have reached optimal financial leverage\u2014conservative, but not too conservative. We evaluate how they return capital to shareholders. We review accounting practices to determine if a company's accounting methods are aggressive or potentially deceitful, which is obviously going to be a negative.\u00a0\nWe also look at executive compensation, specifically at the incentives and the targets that management is awarded and whether those are appropriate targets to align management's interest with shareholders in the long-run.\u00a0\nA: There are a number that come to mind:\u00a0\nFounder and CEO Andrew Florence has navigated the company from its start-up days to its IPO in 1998. Since the IPO, the company has gone from $14 million in revenue to an expected $1 billion+ estimated for 2018. While acquisitions have complemented the existing platform recently, organic growth has been the main driver over the past two decades. The proprietary data CoStar has built out puts it light years ahead of its competition, and places a wide moat around the business.\u00a0\nCostco is a great example of a company that plays the hand that they've been dealt very well. The company has built up a very big footprint but stayed firmly within its circle of competence. Costco has prudently reinvested in the business, while also returning excess cash to shareholders. Management has also developed a winning culture that promotes below-average employee turnover, as the attrition rate is 6% among employees who have been there over a year\u2014as opposed to attrition rates of 50% or greater in the general retail industry.\u00a0\nFiserv is a bank technology company that was built by numerous acquisitions since their founding which left a very decentralized management system. CEO Jeff Yabucki came in and centralized the company's operations, which led to material cost savings and margin improvement. We're also impressed by its stellar M&A track record. The relatively recent acquisition of Open Solutions greatly improves its real-time processing capabilities, which appears to be the future for bank software providers. In addition, it appears Fiserv got Open Solutions on the cheap since the price mostly consisted of the assumption of debt.\u00a0\nManagement has done well to leverage the company's size to capitalize on the firm's ability to provide more consistent and rapid part availability. The benefits of the firm's broad store and distribution network, as well as management's operational prowess, have pushed returns on invested capital higher over the last five years, with returns increasing from 14% in 2011 to 23% in 2016. O'Reilly's leadership has transformed the company from a regional player into a top-four national chain, acting quickly to develop and capitalize on significant long-term brand and cost advantages.\u00a0\nManagement's strategy of providing deep levels of relationship-based banking has been unchanged since its founding, and bankers are compensated not only on the amount of assets they bring up, but how much they retain over time. The bank's focus on low costs as well has paid off, as it typically locates offices on the upper levels of buildings versus the more expensive street-level locations. Signature has undoubtedly been one of the most successful banks in the nation over the past 15 years, in large part because of Signature's straightforward business model and the nimbleness of its executives.\u00a0\nTo date, Steel Dynamics remains one of the most efficient steelmakers, not just in the U.S., but also on a global basis. Management is quick to attribute its success to its employee compensation strategy which, modeled after Nucor's approach, effectively treats employees as managers by motivating their performance via weekly and monthly production bonuses.\u00a0\nA: It's the flip side of everything that would earn a company an exemplary rating. Poor stewardship companies are negatively impacted by short-sighted investment strategies or value-destructive acquisitions. For example, maybe a company has a very attractive core business, but if they make acquisitions that stray from core competencies or don't benefit from similar competitive advantages, their long-term returns are most likely going to be poor. Or a company that makes acquisitions that represent good sense strategically, but pays dramatically too much for them, will similarly dilute long-term returns.\u00a0\nOther examples of poor stewardship include aggressively investing internally in projects that are not going to earn necessary returns; too much leverage; over-aggressive accounting; or compensation targets that are tied to a matrix that would not correspond well with long-term value.\u00a0\nWe also look at the extent to which a company is a good day-to-day operator. A company can't create shareholder value if it has frequent operational and execution missteps like industrial accidents, poor customer service, or product recalls.\u00a0\nMorningstar's Stewardship Rating differs from ISS QualityScore in a few ways. QualityScore evaluates the extent to which the company's management adheres to standard corporate governance practices. Morningstar's Stewardship Rating is evaluating management's strategy and the likelihood that management's actions will improve or deteriorate long-term returns.\u00a0\nQualityScore is a quantitative numerical score that ranks companies, whereas the Stewardship Rating does not explicitly rank order management teams against peers within their industries but against ideal stewardship. We're not trying to figure out if one management team is slightly better than the other; we are focused on identifying particularly strong or particularly weak management teams.\u00a0\nFinally, QualityScore is a more objective rating, whereas Morningstar has extensive research data and the capability of delivering a rating that considers management's actions in the context of the company's situation, which is inherently more subjective. Morningstar's equity research focuses on competitive advantages, and our analysts have a very detailed understanding of the companies they follow and the industries those companies operate in. Investors primarily care about long-term returns, and our Stewardship Rating speaks directly to that.\u00a0\u00a0The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the iShares Russell Mid-Cap Growth ETF (Symbol: IWP) where we have detected an approximate $139.7 million dollar inflow -- that's a 1.4% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 75,150,000 to 76,200,000).

Under the terms of the agreement, Worldpay shareholders will receive 0.9287 Fidelity National shares and $11 in cash for each share.Upon completion of the deal, shareholders of Fidelity National, commonly referred to as FIS, will own approximately 53% of the newly formed company, and Worldpay shareholders will hold the remaining 47%. The combination of stock and cash values the merger at about $33.5 billion, but when the assumption of Worldpay's debt is included, the deal's  inflates to a whopping $43 billion.FIS primarily serves financial institutions by providing them with transaction processing, digital channel solutions, fraud prevention tools, and card issuing services. Worldpay makes the majority of its revenue by offering payment processing solutions to merchants. The new company will operate under Fidelity National's name at its current headquarters in Jacksonville, FL, and FIS CEO Gary Norcross will retain his role, while Worldpay CEO Charles Drucker will serve as the executive vice chairman.Fintech, or financial technology, is transforming the financial sector with innovative solutions to age-old pain points. Legacy companies, such as Fidelity National Information Services and Worldpay, are finding it easier to thrive by joining forces. Image source: Getty Images.In the conference call immediately following the announcement of the deal, transcribed by , the management teams from the two companies stated that the combined entity will be able to recognize new revenue opportunities and cost synergies that they would not have been able to realize separately. FIS now expects that revenue will grow organically between 6% and 9%, which will be coming off a much higher base and will generate $4.5 billion in free cash flow at the end of three years.Fidelity National CFO James Woodall stated it expects to realize $500 million in revenue synergies, stating:We have clear line of sight on global expansion of payment solutions in high growth markets such as India and Brazil, where we have existing presence at scale, enhancing fraud solutions and increasing authorization rates for our customers, driving significant increase in dollar volumes processed, cross-selling of payment processing, enabling faster payment initiatives and alternative payment types and expanding into B2B commercial payments in capturing the high demand for data analytics and insights.Of cost synergies, Woodall said, the new company expects to see $400 million in savings, driven primarily by combining \"issuing and acquiring capabilities from both companies, technology integration as we drive efficiencies in technology and data center costs and corporate costs through functional alignment of the combined company.\" These synergies, Woodall added, were incremental to the revenue and cost synergies Worldpay is recognizing from the  finalized in 2018.In what is the largest fintech deal in history, FIS agreed to acquire Worldpay for $33.5 billion. Image source: Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.Most noteworthy, perhaps, is that the agreement comes on the heels of a  between   and   earlier this year. Fidelity National and Fiserv are the country's two largest issuer processors -- companies that process payments for retail banks, which serve consumers. This deal, like Fiserv's and First Data's before it, will give the new company processing capabilities on both sides of the transaction -- the bank's and the merchant's.The fact that two such similar deals were made so close to one another raises an important question on the motives behind the latest merger. Was the deal reactive or proactive? Was it motivated by a desire to go on offense and take market share or a sudden realization that it needed to play defense? Norcross insisted the deal was made purely for strategic purposes for the two companies' sake, not because of how the industry was moving. Yet later he added:[T]here's a lot of innovation going on. There's a lot of modernization going on. Our clients need to continue to look to compete in this very aggressive market. You've got disruptors coming in. So what we saw on the combination was really this end-to-end innovation we've been discussing on this call, and the ability to be able for our FIs [financial institutions] to gain access to world class merchant acquiring to be able to leverage data in very unique ways, to be able to drive other products with a much faster speed to market, and that's been a very consistent theme that we've talked about.These comments, made near the conclusion of the conference call, paint a more honest picture. Fintech is changing both the payments and financial industries. Companies that don't keep up run a very real risk of being left behind for good. The two-sided data these transactions will provide to Fidelity National's clients will help them keep up with fintech upstarts, such as  , which uses the transaction data from its sellers to make  and is exploring options to open its own .The move looks particularly good for FIS shareholders. Overnight, the company went from reporting decreasing revenue in its most recent quarter to projecting high single-digit growth over the next three years. For Worldpay shareholders, the result of the announcement is a little less clear. The company was making  on its own large deal, finalized just last year, and was showing promising revenue growth and global scale.Both companies were facing fierce competition from disruptive upstarts releasing innovative solutions at a rapid pace. This deal probably better positions the new company to meet these outside threats than they would have fared separately. That being said, it might be wise to hold off on investing in the new entity until investors see positive results.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

On Jan 16, 2019, Fiserv announced acquisition of First Data in a $22 billion all-stock deal. This is one of the biggest financial mergers in a decade and will help Fiserv emerge as one of the world's largest payments and financial technology providers.In 2018, Fiserv completed the purchase of Elan's debit card processing, ATM Managed Services and MoneyPass surcharge free network for approximately $690 million. It should boost Fiserv's payments portfolio, widen its client base and provide new solutions to enhance the value proposition for its existing 3,000 debit solutions clients.

In 2018, Fiserv's DNA platform signed 29 new clients and Zelle had more than 100 new clients. Given the bullish backdrop of growth, the company is optimistic about client additions in the future. Organic debit transaction grew in high single digits and total P2P transactions, including both Popmoney and Zelle, grew nearly 44% in 2018.Volume at Zelle grew more than six times from the prior year. Mobiliti ASP subscribers recorded solid growth throughout 2018. Backed by strong demand, the company expanded its Architect implementation teams and is expected to add more clients going ahead. The company signed 26 new Architect clients in 2018.Further, the company seems to be actively engaged in enhancing its services. In February 2019, Fiserv announced the launch of Mortgage Momentum, a digital-focused approach, aimed at enhancing the overall lending and borrowing experience. In October 2018, Fiserv had announced the launch of a flexible and interactive financial planning tool (which integrates with home office systems and streamlines manual processes) to help financial advisors operate more efficiently and collaborate with clients in their investment targets.In September, Fiserv launched Originate, a new suite of solutions aimed at helping banks and credit unions deliver enhanced digital account opening and loan origination to customers. In August, the company upgraded its unified managed account (UMA) services to help financial institutions and advisors operate more efficiently and announced the launch of two enhanced consumer authentication solutions, step-up authentication and identity verification to help call centers counter card fraud.The diversified product portfolio has led to a steady flow of customers, considering the rapidly changing financial services industry and increasing demand for digital banking and payment services.Currently, Fiserv carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Shares have added about 1% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Fiserv due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recen  in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Fiserv's earnings matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues surpassed the same.Adjusted earnings per share of 84 cents came in line with the consensus mark and improved on a year-over-year basis attributable to internal revenue growth, tax leverage and operational effectiveness. The company reported its 33 rd consecutive double-digit bottom-line growth.Revenues of $1.55 billion outpaced the consensus estimate by $2.4 million and increased 2.3% year over year. Adjusted revenues of $1.47 billion increased 2% on a year-over-year basis.On Jan 16, 2019, Fiserv announced the acquisition of First Data in a $22 billion all-stock deal. Upon closure, Fiserv shareholders will own 57.5% of the combined company and First Data shareholders will own the rest. Subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory approvals and shareholder approval from both companies, the deal is expected to close during the second half of 2019.Revenues at the  segment increased 9.1% year over year to $944 million. The upside was driven by solid performance of card services, biller solutions and electronic payments, which were, however, partially offset by lower periodic revenues. In the reported quarter, organic debit transaction grew in high single digits and total P2P transactions, including both Popmoney and Zelle solutions, grew 74%. Mobiliti ASP subscribers increased 21% to exceed 8 million. The company also witnessed client addition in its unified digital platform Architect.Revenues at the  segment decreased 7.9% year over year to $615 million. These revenues were hurt by the divestiture of 55% interest of the company's Lending Solutions business (the \"Lending Transaction\").Internal revenue growth was 4.5% in the reported quarter, with 6% growth in the Payments segment and 3% growth in the Financial segment.Revenues at the  segment increased 2.9% on a year-over-year basis to $1.30 billion, while  were down 0.8% year over year to $244 million.Adjusted operating income of $492 million was up $1 million from the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating margin declined 60 basis points (bps) year over year to 33.4%. Adjusted operating margin was hurt by structural headwinds from the Lending Transaction and investments funded from tax savings, which collectively had a negative impact of 160 bps in the quarter.Adjusted operating income at the Payments and Industry Products segment was $315 million, up 9.4% year over year. Adjusted operating margin of 36.4% was flat year over year.Operating income at the Financial Institution Services segment totaled $208 million, down 11.5% year over year due to the Lending transaction . Operating margin declined 140 bps to 33.7%.Fiserv exited fourth-quarter 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $415 million compared with $673 million at the end of the prior quarter. Long-term debt at the end of the reported quarter was $5.95 billion compared with $4.82 billion at the end of the prior quarter.The company generated $571 million of net cash from operating activities in the reported quarter.

Over the past three years, Square's stock is up a ridiculous 622%. data by  .Square has built out an impressive ecosystem around its original point-of-sale terminals, from small-business loans, to payroll software, and even a third-party food delivery platform, Caviar. In 2013, the company unveiled its peer-to-peer payments app, Square Cash, which doubled its user base in 2018 to over 15 million.Nevertheless, it is always a good idea for investors to understand the bear argument for the stocks they own. On that note, BTIG analyst Mark Palmer is the most bearish Square analyst on Wall Street, with sell rating and $30 price target -- less than  of where the stock stands today.Though over half of analysts still have a buy rating on Square, let's dig in to Palmer's take on the company.Could Square's stock go down? Image source: Getty Images.Square did underwhelm investors in its recen  release. The company guided to revenue growth of roughly 41%, terrific for a normal business, but only in line with analyst estimates. However, Square's Q1 adjusted  guidance of $47 million-$51 million was well below consensus estimates of $70.3 million. For the full year, management guided to $405 million-$415 million in EBITDA, also below consensus estimates of $421 million.While Square characterizes its rising costs as investments toward a large market opportunity, Palmer doubts that the company can achieve its impressive growth without heavier-than-expected spending.Some of that spending may be due to ward off Palmer's concerns about competition. Square's core payment processing segment is a desirable, high-margin business, which usually invites competitive threats.In particular, Palmer worries about  's (NASDAQ: FISV)  (NYSE: FDC) . First Data makes the Clover point-of-sale system, a Square competitor. The combined companies say they intend to spend over $500 million over five years to \"accelerate growth,\" which likely means putting serious weight behind Clover.Palmer's concerns about Clover stem from the fact that First Data tends to go after larger enterprises. While Square started as a small-business solution, it's made impressive headway with larger businesses over the years. In just two years, the proportion of businesses that process over $125,000 of gross payment volume (GPV) per year grew from 43% to 51% of Square's GPV. Businesses that process over $500,000 of GPV increased from 16% to 24%.Palmer believes this presents concentration risk, especially if First Data makes headway with these large customers.In addition to a higher reliance on large enterprises, Square has also grown its book of loans it makes through Square Capital. Last quarter, Square grew its loan book by 55%, higher than the company's total revenue increase of 51% and GPV growth of 28%.Making more loans does benefit Square, as this increases customer retention for the company's terminals and services. But all loans carry risk.Palmer doesn't necessarily think Square is making bad loans. However, he does argue that other lending institutions such as banks and loan-centric fintech companies trade at much lower valuations than Square, which currently trades at a  ratio of 9.5 and a whopping 76.3 times next year's EBITDA. data by  .In sum, Palmer is worried about looming competition, concentration risk, and credit risk. But on the  , CEO Jack Dorsey sought to tamp down these concerns. On competitive threats, he countered:New CFO Amrita Ahuja also dismissed lending risks, saying Square is using the same strict loan underwriting criteria it always has. And on increased marketing spend, management said it's earning a full payback within three to four quarters, which is excellent.Management's explanations seem credible to me -- after all, they're the ones that built Square into the phenomenal success that it is. That being said, the stock is anything but cheap, so Square investors should definitely monitor the competition and credit risks cited by Palmer going forward.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Over the first nine months of 2018, amid a bull market, Square stock nearly tripled. By late December, as investors fled higher-risk plays, SQ stock had lost half of its value. Source: Now, in a recovering market, SQ has risen over 50% from its lows. The gains set up an intriguing - and potentially key - fourth-quarter earnings report on Wednesday afternoon. Square still isn't even close to cheap, trading at nearly 13x 2019 consensus adjusted revenue estimates. It's going to need a blowout quarter and a strong 2019 outlook to support the current price, let alone drive upside.But SQ stock also is going to need a receptive market. The gains of late are a sign that investors are more comfortable with high valuations - and, given Square's recent moves, higher risk. That's why I called out Square earnings as  this week.If the risk-on trade in SQ stock continues after Square earnings, that could be a sign that the market as a whole is ready to challenge 2018 highs. If not, a sell-off could be a warning sign that the 2019 tech rally is near an end.Expectations for Square earnings look aggressive but achievable. Street consensus projects adjusted revenue growth of 60.7%. That seems like a huge number - but on a year-over-year basis sales  , and over 60% the quarter before. The Street sees adjusted EPS at 14 cents, up 75% year-over-year, while suggesting essentially flat operating margins.Estimates on both the top and bottom lines admittedly are well ahead of Square's guidance after Q3. The company projected adjusted revenue growth of 59%, and non-GAAP EPS of 12-13 cents. That said, Square historically has guided conservatively and still beaten Street estimates. Indeed, Square revenue and earnings have come in ahead of consensus for eleven straight quarters.Another beat does seem likely. It's possible late-quarter stock market weakness and what appears to be a minor blip from a macro standpoint had an impact. But Square's revenue growth has been accelerating in recent quarters - including strengthening in 2018 over 2017 - and there's not much evidence at the moment to see that changing.Given the gains since late December, anything less than a beat likely would lead Square stock down. And 2019 guidance may be even more important. At the moment, analysts are looking for a 43% increase in revenue and a 52% rise in earnings. It's those expectations that have led investors to buy the dip in SQ stock. Square will have to meet those expectations - at least - on Wednesday afternoon.Assuming Square earnings and guidance are good enough, the reaction to SQ stock could be telling. Even ignoring the huge valuation - Square stock trades at over 100x current 2019 consensus - there's no shortage of risks here.The company's move to banking  , as Luke Lango argued last month. But it also adds to the company's macroeconomic exposure. As I pointed out last year, Square is heavily  (  for fellow high-flyer  (NYSE:  )). Small businesses tend to get hit first, and hardest, when the economy turns. If Square is not just serving those customers, but lending to them, the impact of a downturn on Square earnings could be even more severe.Competition is rising as well. As Tom Taulli noted earlier this month, the merger of  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) was driven in part by  with Square. Big banks including  (NYSE:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) have  , taking aim at the payments side of Square's business.Square admittedly has shaken off those risks - and it could continue to do so. 60%-plus growth in adjusted revenue, as seems likely in 2018, is nothing to sneeze at. Success in banking would only add to the company's potential.But the roller-coaster ride in SQ over the past six months has been driven largely by investors' perceptions of those risks. The reaction to Wednesday's report likely won't be any different - and that could provide a valuable read-across to the rest of the market. How much risk are tech investors willing to take? Square earnings could provide an answer.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" announced plans to acquire Worldpay, a leading payments processing company, via a stock-cash deal within the second half of 2019. The combined company will retain the acquirer's name and will be headquartered in Jacksonville, FL.Notably, FIS shareholders will retain 53% ownership in the combined company and Worldpay shareholders will own the remaining 47%. The merger is expected to bode well for FIS by boosting its acquiring and payment offerings, and expanding geographical reach.Shares of Fidelity National and Worldpay gained 5% and 14%, respectively, in the  session, after the companies released the merger news in the market.Per the terms of the deal, Worldpay's enterprise value of about $43 billion includes the assumption of Worldpay debt, which FIS expects to refinance. Upon completion of the merger, shareholders of Worldpay will receive 0.9287 FIS shares and $11.00 in cash for each share held.The companies have decided to have 12 members in its board of directors, of which seven will be from FIS. Gary Norcross will remain as FIS Chairman of the board, President and Chief Executive Officer, whereas Charles Drucker, Worldpay's current Executive Chairman and CEO, will serve as the Executive Vice Chairman.The combined entity is expected to aid in revenue growth of 6-9% through 2021, since the merger will create significant opportunities across merchant and banking businesses. Also, total EBITDA synergies of $700 million are likely to be achieved from the combination of revenues and expense opportunities over the next three years.Upon closing of the merger, the company will have pro-forma 2018 annual revenues and adjusted EBITDA of nearly $12.3 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively. FIS anticipates retaining its investment grade credit ratings of Baa2/BBB, reducing leverage to approximately 2.7x over 12-18 months and continuing to grow its dividend, supported by robust free cash flow.The combination of FIS and Worldpay, two companies that are leading their respective markets in modernization investments, provides clients of both organizations access to a wider portfolio of digital assets for accelerating revenue growth, streamlining operations and creating a better engagement with customers.The booming payments industry has seen some strategic moves lately. In January 2019, Fiserv  agreed to buy First Data Corporation  for $22 billion, in order to become the world's largest payments processor.Fidelity's attractive core business, with a recurring revenue model and investment in digital products, keeps it well positioned for growth. Also, its strong capital position keeps the company well poised to undertake opportunistic expansion strategies.The company's shares have gained 7.8% over the past three months compared with 19.7% growth recorded by the  .Fidelity National flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), at present.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 11 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Fiserv Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $71.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $95.00. The standard deviation is $7.43.But the whole reason to look at the  FISV price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with FISV crossing above that average target price of $86.27/share, investors in FISV have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $86.27 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

As you know, key elements of our shareholder value proposition are to steadily increase our internal revenue growth rate, convert that to growing streams of free cash flow, and last but certainly not least, allocate that capital in a shareholder-friendly way. We accomplished those objectives in 2018 and made important progress in building your company's future success. We achieved an 80 basis point increase in our internal revenue growth rate for the year to 4.5% and also achieved our 33rd consecutive year of double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth.Results in the quarter, which are consistent with our preliminary results announced on January 16th, include 4.5% internal revenue growth and a 33.4% adjusted operating margin, both against a very difficult prior year compare. Adjusted earnings per share increased 24% to $0.84 in the quarter and up a very strong 25% to $3.10 for the year. We also generated an all-time high in free cash flow and allocated a record $1.9 billion to shareholders, repurchasing more than 25 million shares for the year. Sales were extraordinary in the quarter, finishing more than 30% higher than last year's record sales, including our largest account processing win ever, enhancing our growth profile entering the new year.Before we provide detail on the results, let me make a few comments on our recent merger announcement with First Data, which we believe creates the preeminent global provider of payments and financial technology. We expect this strategic transaction to move the industry forward in new and exciting ways. Early client reaction has been extremely positive and centered on the ways in which the combined solutions can come together to create unique value for them and their customers.The model is compelling with leadership positions across multiple solutions and numerous ways to grow and prosper. We also intend to enable meaningful new client value along several axes, though increased investments in strategic solutions, unique and compelling end-to-end integration, and as important, by identifying new and unique sources of value at the intersection of technology, innovation and data. We're approaching this opportunity with excitement as well as a steadfast commitment to excellence.We've kicked off integration planning and expect to hit the ground running when we close. Our priorities include unlocking client value, capturing the meaningful synergies, and retaining and attracting the best talent. We have skilled, experienced integration leaders driving the process, accompanied by strong governance and oversight. We are highly confident we will achieve incremental revenue synergies of $500 million and the $900 million of cost benefits shared in the original announcement.In addition to this transformative transaction benefiting clients, we are equally as focused on creating significant shareholder value. We expect to generate upwards of $4 billion of annual free cash flow over the next several years and will continue to use our disciplined capital allocation strategy to optimize value in the aggregate, as well as on a per share basis. Our collective enthusiasm about the combination with First Data is even greater now than it was on the day of announcement.With that, let's get back to reviewing performance and start against our 2018 key shareholder priorities. Our first priority was to continue to build high-quality revenue, while meeting our earnings commitments; next, to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions; and third, to deliver innovation and integration which enables differentiated value for our clients. As I mentioned, we continue to focus on high-quality revenue growth acceleration, delivering 4.5% internal revenue growth in both the quarter and the year. The 80 basis point increase in our internal revenue growth rate for the year comes from multiple sources, including the cumulative effect of adding recurring revenue with a direct link to client value. We also expect another lift in our internal revenue growth rate for 2019.Our strong adjusted earnings per share performance was due to a combination of internal revenue growth, tax leverage and operational effectiveness. Our full year adjusted operating margin was below the prior year, primarily due to a 110 basis point headwind from the combination of the Lending transaction announced in March and the meaningful internal investments funded by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted last year. But for these items, adjusted operating margin would have increased 80 basis points for the full year.Our second priority was to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solutions. Now, as you may have seen earlier today, we announced the largest new core account processing sales win in our history. In a competitive takeaway, New York Community Bancorp Inc., the holding company for New York Community Bank with over $50 billion of assets and locations in five states, selected DNA and a package of more than 40 solutions, including debit processing, Corillian Online banking, Mobiliti, Zelle and Dovetail, to deliver differentiated high-value solutions to their customers.The combination of modern, real-time technology with significant flexibility is allowing us to meet the changing needs of larger financial institutions. DNA also continued its momentum with large credit unions, signing Fox Communities Credit Union with $1.6 billion of assets. Fox Communities selected DNA as their business had outgrown their existing core processing provider. DNA provides a platform for future growth, eliminates a number of third-party vendors, and will allow Fox Communities to continue serving their members with excellence. Overall, DNA performance was strong with 30 implementations for the year, including 16 for institutions with assets greater than $1 billion.We also signed 29 new clients for the year, which is indicative of the continuing momentum of DNA. Equally important, we signed 30 new account processing clients to our market-leading Premier platform during the year. Interest also remains high for our digital and payment solutions such as Architect, Commercial Center and Dovetail. Banc of California, with more than $10 billion in assets, selected Architect and Commercial Center in the quarter to better meet the rapidly changing expectations of their retail and commercial customers. Additionally, both KeyBanc with over $130 billion in assets and Bank OZK with more than $20 billion in assets, selected Dovetail in the quarter. We expect to see more institutions take steps to enrich and extend their payments capabilities to meet the evolving needs of a digitally centric landscape.our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. We continue to see strong demand around Zelle. As you have likely seen reported, Zelle transactions now exceed 400 million and grew 75% year-over-year. We expect broad industry adoption to accelerate over the next 24 months, as evidenced by the nearly 100 new clients we signed for Zelle in the fourth quarter alone, which is more than the total signings in the first three quarters of the year.As the leading provider of Zelle services to all sized financial institutions, we have opportunities to package our payments value proposition in unique and interesting ways. For example, in the quarter, MUFG Union Bank, with $124 billion in assets, selected both our turnkey Zelle solutions to be implemented later this year, along with the Dovetail payments platform to help enable real-time enterprise payment capabilities for their customers. Overall, we believe our leadership as the most experienced stand-alone as well as integrated Zelle provider will enables us to deliver payments innovation and client value to the financial industry.Lastly, PennyMac, a top mortgage lender, selected a broad suite of products, including debit processing, electronic billing and a unique mobile wallet to meet their customers' expectations. With that, let me turn the call over to Bob for more detail on our financial results. -- Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. As you've heard, we are pleased with our strong 2018 performance. Adjusted revenue was up 2% in both the quarter and the year to $1.5 billion and $5.5 billion respectively. Internal revenue growth was 4.5% in the fourth quarter and full-year, driven by solid performance in both segments. The fourth quarter results were even stronger when considering last year's comparative performance of 6% internal revenue growth.Adjusted operating income, which was impacted by the Lending transaction, was in line with the prior year at $492 million for the quarter and up 1% to $1.8 billion for the year. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter was 33.4%, which is a decrease of 60 basis points, compared to last year's record result. As we've shared all year, our adjusted operating margin performance include structural headwinds from the Lending transaction, along with the investments funded from tax savings. These two items had a negative margin impact of 160 basis points and 110 basis points in the quarter and year respectively.Adjusted EPS was up 24% to $0.84 in the quarter and increased 25% to $3.10 for the year, marking our 33rd consecutive year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth.Our Payments segment has had strong performance all year, and did so again this quarter. Adjusted revenue was (ph) 9% to $865 million in the quarter and up 8% to $3.2 billion for the year, which includes two months of impact from the acquisition of the Elan debit processing business. Integration with our card services businesses is in flight and progressing well. Internal revenue growth in the segment was 6% in the quarter and 5% for the year, led by strong performance in card services, biller solutions and electronic payments, partially offset by lower periodic revenue. Organic debit transaction growth was high-single digits in both the quarter and year.Adjusted operating income in the segment grew 9% to $315 million in the quarter and 8% to $1.1 billion for the year. Adjusted operating margin performance in the quarter was a very strong 36.4%, in line with last year, and expanded 20 basis points to a new high watermark of 35.3% for the year. The client-focused investments funded from tax reform negatively impacted the Payments segment results by 120 basis points and 50 basis points for the quarter and year respectively.An important element of expanding high-quality growth is extending our digital and payments footprint. Along those lines, Mobiliti ASP subscribers grew 21% in the quarter to cross 8 million. We also continued to add clients to our unified digital platform, Architect, with seven implementations in the quarter and 19 for the year. In addition, we signed 26 new Architect clients in 2018, further demonstrating the market opportunity and importance of digital.Lastly, P2P transactions from both our Popmoney and Zelle solutions grew a combined 74% for the quarter and 44% for the year, showcasing the strong growth potential of these important DDA-based payment technologies. Zelle volume alone in 2018 was up more than 6 times the prior year.For the Financial segment, adjusted revenue was down 8% to $615 million for the quarter and down 5% to $2.4 billion for the year, both of which were significantly impacted by the Lending transaction. Internal revenue growth was 3% in the quarter and 4% for the year, driven primarily by solid performance across our account in item processing businesses.Adjusted operating income was $208 million for the quarter and $798 million for 2018, both of which declined due to the Lending transaction. Accordingly, adjusted operating margin contracted 140 basis points in the quarter to 33.7%. And similar to my comments on the total Company results, the Financial segment adjusted operating margin was negatively impacted by the Lending transaction and tax savings reinvestment totaling 190 basis points in the quarter. But for these items, adjusted operating margin would have expanded 50 basis points even in light of reduced periodic revenue from the very strong fourth quarter performance last year.For the year, adjusted operating margin contracted 20 basis points to 33.3%, which reflects a 150 basis point headwind from the combination of the Lending transaction and tax savings reinvestments. We expect the combined impact of these items to be fairly muted on our total Company adjusted operating margin results in 2019.The adjusted corporate operating loss was $31 million for the quarter and $122 million for the year. Both the quarter and full year results were in line with our expectations. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.9% and 21.6% for the year, both lower than prior year, due primarily to the benefits from the Tax Cut and Jobs Act. We expect our tax rate for 2019 to be in the range of 22% to 23%.We generated record free cash flow exceeding $1.3 billion this year, highlighting the hallmark of our business model, significant free cash flow generation. Free cash flow was up 7% for the year, which includes a reduction due to the Lending transaction. Free cash flow conversion was 146% in the quarter and 102% for the year. Conversion was slightly below our initial expectations, primarily due to higher working capital and increased CapEx, which we expect to moderate in 2019.We repurchased nearly 9 million shares in the quarter for $689 million and over 25 million shares in 2018, returning a record $1.9 billion to shareholders. Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we've retired nearly 482 million shares for $11.4 billion, or more than 60% of the shares outstanding at the start. And as of December 31st, we had 393 million shares outstanding and 26 million shares remaining in our share repurchase authorization. As you know, in conjunction with the First Data announcement, we have deferred any additional share repurchase until the transaction closes.Total debt outstanding at the end of the year was $6 billion, bringing our debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to 2.6 times.With that, let me turn the call back to Jeff. -- Thanks, Bob. Sales in the quarter was up 31% to an all-time high, which is even more noteworthy when compared to the record level in last year's fourth quarter, and was 114% of quota. Sales for the year was up 5%, and we attained 91% of quota. Integrated sales was also very strong in the quarter, up nearly 30% over the prior year and 131% sequentially. Importantly, we exited the year with a domestic pipeline that, even after our record sales, remains nearly 20% higher than at the same point last year. We are pleased with our sales results and market momentum.We made excellent progress on our operational effectiveness initiatives during the year. We achieved another $12 million of savings in the quarter and $57 million for the year against our $50 million target. As of the end of year-three, we have already booked $200 million of the expected $250 million five-year program. In the aggregate, we have captured nearly $800 million of saves over the last dozen years. For 2019, we expect to achieve $50 million, which would close out our $250 million five-year program one full year early.Before we get to guidance, let me provide some perspective on the environment. We continue to see the market moving to places where we are focused, such as payments and risk, all things digital and delivering a world-class core account processing ecosystem. We believe this evolving paradigm will require market participants to increase their investments in technology, focus on data insights and reengineer their customer journeys.Given these trends, coupled with the current macroeconomic environment, we believe M&A will continue to be active, an example of which we saw earlier today. We firmly believe financial institutions will increase their technology investment and, where possible, spread that across larger scale, extend their deposit gathering capabilities, and create differentiation in how they go to market. On balance, these trends are very consistent with our strategic hypotheses and reinforces the actions we have taken to position your company for long-term success.Now, looking ahead to 2019, we expect our internal revenue growth rate to step up and be in a range of 4.5% to 5%. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $3.39 to $3.52, representing growth of 10% to 14%, which is measured against a revised 2018 result of $3.08, which reflects the remaining impact of the Lending transaction. We expect our adjusted operating margin to expand by at least 50 basis points, and we anticipate our free cash flow conversion to be more than 105% for the full year.For modeling purposes, we anticipate that our financial performance will accelerate into the second half of the year, creating additional momentum as we go into 2020. Importantly, our guidance does not include or anticipate any impact from the first Data transaction, which we expect to close later this year. In conclusion, we're pleased with our financial, operational and strategic results for the year. We further strengthened the business and are excited and optimistic about the future of your company.We were recently named by Fortune Magazine as a World's Most Admired Company for the sixth year in a row, and received high marks for long-term investment value, financial soundness, people management and social responsibility. This important recognition underscores our commitment to excellence and innovation as a global leader in fintech. As we look to 2019, we remain committed to delivering high-quality results, including an increase in internal revenue growth, strong free cash flow and disciplined capital allocation.Lastly, let me recognize and thank the 24,000 Fiserv associates around the world who are committed to delivering excellence for clients and shareholders each and every day. I'm proud of what we've accomplished so far, and even more optimistic about our collective future. With that, let's open the line for questions.Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)Our first question is from Darrin Peller of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. -- Can you just start off -- hey, Jeff, can you just start off with any market feedback you're hearing from customers either on -- on either side, First Data's customers or perhaps your own banks since the deals announced? I'd just love to hear some quick spot check on the sentiment. -- Yeah, sure. So obviously, we spent the substantial majority of time with our clients, although a number of clients have multiple relationships. And I have to say, the client reactions have been incredibly positive, both in terms of two strong companies coming together. As you know Darrin, Frank and his team have done a great job in rebuilding First Data, and I think the fact that we're coming together, people see the opportunities, those opportunities that we've talked about, whether it be around bank merchant, opportunities around network enhancements and enriching the payment, the end-to-end payment opportunities and even some clients who have said, hey, now that you guys are together, we want you to take a look at this business that we would not have otherwise done, had you not come together. So the feedback has been great, positive, probably more positive we would have thought to the date so far. -- That's great to hear. Thanks. And just a quick follow-up, look, we saw the New York Community announcement today. And obviously, you're showing strong integrated sales again. I guess first of all, if you give us a little more color what drove the win on New York Community -- I think it was a competitive process. And then on the strength on the integrated sales, if you could just maybe rank order the top 3 areas you're seeing differentiate yourselves right now in this quarter and next (ph), last quarter, that would be great. And thanks again, guys. -- Absolutely. Thanks, Darrin. So the world -- as the world becomes more digitally centric, we're clearly in an environment that is real-time. Many of the core banking systems in the US are not real-time, and so there has been a lot of focus on, do I take the step to real-time now or do I wait. In this case, New York Community made a determination that they wanted to go with real-time. The second thing is they wanted the flexibility of an API-based system, more modern technology. And then third and just as important is the suite of products that we bring in, everything from online and mobile to payments hub technology and including -- had we already been closed on First Data, I'm sure we would have looked at this as well.So the believe that we're going long into digital payments and real-time is the thing that helps move that end of the market in. So from that perspective, that's all great. On the integrated sales front, it's really around digital, so whether it be Architect or Mobiliti, a lot of movements on payments, Dovetail payment hub, Zelle, and then a fair amount of energy on just risk and fraud to make sure that as the more complex digital ecosystem comes together that they're able to protect themselves. So a lot of focus in those areas. -- Okay. That's great guys. Thank you. -- Thank you. -- Thanks, Darrin.Our next question is from Brett Huff of Stephens Incorporated. Your line is now open. -- Good afternoon, guys. -- Hi, Brett. -- Can you talk a little bit more about Dovetail? It sounds like we're seeing more traction at least than I expected on that. I know it's a bit of a Swiss Army knife asset. Can you give us the main drivers? Is this a payments hub future-proofing kind of thing? Or is this -- are there specific use cases that people are going after? Or is this a cost savings focus? Can you just illuminate that a little bit for us? -- Sure, Brett. It's a little of all of those things, although I do have to say I like the Swiss Army knife metaphor because that actually fits pretty well, where you have -- you have some trends going on, as you know, in the market that are having people take a look at the payments back-office infrastructure that you have, so whether it be around TCH or other real-time use cases, the opportunities to pair up Dovetail with Zelle and have a different way to move money. There is also a fair amount of focus going on right now around updating and enriching wire capabilities. So those use cases are making it more tangible to think about it.The other beauty of Dovetail is, we can install the hub and toggle capabilities as if and when clients need them. So in some cases, you've got clients who want everything; in other cases, they may only want wire, but we're enabling everything and then giving them what they want -- when they decide they need it. And it was consistent with our strategic thesis when we bought Dovetail, it's taken us a little bit longer. We said throughout the year, it was -- part of why we were seeing some slowness in sales is, these are longer, more technical sales. But as we're seeing them ramp up, they're beginning to get some nice momentum, and we expect that momentum to carry really for the next couple of years, as all sized institutions think differently about ACH as really the standard and moving in more to a real-time or near real-time capability. -- That's helpful. And a follow-up, another product question. Can you talk about bill pay? And I think you have a market-leading bill pay position and have also kind of migrated some of those things to the NOW Network. How does that fit in with the new group of merchants that you all are likely to have once this deal closes? Are there any specific ways or rails or things that we should be thinking about on how you connect the bill pay with some of those merchants? -- Yeah. We're very excited about the fact that First Data has, call it, order of magnitude somewhere around a 40 share in the US in merchants. And that is in fact an element of our rail. And so we're certainly examining, is there a different way to electronify the standard consumer-to-business payments. We're also quite excited in thinking about the combining some of the capabilities that we have in our cash management technologies, along with not just the retail piece of RXP but also the business to business piece of RXP and the size of the merchant databases, which are quite significant, and then looking at really how can we expedite payments, not just in the consumer side, but in the business-to-business side as well. So we see a lot of optionality there. It's one of the areas in which we believe we'll ultimately invest to help enhance the way businesses move money. -- Great. That's what I needed. Thank you. -- Thank you.Our next question is from David Koning of Baird. Your line is now open. -- Yeah. Hi, guys, congrats on a lot of fronts. So I guess first of all, in the FI segment, the margin decline has gotten bigger over the last three or four quarters. Is that just -- you are having a pretty good year. You were kind of flexible in terms of what you could spend on investments. I know the Lending sale obviously contributed. Is that what's kind of happening? And does that allow the margins to grow at an increasing rate through 2019 in that segment? -- Yeah, Dave. It's Bob. Probably the biggest driver of the margin into the second half of the year is really the ramp of that tax savings reinvestment. We announced that and launched that in the very beginning of the year, and by the time we really got it ramped and running, it was really into the third quarter, into the fourth quarter. And so you saw more of a significant headwind of that in the second half of the year than you did in the first half of the year. And of course, that will abate somewhat into 2018. So we hope to see margins lifting as part of the 50 basis point margin -- excuse me, the at least 50 basis point margin expansion we've forecasted for next year. -- We also had, Dave, a fairly meaningful decline in periodic revenue in the quarter, of which a big block of that outcomes in the Financial segment. So that also had a real impact in the quarter. -- It was a big driver for fourth quarter. -- Yeah. -- Yeah. Okay, got you. And then the follow-up question, I guess, in Payments, does Elan have significant seasonality? And is there enough cost savings and margin improvement that that actually drives some of the margin expansion in Payments? Or is that a little bit of a drag still in the first full year? -- Yeah. I think you should think about it as a drag in the first full year. We've obviously accounted for that in our 50 basis points of -- or at least 50 basis points of positive margin expansion this year, but it is going to drag us throughout the year. I don't see them having different seasonality in the rest of our card business, but there is going to be more card utilization in Q4 versus what we would see, for example, in Q1. -- Great. Thanks guys. Congrats. -- Thanks, Dave. -- Thanks, Dave.Our next question is from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. -- Excuse me. -- Hey, Jim. -- Thanks for taking -- hey, how are you? Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering -- and apologies if this has been answered already. If you look more broadly at the bank landscape, what do you think today's merger announcement says about the prospects of foreseeing additional actions more downmarket in your traditional client base? And maybe just talk about what you see in the bank consolidation environment, generally speaking, please. -- Sure. So -- and we talked a little bit about this in our prepared remarks. In my opinion, this is an example of a couple of good strong banks who decided that they're going to go harder at some of the larger banks, and they're going to look to consolidate to create more capacity to invest in technology. I think there's a real recognition of that importance, including an announcement where they're going to increase their technology spend meaningfully. I think that is what we're seeing across the ecosystem in terms of looking for different ways to spend money on technology. There is a real need to do that, whether it be digital, retail, risk, payments, all of those areas, many of the things that we've talked about and weaved in throughout our prepared comments.We have been saying for a couple of years we've been seeing a fair amount of M&A. I think that's going to continue because scale is going to matter. There's a lot of focus on deposits, deposit gathering. And for us, the good news is, even though we will continue to have the same kind of consolidation in our base, and we've seen for the last 30 years, I do think that the places in which we are going long are the places in which the investments are occurring. And I also think that -- I think it will send a message to the industry. When you're seeing companies that are both strong come together to be a better company -- we think 22 days ago, we made a similar announcement, but , Jim, I think that's what the messages is in that announcement today. -- That's helpful. Thanks very much. And then maybe just as a follow-up, can you maybe talk about relative to the revenue synergies you expect to see over the five years post transaction close, which are the one or two items that you think you could see soonest in terms of either the cross-sell opportunities or on the network side or the card processing side or just the pure cross sell of acquiring services? Maybe just kind of talk us through what you see kind of coming and materializing first, second and third in the progression to the $500 million. -- Sure. So I think as part of our original announcement, we said we expected nearly a $100 million of actual revenue synergy in the first 12 months post close. And a big part of that is because we believe, by the combination of the networks and the ability for routing opportunities and different forms of network innovation, that we will be able to, by virtue of the combination without having to go out and sell and implement, have lead time but just doing things in a more cohesive way with the scale of the companies coming together, that will create some incremental value there.I think the second thing is, we're going to have a good amount of success in the merchant bank space. One of the things that we've been very pleased about is that the feedback coming from the community institutions, all the way up through the largest banks, there is a lot of interest in how can we take the things that we're doing today, whether it be digital and core, and integrate them with merchant, and we will work on that and have -- be as expeditious as we can in getting that into the market. So I think we'll actually see benefits coming from that fairly early in the process, again, part of the nearly $100 million, but I think we'll see sales ramp up a little bit faster than we originally anticipated. And then, we'll have a number of different products to sell across both sets of client bases through the normal, think about it as our integrated sales, and I think that will probably -- could be in that order. -- Thank you. -- Thank you.Our next question is from Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays. Your line is now open. -- Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to revisit the BB&T-SunTrust deal. Can you help us understand to what degree there would potentially be an impact to your P&L from that transaction? Are they both customers of yours? Or are there any risk of consolidated pricing there or losing some of the business? If you can just speak to that, I'd appreciate it. -- Sure. So both SunTrust and BB&T are good long-term clients of ours, and we expect that that will continue. Of course, it's only been a few hours, but we have no reason to believe that that will not continue. The kinds of services that they are using from us, we think, are fairly well provided across the base, and they're not generally the kinds of things that you can combine, so bill payment would be a good example. So we think that that will continue to be -- will work well for us. They are also clients of First Data, and I assume that they will continue to be good clients of First Data. So for right now, we feel like there will be opportunities for us to do as much, if not more, given some of the things that we're doing and some of the investments that we believe they may make given the transaction. -- Got it. And my follow-up, I wanted to ask about DNA and this New York Community Bank win, which is impressive. This is kind of a proof point that DNA definitely appeals to a larger asset size institution. What does the pipeline look like for larger size deals here? Is this kind of more of an outlier or are you really seeing the momentum moving sort of upmarket with DNA? -- Yeah, Ramsey, that's a great question. Thanks. Thanks for the kind remarks. We have been -- interestingly, for the last couple of years, we have been very pleased at where -- how we have played in the kind of the larger bank RFP process. So we have -- basically in every large deal that has been done over the last couple of years, we have been a finalist in an RFP process, so in the competitive process. And frankly, one of the things that's been a little bit of a challenge is, it's hard to win your second one until you've won the first. And now that we have won this, we've won several banks that are in the $30 billion range. We now believe that this takes us up to the next level, and we are the only real-time modern technology platform in the US that's US based and US-centric, and we do think this will help us.Now, we also recognize that there are not a 100 of these going a year, but there are enough of them to matter. And as you know, we typically are really great in payments and digital and mobile and risk and those products up in that end, but we have not had the momentum in core, and we think this is a great step in the right direction. -- Great, thank you so much. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of George Mihalos. Your line is now open. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. -- Sure. -- Again, maybe thinking about the First Data acquisition and all the assets and the services that brings to you -- now you obviously have the merchant capability. You were more robust on the issuer processing side. You also get sort of a stronger switch. Is there an opportunity as you think of sort of recreating a network to sort of put something in place kind of similar to what a very large bank like Chase has done with sort of a ChaseNet type product? Is that something that's on the road map for you guys? -- I would say, at this stage, we are in the process of evaluating a number of different opportunities. Certainly looking at all of the different ways in which we can create network value for our issuer clients and our merchant clients is quite high on the list. Frankly, our focus at this stage has been more around where are the opportunities to innovate in the progression of the merchant capability and where are the ways to integrate in the progression of the issuer-merchant connectivity. And so we see some really intriguing opportunities there around digital enablement, around real-time connectivity between what's happening at the point of transaction, all the way back through cash management and back into the core account processing system.Frankly, we believe that one of the things that makes us unique is not just that we have the issuer and the merchant piece, but we have the core engine as well wrapped up by the back-office payments. And so we see a lot of opportunity there, especially as the world moves more to real-time. So a little bit of a long-winded answer, but we're still early in the process of evaluating those kinds of opportunities. -- Great. Appreciate that. That's very helpful. Then maybe just a quick follow-up, sort of a housekeeping item. How should we be thinking about the term fees in '19 versus '18, and maybe if we look at the 50 bps of margin expansion, kind of thinking about that between the Financial and Payments segment? Thank you. -- Sure, thank you. -- Yeah. For 2018, it was down a bit. I would expect 2019 in total, from a periodic revenue standpoint, to be up modestly, call it flat relative to what we saw in 2018 actual.Our next question is from Chris Shutler of William Blair & Company. Your line is now open. -- Hey, guys. Good afternoon. -- Hi, Chris. -- Hey, Chris. -- Jeff, could you give us a sense when you look at your FI customers, how many have merchant bank capabilities today and how many you view as kind of viable candidates for merchant acquiring? -- It's a really interesting question, and it's really interesting because there is really no bank or -- and many credit unions who don't have connectivity to merchant. What we have found in the community space is an incredible amount of fragmentation, very few institutions have kind of all -- going all in with a single source. It's much more around letting the merchants to some extent make those decisions because people like us have been built out the technological advantages around the integration that we believe we're going to be able to build.So we think it's very much a greenfields space, and the key is going to be how will you begin to prioritize the combination of front book and back book and how the institutions are focusing on their end market. And again, the second piece is, how do you make it easy through integration into the core system for banks to be in a place where they can better serve their merchants and create some economic value for them at the same time. And we think there's a reasonable amount of value for banks to capture and we like being in the point where our technology is actually making money for banks as opposed to costing them money. -- Great. And then just one cleanup. The 2019 guidance for EPS, can you just confirm that whether there are any share repurchases in that guidance? -- We've, essentially in our overall guidance, 10% to 12% growth off of the 2018 actual results, incorporated the deferment of our share repurchase through at least close, and that range essentially encompasses a variety of potential outcomes there. -- Hey, Chris. And I think I would clarify by saying, Bob really meant to say 10% to 14% of EPS guidance. I think, what we -- we obviously are not buying back shares at this point and we have to get to close. I think what we would say is, our 10% to 14% assumes whatever the different scenarios are that we believe will happen throughout the year. -- All right. Thank you. -- Thank you.Our next question is from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is now open. -- Thanks. Good afternoon, Jeff and Bob. -- Hi, Glenn. -- I wanted to go back to sort of the booking and sales environment. The 30% plus number in the fourth quarter was obviously great. But I'm curious how broad based it was or was it skewed by New York Community Bank, how much. And obviously, you've got the pipeline up 20%. So it certainly feels like the environment is really good. And just sort of a secondary question on that is New York Community Bank scheduled to convert at all in '19 or is that more of a 2020? I'm trying to understand if that impacts your organic growth in '19. -- Yes, so I would say, Glenn, that the sales for the quarter were incredibly broad based, a lot of activity across virtually every line. And many, many of the sales were on an outsourced ASP kind of cloud environment, right, so a lot of future recurring revenue that's going to get booked. Part of it is the second and third quarters were not great, and so we had some pickup in the fourth quarter for that. But the fact that we had such a big quarter ended up up for the year year-over-year even though a little short of quota, and the pipe is still up nearly 20%. We, like you, view that as being quite positive. And we like what's in the pipeline, the kinds of transactions that are in the pipeline. As far as New York Community goes, there will be a bit of positive impact in '19, but the substantial majority or the big boost will come in in 2020 and beyond. -- Okay and then just quickly, I don't know if you've got any more thoughts, it's only been three weeks since you announced the merger, but the $900 million of cost synergies, I'm just getting a sense -- trying to get a sense if there's any other sort of low-hanging fruits you found and would you be willing to share a little bit sort of thinking of the timing of how quickly you might have realized that. -- Yeah. So I would say that, as we referenced in our prepared remarks, that we're highly confident in both the $900 million of cost synergies and the $500 million of incremental revenue synergies over the period. I think when we made our -- when we talked about this, we talked about the fact that it's a little bit of a barbell. We expect to get a lot of benefit in the first couple of years. We're talking about a net 20% accretion, which obviously also takes into account the interest saves, which are not part of the $900 million. Then you start to get to some things that are a little bit tougher. You do work and you have it come back in.I would say, at this stage, we've gotten the integration kicked off. We're taking a look at things depending on if you're asking Frank or me, we're more bullish on the timing. Bob and his counterparts are a little bit -- they're going to give us the Heisman on that a little bit. We feel very good about the $900 million. We feel good about the timing that we talked about. And you can be sure that just like what we do in our operational effectiveness work, we're going to do everything we can to bring that in early and we'd would like nothing better, although this is not guidance. So we'd like nothing better than to get done earlier than we anticipated so we could get to the Phase 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 and everything else to build upon the muscle that we've built in Fiserv for the last 12 years. -- All right. Great. Thank you very much, Jeff. -- Thank you.Our next question is from Chris Brendler of The Buckingham Research Group. Your line is now open. -- Hi, thanks. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. One quick question on the merger. If I look at the cash flow projections and on this pro forma company, it looks pretty powerful, and your leverage guidance, I'm getting a pretty significant variance on the -- as I pay that down. Can you talk about potentially the merger and sort of integration costs and how significant those might be in your plans? Thanks. -- Sure. Thanks. And Chris, good to chat with you. So I would say that our plans around generating the free cash in the, call it, $4 billion-ish over the next few years, we're certainly feeling quite good about that. I think on balance, we've said that we expect the -- and Bob, correct me if I'm wrong -- we basically expect the one-time costs to be somewhere in the area of the $900 million of synergies. And so I think that's a general rule of thumb that we're using and that will probably go a little bit ahead of the synergies because you typically are spending the money as you book them and not -- or as you lock them down and not necessarily as they come into the P&L, but I don't think they'll be gigantic differences in the flow of that.And then as it relates to the leverage ratios, remember that what we've talked about is that we're going to suspend -- sorry, defer share repurchase between now and closing, and then we'll reevaluate what we have going on. We think the combination of the growth in EBITDA and the payback potential out of the significant free cash flow that we'll generate will allow us to pretty quickly get back to our more normal capital allocation strategy, which typically includes buying back shares. So we think that there will be a combination of tracks, paying down debt, repurchasing shares and probably doing little solution-oriented acquisitions, again, at some point, with the first two taking precedents. Bob, does that... -- Yep, exactly right. -- Okay. -- That makes kind of sense. Thanks, Jeff. And if I can ask a follow-up on, you mentioned the merger call the opportunity with Clover, potentially within the Fiserv client base. And I'm just sort of fascinated by that possibility. Can you just give me sort of the -- how you view Clover both as part of the merchant business and potentially bring that into banks today and offer them a Square-like solution and also what you're thinking in terms of the core business, the core processing business and how they can use Clover? Thanks. -- Yes, sure. So we were more really very bullish about the ability to bring Clover into the community banking system for a couple of reasons. First of all, we like the fact that we can drive we think a really powerful end-to-end integration advantage. We can digitally enable that to make it easier for merchants to be able to select on their own that technology. If they decide to open an account online, we envision being able to also sign up as a Clover merchant in that same process, so digitally enabling that element of the value chain. And then most importantly, it's a really attractive technology. It will be in a place where we can combat -- banks can combat Square if they so choose. And then lastly, and probably most importantly, is we believe that by integrating this into the core account processing systems, that we'll be able to create a data advantage for the banks vis-a-vis what they could have done otherwise and allow them to better serve their there SMBs and also to optimize their revenue, which we see happening in some of the larger institutions, so we're really excited about that and our banks are as well. -- Great, thanks, Jeff. I really appreciate it, and I just can't wait to see all this come together like... -- Thank you very much, appreciate it.Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Cantwell of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open. -- Hi, good afternoon. -- Hi, Jeff. -- Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Can I just circle back on something? You sort of just touched on this. I guess a little context for you here. We cover Community Bank. That's a client of yours and they're excited to see what you do with Clover, right? So I guess the crux of the question is, should we expect Clover as a potential offering by your bank partners using online? Because we know that, from First Data's standpoint, digital distribution was a big initiative of theirs with their larger JV partners. I guess what I'm trying to drive at is, is offering Clover at all of those financial institution websites a realistic outcome from all this, even if it might not be a near-term focus? Can you just give us your thoughts there? -- Yeah. And Jeff, thanks for asking the question. We realize as well as you do that one of the issues has been a lack of digitally enabling the selection of Clover or other merchant capability. And First Data has done a great job of building out the -- basically the procurement capability but have not been able to enable the whole process. One of the beauties of what we bring to the party is not only do we have the core system, but in many many cases, we are also the digital enabler hosting websites, doing lots of those kinds of things. We're serving we're serving somewhere in the area of 110 million digital users today in the US. We have a 140 million accounts that we're processing for. And so when you bring that together, we do see opportunity. Now to your point, we think it will take some time to figure out the right way to do that, but that's pretty high on our list, just given the opportunity that we see and the opportunity that the clients see as well. -- Thanks very much. -- Thank you.And our last question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open. -- Hi, thanks for squeezing me in. -- Sure. -- I had -- I should ask it like a multi-part one, right, just to -- it's been a long day for me too. So on the -- everyone has asked about sort of the cost synergies. I wonder -- just two parts, and I will ask them upfront. First, on the $500 million of revenue synergies, can you break that down for us? Is a cross-selling versus new products versus other products? And then the second part of that question is, which I'll just ask upfront, traditionally having covered FTC and having covered Fiserv and the core processors, you're selling into different parts of the bank with different decisions and different people. And I'm wondering, as you start to see this come together, how do you bridge that gap? Would a core processing system necessarily -- or someone who uses a different core processing system necessarily convert because you've got merchant acquiring? Or is it all from the outside-in and as you've talked about with Square, et cetera? Thanks. -- Yeah, absolutely. So let me take the first part of that first. So when we announced the deal, we talked about three distinct buckets of value. We talked about a couple of hundred million dollars of revenue synergies. So 40% of the $500 million would really be around merchant bank acquiring services. The second bucket was around really payments network innovation, expanding our payments offerings and network innovation. That was around $250 million. And then the last $50 million was around integrated sales, just generally cross-selling across all of the things that both of the companies do, and that's really around the world. And again, we provided numbers that we were highly confident that we would be able to achieve. I would also put in one other caveat. We also talked about the fact that we made a $500 million incremental investment into technology, into supporting the technologies, and that is separate from the $500 million. So the benefits of that $500 million aren't accounted for in the $500 million of revenue synergies. So we continue to feel good about that aspect of it.As it relates to the second part of your question, really around -- to your point about the core processors and payments, in the largest banks, clearly that's going on separately. You've got back office payments people looking at payment hubs and you've got front office payments looking at cards and you've got core looking no one -- no one in the largest banks are really, for the most part, looking at core, but certainly that would go into a different place. In the core -- even in the New York Community Bank level, that sized institutions doesn't have the fragmentation that you're talking about, and these things are looked to be bought together. And because we have such strong relationships, whether they be digitally based or payments based or core based, in the, call it, everything but the top 10 banks, they are less fragmented than having to literally go to a bunch of different people.Once you -- and maybe it's 15, but for the most part, the relationships that we have and First Data have are going to be extensible and not going to be as murky as it will seem on the surface to go in and be able to talk through the value. In fact, many, many, many, many clients are wanting to do that already. Of course, we have to wait until we close to be able to go out and do that. But the conversations and enthusiasm is certainly out there right now, and we're not seeing any issues around that kind of fragmentation or silos coming from the financial institutions or the merchants. -- Thank you. -- Thank you.

The upside was driven by solid performance of card services, biller solutions and electronic payments, which were, however, partially offset by lower periodic revenues.In the reported quarter, organic debit transaction grew in high single digits and total P2P transactions, including both Popmoney and Zelle solutions, grew 74%. Mobiliti ASP subscribers increased 21% to exceed 8 million. The company also witnessed client addition in its unified digital platform Architect.Revenues at the  segment decreased 7.9% year over year to $615 million.

Adjusted operating margin declined 60 basis points (bps) year over year to 33.4%. Adjusted operating margin was hurt by structural headwinds from the Lending Transaction and investments funded from tax savings, which collectively had a negative impact of 160 bps in the quarter.Adjusted operating income at the Payments and Industry Products segment was $315 million, up 9.4% year over year. Adjusted operating margin of 36.4% was flat year over year.Operating income at the Financial Institution Services segment totaled $208 million, down 11.5% year over year due to the Lending transaction.

Revenues of $1.55 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $2.4 million and increased 2.3% year over year.Fiserv has a decent surprise history. The company beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, the average being 0.7%. For the first quarter of 2019, the consensus mark declined 2.4% in the past 30 days.Fiserv holds a dominant position in the financial and payments solutions business, courtesy of high recurring revenues and consistent technology upgrades. In 2018, which marked the third year of the company's ongoing five-year operational effectiveness program, it achieved $200 million of the expected $250 million. The savings can be attributed to solid labor optimization and procurement benefits. The company is optimistic about achieving the remaining target of $50 million in 2019, thereby closing the program a year earlier. This is expected to drive long-term growth.The rapidly changing financial services industry and increasing demand for digital banking as well as payment services provide significant growth opportunities to Fiserv.

We recently learned that two significant companies in the payments and financial-services technology space are about to join forces.  (NASDAQ: FISV) is buying  (NYSE: FDC) for $22 billion in stock, valuing the target at a 30% premium compared to where it was trading prior to the deal's announcement.In this segment from  , host Mac Greer and senior analysts Emily Flippen and Jason Moser discuss the potential benefits of combining the financial services technology player and the payment processor, what each one brings to the table, and how this deal reflects the trends in the space.A full transcript follows the video.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, the Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Walmart wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks!The author(s) may have a position in any stocks mentioned. Let's begin with the big deal of the day, financial technology provider Fiserv is buying payment processor First Data in a $22 billion all-stock deal. Jason, that $22 billion number represents a nearly 30% premium over where First Data closed on Tuesday. First Data up big today. This is a very good deal for First Data shareholders. Congratulations! You should feel good about this. Fiserv is a company Matt and I talk about on  here and there on Mondays. Ultimately, in a nutshell, this buys Fiserv market share into a part of the value chain that moves money around in this world of electronic payments. It gives the combined entity a chance to cut costs and boost margins over time, assuming they execute.The mechanics of the deal, as you mentioned, are relatively fair. All stock. It does seem like Fiserv has had a decent past 12 months over the past three years. Before today's sell-off, the stock was up 67%. It's not like they're selling with the stock at depressed levels. That's good. Probably could have gotten away with issuing debt to do this. The thing about stock deals, stock is still theoretical. It doesn't cost them any money to do it. You see these big tech companies do it all the time, like  buying WhatsApp. Everybody has an opinion on that.Ultimately, First Data is a merchant acquirer. They just play a part of that transaction when you're going from the merchant to the  network, to the bank. That's what Fiserv does. It could be argued that their competitive position is a little bit trickier in today's world with  and  . That's why I think the deal was a pretty good one. I'm not sure I feel as strongly about First Data as I do about Fiserv. All in all, probably a sensible acquisition. I think this is probably a testament to what's happening in the bigger space. We're seeing a lot of consolidation. There's a lot of small players acquiring other small players, big players acquiring small players in technology in general, like  and  , which we talked about. There's a lot of consolidation going around because we have so many new start-ups operating in the space. So, when I see stuff like this happen, it's not really a surprise. You can't have so many different operators within payments or other industries operating independently. There needs to be some consolidation. Let's talk about that space, to wrap this story up. Jason, you talk a lot about the war on cash. We talk about names like Square and PayPal. Does this deal change your thinking at all in terms of that bigger war on cash? It makes me feel like Square and PayPal's position is a bit stronger perhaps today than it was five years ago. To understand what Fiserv does -- these are two very different businesses. Fiserv is essentially a software provider for smaller financial institutions. That's a good business in which to be. You provide some good software to big banks like this. They don't want to switch systems ever. So, you deliver a decent product. Over time, you can develop some switching costs there, which is a little bit of a competitive advantage.But I think the real question here is going to be, where is First Data's position in this value as we move toward this trend of electronic payments? Ten years ago, First Data's value proposition would be a lot clearer than it is today. I think today, investors, including myself, would ask themselves the question, why does First Data need to exist in a world where Square and PayPal are becoming more and more able to do more and more things? That question, time will only answer. A nice thing for Fiserv if, for some reason, First Data's business falls by the wayside -- again, they only issued stock to do it, so they're not really out of pocket. Shareholders get screwed, but hey, that's life.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["all Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Fiserv (FISV) reports results for the quarter ended December 2018. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 7, 2019, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the  will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.This financial services technology company is expected to pos  of $0.84 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +18.3%.Revenues are expected to be $1.55 billion, up 2.1% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.78% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Fiserv, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.03%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Fiserv will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the las  ed quarter, it was expected that Fiserv would pos  of $0.77 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.75, delivering a surprise of -2.60%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Fiserv appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The agreement combines two companies in the financial services industry that surprisingly overlap very little in their core capabilities.Fiserv provides financial institutions and banks with services such as electronic bill pay, digital and mobile banking solutions, and financial planning tools. First Data is a payment processing company that provides merchants with point-of-sale hardware, such as its  , that enables them to accept electronic and digital payments.Under the terms of the deal, First Data shareholders will receive 0.303 shares of Fiserv once the acquisition is finalized. On the day the deal was announced, this represented a $22.74 price, an almost 30% premium to the price First Data's shares were trading at before the announcement. It should be noted, though, that the price was also well below First Data's 52-week high of $26.62. At the agreement's closing, Fiserv shareholders will own 57.5% of the newly combined company, and First Data shareholders will own 42.5%. Fiserv CEO Jeffery Yabuki will remain the combined company's CEO, while First Data CEO Frank Bisignano will become chief operating officer.Let's take a closer look at what Fiserv will look like once the two companies are integrated and what the move says about the current state of the payments and fintech industries.Fiserv and First Data management teams believe this $22 billion acquisition will create significant cost savings and revenue synergies. Image source: Getty Images.Management of the two companies expects the acquisition to lead to $900 million in cost savings and $500 million in revenue synergies over a five-year period, and generate $4 billion in free cash flow by 2022. Let's tackle these issues in order: In the conference call with analysts following the deal's announcement, Yabuki said, \"We spent significant time and diligence validating these assumptions and expect the savings to come from a number of areas, including the elimination of duplicative overhead, streamlined and enhanced technology infrastructure, increased operational efficiencies, process improvements, and global footprint optimization.\" However, when questioned by an analyst, he clarified that the \"substantial majority\" of cost savings would not be coming from platform consolidation, but from the \"duplicative structures\" that are inevitably present when any two large companies combine.The more significant cost saving, though it is not included in the $900 million figure, will come from the refinancing of First Data's debt. Fiserv has said it expects to refinance First Data's approximate $17 billion debt immediately upon the deal's closing. While that is still a lot of debt, the combined entity will be able to swallow that bitter pill a bit more easily than First Data alone. For the first two years after the acquisition, Fiserv will suspend its share buyback program to prioritize paying down that mountain of debt. In the conference call, Yabuki said, \"Our revenue synergies will be driven by a focus on additional client value in areas such as bank Merchant Services and Clover, credit processing, expanded biller and payment services, along with many additional opportunities to innovate across our network.\" Nearly $100 million of revenue will be seen in the first year alone, and Yabuki expects the deal to increase earnings per share about 20% in the first year.While there is not a direct overlap between much of the two companies' services, that doesn't mean they don't exist. Take Clover, First Data's cloud-based, mobile point-of-sale solution. In First Data's third quarter, Clover processed about $17.5 billion in payment volume, a 45% increase year over year. Banks that subscribe to Fiserv's platforms can now offer Clover as a default point-of-sale option to their business accounts. As Bisignano put it, the deal \"massively changes the distribution capability of Clover.\"While all of the synergies listed above seem plausible, this move was all about Fiserv and First Data playing defense, not offense. It wasn't too long ago that the payment processing industry offered a largely commoditized service to merchants with established storefronts. The arrival of upstarts, such as  (NYSE: SQ) , began to change all of that. first offered mobile point-of-sale solutions, then moved to other innovative solutions, including giving merchants immediate access to their money (for a fee), payment processing solutions tailored to  , and a  . With Clover becoming a part of Fiserv, banks will have the same access to sales data that Square has and be able to offer loans to merchants in much the same way Square does now. For financial institutions losing market share to Square, that is a compelling proposition.Fiserv is also facing renewed competition from upstarts such as  (NYSE: QTWO) , which is growing revenue much faster by offering digital expertise and cloud-based platforms to  .While this deal does not solve all of these problems, it increases both companies' reach into sectors where they previously had no presence. The interesting combinations and larger distribution channels might be enough to recharge growth and stave off disruptive upstarts a bit longer. While I'm not rushing to buy shares of either company just yet, once the acquisition is complete, the more-robust Fiserv will bear close watching by investors.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Currently, Cardtronics has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Fiserv has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that CATM has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.CATM currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.14, while FISV has a forward P/E of 22.16. We also note that CATM has a PEG ratio of 1.18. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. FISV currently has a PEG ratio of 1.85.Another notable valuation metric for CATM is its P/B ratio of 3.26. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, FISV has a P/B of 11.71.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to CATM's Value grade of A and FISV's Value grade of D.CATM stands above FISV thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that CATM is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Despite the three-day weekend ahead of them, the bulls were willing to plow in, driving the  up 1.32% to the highest close in over a month.Winners were plentiful, though the biggest and best gains came from companies that didn't necessarily move the whole market.

The move that day wasn't meant to last, however. Too strong to sustain and with a gap left behind in the process, that day's doji ended up being a pivot back into a downtrend. The doji in question is marked with a yellow arrow on the daily chart.The line in the sand never stopped mattering, however \u2026 or lines in the sand, now. The recent bounce is once again testing that resistance, and while INTC shares aren't back above either, they're close to breaking back above both and kick-starting a sustained gain.Click to Enlarge  \u2022 One of the lines in question is around $49.40, plotted with a blue dashed line on both stock charts. With the exception of the singularity on Dec. 3, Intel hasn't been able to trade above that level.\u2022 Also coming back into play now is the white 200-day moving average line, currently at $49.44. Traders are afraid to push their luck there now, and it only took a kiss of that line on October to send Intel into a dive.\u2022 Friday's high-volume move is telling. Most stocks only saw tepid pre-weekend buying interest on Friday.Very early this year we noted  and looking to move into a new uptrend. The clues were only tentative at the time, but still worth watching.Much has changed in the meantime. Namely, the big technical ceiling that were still a factor then have since been left in the rearview mirror, and another resistance level that looked like it could have been a problem has also been hurdled. A good start to this week's action could seal the deal on what could be a huge rebound effort.Click to Enlarge  \u2022 The previous problem area was a combination of the blue 20-day and purple 50-day moving average lines. Those ceilings were cleared back on the 3rd, and though the gray 100-day moving average line caused a stall last week, the bulls punched through on Friday.\u2022 This is all part of a much bigger breakout effort illustrated on the weekly chart. The line that had guided EBAY lower over the course of the latter half of 2018 stopped doing so three weeks ago.\u2022 The bears are likely to push back from here. Keep in mind breakout thrusts are often born out of a process rather than a single-day event.It was only  we suggested Fiserv was a buying opportunity, despite the previous day's drastic loss on the heels of news that it was aiming to acquire  (NYSE:  ). Too many hints suggested the sellers overshot their target, ceding all control back to the buyers.Things panned out exactly as suspected. FISV followed through on Wednesday's pivot on Thursday, and the buyers dug in again on Friday. But, that pendulum may have swung back as far as it was going to. From here, the buyers are apt to take at least a short break.Click to Enlarge \u2022 Though an impressive move, Friday's advance was suspiciously stopped exactly where one would expect - at the 100-day moving average line, plotted in gray. The bears drew a line in the sand there, and will likely stick with it this week.\u2022 Underscoring the idea that Fiserv will need to pull back first before continuing to move higher again is the distinct lack of buying volume seen since then.\u2022 The most plausible outcome from here is a dip back between the moving average lines around $78 and $73, a regrouping, and a renewed rally effort that takes shape at a more sustainable pace.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n recent trading, shares of Fiserv Inc (Symbol: FISV) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $81.58, changing hands for $82.79/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 12 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Fiserv Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $71.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $95.00. The standard deviation is $7.292.But the whole reason to look at the  FISV price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with FISV crossing above that average target price of $81.58/share, investors in FISV have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $81.58 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

There's a lot of consolidation going around because we have so many new start-ups operating in the space. So when I see stuff like this happen, it's not really a surprise. You can't have so many different operators within payments or other industries operating independently. There needs to be some consolidation. Let's talk about that space, to wrap this story up. Jason, you talk a lot about the war on cash. We talk about names like Square and PayPal. Does this deal change your thinking at all in terms of that bigger war on cash? It makes me feel like Square and PayPal's position is a bit stronger perhaps today than it was five years ago. To understand what Fiserv does -- these are two very different businesses. Fiserv is essentially a software provider for smaller financial institutions. That's a good business in which to be. You provide some good software to big banks like this. They don't want to switch systems ever. So you deliver a decent product. Over time, you can develop some switching costs there, which is a little bit of a competitive advantage.But I think the real question here is going to be, where is First Data's position in this value as we move toward this trend of electronic payments? Ten years ago, First Data's value proposition would be a lot clearer than it is today. I think today, investors, including myself, would ask themselves the question, why does First Data need to exist in a world where Square and PayPal are becoming more and more able to do more and more things? That question, time will only answer. A nice thing for Fiserv if, for some reason, First Data's business falls by the wayside -- again, they only issued stock to do it, so they're not really out of pocket. Shareholders get screwed, but hey, that's life. Let's turn our attention to the airlines. Emily, shares of United Continental up around 6% at the time of our taping after United reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue. This is really shocking, I think, to a lot of United investors. Last year, United said they were going to achieve a new strategy for growth via increasing capacity. And the market just killed them for it. I think a lot of people in their minds thought, \"increased capacity means lower prices, competitors are going to increase their capacity, then we're going to see a bunch of airlines price for disaster because we're competing over fares and who can be the cheapest, and it's just not an environment that you want to be in.\"This is their firs  throughout 2019 and it's better than expected. They're seeing that they're actually making a lot more revenue from the increased capacity by expanding their bases. I think they're going to continue that strategy throughout 2019. It's really interesting, this news. I don't think a lot of investors were necessarily expecting it. But when you look at the hard numbers of what they're doing, it shouldn't be much of a surprise. Is this a case of a business getting more efficient? Or are they just able to charge a lot more? Or both? Both, for sure both. The seat prices, we see going down, but the extras go up. By expanding the capacity, building out their three main home bases and making them more accessible, I think their idea is not that airlines are competing over the same customer, but they're actually drawing more customers to fly, as a result. Jason? Pretty sure, also, that Matty Argersinger was telling us to keep an eye on the airline industry for 2019. He was. That's in line with a lot of what Emily was just saying. Let's move on to Snap, the Snap soap opera. Shares of Snap down almost 10% at the time of our taping. On Tuesday, the technology company said that CFO Tim Stone is leaving the company after just eight months on the job. Here are a few stats. Stone moved to Snap in May after working at  for 20 years. In addition to his salary, he had $20 million in restricted stock with an option to buy 500,000 common shares. Stone will not get the majority of that stock, as it was scheduled to vest over four years. So he's leaving with all this stock on the table. What's going on here? That's a really good question. I think it's interesting to see someone coming from Amazon who has such a quick turnover at Snap. It begs the question of, Amazon doesn't have the best reputation for company culture, so how bad are things at Snap that he couldn't even last a year? I don't have much insight into the Snap culture, unfortunately, but I don't think it bodes well for the company. No. We've read a lot into the culture at Snap. Again, you're reading that, but those are the only accounts we can go by. And they don't seem all that clear. I like to have a lot of fun with this company because I really don't like it. What is Snap? What is this company? They're a self-proclaimed camera company. I would argue that today, it seems they're more in the business of revolving doors, based on everybody who's leaving. Listen, I'm working a little bit on my roasting skills here. I like it! I came up with these on the ride to work today. If you scrounge through the change in your couch, you're likely to come up with enough money to buy a share of Snap before a cup of coffee at  . Hey-o! I'm not saying things are dire, but we may need to start referring to the company as Snapped. Nice! Shareholders' best chance for a double from today's price is a reverse split. I'm out. George Costanza, leave it on -- no, no. Listen, we give these guys a hard time, but really, we should, because this is a company that probably should have never come public. I blame the underwriters for that. It's hard to blame Evan Spiegel because they gave him a lot of money to do this. I have a feeling you're going to blame Evan Spiegel. Greed is just greed. The bottom line is investors deserve at least a competent leader, and he's not one. Listen, we hold other CEOs to the same account. Kevin Plank is one that I've kept on the hot seat all of 2018. At  . Put him on the hot seat in 2019 because we saw the same problem there at Under Armour. Executives would come in there, work, and then they'd leave. A pattern starts emerging, and you realize that he's not the easiest guy to work with. Thankfully with Under Armour, their COO and CFO have stayed on. That's the standard we've held. That's one of those red flags we've been watching. With Spiegel and Snap, unfortunately, executives keep on leaving. This is not the first person to leave. They have a big problem here.The other problem, a really damning chart I ran across on  the other day from Rob Price over at Business Insider, I think this says a lot, there's a Cowen survey that was done in December 2018. The question was posed to ad partners if, given the choice, which would your largest client prefer to advertise on? Choice was between Instagram stories and Snapchat stories. One hundred percent answered Instagram stories to 0% Snapchat stories.That's a huge problem, and it doesn't seem like they've come up with any way to answer it yet. Yeah, those numbers don't seem good. No. When we look out into the future, five years from now, and we're looking at Snap, has Snap faded away? Slowly or quickly? Has it been acquired? Or has it come up with some sort of second act? We're talking about the great rebound, the great recovery of Snap. There's 100% a second act here. No, no, I'm joking. [laughs] [laughs] Wow! I was getting ready -- It's a slow decline, I don't think it's going to be a fast decline. I think they're going to hold on for as long as possible. I really don't think anyone's making an acquisition here because they still haven't figured out a way to effectively monetize. Jason's stat perfectly encompasses it -- what are you getting when you're buying Snapchat? Not much! I think they're probably going to struggle along for a little while. It's going to be that sad, slow decline. Yeah. I want to be glass half full and say there's something there. I tend to agree with Emily here, though. I don't know what it is. Maybe at a fraction of what the market's paying for it today, there's something that somebody out there might like. But clearly, the platform is bleeding users. I admittedly never used Snapchat, but it sounds like a lot of people don't use Snapchat, and that's a big problem. I think the only chance they really have is what we've seen other companies in the space, like Twitter and Facebook, do over time, acquire other apps, bring them into their family. They're not really doing that. Part of that is probably them recognizing themselves as a camera company. Most people say camera, they think hardware. We don't like investing in that stuff. So, yeah, I tend to agree with Emily. OK, let's talk Apple. You have an iPhone. I have an iPhone. Emily, do you have an iPhone? I do have an iPhone. What model? What vintage? I had a 4S up until a few months ago, when I upgraded to a 7S -- a refurbished 7S. Wow. I've got a 6S. Jason, what do you have? My wife and I just upgraded from 6S to the new X. OK, Mr. Fancy Pants. Well, let's wait a minute. If you have an iPhone and you had your battery replaced this past year, you are not alone. Apple replaced 11 million batteries in 2018 during its $29 replacement program. During a normal year, Apple expects to replace between 1 [million] to 2 million batteries. So they replaced around 10X as many batteries as they expected. That news just came out. Apparently, gone are the days when Apple can assume that everyone wants the newest model. I did that battery replacement on the 6 when they were offering that thing because they were pulling back on the performance of the phone. I took advantage of replacing that battery on the 6. And it did extend the life of it. I thought it was actually going to be a little bit better. It was OK. How much of a threat is this to the business? There's been a lot of talk about China and the slowdown in China. But when I see this news as an Apple shareholder, I think this worries me even more. By the way, I'm not getting a new iPhone. You've got to bring back the headphone jack and you've got to improve the battery life. Well, you might be alone in that regard. [laughs] I have to wonder, do people who work at Apple use Apple phones? How could they only think that about a million people would want to replace it for the batteries? I know personally, my phone hardly makes it through a day with the battery life. It shouldn't have been a surprise for Apple that so many people got their batteries replaced.But you know what? I don't think it matters that much. Apple has such a strong ecosystem. Push came to shove when I was getting rid of my old 4S. I was like, I could get any phone on the market, but it's just so much easier for me to go ahead and get that refurbished 7. It was about the same price as an alternative. And yeah, the alternatives are a little bit newer, but the process I'd have to go through to transfer, it's like, eh, I'll just bite the bullet. So you think this story for investors, a bit of a nothing burger? Does it matter? It might be a bit of a nothing burger, but I don't think it bodes well for whatever person made that original estimate. I think somebody lost their job. [laughs] Yeah, it's one where you think, as consumers, this is great. The phones get better over time. The phone should last longer over time. That's just the evolution of tech. But if you're an investor, that kind of sucks because that means people aren't upgrading their phone as much as they used to. So if Apple wants to get people upgrading more often, they've got to offer more incentives. Eventually, what that all plays out into is their ability to raise prices on the phones in one form or another. We're hitting that peak here, because I think we're hitting the peak of what these phones can do. I'll say, going from the 6 to the XR, I'm still not impressed with some of the user interface. I think Apple Pay took a major step back, they added more friction to that process, in a process where they need to take away as much friction as possible. The face ID is, eh. We're at a point now where the biggest advancements they can make in these phones, in my opinion, is to make the battery last as long as it can. And that, to me, has been the greatest part about going from the 6 to the X: Now I have a phone that can make it through all day without having to recharge it. But I know those days are limited, too.To Emily's point, Apple is more than just the iPhone. I know a lot of investors will love to make a big deal out of this. Let's step back and take a little bit of a longer-term view there and recognize all of the strengths of this business still. I think they're going to be OK. Any chance I get the new model, I get my headphone jack back? I really wish. I'm grieving still. I applaud them for sending me the headphones with the new jack. But I ran into the situation, I was on a plane the other day, and I'm thinking, \"I'd love to plug in and watch one of the movies on the screen there.\" And guess what? You couldn't do it. I couldn't do it. You could do it with my headphones -- and my rotary phone. I could have. That was a bit of a downer. These are the advancements, you have to make these trade-offs, I guess. What's more important, the battery or the headphones? Let's move overseas for this last story. This is, I think, my favorite story. An EU judge has ruled against McDonald's in the battle of the Macs. McDonald's had been engaged in a trademark battle over the Big Mac with the Irish-based fast-food chain Supermac's. Now, because of this judge's decision, Supermac's will be allowed to expand throughout the U.K. and Europe. More importantly, it means McDonald's no longer has the right to their Big Mac trademark. Supermac's managing director hailed the decision as \"the end of the McBully.\" [laughs] This is not a nothing nugget. This is a big deal for McDonald's. Now, anyone can start selling Big Macs all across the EU. I think my favorite quote from the proceedings was from the EU Intellectual Property Office. I quote, they said, \"McDonald's was not putting the Big Mac trademark to genuine use.\" [laughs] My challenge to McDonalds now is to start selling Super Mac burgers across the EU. Stick it to the man in that regard. I like that. I think it's a missed opportunity if they don't. I mean, who do you think wins that case, though? Oh, McDonald's, 100%. More than likely. That's amazing! It's amazing they would say it's not genuine use. Now, having said that, I'm a McDonald's shareholder. Why are they wasting time with lawsuits like this? Supermac's was started by a guy who says that the name came from a nickname that he was given. Why is McDonald's worried about that? What are they doing? What's more valuable for McDonald's -- is that the actual food or the way they've branded it? I think that McDonald's right now is more a brand than anything else. I mean, the food is totally replicable for the most part. But does anyone confuse Supermac's for McDonald's? No, I don't think they are. But I think that when you have a business that values its branding, as McDonald's does, and they've built that stuff through the years, they're going to try to set every example they can. It's a waste of money. It seems like it. Improve your food and just keep your eye on the ball. Every time Mac hosts  from here on out, we have to introduce him as Supermac. They may sue me. McDonald's may come after me for my name. It's this arrogance. I'd like to see them get past us. Just try it. We've got your back. Don't worry, buddy! As long as I have my iPhone 6S with the auxiliary headphone jack. OK, Emily, Jason, thanks for joining me! Thank you! Thank you!

While Fiserv is known for processing credit and debit card transactions for banks, First Data handles the merchant side of the proceedings.The all stock-deal is at a premium of about 30% to First Data's closing price on Jan 15.

One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 337 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the FISV options chain for the new December 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $70.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.50. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $70.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $66.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of FISV, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $74.69/share today.Because the $70.00 strike represents an approximate 6% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 70%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of FISV stock at the current price level of $74.69/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $80.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 13.27% if the stock gets called away at the December 20th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if FISV shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Fiserv Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing FISV's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $80.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $80.00 strike represents an approximate 7% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 54%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

Beats from Bank of America (), Goldman (), Delta Airlines () and United Continental () are good news, not just for the companies concerned but also for the market as a whole.Because of that and coverage of the resounding defeat of Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s Brexit proposal in the British parliament, the news of a massive deal in fintech is flying a bit under the radar, but that deal offers up a great long-term opportunity for investors.Fiserv () is buying First Data Corporation () in an  that values FDC at around $22 billion. As is usually the case in big deals like this, while shares of the target company have risen to adjust for the new valuation, stock in the acquirer has fallen in early trading.FDC finished yesterday at around $17.50 then jumped to a high of $22.70 this morning before pulling back somewhat. FISV bounced around, initially falling before moving higher on the announcement, reaching $78.11 in pre-market trading before dropping to around $70.That kind of knee-jerk reaction to buying another company with stock is logical in some ways but is focused on the short term and is very often reversed quite quickly. The immediate value of the acquiring company is obviously affected. Either they spend available cash, add debt to their balance sheet, or, as in this case, dilute existing stock by issuing new shares to pay for the deal.Whether or not that weighs on the stock in the long-term though depends on many factors, including the state of the industry, the profitability of the acquired company, the fit between the two, and the price paid relative to previous valuation. This deal scores on all those fronts.Source: Statista.comFintech is a relatively young, rapidly growing area of business as you can see, and up until now FDC has been getting their share of that growth with year on year earnings up over 35%. And they are very profitable. They reported over $5 billion in gross profit over the last year, with free cash flow of over $1.3 billion. The fit also looks good as the two companies tend to focus on different areas of the industry, but it is the value of the deal that stands out.The price being paid may represent a premium to the current stock price, but it around ten percent lower than the high achieved as recently as September. That makes this looks like an opportunist move to acquire a company that at a pre-deal trailing P/E of just over 9 looks decidedly cheap.That is not to say that there aren\u2019t reasons for that low multiple. FDC has a substantial debt load and, while profit growth has been excellent, revenue growth over the last year has been disappointing. Still, a current ratio of 1.02 and the strong levered free cash flow suggest that the debt is manageable and combining with FISV will increase growth opportunities.All in all, this is a logical expansion for FISV in a rapidly growing industry.

Fiserv shareholders will own 57.5% of the combined company and First Data shareholders will own the rest.First Data's shares closed 21.1% higher at $21.24 on Wednesday, while Fiserv's fell 3.3 percent.This is one of the biggest financial mergers in a decade and will help Fiserv emerge as one of the world's largest payments and financial technology providers.Fiserv will link its merchant and cash management capabilities with that of First data to expand offerings and provide First Data's Clover cloud-based platforms for small and medium-sized businesses. The company will be able to develop a differentiated, end-to-end payments platform and offer additional payment methods. | Fiserv and First Data are targeting the development of complementary technology capabilities and solutions to enhance client value as well as increase market differentiation. The combined company plans a $500-million incremental investment to enhance solutions over five years.Also, the acquisition seems to be part of Fiserv's increased push to fend off growing competition from the likes of Fidelity National Information Services  Square  and Adyen NV.The transaction is anticipated to be accretive to Fiserv's adjusted EPS by more than 20% in the first full year following the close and generate free cash flow of more than $4 billion in the third year following the close.It is expected to generate at least $500 million of revenue synergies and $900 million of run-rate cost synergy savings over five years.The deal should provide respite to First Data CEO Frank Bisignano, who has been struggling to turn the company round. First Data was grappling with a debt from a $29-billion leveraged buyout led by private equity firm KKR & Co Inc in 2007.Fiserv had secured debt to refinance First Data's existing $17-billion debt and expects to return to its historical leverage levels within two years after the deal closes.Bisignano will become President and COO and join the board of directors of the combined company.Fiserv carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

After a poor open and then a sharp move to lower lows, the buyers came roaring back later in the day to force a close near the top of the range. The pivot has already been made.\u2022 Underscoring the potential capitulation is a huge volume surge. This indicates the last of the would-be sellers were finally flushed out. Now the buyers can start to trickle in without facing a headwind.\u2022 Curiously, yesterday's low around $68.50 was also last month's low, and last May's low. The bulls have drawn a line in the sand there.\u2022 Still, this is a scenario that requires a little follow-through to erase any lingering doubts that the reversal effort is for real.In  of the market's top three stock charts, the brewing bearishness of  (NYSE:  ) was highlighted, but only because rivals like were also bumping into a headwind. When an entire group of stocks starts to struggle, it generally indicates a secular undertow that won't be easy to stop.In the meantime, Pfizer itself worked its way into a little more technical trouble, losing ground after being unable to press above its key moving averages too \u2026 moving averages that have formed bearish crosses while most other stocks are seeing bullish ones.Click to Enlarge  \u2022 A couple of weeks ago the blue 20-day moving average line fell below the purple 50-day and gray 100-day moving average lines, and the 50-day line is close to breaking below the 100-day line. It all points to accelerating bearishness.\u2022 The selling volume has also been greater than the buying volume of late, even if both have been choppy.\u2022 The white 200-day moving average line at $40.27 has the potential to act as support should the potential selloff take shape, but there's an interim floor around $42.00 that would have to fail first before any of this weakness matters.Finally, though almost all financial stocks were up on Wednesday, too many of them are now too overextended to bother stepping into now.Not PNC Financial Services Group, however. PNC is still closer to its recent low than not, with a whole lot of room to keep climbing. And, the recent chart action says this stock has built a near-perfect launch pad from which PNC will continue to rally.Click to Enlarge  \u2022 Notice that PNC Financial Services shares have mostly stagnated since late last year, but within the past few days has started to log higher highs and higher closes.\u2022 Better yet, Wednesday's pullback to the blue 20-day moving average line was a perfect opportunity for the profit-takers to pile in. They didn't though, overwhelmed by the buyers waiting in the wings. Rising volume confirms more buyers are crawling out of the woodwork.\u2022 Zooming out to the weekly chart we can see the December pullback dragged PNC all the way to an established support line that extends back to March's lows.

Shares of WEX have declined 0.9% in the same time frame.Earnings growth along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company's strong prospects.WEX's fourth-quarter earnings are projected to grow 41.6% compared with 21.1% for Fiserv. Looking at the full-year 2018 picture, WEX's earnings are projected to grow 51.6% while that of Fiserv are expected to increase 22.3%. For 2019, WEX's earnings are expected to register 15.5% growth compared with 12.1% for Fiserv.Thus, WEX has an edge over Fiserv in terms of quarterly and yearly projected earnings growth.The earnings surprise history of a stock helps investors have an idea of the stock's performance in the previous quarters.WEX and Fiserv have an impressive earning surprise history, with WEX's earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the previous four quarters. Fiserv's earnings outpaced the consensus mark in three of the past four quarters.However, WEX delivered a higher average positive earnings surprise of 3.3% compared with 1.5% for Fiserv.The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock.Based on fourth-quarter and full-year earnings estimate revisions in the past 90 days, WEX is better placed.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter 2018 earnings has increased 1.9% for WEX compared with an increase of 1.2% for Fiserv. For 2018, estimates for WEX have increased 1.4%, the same for Fiserv have remained unchanged.

Hence, a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors.While Fiserv has a TTM net margin of 25%, the same stands at 15.6% for WEX.Though both the stocks compare unfavorably with the industry's figure of 40%, Fiserv has a higher TTM net margin than WEX.The price to earnings ratio (P/E) metric is used to measure a company's value relative to its earnings. In general, a lower number or multiple is considered better than a higher one.The trailing 12-month price-to-earnings multiple for Fiserv and WEX is 24.6 and 20.1, respectively, while that of the industry's is 24.8. The numbers clearly imply that WEX is not only cheaper than Fiserv but also undervalued compared to the industry it belongs to.Our comparative analysis shows that WEX scores over Fiserv in terms of earnings estimate revisions, earnings surprise history and quarterly and yearly projected earnings growth. Fiserv has an edge in terms of price performance and net margin.However, a faster share price rally on a year-to-date basis has led to a rich valuation for Fiserv compared with WEX.Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Zacks Business Services sector are Interpublic  , Automatic Data Processing  and Navigant Consulting  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Cardtronics has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Fiserv has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that CATM likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than FISV has recently. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.CATM currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.01, while FISV has a forward P/E of 20.88.

FISV currently has a PEG ratio of 1.82.Another notable valuation metric for CATM is its P/B ratio of 3.02. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, FISV has a P/B of 10.96.Based on these metrics and many more, CATM holds a Value grade of A, while FISV has a Value grade of D.CATM stands above FISV thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that CATM is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

In the first nine months of 2018, Fiserv repurchased 16.6 million shares for $1.23 billion. It repurchased shares worth $1.17 billion, $1.20 billion and $1.47 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Shareholder-friendly initiatives instill investors' optimism and make a positive impact on earnings.Despite riding on significant growth prospects, Fiserv is not free from overhangs. The company has a debt-heavy balance sheet, with debt at the end of the third quarter accounting for 64% of total capital. A high debt may limit the company's future expansion and worsen its risk profile. Also, Fiserv's policy of acquiring a large number of companies results in integration risk.

Joining me in the studio, as always, is Certified Financial Planner Matt Frankel. Matt, did you have a good weekend? I did. I went to a wedding in North Carolina, and there was no cell service, no internet, no nothing. It was in the middle of the mountains. It was really weird to unplug. You were disconnected, as they say. As much as I ever have been. That's a foreign feeling. I can't even remember the last time I was in such a position. I'll tell you, these days, I don't even understand how you go for an hour without checking your phone. It's a bad habit. I have to get out of it. You should try doing it for a weekend sometime. [laughs] Well, on today's show, we're going to talk more earnings, of course. We're going to talk about some IRA changes that you need to be aware of, some interesting wages and salaries data. We'll tap into  . We'll have One to Watch for you.We're going to start the week with Uncle Warren, his latest investment in the payments space.  (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) earnings came out over the weekend as well. We have a lot to talk about with Berkshire Hathaway. Let's go ahead and get started first and foremost with Berkshire buying into fintech. Matt, this was something that I don't think a lot of us were expecting, but it's also not terribly surprising. He likes investing in those market opportunities. I think, more than anything, the most interesting part was the companies he decided to invest in. Just to be clear, first of all, this wasn't initiated by Warren Buffett himself. He doesn't understand these companies well enough by any stretch to make an investment in them. This was by Todd Combs, one of Buffett's two main stock pickers, and he's definitely the more techie of the two. Buffett gives him a stamp of approval, so we can consider it a Warren Buffett investment. The two companies are both foreign companies. There's Paytm, an Indian mobile payments company, and  , which is in Brazil.At first glance, these might sound weird. Like, why would Berkshire be looking at some foreign fintech companies? But they do both have a bunch of Berkshire-like qualities. First and foremost, they are market leaders in their economies. They both have big market shares. They're both very well known in their local markets. They do have that going for them. It's like how Berkshire invests in  because it's the leading soft-drink provider. Same idea there, just on a more fintech-y and more rapidly growing scale. And StoneCo is the only public one out of the two. These are both relatively small investments for Berkshire -- $300 million a pop. That sounds pretty big, but it's not when you're talking about a $500 billion company.I'm glad to see Berkshire finally putting more of its cash to work in outside-the-box ways. They've had a real issue building up cash. They still have more than $100 billion after spending some of their money on a bunch of new stock investments and things like that. I'm really excited that they're finding ways to put their money to work in ways that could actually end up moving the needle if these companies prove really successful. Yeah. It's no secret we obviously love these payment companies all over the world. Plenty of opportunity out there. Even he noted it -- payments are a huge deal worldwide, is what he said. Berkshire already owns stakes in  ,  (NYSE: MA) , and  . It's neat to see them get some of these smaller firms in there that are a bit more based on technology, like you said. Definitely a little bit more difficult to understand. I think this is also a testament to the kind of team that he's building there at Berkshire Hathaway. I think investors need to feel really good about that.I wanted to mention a little bit about the earnings that came out for Berkshire Hathaway this weekend. It was, generally speaking, a pretty good quarter. They saw a nice bump in operating income there. It did seem like the insurance underwriting profit saw a nice boost versus last year. There were some natural disasters last year that hit them on that line, of course. But another quarter of big share repurchases for Berkshire Hathaway as well, wasn't it? This was the first time they've been allowed to repurchase shares under the new plan that allows Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger to pretty much buy back shares whenever they both agree it's a good time. Berkshire bought back $928 million worth of shares this quarter. That sounds like a lot, but the takeaway here is not that this is a real needle-moving thing. Like I said, Berkshire is a $500 billion company. Buying back less than $1 billion worth of stock isn't anything to get that excited over. But the new buyback policy says that they can only buy it when Buffett and Munger both agree that the stock is trading at a substantial discount to its intrinsic value. The takeaway here is that Buffett really considers Berkshire cheap at the current levels. Yep. And I think right now, it's about 1.4 times book, right? Yeah, which is actually pretty low for Berkshire. If you look at the history, Berkshire oscillates between 1 to 2 times book. So it's not that expensive in a historic context. The former benchmark that they had given themselves was 1.2 times book, which seemed very reasonable. But by the same token, I don't have any problem with them lifting that benchmark and just saying, essentially, \"We'll do it when we feel like it makes sense,\" because that's ultimately what they're doing. They've got a pretty good track record so far, so I think we can trust them. I do wonder how some shareholders may feel about that versus dividends. Certainly, dividends are something that they're going to hear more and more about as time goes on. I wonder if they're going to feel a little bit more pressure to cave into at some point. But I haven't really gotten any sense of anything like that in regard to dividends yet. Have you noticed anything? Do you have any feelings there? As the cash was starting to build up, Warren Buffett for the first time ever, I think, mentioned dividends as a real possibility. Then he walked it back over the next few quarters. His attitude is pretty much, \"If you want a 3% dividend from the stock, just sell 3% of your shares every year.\" He said, \"Trust me to do what I will with the profits. If you want income off Berkshire, just start gradually selling your stock that way.\" That's a fair point. It's tough to argue with that. I mean, I'm a financial planner and I trust my money with Warren Buffett. I trust him to make the best decisions with Berkshire's income. Well, if he's good enough for you, he's good enough for me, and he should be good enough for all of our listeners. That's the takeaway.Let's talk about these IRA changes. I thought this was pretty neat. I was also a little bit taken back by the fact that this is the first increase to the annual contribution limit since 2013. You published a nice article here. We'll get that out to our listeners. Talk to us a little bit about the IRS increasing the limit on contributions for 2019. The IRS looks at contributions every year for things like IRAs, 401(k)s, and other types of retirement vehicles. For IRAs, it's a pretty big jump. This is almost a 10% jump, from $5,500 a year as the standard maximum contribution to $6,000. The reason being, they adjust this upward with inflation over time, but can only do it in $500 increments. So for a 401(k), where the maximum was $18,500, a $500 jump isn't that hard to come by when you're talking about inflation. But with an IRA, that's almost a 10% jump, and it takes a little bit of time before we get 10% inflation. Hopefully. If we're getting 10% inflation a year, we have other problems besides the IRA limit.This is a big deal for retirement savers. It means that anyone who uses an IRA as their primary retirement savings vehicle has the potential to set aside an additional almost 10% a year for their retirement. Most people with IRAs, unlike 401(k)s, max out their contributions every year. I think the average is right around $5,000 as an annual contribution, and the maximum was $5,500. So it's fair to say that the majority of people with IRAs come close to at least maxing out their contribution. This is good news in the pending retirement crisis that you keep hearing about. The average American will be able to set aside a little more for their retirement if they choose to do so. That's always good news. Of course, we encourage anyone and everyone out there to start saving for retirement. No matter your age. You can't start soon enough. We'll make sure to get that article tweeted out there on the  Twitter feed for you, Matt.We also saw some news here that wages and salaries this recent quarter jumped by 3.1%. The reason why this seemed noteworthy to me is it's the highest level in a decade. We talked a lot about, over the past several years, as unemployment has started recovering, that wages always seemed to be a little bit of a point of weakness there. While jobs were coming back around, wages weren't necessarily moving as much as some would want to see. It appears, though, now, that we have seen at least some kind of a jump there. What's your take on that? Is that something that's sustainable? Is that something that's going to play out in a good way on the economy? Or what? It's definitely sustainable. From an economic standpoint, you want to pay attention to what's called real wage growth. That is, are wages growing at least as fast as inflation? To put it in context, if your salary goes up by 2%, but it costs you 2% more to pay for your mortgage, pay for your rent, pay for your groceries, etc., you really aren't making any more money. But on the other hand, if wages are going up 3.1%, like we just learned, and inflation is rising at about 2%, then your purchasing power is rising over time. That's what we really want to see. That means everybody's collective standard of living is going up over time.So yes, wage growth is excellent. Highest number in 10 years. But pay attention to inflation, especially as we go on this rate-tightening cycle and the Fed's monitoring the economy like they are right now to see what the next move is. Yeah. That inflation lesson is a really good one. We've talked about it in some of our Fool School classes. We'll meet with Girl Scout troops or classes, kids around 10-12 years old, give them some ideas as to how inflation works. We talk about it from the perspective of having your money in a piggy bank versus having it in a bank account versus having it in an investment account. You can see over time, obviously, your money's going to be very safe sitting there in the piggy bank, but over long periods of time, that inflation takes hold and actually erodes the value of that money in the piggy bank. The piggy bank is safe, but it's actually hurting you, because you're not keeping up with inflation. That was the lesson that got a lot of their attention. Once you can start understanding how that works and how it works over long periods of time, I think it really helps justify the case for not only investing, but investing the way we do here, taking that longer time approach.Matt, let's dive into earnings-palooza. It just keeps on coming, man. I tell you, we've got more companies reporting this week. We had a lot of companies that reported last week. Let's go ahead and kick it off here talking about Mastercard. Tell me what you saw for their most recent quarter. It was good. The stock popped right after the earnings, so you know everybody liked what they saw. Earnings were up by 33% year over year. Revenue grew by 15%. Anyone who thinks companies like Visa and Mastercard are maxed out, this proved them wrong once again. [laughs] Maxed out. I like that. You probably didn't even mean to do that! [laughs] No pun intended! The things that really were encouraging to me were, one, cross-border transactions, meaning the international revenues, were up by 17%. That was the strongest of their main areas of growth. That was very encouraging. And not only that, but their margins are getting better. Their expenses only went up 11% while their revenues went up by 15%. As we've said many times, anytime your revenue is growing faster than your expenses is a very good thing. Mastercard's margins were higher by over 2%.The other really big thing that stood out to me was the aggressive buyback that they're using. I know everyone's buying back stock right now. It's kind of the buzzword of the day, given the tax reform savings. But Mastercard not only bought back $1.2 billion worth of stock in the third quarter alone, they came out with their earnings report and said, \"We took advantage of this big market correction in October.\" In the first 25 days of October, they bought almost $360 million more on top of that $1.2 billion. It's really nice to see them being proactive and saying, \"We took advantage. We thought our stock was dirt cheap in the beginning of October, so we bought a lot more.\" As a Mastercard shareholder, I like everything you just said there. Let's keep it going in that direction.Let's take a look here at  (NASDAQ: FISV) . This is an interesting business. I think it flies under the radar for a lot of people, but it's a really good business. It's the company that provides the software for a lot of these smaller financial institutions, smaller banks and whatnot. They provide the software for these banks to get their work done -- the ledgers, the payments, and whatnot. Again, it's a good business. The stock is having a decent year so far. It's pulled back a little bit here, but obviously is benefiting from the growth in electronic payments. Generally speaking, from a business perspective, they benefit from switching costs. Banks don't typically like to switch operating systems very often. It's a pretty big undertaking. So what this means is, Fiserv is a partner that grows with these banks and continues to offer more services.What this ultimately does is give Fiserv a little bit of pricing power as time goes on. We'll see them exercise that here and there. But generally speaking, you're looking at a business that's going to continue to grow around 4%-5% organic growth. They really do a good job of bringing it down to the bottom line. When you talk about the share repurchases, if we look at their share count going back to 2013 to today, they have brought that share count down 22% in that period of time. They continue to do a really good job in buying back shares and helping realize value for shareholders. It's not something that's going to sit there and double overnight, but I think it's going to be a nice, slow grower for folks looking for some financial exposure there.Let's talk about  (NYSE: PAYC) . Matt, you went through their quarter. What did you find? More good things. Revenue and earnings were up by 32% and 33%, respectively. The reason I love Paycom, they just announced that recurring revenue now makes up 98% of their total. If you're not familiar, Paycom is the payroll processing software company. Ninety-eight percent recurring revenue is a pretty nice moat.This is a service that companies need. Businesses need to process payroll. This is a great recurring revenue stream. It's growing, like I said, at a 33% year-over-year clip right now. They're not buying back shares very aggressively. They said they bought back about 30,000 shares, which is a drop in the bucket. They're plowing all their money back into growth, which is exactly what they should be doing. If you can have 98% of your revenue be recurring, and grow that at the same rate for another few years, they're going to be in really good shape. Yeah, recurring revenue is a beautiful thing. We'll wrap it up really quick with  (NYSE: MKL) , another one of our Foolish favorites here. We've talked about this business for many, many years. It's our baby Berkshire, as we like to call it. Another very good quarter for the company. We talked about the three main drivers of the business in the insurance underwriting. They stood at $4.5 billion in insurance underwriting this quarter, $4.5 billion for the first nine months of the year, versus $4.1 billion a year ago. We also talk about their investment income, which was up to $320 million from $304 million a year ago. And then there's the Markel Ventures side of the business. That's their investments in these smaller businesses. They take meaningful stakes in these businesses. I think they have somewhere in the neighborhood of 17 or 18 and the portfolio now. They brought in $1.4 billion in revenue on the Markel Venture side, versus $933 million a year ago, for the first nine months of the year. So, seeing some very good performance there on the Markel Venture side of the business as well.They just keep on doing a lot of the same things here, running a smart business. Co-CEO there, Tom Gayner, he's a leader we like. We've had a chance to speak with him a number of times. So as a Markel shareholder myself, I'm happy to see that they're doing what they're doing. And I think shareholders should remain very encouraged about where this business is headed.Let's tap into Twitter this week. We had some questions that we wanted to get to here. And so first one here is coming from @maurerpowerin. Matt asks, \"Why, in the light of the  (NYSE: EFX) breach, would it be a good idea for everyone to have their banking information shared? It sounds like the UltraFICO only benefits a small number of people, yet everyone will have their data shared, potentially, without consent or consequence.\" Matt, you wanted to clarify a few things in regard to this question, right? Yes. It's a good question. When I spoke with the FICO people at the Money20/20 conference a couple of weeks ago, they really clarified this. That was one of my first questions that I asked them. I don't want everybody having my bank account information on top of my credit cards and things like that. There are two points I wanted to clarify there.One, your banking information will not be added to your credit report. This is not going to be part of your three-bureau credit report that people can access, you can access, that Equifax,  and  maintain. Your bank information will not become a component of your credit report. Two, you have to opt in to individual lenders for the UltraFICO program. In other words, if I'm applying at a certain lender, and my credit score is a little too low for the loan or whatever other product I want, I can say, \"Here's my bank account information. Run my UltraFICO score.\" It's an opt-in with an individual lender. It's not that everybody is going to have your bank information.So it's a little more legwork on the process of the consumer, because your information isn't just out there for anybody to access through your credit report. But it is kind of nice in the interest of data security, as you mentioned, to have the ability to give your bank account information or not give it to any lender you're applying to. That's key. Control is the key there. It seems like the consumer at least will have that option. That's important.That leads to this next tweet I want to read off from @TSprings11. This is Troy. He was actually an intern with us here at the Fool. Troy says: \"I love the UltraFICO concept. I wasn't able to get a credit card until I became a USAA member. They just verify military, not credit score. Meanwhile, I had a job since 14, am a college graduate with no student debt, in good financial shape.\" I wanted to read that off because I think that really is important here. That's where the UltraFICO could have a great impact, helping people who just don't have established credit yet. If it's something where you can bring in actual, real behavior, based on savings and checking, that's a great alternative. It's a great option to have. I think Troy made a very good point there. It sounds like someone like him would benefit from that. Thanks, Troy!Finally, from @BTCapital12, asks: \"Can you guys comment on the lawsuit filed by  (NYSE: WMT) against  (NYSE: SYF) ? Do you think it's really just part of a bargaining strategy for the receivables? Or is there more to this? Also, do you then think  (NYSE: COF) is getting the short end of the stick as they won the Walmart deal?\" Folks, remember, you can always reach out to us via Twitter. These are some great questions here. What do you have there for BTCapital here, Matt? It's kind of a he-said, she-said at this point. Walmart is claiming that Synchrony didn't use great underwriting standards when approving people for their co-branded card, and it resulted in higher-than-expected losses, and therefore lower income, for Walmart than they were promised with the deal. They're suing for $800 million to recoup whatever they feel they lost. Synchrony's claim is that this is a baseless lawsuit, they used the same underwriting standards that they use for all of their store credit card products, and that Walmart is just trying to get out of paying market value for that loan portfolio, which they agreed to do if they broke the deal.The outcome of this remains to be seen. I tend to think that Synchrony will be the winner. I don't think Walmart's going to get $800 million out of them. They may end up settling at some point. Synchrony's business goes beyond the Walmart partnership. I think at their growth rate, they'll make up the lost revenue, and they're not terribly worried about the Walmart revenue. They just want to put it behind them at this point, and the lawsuit is preventing them from doing that. Sounds good. I appreciate that, Matt, and I'm sure our listeners do, too.Let's wrap up the week here, as we always do, with One to Watch. What's your One to Watch this week, Matt? [laughs] My One to Watch is Synchrony, SYF, actually. Not only is it down about 10% after the lawsuit was announced, but, as I mentioned before, I love their high-yield business model. It's a very efficient company. I had a chance to meet with their management team. I think they have great leadership. There are a couple of really promising avenues they're taking their business. The CareCredit healthcare product has a lot of runway as more healthcare costs are being shifted to the consumer. They're starting to bundle a lot of their store card products together. All of their different home goods retailers, they're going to offer one credit card product that can be used across all of them. Same with auto parts. There's a lot of runway for growth here. As they're bringing in more and more retail deposits. Their cost of capital is getting lower. I think it's a great time to get into this at a big discount. And hopefully, I'll be able to shut up about Synchrony for a few days so I can buy some. [laughs] Yeah, we have trading guidelines we have to adhere to here. If we talk about it, we can't buy it, and if we buy it, we have to shut up about it for a while. What's the ticker there for Synchrony, Matt? It's SYF. If I don't mention Synchrony next week, that might be why. That's always a good thing to remember. I was trying to figure out, did I want to get Berkshire Hathaway as my One to Watch or Markel? I really love what both their quarters looked like. I'm going to go ahead with Markel, MKL. I'm really enthusiastic about where this company is headed. It's still a fairly small insurer, but they're building this business in that Berkshire Hathaway model. It's exciting from a number of different perspectives. I love the Markel Ventures side of the business. Again, I think Tom Gayner is doing a lot of great things with these guys. I think Markel should be on probably everybody's radar here at this point.And, listen, folks, another thing you need to have on your radar, why not go check out The Motley Fool's newly renovated YouTube channel?

While the industry rose 9.4% in the said time frame, Zacks S&P 500 composite declined 1.6%.The company reported third-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 75 cents per share that missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents but rose on a year-over-year basis. Revenues of $1.41 billion lagged the consensus estimate by $19.4 million but came ahead of the year-ago figure by $12 million. Adjusted revenues of $1.35 billion increased $10 million on a year-over-year basis.Fiserv has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outpaced estimates in three of the last four quarters. It delivered average trailing four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 1.5%. Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings has been revised 1.2% upward.Fiserv continues to expand its product portfolio and enhance its offerings with the help of strategic acquisitions. On Oct 31, Fiserv completed the acquisition of the debit-based assets of Elan Financial Services (a unit of U.S. Bancorp USB) for approximately $690 million. The deal includes the purchase of Elan's debit card processing, ATM Managed Services and MoneyPass surcharge free network. It should boost Fiserv's payments portfolio, widen its client base and provide new solutions to enhance the value proposition for its existing 3,000 debit solutions clients.In 2017, Fiserv completed four acquisitions - Online Banking Solutions, Inc., PCLender, LLC, Dovetail Group Limited and Monitise plc. These buyouts helped the company to improve cash management and digital business banking solutions and transform payments infrastructure.We believe that the company will continue to pursue accretive deals, which will boost its market share and customer base going forward.Fiserv looks well poised on the back of its diversified product portfolio. In third-quarter 2018, Fiserv's DNA platform had eight clients and expects to reach nearly 30 by the end of 2018. In the first nine months of 2018, it had more than 20 clients. Zelle had 50 new clients in the last reported quarter. Zelle transactions grew more than 50% sequentially and more than 10 times year over year. While debit transactions recorded double-digit growth, Mobiliti ASP subscribers increased 23% in the last reported quarter to nearly 8 million.Further, the company seems to be actively engaged in enhancing its services. In October 2018, Fiserv announced the launch of a flexible and interactive financial planning tool (which integrates with home office systems and streamlines manual processes) to help financial advisors operate more efficiently and collaborate with clients in their investment targets. In September 2018, the company announced the launch of Originate, a new suite of solutions aimed at helping banks and credit unions deliver enhanced digital account opening and loan origination to customers.In August 2018, the company upgraded its unified managed account (UMA) services to help financial institutions and advisors operate more efficiently and announced the launch of two enhanced consumer authentication solutions, step-up authentication and identity verification to help call centers counter card fraud.The diversified product portfolio has led to a steady flow of customers, considering the rapidly changing financial services industry and increasing demand for digital banking and payment services.Fiserv's balance sheet is highly leveraged. As of Sep 30, 2018, long-term debt was $4.82 billion while cash and cash equivalents were $673 million. Such a cash position implies that Fiserv needs to generate adequate amount of operating cash flow to service its debt. High debt may limit the company's future expansion and worsen its risk profile.Additionally, Fiserv's policy of acquiring a large number of companies results in some integration risk. Acquisitions can negatively impact its balance sheet in the form of a high level of goodwill and intangible assets, which totaled $7.25 billion or 67.5% of the total assets as of Sep 30.Currently, Fiserv is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Zacks  sector are Paychex, Inc  , WEX Inc  and Automatic Data Processing Inc.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Long-term expected EPS (three to five years) growth rates for Paychex, WEX and Automatic Data Processing are 8.5%, 15% and 12.5%, respectively.Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

In response to the lower-than-expected results, shares declined 2.9% in after-hours trading yesterday.Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 75 cents missed the consensus mark by 2 cents but rose on a year-over-year basis attributable to operating leverage, tax rate reductions and capital deployment.Revenues of $1.41 billion lagged the consensus estimate by $19.4 million but came ahead of the year-ago figure by $12 million.

Adjusted operating margin declined 100 basis points (bps) year over year to 31.6%. The decline was due to a negative impact of 160 bps resulting from Lending divestiture, acquisitions completed last year and the impact of client-focused incremental investments funded through tax savings. These were, however, partially offset by a positive impact of 60 bps from the company's strong operational effectiveness performance and operating model leverage.Adjusted operating income at the Payments and Industry Products segment was $267 million, up 5.1% year over year.

Nicely done on your first . Good afternoon to everyone joining us today. We delivered strong financial results including 5% internal revenue growth in both the third quarter and the first 9 months of the year. Additionally, internal revenue growth has been 5% over the rolling 12 months ending in this year's third quarter. Adjusted EPS grew 23% in the quarter and is up a very strong 26% year-to-date. We remain well on track to meet our financial commitments for the year, while continuing to invest in your company.Free cash flow for the quarter was up 22% to $322 million and is over $800 million year-to-date, both of which include the divestiture impact of our Lending business. We continue to focus on share repurchase as our primary capital benchmark allocating $438 million in the quarter and for the year-to-date have repurchased $1.2 billion.Before we dive into the results, let me provide perspective on the approximately $690 million acquisition of the debit-based assets of Elan Financial Services, which closed today. This acquisition with annual revenue of over $170 million, extends our leadership and payments , broadens client reach and scale and provides new solutions to enhance the value proposition for our existing 3,000 debit solution clients.We're excited about the opportunity to extend our payments franchise and welcome more than 300 talented associates to Fiserv. Scale is becoming increasingly important in the payments network and processing businesses.We have spent the last several years quietly migrating more than 1,200 clients to a single debit platform with our most advanced capabilities. We plan to leverage those experiences to successfully migrate the more than 1,000 acquired along clients to our platform over the next couple of years.We see revenue synergy opportunities across three primary areas. First, we have a number of solutions in our existing card portfolio to make available to the existing clients in areas such as the Accel Network, enhanced risk, card production and digital capabilities such as CardValet. The acquisition also provides a couple of new solutions, which are additive to our portfolio and should contribute to internal revenue growth. As part of the transaction, we acquired MoneyPass, the second largest surcharge free ATM network in the US, with over 33,000 in network ATMs. In addition, we acquired a small, but strong ATM Managed Services capability, which extends our existing ATM offerings and payments differentiation.The third opportunity is to provide other Fiserv solutions, outside of card payments as the substantial majority of the acquired clients are not currently Fiserv account processing clients. Over time, we expect to compete for new revenue opportunities by demonstrating our solution strength and integration advantage.Overall, we believe the synergy opportunity from consolidating to a scaled market leading platform will add value to the acquired clients and deliver meaningful cost benefits over the next 24 months. We also believe the revenue synergies to be equally significant, but we'll have a longer ramp given existing client contracts and sales lead times. We generally expect to be at the revenue synergy run rate over a 4- to 5-year period. Given synergy timing, we expect this transaction to be modestly accretive to earnings in 2019 and to grow over time.With that, let's move to our three key shareholder priorities for 2018, which are first, continue to build high quality revenue, while meeting our earnings commitments; next, to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solution; and third, to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. As I mentioned, we achieved 5% internal revenue growth in the quarter and year-to-date, driven by strong results from a number of our businesses, including card, biller and bank solution. Internal revenue growth is up 170 basis points versus the comparable 9-month period and is 5% for the trailing 12 months.As you know, we are making and we will continue to make investments to ensure your business deliver sustained competitive advantage and excellence for our clients, balanced against delivering results, that are consistent with expectations. To that end, adjusted earnings per share was up 23% for the quarter and 26% year-to-date from a combination of operating leverage, tax rate reductions and capital deployment.These very strong adjusted EPS results were delivered in spite of a 100 basis point decline in adjusted operating margin in the quarter and down 20 basis points year-to-date.The year-over-year decline was due primarily to the lending divestiture, margin dilutive acquisitions and the investment pool established in tax savings earlier in the year. But for these items, adjusted operating margin in the quarter and year-to-date would have been up 60 basis points and 130 basis points respectively compared to the prior year. We continue to believe, we will achieve our revenue and earnings commitments for the year consistent with our first shareholder priority.Our second focus is to enhance client relationships with an emphasis on digital and payment solution. DNA is position as the leading charter agnostic, realtime account processing platform continued with eight signings in the quarter. We announced the addition of CFCU, Community Credit Union with over $1 billion of assets to our new Digital Edge solution suite, which is anchored by DNA. In a competitive process, CFCU selected our comprehensive digital centric platform to provide their members access to our leading digital and payment solutions integrated into DNA.Market interest in digital edge is growing and we believe it will be a longer-term differentiator for the digital first market. We had eight DNA clients go live in the quarter and a total of more than 20 since January. We expect nearly 30 DNA clients to go live in the year, which will be a record number of annual implementations. We continue to see important growth both for us and our clients across our digital banking solution. Mobiliti-ASP subscribers grew by 23% in the quarter to just under 8 million. Due to strong demand, we have expanded our architect implementation teams and expect to bring 12 clients live in Q4 alone, which will double the number of go-lives for the full year. We anticipate exiting the year with strong architect sales, a large implementation backlog and continuing market momentum.We're seeing interest in sales activity and platform modernization with our recently acquired Dovetail Payments Platform. We were pleased to sign Union Bank with $160 billion of assets to enable their connectivity to the TCH Real-Time Payments network. We also signed BBVA Compass with nearly $90 billion of assets to help modernize their enterprise payment capabilities in the shift toward real-time settlement. We were recognized in the quarter by IDC for a Real Result Award for next generation payments for enabling instant payments in our Dovetail solution for Intesa Sanpaolo, the leading bank in Italy with a strong international footprint.Our third priority is to deliver innovation and integration, which enables differentiated value for our clients. Zelle continues to garner significant market focus and attention, leading us to sign more than 50 new Zelle clients in the quarter. We were also pleased to bring Dollar Bank with $0.5 billion in assets, live in the quarter. We expect the continuing ramp of new Zelle clients in Q4 and meaningful acceleration in 2019.We remain focused on ways to accelerate implementation cycle to meet the growing market demand. Zelle transactions were up more than 50% sequentially, and through September 30, are more than 10x the prior year level. Our conviction in Zelle remains high, as financial institutions accelerate their focus at the intersection of digital capabilities and real-time money movement.Lastly, we are seeing additional interest in our Immediate Funds solution, which provides financial institutions the opportunity to provide their customers with instant access to deposited funds. A Top 10 bank selected our solution in the quarter, to address this evolving opportunity and plans to offer this service to their customers across multiple channels.With that, let me turn the call over to Bob, for more detail on our financial results. -- Thank you, Jeff and good afternoon. Adjusted revenue was up 1% to $1.3 billion in the quarter, and 2% to $4.1 billion year-to-date. Internal revenue growth was 5% in the quarter, driven by strong performance across a number of our businesses, and is also up 5% for the 9-month period. For comparison, our reported internal revenue growth through September would have been 50 basis points higher, had we restated our results under ASC 606.Adjusted operating income, in the quarter, was down 2% to $425 million and for the year-to-date was up 2% to $1.3 billion, both of which were impacted by the Lending transaction. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 31.6%, a decrease of 100 basis points, and was down 20 basis points through September 30. The performance in the quarter, includes a 160 basis point headwind from a combination of the Lending divestiture, acquisitions, which closed last year and the impact of a client-focused incremental investments funded through tax savings. This headwind was partially offset by 60 basis points from a strong operational effectiveness performance and operating model leverage. We now expect 2018 adjusted operating margin to expand about 10 basis points, the low-end of the range, given a slower ramp of acquisitions including Elan, which closed today, and high opportunistic in-year investments.Adjusted EPS was up 23% to $0.75 in the quarter, and increased 26% to $2.26 through the first 9 months of the year. Based on our strong performance to-date, we expect to achieve double-digit adjusted EPS growth for our 33rd consecutive year. Payments segment adjusted revenue was up 6% to $779 million in the quarter, and up 7% to $2.3 billion year-to-date. Strong performance in our Card Services and Biller businesses drove internal revenue growth of 5% for both the quarter, and first 9 months of the year. Increased adoption and growing transaction volumes remain important elements of driving high quality revenue growth.In the quarter, debit transactions were up double digits and total P2P transactions, including both Popmoney and Zelle grew nearly 50%. Additionally, Mobiliti-ASP subscribers grew 23% to nearly 8 million, continuing to reinforce the importance of digital in the evolving landscape of financial experiences. Adjusted operating income in the Payments segment grew 5% to $260 million -- excuse me, $267 million in the quarter, and 7% to $809 million year-to-date. Adjusted operating margin in the quarter contracted 40 basis points to 34.2% and is expanded 20 basis points to 34.9% for the year-to-date. Segment adjusted operating margin results were negatively impacted by 140 basis points in the quarter. From a combination of the headwind from acquisitions, and the investments from tax savings, which were included in our guidance, shared at the beginning of the year.For the Financial segment, adjusted revenue decreased 7% to $574 million for the quarter and 4% to $1.8 billion for the first 9 months of the year, due to the Lending transaction. Internal revenue growth, which considers the divestiture was up a strong 4% in both the quarter and year-to-date, driven primarily by solid performance from our account and item processing businesses. The Financial segment's adjusted operating income decreased 8% in the third quarter to $187 million, and declined 4% to $590 million for the year-to-date, again, due to the Lending transaction. Adjusted operating margin contracted 40 basis points to 32.7% for the quarter, and expanded 20 basis points to 33.2% for the nine-month period. But for the Lending transaction segment margin would have been up by 120 basis points and 160 basis points in the quarter and year-to-date periods, respectively.The adjusted corporate operating loss was up $6 million in the quarter, due primarily to a difficult prior year compare, but fully in line with our plan and consistent with the 2018 run rate. The adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter was slightly better than our expectations at 19.7%, due largely to a discrete tax benefit realized in the quarter. Our adjusted effective tax rate through September was 20.7%. And we continue to focus on strategies to sustainably lower our tax rate and accordingly, we now expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be just below 22%. We continue to deliver significant free cash flow, generating $813 million for the first 9 months of the year. Free cash flow conversion was better in the quarter at 104%, nearly double the rate from Q2, and is now 86% for the 9 months this year. The results for the year have been pressured by combined impact of working capital timing and the impact of ASC 606.Now given our visibility into Q4, we expect to be around the low-end of our free cash flow conversion rate outlook for the full year. We repurchased 5.6 million shares in the quarter for $438 million, and have returned over $1.2 billion to shareholders through September 30. We have now exceeded for the first 9 months of the year, the total amount repurchased in all of 2017. We had 34.9 million shares remaining in our share repurchased authorization, which includes a new authorization for 30 million shares approved in the quarter. We had 401 million shares outstanding as of September 30.Now during the quarter, we issued -- excuse me, during the quarter, we issued $2 billion of new 5- and and 10-year notes at a blended rate of 4%, and an average maturity of 7.5 years. We use those proceeds to pay off our term loan, retire our $450 million, 4.6% to 5% interest rate bonds that were due in 2020, and pay down our revolving line of credit.Although interest expense will increase sequentially in the fourth quarter and next year, it was a great opportunity to lock in attractive rates ahead of an upward trending market. Also because we completed the 2020 note pay-off in October, our balance sheet at quarter's end did not fully reflect the results of the refinancing. Lastly, we extend the term of our revolving line of credit to 2023, and used it to finance the Elan acquisition, which closed earlier today. Our long-term debt excluding the revolver is now entirely fixed rate. Our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.4x at the end of the quarter, which does not reflect the retirement of the 2020 note. Had that been completed as of September 30, our debt-to-adjusted EBITDA would have been 2.2x.Now with that, let me call -- turn the call back over to Jeff. -- Thanks, Bob. Sales performance in the quarter was off a bit more than expected, coming in at 69% a quarter, and declined 29% from the prior year. A sizable amount of the decline came from two large long tenured transactions in the prior year period. Normalizing for contract term only, sales would have been down by 13% in the period. Year-to-date book sales are down 8%, but up 1% when adjusting for the term differential. Quota attainment for the year-to-date was 80%. The domestic pipeline continues to grow, and is up 30% over the prior year. We expect very strong sales in the fourth quarter.We continue to make excellent progress on our operational effectiveness initiatives. We achieved another $13 million of savings in the quarter and are at $45 million attainment for the first 9 months of the year. We now expect to exceed our annual goal of $50 million of savings. The Financial Services environment remains strong, with rising interest rates, positive tax momentum and a benign credit landscape. We continue to see meaningful demand in areas where we have invested such as consumer and commercial digital, risk management and Real-Time Payments. The Zelle opportunity remains robust as the industry looks to claw back the P2P space and create technology optionality for the future. M&A remains active as financial institutions continue to focus on gaining scale and increasing deposit balances, which we expect will continue for the foreseeable future.As we said upfront, we remain on track to achieve our key financial objectives for 2018, which includes an increase in our internal revenue growth rate to at least 4.5% for the year. As a reminder for comparison, last year's fourth quarter was our strongest internal revenue growth quarter of the year. We also expect to achieve our adjusted EPS guidance for the year, given where we are in Q4, we now expect the full year to be in a range of $3.10 to $3.15, strong growth of 25% to 27% over the adjusted $2.48 last year and $0.08 higher, then the bottom of the original range of $3.02 to $3.15.You'll recall that our full year results anticipate incremental investments funded from tax reduction savings of at least $25 million for the full year. As Bob indicated, we now expect full year adjusted operating margin to be around 10 basis points and free cash flow conversion to be about 106% for the year.In conclusion, we're pleased with our year-to-date performance and our progress in building your company. Internal revenue growth is 5% and well ahead of last year's comparable growth rate. Adjusted EPS is up a very strong 26%, supported by operating leverage and operational effectiveness program benefits and also includes incremental investments to further sustained competitive advantage. As important, we continue to allocate capital to build value for shareholders, including a record pace for share repurchase and enhanced debt structure and the acquisition of Elan's debit assets and a move to deliver incremental value for both clients and shareholders.We also remain committed to a continuous 360 degree view of excellence. Last month we received the results of our annual associated engagement survey and after recording a 5th straight year of improvement have now crossed into the top quartile of associate engagement of the participating employers and there are more than 3.5 million employees, and while we aren't done yet, we are grateful to the 24,000 Fiserv proud associates, who bring their best every day for the company, its clients and you, our shareholders.With that, operator, let's open the line for questions.We will now open up the lines for the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from David Togut from Evercore. Your line is now open. -- Thanks, good afternoon. I'd like to start with a question about the Elan Financial Services acquisition. Thanks for giving the revenue from Elan, could you break out what expected EBITDA will be on an annual basis? -- Yes, David, thanks for the question. Good afternoon. Overall, as you heard in our prepared remarks, that business will add about a $170 million of revenue to us. We're just now closing as of this morning, so it will be a nominal impact for the 2018 results in fourth quarter and when we get into 2019, we'll certainly incorporate that in overall guidance. It's a nice business for us, it's right up the alley of what we do in our debit card processing business today and as Jeff pointed out in his prepared remarks gives us some really nice opportunities for synergies over the next couple of years from a cost synergy standpoint as we bring those -- that scale into our existing debit processing platform and over the next 4 or 5 years to drive some meaningful revenue synergies. So we're looking forward to getting that business online and driving that revenue and cost synergies over the next 4, 5 years. -- So, David to the exact question of, will we provide EBITDA? The answer is we don't give that kind of a breakdown, as I know, you know. But I would say that we would expect that business to maintain margins consistent with our debit processing business, especially as we migrate, as Bob mentioned, we migrated over to our platform over the next couple of years. We're moving from having -- they run on their own platform, their US bank, we're going to obviously migrate them to our platform. So we think that there are meaningful cost synergy benefits that will come in. One of the reasons why we're saying it's moderately accretive next year is obviously we'll be be moving that forward as we migrate clients over to our platform. -- Understood. And then on the third quarter earnings call last year, you gave a preliminary 2019 earnings outlook of $3.50 a share, on a split-adjusted basis based on what you see in terms of the underlying margin expansion of the business, bookings, revenue trends, is that $3.50 outlook still intact for 2019? -- Yes. So I would say, Bob is making sure that he gives me the normal look, I think what we told you is specifically, we were not giving guidance, but based on what we could see at the time that we expected to be in that range. I would say that nothing has changed since we talked about that previously to where we are today, I would say, with one exception and that is, as Bob mentioned, we did a fairly meaningful refinance in the quarter. And that's going to add some additional interest expense, which we expect to cover the same way we cover every everything else from an operating perspective, I am not saying we won't be there and I'm not saying we will be there, but I am saying that, that's the one thing that I can think that's a little bit different than it was when we talked last time conversely, we've acquired Elan. We expect that to be accretive. So I think when we give guidance, we'll be giving guidance such consistent with what we have been saying all along. -- Got it. And then just a quick final question for me at Money 20/20, MasterCard debit do a BillPay exchange offering. And I'm just curious if you compare that on a feature functionality basis to kind of CheckFree's core BillPay offering, how does it stack up, is this sort of a significant competitive threat or not so much? -- Not so much. -- And why would that be? -- It's not so much. We, as you know that, that technology has been a market-leading technology for a long time, and the beauty in our technology is that the data, not only can we move money at any speed consistent with what a consumer wants. But we know how to perfect the payment and we know how to manage risk on those payments. And so we are able to take money out of accounts when the consumer wants it because we have a risk model -- a patented risk model that allows us to make smart intelligent decisions on that basis. But the most important part is, is we know how to make sure the money goes where it supposed to go even if the consumer who will occasionally tell us the wrong thing. So we just think it's a more advanced technology, by the same token we all see a very significant opportunity to electronify the nearly half of the bill payments each year, that still are not moving on an electronic rail. So we're glad others are talking about it, but we believe right now, we maintain a meaningful and important strategic and competitive advantage. -- Thank you very much.Thank you. The next question comes from Dave Koning of Baird. Your line is now open. -- Hey, guys. How is it going? -- Hey, Dave. How are you? -- Good afternoon. -- Good. Thank you. So I guess first of all, I'm just wondering -- so Q3 revenue is a little lighter than we thought, was there some periodic revenue maybe that's moving into Q4, because Q4 seems almost a little better than we thought and margins in Q3 a little weak, and you see that periodic revenue carries pretty high margins, is that kind of what's happening here? -- Yes. And we -- you know well that periodic revenue comes in when to a large degree it decides it wants to come in. In Q2, remember we said, we had a little bit of a pull from Q3 to Q2. In Q3, we actually have a shifting from Q3 to Q4. And so because of the margins that also follows. So we do expect -- I think we tried to give a little clarity last quarter, when we indicated, we expected the first half and the second half to be substantially similar and we're absolutely on track for that. So nothing other than the shift in revenue -- sorry, the periodic revenue, as you know. And then the other piece on margin, just to add a little bit more clarity, if you look at the last 3 years. Q3 has been our weakest margin quarter and most of that to your question comes from movement of periodic revenue between quarters. And it just so happens that Q3 tends to be an unusually weak periodic revenue quarter for some reason. -- Okay. And I guess how much down was the year-over-year in Q3? -- It was not, it was not down meaningfully in the quarter, to the prior it was down relative to our expectations for how the periodic revenue would flow through the year. -- Dave, if you think about it, we had a good first quarter, we had a very strong second quarter to Jeff's point, some of that was timing of periodic revenue actually shifting out of third quarter, we ended up in the first half of the year at 5%, we expected the second half to be similar in growth rate, in total versus first half and expect Q3 to be the strong quarter within the half with Q4 being a little bit lighter, given the tougher comp in the fourth quarter. That's still the case, but will be more normalized, because Q3 came in a little bit lighter and Q4 will be a little bit stronger, but it's a shift within quarters, it is not a year-over-year thing per se. -- Okay, thank you. And just one quick follow-up, the $3.10 to $3.15 this year includes a little bit, I think a couple of months of the Lending business in the first quarter. So you lose that next year. Is Elan, the benefit from Elan the accretion from that bigger than the lending EPS that you kind of lose next year. -- No, the lending income -- operating income in the first quarter of 2018 will be a little bit stronger than the first quarter from Elan in 2019, little bit bigger business. -- Okay. Thanks guys. appreciate it. -- Thank you.Thank you. The next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Your line is now open. -- Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question here this afternoon. I actually have a couple if I may. Jeff and maybe both for you guys could actually good way in. You call out sort of investments and you do so consistently and maybe a little bit more so this quarter than others. Could you just talk a little bit about IRR thresholds or philosophy in terms of how you deploy and when you deploy capital to reinvest in the business? -- Sure. So philosophically, the investments that we make, we think more about the capital trade-offs as opposed to maybe a traditional IRR. So if we're going to make incremental investments, we think about how does that compare to share repurchase, just like we would with an acquisition. And how does that end up impacting our competitive position in the market. I -- the problem with IRR is as you can do lots of things with terminal value to make the IRR be what whatever you want it to be. And so we tend to stay away from that, as a metric, unless, we're doing very large incremental allocations of capital, which we are not. The reason why we referenced it in this quarter and maybe a little bit more to your perspective is because the margin was a little bit lighter in the quarter, than I think people expected. We were trying to call out this idea that $25 million pool that at least $25 million, the third quarter was the first quarter in which that really started to hit, will have an even bigger hit coming in next quarter. And so pointing that out and also looking for other opportunities to invest in a year where frankly, we're going to deliver 25% to 27% EPS looking for ways to expedite investments in technology or feature function. We think is the right way to think about capital overall. -- Okay. So in the context of sustaining the kind of earnings growth and organic revenue growth I guess. -- That's right. And well, sustaining and hopefully increasing, right. Our strategy is to increase this year out 4.5% is roughly an 80 basis point increase in internal revenue growth, where we are based on what we can see right now, we would expect to see some lift in that. Moving into 2019, of course, that's not formal guidance, but we would expect to see that as we continue to move forward. -- Okay. And then if I may, recognizing that Elan there's a lot about debit processing. You also, as you mentioned acquired MoneyPass in a Managed Services business. Can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about ATMs and generally, how they fit into sort of banks priorities and whether there is an opportunity for a third-party like Fiserv that outsources just about everything else, like community banks do to provide more outsourced services around ATMs? -- Sure. I mean, from our perspective, when we hear clients talk about how the digital world, right, will intersect with physical world. ATMs continue to be front and center in that device centric key type strategy. And so we're still seeing that and we're actually hearing more people want to add sophistication to those ATMs. For us -- and so given the scale that we have over 3,000 clients, who we -- most of them we drive ATMs for as part of our EFT and debit proposition, we see this to be actually a pretty attractive incremental service, outsourced service that we can provide. We have stayed away from services like that historically for two reasons; number one, we didn't have the expertise; and number two, it takes a little bit more capital than that we tend to use, right, for going out and acquiring the ATMs. But just given how the world is morphing right now, we think it could make some sense. And we'll spend the next couple of years, looking to see what can we add in terms of service offerings to those 3,000 clients. -- Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it. -- Thank you.Thank you. The next question comes from Jeff Cantwell of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open. -- Hi. Good evening. -- Hi, Jeff. -- Hey, Jeff. -- Thanks for taking my questions. Jeff, you led this Company for many years, you've seen how it performs through various business cycles. Now, clearly there's a lot more focus right now on macro risk versus even 3 months ago, when you last spoke with us. So I wanted to ask you what you're thinking as at this point in time, as far as, how you expect this Company to perform if the US economy moderates to some degree in the future? And then what operational leverage might you be able to port or to manage through the cycle? -- Sure. So, Jeff, I mean, we are in a period where we are investing significantly in technologies that are linked up with digital kind of the digitization our Financial Services along with the need and soon to be mandate to move to a real-time monetary ecosystem. It's hard for me to see how either of those trends will moderate, even if the economy itself begins to slow a bit. So I think that based on where we are strategically that will continue to be a fairly strong defensive play as we have been and frankly in all of the other cycles. That said, if, in fact, we see a slowdown that starts to negatively impact financial services, I would expect us to be able to take steps such as slowing down the investments. And one of the things, if you go back and look at our data, you'll see that we've meaningfully increased our level of spend as a percentage of revenue over the last 3, 5, 7 years and most all of that drives future internal revenue growth. We think one of the beauties of our model is, we can pull that back as needed without impacting the current level of internal revenue growth and create incremental flow through of free cash. So I think, we're pretty positioned, we think about that all the time as you might imagine and we like the fact that we have that lever as well as -- I think we've demonstrated for the last 10 plus years, a strong ability to reduce weighing in and restructure our costs, our costs overall. We talk about it is operational effectiveness and I'd expect us to be able to, to do more of that as well as needed. -- Okay, great. Thanks very much. -- Thank you.Thank you. The next question comes from Brett Huff of Stephens. Your line is now open. -- Good evening, guys. -- How are you? -- One question on Dovetail, that was an interesting acquisition to us and it sounds like you guys got a couple of pretty big contracts. And I know that you serve a lot of very large banks, especially in BillPay, any thoughts on in moving up market, maybe in specific verticals or maybe even in the core account processing. But is there a strategy about moving up market? Or is this more about digital and immediate payments and you're just going maybe where the demand is right now? -- It's really a combination of both, I mean, we, Brett, as you know, have a number of large clients who work with us on BillPay. We also have a number of large clients who work with us on digital, and we see that interesting interaction to just open the door to allow us to come in and talk about how the rails are evolving. And that was the back strategy. The other thing that you probably know is PEP+, which is the majority of the ACH and the US goes over PEP+ today is owned by us. And we see a nice fit between Dovetail and PEP+. So being able to help clients who we've served for years on payments modernized with Dovetail is also part of the strategy. So it's coming together in the market, the market will move if the patient moves. But we were pleased with the results in the quarter and the pipeline looks good and hopefully we'll continue to make that progress. -- Great, thanks. And then also, there's been a lot more focus I think on helping banks or banks looking to do more alternative deposit gathering not necessarily having to own the deposit gathering function itself using partners, things like that, some of those are featured at Money 20/20. I know you guys do some of that. Can you just remind us of the various things you do, whether it's alternative lending, things like that? What kind of products given your digital focus have you been developing? -- Yes. The majority of the things that we're doing are on certainly focused on lending, we're doing work. As I mentioned, this is a little bit of an offshoot, but we're seeing more and more banks look to set up separate internet brands to be able to go out and gather deposits, we do some work with some third parties who are -- who basically are brokering deposits across the -- but more of on a partnering and integration basis, who are moving deposits around the ecosystem. And then as we mentioned things around Immediate Funds which is about attracting non-customers into branches, things like that. -- Great. That's what I needed. Thanks guys. I appreciate it. -- Thank you. -- Thanks.Thank you. The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JP Morgan. Your line is now open. -- Hi. Thanks so much. Happy Halloween to you guys. I want to ask on your comment on the strong sales expectation for the fourth quarter is -- what type of -- what do you see in the pipeline and being able to replenish the backlog and when that is there. I feel like I ask you this every year, Jeff, but is there a concept of budget flush maybe that might be beneficial? -- Yes, we do talk about it as we should. We -- you have kind of the year-end budget that's always the case, fourth quarters are always strong. We had some larger sales slip from Q3 to Q4, that's part of the revenue movement from Q3 to Q4 is also due to some of those sales. So we have that and we have, whether it is around the payment rail transformation, you've got a lot going on there. Zelle, DNA a lot on the digital front, whether it will be architect or others. So this, the same kinds of trends, I think by the -- also connected to the urgency of -- we've got to get it done this year, so we can spend the project up and get going for next year. -- Got it. Okay. That's good. So just my follow-up on the marginal front, you covered a lot of it, I know, but just to be clear on my side, is the incremental change in the margin outlook, is it Elan, because that the tax reinvestment side, I know you contemplated maybe the timing wasn't contemplated. Just trying to better understand what changed? -- Sure. Are you talking about from being 10 to 30 to going to saying it's going to be about 10? -- Right. What's incremental to get to the 10? -- Yes, there are a couple of things. I would say the biggest one is the acquisitions that we brought in last year, as well as as the impact of Elan, they're ramping a little bit slower. They've been there say -- the sales cycles, took a little longer, so they -- instead of us signing X deals, we signed Y deals. So things like that around the acquisitions, I would say that's one Elan will be moderately dilutive as well. And then you've got the incremental investments that was due to tax reform, we've been looking for given how the year is progressing. Are there some incremental investments we can make that none of them are material by themselves, but just a few million here and a few million there, not to diminish a few million, but it adds up and it has a basis point impact. So it's really those kinds of things. -- Okay, thanks for that clarification. Appreciate it. -- Thank you.Thank you. The next question comes from James Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. -- Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. Maybe just returning to the question of sales for a moment, I think you talked about some of the slippage from Q3 to Q4 , but I think that on a full year basis or year-to-date, the Quota attainment still feels a little bit light. Is that just the size of the deals? And maybe can you -- maybe address the whole topic of competitiveness of new deals because some of the sales commentary from some of your peers seems quite robust over the past couple of quarters. So I just wanted to square those two issues? -- Sure. So the answer to the first part of the question was really around larger deals that were the ones that were slipping, so they have an impact. We mentioned the fact that we had the term adjustment, which had an issue on our comparative sales I think as it kind of squaring it, we are seeing a very robust sales environment, pipeline is up 30% year-over-year, and it's both a strong at the late stage as well as in the early stage, I think we probably give a bit more information than others in terms of exact percentages and things like that. So it's a little bit easier to see how our quantitative data -- how our quantitative data ends up playing out. I would also agree that the AT is a little bit light. But again, we're expecting a very strong fourth quarter and I think we'll be quite well positioned for next year. -- That's good to hear. And then maybe just on the financial side. Free cash flow was actually down slightly year-to-date. And you talked about some of the factors that drives me out and some of the investments I assume that are playing into that. Can you maybe talk about as we head into 2019, what levers you're able to pull to kind of get that free cash flow back up to where it normally would be in the -- if that -- is that an issue of conversion percentage or is an issue of lower CapEx, as a percentage of revenue or maybe some of the factors there, please? -- Yes, Jim, it's Bob. We are nominally down, just a couple of million dollars, few million dollars on $800 million year-to-date number, the largest driver of the year-over-year performance is the Lending divestiture and that's a business that generated good cash that we don't have any more. So it's in their last year numbers. We didn't adjust or make any modifications to last year's actuals. So that's probably the biggest driver. You saw in our third quarter numbers, the conversion rate jumped up very nicely to a 104%. We've been a bit behind the overall year-to-date conversion rate is now what we would typically expect and that's really driven by timing of working capital as well as CapEx spending some of those investments that we've talked about with that reinvestment of the tax savings is also bringing capital spending. So that will moderate into next year, we expect to have a very strong fourth quarter and hit the bottom end of guidance range of the 106% for this year and be in good shape into 2019, and beyond. -- But just to clarify, as it relates to the cash flow itself, it's really a matter of the lending business a little bit more CapEx things that should come back to a more normalized route. -- Great, thank you. -- Thank you.Thank you. The next question comes from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research. Your line is now is open. -- Hey, good evening, Jeff and Bob. -- Hey, Kartik. -- Jeff, as you look at kind of the backlog of the business, the sales you are anticipating in the fourth quarter. What percentage of revenue do you -- is already kind of, I hate those word, but in the back for 2019 and what do you still have to kind of backfill? -- So on balance, our recurring revenue is in the 80% to 85% range depending on what year, year-end. So I think that's a reasonable proxy to say, certainly that's using the notion of in the bag, I think that's a fair way to think about it. But we also have line of sight into a whole bunch of additional revenue below that, I'm sorry, above that recurring revenue number. So it's a fairly small number, ultimately, that is kind of in the go get category. But if it's -- even if it's 5%, it's $300 million and change. So -- and because $10 million is a point in a quarter roughly, Bob is going to tell me, it's really $12 million. But it's in that range, you can have those shifts just because of the $25 million to $30 million a month, that is in that 5% range. -- And then Bob, just the tax rate for 2019, do you anticipate it to be similar to 2018 or are there things that might change for 2019? -- No. We came out with original guidance of 22% to 23% and I would think that is kind of a more normalized rate this year, will dip just below that, given some of the discrete tax items we had. But, of course, there we're always looking for that, in fact there are some of the things we pointed out in the prepared remarks, that's an expense line that we look to manage, but 22% to 23% is kind of a long-term normalized rate for us. -- Thank you very much. Appreciate it. -- Yes.Thank you. The next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citibank. Your line is now open. -- Thanks. Hey, Jeff, hey, Bob. -- Hi, Ashwin. -- Happy Halloween. You guys gave a lot of good color on sales. Appreciate that. I guess larger deal slippage, I mean that happens that larger deals also tend to be competitive in many ways. So I guess the question is, if the deals and ramps push out more or if you suppose don't win, can that affect your internal growth rate? Or do you believe this year's internal growth rate is sort of a good assumption thinking ahead into future quarters? -- Well, that I'm pausing because sure these larger deals and smaller deals tend to have a competitive element, the pipeline that we're talking about that is up 30%, is actually weighted on the basis of our belief that we will prevail or not. Now things happen and sometimes you lose transactions that you don't think you're going to lose. And certainly if we lost a bunch of things that we were expecting to win, it could have an impact on revenue this year and frankly, next year, I think that's always the case. We feel pretty good about where we are right now and that will achieve the at least 4.5% internal revenue growth. But to sustain that overtime, obviously, we have to continue to win and we'll make sure that we're doing what we need to do from a product and a go-to-market perspective to ensure we were winning. -- Got it. And then on the debt, I mean paying up to ensure a fixed rate, would -- to me is sort of a -- in some ways a bullish sign because it kind of probably implies if you kind of think fee rate can continue to improve and that would imply things for the spending environment, things like that. I guess -- is that a fair hypothesis in terms of kind of as you speak with bank executives with regards to what you're hearing about spending intentions for technology and so on so forth? And then a quick question at the end of that, what is the new cost of debt? -- So let me take the -- even though I know the answer to the last one, I'm going to let Bob take that Ashwin. -- Okay. -- The spending environment is quite bullish. I mean right now everyone in financial services knows that technology investments have to continue to be made to keep up with what's going on the digital transformation front. So there's lots going on there, there's still a ton going on around cyber, other kinds of risk, and then in this whole -- the whole notion of this payments revitalization. So there is a lot of that going on. Most of those quote decisions have been made to do things. Now it's a matter of finding the right partner, making the decision, making sure they have the right resources in their own shops to get this done, that is one of the constraints is, do the financial institutions have resources on their own side, not just us, but the pair up to be able to get things done. But there's a lot of energy and focus and, in fact, I would say that there is a higher level of motivation now to get things done because people can see what's on the other side of the wave. And what's on the other side of the wave is, this intersection of digital, and payments, money movement, new financial experiences all of that. And though we haven't even begun to talk about cognitive technologies, RPA and where that's all going to go. And in order to do that, you have to get some of the other legacy systems cleaned up. So it's pretty good from that perspective. Pretty bullish overall. -- And then let me answer your question on the cost of debt after this refinancing, we're just under 3%, about 2.9% after tax. -- Got it. Pretty good. Can I squeeze one last one in just to get the next full explanation on -- you mentioned the acquisitions have had a slower ramp. Is that -- I mean was that a product issue? Or what led to the slower ramp? -- I'm sorry, Ashwin, on which act -- which product are you talking about? -- No, no. When you said the acquisitions that have had a slow ramp? -- On acquisitions, I'm sorry, I thought you said something activation, it's all about sales cycle. So it's about how long -- so we announced a couple of Dovetail payments platform transactions. It's about how the sales cycles have gone in terms of how long it took for people to get comfortable that we were going to continue to invest in win. And then just the cycles on the client side took a little bit longer. So that idea is the main slowdown that we've seen relative to what we expected to happen. Does that make sense? -- That makes sense. Yes, got it. Thank you. -- Thank you. And thanks everyone for joining us this afternoon.

The bottom line was hurt by the normalization of adjusted effective tax rate and negative impact of 2 cents due to unfavorable foreign currency movements, which, however, were partially offset by improved operating performance.Total segment revenues of $2.16 billion lagged the consensus estimate by $47 million. The top line was, however, up 4% year over year on a reported basis, 3% on a comparable accounting basis and 5% on an organic constant currency basis. Impacted by the adoption of ASC 606, consolidated revenues were down 22.9% year over year to $2.37 billion.The top line benefited from strength across the company's core merchant acquiring and card issuance businesses. ISV and Clover both performed strongly in the quarter. While ISV recorded more than 50% revenue growth, annualized volume on Clover was up 45% year over year. First Data is increasing its investments in both these businesses. International businesses recorded double-digit growth in the quarter.Additionally, the company is expanding its digital merchant signup initiatives across its JV and other bank partners. Its direct channel continues to grow on the back of solid volume growth across RSA partners and several initiatives undertaken in the last two years.On Sep 28, First Data completed the divestiture of its card processing businesses in Greece and Central/Eastern Europe (reported within GFS EMEA) for $440.07 million (\u20ac387 million). On Aug 16, the company closed the divestiture of its check remittance processing business (reported within GFS North America) for approximately $100 million.So far this year, shares of First Data have gained 29.3% against 1.2% decline of the  it belongs to.Let's check out the numbers in detail. : This segment generated revenues of $1.38 billion, which grew 10% year over year on a reported basis, 7% on a comparable accounting basis and 6% on an organic constant currency basis. Growth was driven by strong geographical market results across North America, Latin America, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia Pacific (APAC) regions.Strong growth in the ISV and agent businesses within the Partner Solutions channel, combined with good growth in the Direct channel boosted North American performance. Latin American revenues were driven by strong growth in Argentina and Brazil. While growth in the U.K.drove EMEA revenues, APAC revenues were driven by solid growth in India. Revenues from this segment came in at $407 million, down 2% year over year on a reported basis,1% on a comparable accounting basisbut up 6% on an organic constant-currency basis. The improvement can be attributed to higher revenues from Latin America and APAC, partially offset by lower revenues from North America and EMEA. This segment generated revenues of $367 million, down 7% year over year on a reported basis, 4% on a comparable accounting basisand 2% on an organic constant currency basis. The downside was due to lower revenues in Stored value network, Security and fraud and TeleCheck, which was partially offset by strength across EFT Network Solutions (which recorded mid-single digit year over year growth).Total segment EBITDA came in at $815 million, up 4% year over year on a reportedbasis, 5% on a comparable accounting basis and 7% on an organic constant currency basis. Segment EBITDA margin of 37.8% improved50 basis points (bps) year over year on a comparable accounting basisand 60 bps on an organic constant currency basis.Operating profit increased 13.9% year over year to $475 million. Operating profit margin climbed to 22% from 20% in the prior-year quarter.Total expenses declined 28.8% from the year-ago quarter to $1.89 billion. | First Data exited the third quarter of 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $601 million compared with $544 million at the end of the prior quarter. Long-term debt was $16.9 billion compared with $17.7 billion at the end of the prior quarter.The company generated $671 million of cash from operating activities in the reported quarter. Free cash flow was $444 million. Capital expenditures were $162 million.First Data revised its 2018 guidance for segment revenue growth, segment EBITDA growth and adjusted EPS.For segment revenues, First Data expects reported constant currency growth of 6.3-7.3% compared with the previously guided growth range of 7-8%. Organic constant currency segment revenue growth range of 5-6% remains unchanged.Segment EBITDA is now expected to register 7.6-9.6% growth on a reported constant currency basis compared with the previously guided growth range of 8-10%. Organic constant currency segment EBITDA growth range of 6.5-8.5% remains unchanged.The revised guidance for segment revenue and segment EBITDA growth reflects the impact of divestitures completed in the third quarter of 2018.Adjusted earnings are expected in the range of $1.38-$1.40 compared with$1.42-$1.47 guided earlier.

Welcome to  , the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market each day. It's Monday, October 29th. I'm your host, Jason Moser. Joining me in the studio today is certified financial planner Matt Frankel. Matt, you are back from Las Vegas, in South Carolina. I hope it feels good to be home! It does! It's always fun being away for a few days, but then I start to miss my kids, sadly. I don't like traveling as much as I used to. I hear you, I feel the same way. It's always nice to get back to the family at home. It was a good weekend all the way around, right? Your Gamecocks took it to the Tennessee Volunteers, Wofford Terriers won, and hey, listen, congratulations Boston Red Sox! That was an awesome World Series win right there. I was happy to see that! And my Philadelphia Eagles won in England. Oh, you're an Eagles guy, huh? I am! New Jersey, born and raised. Good! On today's show, we're going to talk more about earnings. We'll tap into  , of course. And we'll have One to Watch, as always.We're going to start the show today with money. By that, I mean the Money20/20 show that Matt attended last week in Las Vegas. He was there working nonstop for us to get a lot of great information. He had some interviews, really a lot to get to. Let's go ahead and kick it off with a story we talked about before, the UltraFICO rating. We know that  (NYSE: FICO) was looking to add this UltraFICO rating, which was going to take into consideration the way people manage their checking accounts and savings accounts, and incorporate that into their credit score. The first inclination for both of us was to look at this with a little bit of skepticism. Matt, you were able to speak with some folks out there at the Money20/20 show. Tell us a little bit more about this UltraFICO and what you learned. I had a long conversation with the head of scores at FICO. They shed some light on some of this. This is designed to help two key groups. First is younger people or people who may not have much of an established credit history. For example, if you've never used a credit card, you've never gotten a mortgage, you might have either a terrible FICO score or no FICO score, depending on how little credit you've used. That's somewhat unfair to customers like that. Under traditional means, we have no way of assessing how well they handle their money. That's group one. Group two are people who are rebuilding their credit. It's not people with bad credit, but people who have had a couple of dings a few years ago, maybe, and now are just getting back on their feet and need an extra boost to show how they're behaving lately.To be clear, one thing FICO shared with me is that the vast majority of this formula is still going to be the traditional FICO reporting metrics, such as your payment history, the amounts you owe on your accounts, the length of your credit history, and so on. For people with bad credit, this isn't going to make the difference between getting approved or not. If you have terrible credit, you're still going to have terrible credit under this UltraFICO score. It's meant to give a boost to people in those two groups who, for one reason or another, the regular FICO formulas may not reflect their real credit risk. That's a good point there. I think about the common observation that when you're a student, maybe 18-20 years old, you probably haven't had a chance to develop any kind of a credit history because you haven't had the need to borrow for a car or a house, or perhaps respond to a credit card solicitation in the mail. If this is something that they can use to actually help establish someone I mean, that makes sense. If you're going through pretty reliable data there, the way someone might manage their checking account and/ or savings account, you do have to know how to balance those books to make sure you're not overdrafting the account. So that's actually a good thing.One thing I also saw this morning, I noticed, is that  and  both seem to be pulling back a little bit on credit offerings. Essentially, both companies noting that right now, it seems like everything is looking pretty darn good. Consumers are feeling confident, unemployment is low. This is a great, great time to be out there making some money and spending it. But they're thinking a little bit forward. Really, this is more from a risk perspective. They're trying to keep a lid on this thing getting out of control. Perhaps that UltraFICO can help out, as well. Yeah, definitely. And it's not just overdraft history. They told me there's actually a lot of banking information considered in this. Savings behavior is one thing, whether consumers have had a steadily growing average balance for the past few years, things like that. They say that the data really backs this up, that these behaviors that they're going to be looking at really do predict financial performance. They also said that they have a ton of financial institutions, both big and small, that are very interested in this to expand their prime lending base.While I'm still approaching this with a healthy level of skepticism, in terms of, will it increase default risk, it definitely serves a purpose, I could say after talking to them. That's good. It's nice to see both sides of it.Goldman Sachs Marcus. Apparently, they are looking to try to help consumers and/ or businesses manage debt a little bit more wisely. You had a chance to take a look at this is Marcus offering that they have, learn more about it. Tell me your takeaways with Goldman Sachs and Marcus. The wealth management offering that they're coming up with is still very much a work in progress. I spoke with one of their executives. He said that it's not just going to be a robo advising platform. It's definitely going to have some sort of active component. Then I asked him more in depth where Marcus is going. They had mentioned a bunch of possible growth avenues -- say, mortgages, auto loans, checking accounts, things like that. He said that even though they have the capital and the ability to grow as fast as they want to, they're still just going to focus on their core businesses that they've had so far. Those are online savings accounts and personal lending, both of which they feel have tremendous runway still. They shared a couple of stats with me. 70% of people in a recent survey don't know that you can pay off credit cards with personal loan proceeds. About 60% don't know what their savings account interest rate is. They see a big opportunity with just educating the consumer and building up the products that they already offer, and they're going to cautiously roll out new products as they see fit. Wealth management is just the next avenue.While other things like mortgages, credit cards, things like that, could be coming in the future, I wouldn't count on seeing any kind of accelerated timetable. You have to realize that Marcus itself is just about two years old. As I was talking to them, on that day, they were celebrating two years since their first personal loan was issued. They're still a very young platform, and are still trying to establish their core competencies, and aren't really inclined to grow that fast. I think I can get by that. One thing that always takes me a bit by surprise is, when you look at the bigger picture, a lot of people out there don't understand how finance works. From something as basic as a checking or savings account to taking out a loan, or even what your taxes are going toward, how much you pay in taxes, filing taxes every year. I've done a lot of research on this through the years. I had the good fortune back in 2012, to interview then-Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan. He agreed, the biggest hurdle to clear in regard to individuals in the United States in finance, is simple education. States aren't doing a good enough job of it through school systems. It's not something where you can just say, \"We're going to implement this nationwide financial literacy program. That'll take care of it.\" My observation as a father and through what we do as employees here is, it really all does start in the home. The biggest problem there is when you're a parent you don't know enough to teach your child or children about those basic financial concepts, then you're really stuck. It certainly sounds like Marcus is leaning more toward the education side, and helping people make smarter decisions. I think we can all get behind that.When we look at this next topic, this is one that you and I both support, no question. For whatever reason or another, we just don't see as many women in money and finance as you would think. If you listen to LouAnn Lofton, she wrote a terrific book about Warren Buffett, how he invests like a girl. I recommend anyone out there who hasn't read it to check it out. LouAnn is a longtime favorite of ours here at the Fool. The bottom line is, women are really good with money, really smart with money. It seems like we should have more in this profession. But for whatever reason, we don't. You had the opportunity to interview the Money20/20 president, Tracey Davies. Talk to me about what you learned. Ms. Davies is really trying to push for inclusion on all levels, they're just trying to start with gender. It makes sense, women are the biggest minority pool out there with 50% of the population. Finance is an industry that generally has not been very inclusive traditionally. If I asked everybody who's listening to close their eyes and think of an investment bank's boardroom, you're probably picturing a bunch of old white men sitting around a table. There's a reason for that. Historically, that's been the case. Over the past couple of decades or so, they've done a very good job of becoming a more inclusive industry as a whole. But we need to do better.Mr. Davies shared with me that only about 20% of leadership roles, meaning executive positions in the financial sector, are held by women. Only about 20%. They're starting what's called this Rise Up Initiative. The way she described it was an accelerator for ambitious women who want to get their start in the financial industry. Basically, they apply to this program, they go to the Money20/20 conference that I was at. They're in this program, and they have very great, unprecedented, one-on-one access with leaders, both male and female, in the financial industry, seminars. One was called Ascending to the C-Suite that I saw. It's a very intimate program, only 30 people this year. They're planning on expanding it somewhat, but still keeping it pretty small.It's really nice to see these initiatives. Like I said, they're only starting with gender. They're planning on embracing all kinds of inclusiveness. This program was in its first year, and she said they had too much interest, which is a great problem to have. It's really nice to see. Like I said, the financial industry has been doing great, but we have to do better with being inclusive. It's really nice to see them taking a step in the right direction. I agree 100%. Speaking as a father of two young daughters, I get excited when I think about the opportunities that they're going to have as they get older. They both always tell me they want to work at The Motley Fool. [laughs] I think they see how much fun I have at my job, so they figure, hey, why not? And I want that possibility to exist. I want them to have the world at their fingertips.Another great advocate for women in finance, Sallie Krawcheck. You can follow her on Twitter @SallieKrawcheck. She's also the founder of this platform, Ellevest, which is essentially women in finance. It's the same basic message. It's giving women a place to learn more, to be more, to grow more, to take advantage of the opportunities out there. Certainly something we can all get behind. We look forward to the opportunities to bring more women in finance to our ranks there at The Motley Fool. That's great, I'm glad you had the chance to speak with Tracy out there. Actually, before we go on, she asked me to share her email, if any of our listeners might be interested in the Rise Up program. Absolutely! Yeah, please give us that! Sure. It's tracey@money2020.com. Terrific! Excellent! Hopefully we have some listeners out there that can reach out and learn more.  (NYSE: GDOT) , probably a company that not a lot of folks out there have on their radar, but it is a publicly traded company and it's actually been on the public markets for a little while. I do remember looking at this company when it first went public, Matt. There were some questions I had in regard to the total market opportunity and the trends of what they were pursuing. You made a point here in that they're targeting the group of consumers that are most likely to still use cash. What were the takeaways from your time learning about Green Dot at the conference? Green Dot's oldest and most visible business, they've been around for 20 years now, are prepaid debit cards. Particularly if you ever shop at  , those prepaid money cards that are at the checkout, those are all Green Dot products. That's what they're known for.They also provide a checking account product for people who don't have a traditional checking account. They're also really emphasizing what they call their banking as a service platform. If you're a company that needs, say, a peer-to-peer payment app, or something like that, it's really expensive and in most cases undesirable to actually become a bank. We've heard some talk about maybe Amazon offering a banking product. Amazon will never become a bank. They may partner with a bank to offer the Amazon-branded checking account, but they're not going to become a bank. They don't want that regulatory oversight, the costs associated with it, things like that.What Green Dot does is let companies piggyback off their infrastructure and their technology to offer the piece of banking that they want to, and not become a bank. To give you a couple of examples, Uber allows their drivers to have payment accounts where they can get paid whenever they want to do from their ride. That's powered by Green Dot's infrastructure.  Pay Cash, the peer-to-peer platform on Apple, is powered by Green Dot. Turbo Tax's pre-loaded debit cards with tax refunds are powered by Green Dot. Companies that need banking products and services, but don't want to become a bank themselves, use Green Dot.And like I mentioned, these are the customers who are most likely to be the last holdouts of the cash economy. People with an American Express card and a  checking account, like me, I use card or mobile payments for most purchases now. People without those things are the most likely to use cash for everyday purchases. When we're talking about war on cash investments, Green Dot is a really interesting play, because they're targeting the people that use cash the most. They have a huge addressable market there. That's always nice to hear. That's one of the things we look for in all of our investments, huge market opportunities. It sounds like Green Dot certainly still has one.Lastly, we want to talk a little bit about American Express tying up here with Amazon. If I'm reading correctly, this is primarily a business relationship from what I can see. The one thing that I found noteworthy was, it didn't look like there was any type of annual fee involved with this relationship. American Express is pretty notorious for that annual fee. Talk a little bit more about the American Express and Amazon tie-up, and what exactly that's going to mean for both companies. This was actually probably my favorite announcement there just because I'm a huge  fan, and Barbara Corcoran was the spokesperson giving this announcement. It's a good show, I like it too! On a personal level, I really enjoyed this announcement. You're correct, it's a business card. This is not a personal credit card product. And yes, it's no annual fee. But the most unique thing is that cardholders have a choice -- on one hand, Amazon Prime members could choose to get 5% rewards on any Amazon purchase, including Whole Foods; or, they can choose to have 90-day payment terms. What's really unique about this is, this is not just 90-day interest-free payments. This is 90 days of no payments, meaning that you charge something, and you're billed without any interest comes due in 90 days.This is a really big benefit for businesses that have cash flow issues. Let's say you sell something to somebody. You need to finance the cost of goods to make whatever you're selling, but then you're not going to get paid for a couple of months. This really allows you to manage your cash flow so much better without that extra expensive credit card interest, or any payments due at all, until your receivables come in. I don't know of any other credit card that has zero payments for 90 days. There's a lot of interest-free credit cards, but you're still to make minimum payments along the way.That was the big takeaway I saw. And, it's a no annual fee product, and 5% cashback if you choose that route. It's a great rewards rate for a no annual fee credit card to begin with. There's a couple of big perks to this for small businesses. That's a couple of really a behemoth companies in the space, and it looks like they're tackling what is a problem with a unique and compelling solution. I have to believe that they should gain a little traction with that.Matt, one more thing here. I know it was busy week for you, obviously. You had a lot of stuff. You're probably still digging through all your notes. You've got at least one article coming out here soon with a lot of your Money20/20 observations, right? Yeah, I actually have two. I have a Green Dot article with a deeper dive into that company, which should be out tomorrow. Then there's an interview article with the head of brand for Marcus. I'm waiting on a couple of quote approvals from them just to make sure I quoted him correctly because I can't read my own writing in a few cases. So there's a small delay on that. But it should be out any day now. Great, good stuff. We'll make sure we get that tweeted out on the  feed, so all of our listeners can get a chance to check it all out.Let's take a moment and look back at the week that was in earnings. Earnings season is still going strong. We had a few companies that we keep on our radar here that announced last week. We'll go ahead and open with  . I'll just give you my quick takeaway looking at it. You don't really want to read too terribly much into what this company is doing because it's kind of an \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" situation. If you look at Visa, payments volume was up 11%. Transactions were up 12%. We talked about this before, they did raise the dividend prior to the announcement. I for one have been critical that they should raise their dividend more when you look at the amount of money they've spent on share repurchases vs. what they've given shareholders as dividends. But it's still working out either way. They're bringing the share count down. What stood out to you in the quarter? Well, a 34% jump in earnings. A lot of that is tax reform, but not as much as you might think. The 12% boost in revenue that you just mentioned was really what stood out to me. That's with some foreign exchange headwinds, as well. That's the impressive growth. The revenue growth is the really impressive thing to notice with pretty much all of these financial earnings since we're still less than a year in from tax reform.Visa is still growing at a double-digit rate. They're anticipating growing at a double-digit rate. That's another company I had a chance to briefly speak with at Money. They couldn't stop talking about how much untapped opportunity there is, especially in overseas markets. They mentioned something like 70% of transactions still take place in cash. If you think that the card market is getting saturated, think again. There's still a lot of runway here. I'm sure I've mentioned it before, but in the time we lived in Egypt for three years in the early 2000s, and then onward in Kazakhstan, those were two economies that ran so much on cash. They just didn't have that infrastructure yet. When you look at it from a global perspective, you certainly do understand the opportunity that still exists, how many dollars are flowing through those networks today and how many will be flowing through them in the next 10 years. It makes companies like that so attractive. , a company that most of our listeners might not be as familiar with, but you are familiar with it. Tell me what your takeaways from the quarter were. They beat on earnings, but the stock plunged right after the report. It kind of looks puzzling at first, but when you dig into it, this is a bank that has been a beneficiary of the booming economy of start-ups and things like that in Silicon Valley. Because of their relationship with all the start-ups and venture capital out there, they get a big low-cost deposit base, which has been growing rapidly. This quarter, the deposit growth was just about 2%, which is not as good as investors were hoping for. Interest margins, because they have a big low-cost deposit base and rates are rising, everyone wanted to see margins expand a little more than they did. I think they only expanded by about three basis points. While on the surface, it looks good, and the bank is still growing at a pretty impressive level, the numbers just weren't quite what investors were looking for. It happens. That happens. It does. Another one, I got a few questions on Twitter last week about this one, so I want to make sure we give it a little bit of attention.  , a company I'm a big fan of, I know a lot of our members and listeners are fans of it, too. The stock just got shellacked after earnings came out last week. It fell somewhere in the neighborhood of 17-20%. I think this is one where the bark was much worse than the actual bite. I don't think things are nearly as bad as that sell-off would have you believe.With that said, what we're seeing play out is one of the biggest risks that we called out investing in this company. Ellie Mae, being the mortgage software provider, has really benefited from this huge stretch of low interest rates, where people are refinancing, it seems like, on an annual basis. With rates starting to go back up, the refinance volume is drying up. They need to make up for that lost volume on the purchase side. But of course, purchases are only going to take care of so much here.Management guided back on full year revenue guidance. They guided back on the actual number of contracted seats that they see filling out for 2018. Those clearly aren't good things. They tell us that things are slowing down a little bit. But, by the same token, they actually gained 1% in terms of volume expansion in the face of a market that was down 13%. They're maintaining and actually picking up a little bit of share in what is a very tough market. They do see the housing market getting a little bit better in the coming months going into spring of 2019. I think one of the biggest challenges right now is a lack of inventory out there for entry-level homebuyers.But the bottom line is, when you look at the actual business itself, they're continuing to do good things. They're growing the active users, they're closing more loans, the revenue per closed loan is on the rise. These are all good things. I think we're witnessing a bit more of a macro thing as opposed to a business thing.If you don't own shares of Ellie Mae and you always wanted to, I think this is probably a good opportunity to at least take a closer look. For full disclosure, I own shares of Ellie Mae. I didn't sell them, I'm not going to sell them. I love this business, I want to hang on to them. Definitely some macro concerns that are going to play out on these guys for the coming quarters.The big risk is, did they get everything out there this quarter? Or are they going to guide down again in a quarter or two to come? Hopefully they threw out the kitchen sink this past quarter. But it's always possible that they come out next quarter and things don't look quite as good as maybe they'd hoped, and they guide back down again. If that's the case, the stock may see tougher days ahead. But it's a good business, it's a growing business, it's a profitable business, it's a cash flow positive business. A lot of good things here. They're clearly building a platform that their customers like and are using, so I wouldn't get too worked up over it. It wasn't the greatest quarter in the world, but it wasn't as bad as the market would have you believe.There we go with earnings.Let's take a look here really quick, I want to tap into Twitter, as we do every week. Always some good stuff out there being said and questions being asked. I'll look here first @Cricket99238. He says, \"Wonderful episode, love the insights on  . Definitely one that I'm going to watch closely. Thanks for the education.\" I think you really caught his attention there with Synchrony, Matt. Good job! Glad to do it! That's another company I met with at Money20/20. By the way, I'm convinced that Vegas is the most cash-friendly city in America. Ironic that they hold a payments conference there. People can't gamble with cards, so everybody has cash. All the businesses there just use cash. Cash is everywhere in Vegas. Ironic that they have a cashless payment conference. [laughs] Last week, we had a lot of volatility in the markets. On October 26th, long-term investor @GBP_HS said, \"On days such as these, one needs all three of cash, courage, and conviction. If any one of the three is missing, the correction will be a wasted opportunity.\" I couldn't agree more. Always nice to have some dry powder, but it does you no good if you don't have the courage and conviction to actually hit the buy button. Make sure you have a watchlist there with the companies you really have high convictions on so that when we have these -- let's face it, it seems like these corrections are happening really quick. A couple of days, you'll see some volatility, then the next couple of days, it's back on the way up. Be able to take advantage of those down days because you don't know how long they're going to last.Rick Zabrowski, @RZabrowski, I call him Dr. Rick. He's a good tweet. He said, \"I've been investing for 30 years, buying on dips. Biggest mistake was selling anything. I now have numerous 20-plus-baggers and  paying 20%-plus based on my initial cost. Buy and hold also means I'm diversified in sectors, size, geography, growth, and dividends. Stay the course.\" I thought this was a great tweet. You've got a guy out here who's lived it, who's done it. This is a lot of great advice from someone who's seeing the benefits of what he's preaching right here. Thanks for that, Dr. Rick!Lastly, last week, I had a chance to go on CNBC and talk with them a little bit about some of our favorite payment companies. A tweet here from @Every90Midwest. He said, \"The important question: were you wearing pants?\" Yes. Yes, Adam, I was wearing pants. For a little backstory there, sometimes here in the summertime, we don't have a dress code here at the Fool, so you can wear shorts. If I'm doing a press spot here or something from the studio here, well, I may just put on the suit top and leave the shorts on. I call that the wardrobe mullet. Business up top, and you get the party going on down below. If they're just shooting the camera from the high level up, there's no reason to worry about having pants on. But I have pants, they're just shorts. I confess, during the summer, I've done the same. [laughs] I just wanted to be very clear, I'm wearing pants in one way or another. This one was at their studios, so I most definitely was wearing pants. Good question there, Adam, I appreciate it.Matt, let's go ahead and wrap it up here with One to Watch, give our listeners something to focus on for the coming week. We still have more companies out there reporting. What's your one to watch this coming week? I'd say mine is Green Dot, ticker GDOT, the one I mentioned. The more I hear about the company, and the more I dig into it, the more I like it as a long-term investment. Nothing particularly newsworthy coming in the next week, it's just the one that's on my radar right now. I'm going to be watching out for  (NASDAQ: FISV) earnings, ticker FISV. I believe those are coming up Wednesday. This is an interesting payments company. I think their customer base primarily is financial institutions. But again, it's finance, it's tech, it's taking advantage of that space and I think playing a big role in the behind-the-scenes nature as opposed to some of those other names that we see in fintech every day. We'll make sure to go through that quarter and have an update for you next week.Folks, remember, you can always reach out to us via email at  . Make sure to follow us on Twitter @MFIndustryFocus.

This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 31. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the , it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.This financial services technology company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.77 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +20.3%.Revenues are expected to be $1.43 billion, up 2.2% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Fiserv, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.75%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Fiserv will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Fiserv would post earnings of $0.74 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.75, delivering a surprise of +1.35%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Fiserv doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 11 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Fiserv Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $71.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $87.00. The standard deviation is $5.5.But the whole reason to look at the  FISV price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with FISV crossing above that average target price of $79.36/share, investors in FISV have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $79.36 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

Notably, Fiserv has witnessed a 7% rise in shares since it posted strong second-quarter 2018 results.Let's find out what's driving the stock.The company's diverse product portfolio provides significant growth opportunities, courtesy of rapidly changing financial services industry as well as increasing demand for digital banking and payment services. In second-quarter 2018, Fiserv's DNA platform comprised 11 clients, which is expected to reach nearly 30 by the end of 2018. Since its acquisition in 2013, DNA delivered largest sales figure during the quarter. DNA's modern architecture and true real-time processing continues to remain popular. Moreover, Mobility ASP subscribers increased 24% in the quarter, to 7.5 million.Zelle, launched in June 2017, is poised well on the back of 35 sales to financial institutions in the second quarter.

Identity verification provides real-time analysis by evaluating high-risk cardholder behavior within the interactive voice response (IVR) system. This activates protective action to reduce account takeover. Layered, multi-factor authentication helps generate caller identity and moves the information to other fraud applications.According to Fiserv, overall fraud activities have touched a three-year high of $16.8 billion in 2017 with mean consumer expenses for the same at $102 per incident, which is twice than 2016. In the United States, account takeover loss of $5.1 billion in 2017 was more than three times the loss incurred in 2016.Patrick Davie, vice president of Fiserv's Product Strategy, Card Services stated, \"With these two solutions, fraud exposure for financial institutions can be reduced, cardholders' personal data is safeguarded and account takeover can be prevented before transactions at the point of sale occur.\"So far this year, shares of Fiserv have gained 21.5%, outperforming the 7.3% rise of Zacks S&P 500 Composite.Considering the rapidly changing financial services industry with digitalization taking center stage, financial institutions have become more prone to fraud and malicious activities. Consequently, demand for authentication services is expected to increase, which, in turn, should aid uptake of Fiserv's enhanced consumer authentication solutions.Notably, the initial five-month trial period of step-up authentication witnessed more than $2 million in fraud savings. Identity verification, made available to Fiserv clients in the second quarter, successfully identified several fraud calls.We believe that the newly introduced solutions will boost the company's growing Payments segment. In the second quarter of 2018, the segment contributed around 59% to total revenues and grew 7.4% year over year to $837 million.

In today's fast-paced life, people rely heavily on digitaltechnologies and gadgets - especially mobile, laptops and others - for day-to-day needs. Digitalization of banking and payment services has made it easier for them to conduct transactions.With the market adapting a quantitative approach to save time, reduce operating expenses and increase work efficiency, companies in this industry should benefit. The buoyancy in the financial transaction services industry is further confirmed by its  in the top 41% (105 out of the 250 plus groups).Given this backdrop, it is not a bad idea to undertake a comparative analysis of two Financial Transaction Services stock - Fiserv, Inc.  and Equifax Inc.  . Both the stocks are part of the broader  (one of the 16 Zacks sectors). While Fiserv has a market capitalization of $32.28 billion, Equifax's market cap is $16.20 billion.As both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), we are using certain other parameters to give investors a better insight. You can see Fiserv clearly scores over Equifax in terms of price performance. So far this year, shares of Fiserv have gained 21.6%, outperforming the 8.6% rise of Zacks S&P 500 Composite. Equifax has returned 14.1% in the same time frame.Earnings growth along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company's strong prospects.Fiserv's current-quarter earnings are projected to grow 20.3% against a decline of 7.2% for Equifax. Looking at the full-year 2018 picture, Fiserv's earnings are projected to grow 22.3% while that of Equifax are expected to decrease 2%. For 2019, Fiserv's earnings are expected to register 12.2% growth compared with 7.2% for Equifax.Thus, Fiserv has an edge over Equifax in terms of quarterly and yearly projected earnings growth.The earnings surprise history of a stock helps investors have an idea of the stock's performance in the previous quarters.Fiserv and Equifax have an impressive earning surprise history, with Fiserv's earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters. Equifax's earnings outpaced the consensus mark in all the past four quarters.However, Equifax has delivered a higher average positive earnings surprise of 2.8% compared with 1.5% for Fiserv.Net profit margin helps investors evaluate a company's business model in terms of pricing policy, cost structure and operating efficiency, and shows how good it is at converting revenues into profits. Hence, a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors.Fiserv's TTM net margin of 25.1% places it favorably in comparison to Zacks S&P 500 Composite's figure of 12%. It also has a lead over Equifax's 14.8% TTM net margin.The Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E) metric is used to measure a company's value relative to its earnings. In general, a lower number or multiple is considered better than a higher one.The trailing 12-month price-to-earnings multiple for Fiserv and Equifax is 28 and 22.8, respectively, while that of the Zacks S&P 500 Composite is 20.1. Although both the companies are overvalued relative to the industry, Equifax has a lower P/E ratio than Fiserv.The EV/EBITDA metric is used to compare two stocks within the same industry and offers a clearer picture of a company's valuation because it includes debt. The ratio is often used in addition to the P/E ratio.We observe that while Fiserv and Equifax have EV/EBITDA ratios of 18.2 and 15.6, respectively, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite's figure stands at 11.9. Although both the companies compare unfavorably with the industry, Equifax has a lower EV/EBITDA value than Fiserv.So, in terms of aggregate valuation, Equifax is undervalued compared to Fiserv.Our comparative analysis shows that while Fiserv scores over Equifax in terms of price performance, net margin and quarterly and yearly projected earnings growth. Equifax has an edge in terms of earnings surprise history.Although faster share price rally year-to-date has led to a rich valuation for both stocks compared with the benchmark index, Equifax is cheaper than Fiserv.Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include NV5 Global  , Information Services Group  and Genpact  . All the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The long-term expected earnings per share growth rate for NV5 Global, Information Services Group and Genpact is 20%, 14% and 20%, respectively.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

Its diversified product portfolio and prudent business moves in the form of accretive acquisitions and partnerships help maintain a competitive position in the financial and payments solutions business.Fiserv's solid run seems to continue with its outperformance in second-quarter 2018. Adjusted earnings per share of 75 cents beat the consensus mark by a penny and improved 32% on a year-over-year basis. Revenues of $1.42 billion outpaced the consensus estimate by $2 million and increased 2.5% year over year. Adjusted revenues of $1.35 billion increased 2% year over year.Fiserv looks strong on the back of its diversified product portfolio. In second-quarter 2018, Fiserv's DNA platform had 11 clients and expects to reach nearly 30 by the end of 2018. DNA reported the highest sales in the quarter, since its acquisition in 2013. DNA's modern architecture and true real-time processing continued to remain popular. Mobiliti ASP subscribers grew 24% in the quarter to 7.5 million. Zelle transactions grew more than 40% sequentially and more than 15 times year over year. Debit volume growth in the quarter was in high single digits. P2P transactions also reported solid growth. Considering the rapidly changing financial services industry and increasing demand for digital banking and payment services, the diversified product portfolio continues to yield a steady flow of customers for Fiserv.Acquisitions have been contributing to Fiserv's top-line growth. In 2017, the company completed four acquisitions - Monitise plc (on Sep 1), Dovetail Group Limited (on Aug 18), PCLender, LLC (on Jul 31) and Online Banking Solutions, Inc. (on Jan 17). These buyouts contributed $42 million of revenues in the first half of 2018. Additionally, these helped Fiserv to improve cash management and digital business banking solutions and transform its payments infrastructure.Fiserv continues to expand into digitalization with the help of multiple partnerships. On Jun 19, 2018, Fiserv partnered with Iowa-based Sioux Valley Community Credit Union (CCU) and Washington-based Coulee Dam Federal Credit Union (FCU) to improve their technological suite and deliver updated and enhanced services to members. In the same month, Fiserv collaborated with Dollar Bank and VyStar to help them expand into digital banking and payment services.The company entered similar partnerships with Broadway Bank and Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka & Finance PLC (MBSL) in May, SISCOOP and Carter Bank & Trust of Martinsville in April, Mastercard in March, Kawartha Credit Union in February and with Motor City Community Credit Union, First Foundation Bank and The Home Savings and Loan Company of Kenton in January. Such strategic partnerships will help Fiserv expand its product and services in the market, thereby strengthening its position.We are also impressed with Fiserv's consistent efforts to return value to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. In the first half of 2018, Fiserv repurchased 11 million shares for $789 million. As of Jun 30, 2018, the company had 10.4 million shares available for buyback. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, Fiserv repurchased shares worth $1.17 billion, $1.20 billion and $1.47 billion, respectively. Such moves indicate the company's commitment to create value for shareholders and underline its confidence in its business.Notwithstanding the abovementioned positives, the company faces certain headwinds. Fiserv's balance sheet is highly leveraged. As of Jun 30, 2018, long-term debt was $4.8 billion while cash and cash equivalents were $348 million. Such a cash position implies that Fiserv needs to generate adequate amount of operating cash flow to service its debt. High debt may limit the company's future expansion and worsen its risk profile.Additionally, Fiserv's core banking products and services are part of a highly competitive market. The industry is getting more competitive with the entry of several non-banking bodies. Going forward, competition is anticipated to increase as market entrants multiply and the existing players expand their product lines and services with updated technologies. Maintaining strong and long-term client relationships is a difficult task amid stiff competition.Currently, Fiserv carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Namely, I pegged  (NYSE:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) as underestimated opportunities that were likely to end up dishing out pleasant surprises as they win more than their fair share of the market.Those were hardly the only compelling prospects in this fast-growing overlap of the financial and technology sectors though - there are plenty more fintech stocks with oversized upside most investors just don't see.To that end, here's a run-down of three more interesting picks from this sliver of the stock market. They may not be center-stage names, as was the case with our first look at the financial technologies business  .As was also the case three weeks ago though, all three of these organizations bring something unique (and marketable) to the table.The name  (NASDAQ:  ) may ring a bell, though many investors don't remember why. The reason is, this company isn't in the foreground anywhere, but is in the background everywhere.Fiserv offers a  to the financial services you lean on \u2026 banks, brokers and insurers. Namely, it provides payment processing, risk management tools and even customer-rewards programs. It's likely the company has performed a task for your benefit, with you assuming your consumer-facing contact took care of it.It's still adding paying customers to its roster too. If you're a customer of Dollar Bank, Fiserv's Architect platform will  for the bank's digital banking options, further growing its recurring revenue base.It's a two-edged sword.On the one hand, the nature of its business is one that doesn't facilitate huge waves of revenue and earnings growth. On the other hand, there's much to be said for reliable revenue, even if it's growing at a snail's pace.This year's  will heat up to a similarly un-blistering 4.7% next year, but this year's expected per-share profit of $3.13 will almost certainly get to 2019's projection of $3.51. That's more certainty than most  fintech stocks can offer. (NYSE:  ) is yet another one of those \"boring\" insurance platform stocks that have a license to print money. Unlike Fiserv, however, Guidewire is headed into a period of red-hot growth\u2026 growth most investors are just overlooking.Guidewire Software, as was noted, offers  to solve the unique problems of the insurance industry. Tapping the flexibility of the cloud, its InsuranceSuite melds customer engagement, operations and analytics into one platform that seamlessly integrates all facets of the insurance business.The industry has certainly taken notice. Guidewire Software was recently  by EMEA's Celent, adding to a lengthening string of accolades.Would-be paying customers have taken notice, too. Last quarter's top line of $140.5 million was  , topping expectations while  easily trounced analyst expectations for a loss of 1 cent per share.That's just the beginning \u2026 analysts are calling for almost  followed by 20% growth next year, with per-share operating profits expected to grow at a similar pace.Last but not least, add  (NYSE:  ) to your list of fintech stocks to think about.Yes, this is the same JPMorgan Chase that's a mega-bank and broker, and has been around (in one form or another) for eons. These larger, stodgier players have generally been less inclined to - and less capable of - wading into fintech waters, but JPMorgan Chase has been a curious exception to the tendency.Case(s) in point: JPMorgan has been on something of an investment spree,  (which powers GoFundMe) in December, which  . At the same time, it's been  like OpenFin, Stripe and Bill.com.It's not entirely clear where all this is going. And it may be mere coincidence that the bulk of the company's deal-making thus far has focused on payments.Regardless, JPMorgan Chase's willingness to enter unfamiliar territory is interesting if for no other reason than it has enough reach and financial backing to really change the landscape of the fintech world in a way that suits the bank best.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["hares of  have gained 22.1% in the past year, outperforming the S&P 500's gain of 14%. The company's key growth drivers include its strong market position, a healthy product portfolio, significant acquisition synergies and steady flow of new customers.Fiserv reported mixed results in first-quarter 2018, wherein bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missed the same. Adjusted earnings of 76 cents outpaced the consensus mark by 3 cents and improved 22.6% year over year. Total revenues came in at $1.440 million, which missed the consensus mark of $1,442.1 million but increased 3.3% year over year.The company's earnings surprise history has been decent. Fiservsurpassed estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 0.4%. For the second quarter, the consensus estimate has remained unchanged over the past 30 days.Fiserv's dominant position in the financial and payments solutions business is expected to continue driving growth. Furthermore, the company's broad and diverse customer base, efforts to enhance operational efficiency, high recurring revenues and continued technology upgrades are encouraging.In first-quarter 2018, which is the third year of Fiserv's ongoing five-year operational effectiveness program, the company achieved $18 million of savings. The savings came on the back of solid labor optimization and procurement benefits. Fiserv is optimistic about achieving its target of $50 million savings by 2018. | Fiserv continues to expand its product portfolio and enhance its offerings with the help of strategic acquisitions. The company completed four acquisitions - Online Banking Solutions, Inc., PCLender, LLC, Dovetail Group Limited and Monitise plc - in 2017. These buyouts helped the company to improve cash management and digital business banking solutions, and transform payments infrastructure.We believe Fiserv will continue to pursue accretive deals, which will boost its market share and customer base moving ahead.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Cardtronics has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Fiserv has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that CATM likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than FISV has recently. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.CATM currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.70, while FISV has a forward P/E of 24.51. We also note that CATM has a PEG ratio of 1.43. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. FISV currently has a PEG ratio of 2.13.Another notable valuation metric for CATM is its P/B ratio of 2.73. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

At times, it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Here we focus on  , a stock with expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 11.5%. Its earnings are expected to register 21.9% and 12.6% growth, respectively, in 2018 and 2019.The company's price performance over the past year looks impressive. Share of Fiserv have gained 19.3%, outperforming the S&P 500's gain of 12.5%.We believe the stock has the potential to continue the momentum. The reasons behind our optimism include the company's strategic acquisitions and alliances to boost its digital banking and payment services suite and shareholder-friendly moves.Let's discuss them in detail.Fiserv continues to expand its product portfolio and enhance its offerings with the help of strategic acquisitions. In 2017, Fiserv completed four acquisitions - Online Banking Solutions, Inc. (on Jan 17, 2017), PCLender, LLC (on Jul 31, 2017), Dovetail Group Limited (on Aug 18, 2017) and Monitise plc (on Sep 1, 2017). Thesebuyouts helped the company to improve cash management and digital business banking solutions and transform payments infrastructure.In 2016, Fiserv acquired two businesses - Convenience Pay Services business of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Companyand Community Financial Services businessof ACI Worldwide, Inc. Both these buyouts expanded Fiserv's biller solution offerings and enhanced its digital banking and payments solutions suite.Considering the rapidly changing financial services industry and increasing demand for digital banking services, investment in digital-oriented technologies through strategic acquisitions should boost Fiserv's long-term growth and improve competitiveness.We believe that the company will continue to pursue accretive deals, which will boost its market share and customer base going forward. The company is focused into becoming a global leader in transaction-based technology solutions.Fiserv continues to make prudent business moves. It is entering into partnershipsto expand into digitalization. On Apr 19,2018, Fiservannounced its partnership with SISCOOP to enable 26 Mexican credit unions to offer a full range of secured digital banking and payment services using Fiserv's DigitalAccess technology. This came on the heels of Fiserv's foray into digital transformation with Carter Bank & Trust of Martinsville, announced on Apr 9, 2018. The bank will use the Digital Edge suite from Fiserv to digitalize banking services and automate multiple manual processes as part of a strategic transformation.Fiserv continues to profit from offloading assets. In first-quarter 2018, Fiserv sold its 55% stake in Lending Solutions business to funds affiliated with Warburg Pincus LLC. Fiserv received total sale proceeds of $419 million from the deal. The company will retain the remaining 45% stake in the Lending Solutions business.On Jan 10, it completed the sale of the retail voucher business, MyVoucherCodes (acquired as part of its purchase of Monitise in September 2017) for $50 million. On May 11, 2017, Fiserv sold its Australian item processing business for approximately $17 million.We are impressed with Fiserv's consistent efforts to return value to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. In first-quarter 2018, Fiserv repurchased 5.7 million shares for an aggregate cost of $398 million. As of Mar 31, 2018, it had 15.8 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization. Fiserv repurchased shares worth $1.17 billion, $1.20 billion and $1.47 billion, respectively, in 2017, 2016 and 2015.Such moves indicate the company's commitment to create value for shareholders and underline its confidence in its business. These shareholder-friendly initiatives not only boost investors' confidence but also positively impact earnings per share.The aforementioned factors positively impacted Fiserv's performance in the last reported quarter. In fact, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 0.4%. We believe the upbeat performance will continue in the quarters ahead, thus giving investors enough reasons to remain optimistic on the stock.Currently, Fiserv has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Fiserv has delivered positive surprise in two of the prior four quarters with an average beat of 0.4%.Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E) metric is used to measure a company's value relative to its earnings.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 14 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Fiserv Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $61.50. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $85.00. The standard deviation is $7.186.But the whole reason to look at the  FISV price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with FISV crossing above that average target price of $71.26/share, investors in FISV have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $71.26 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

In fact, a rise in share price and strong fundamentals signal a stock's bullish run. has performed well so far this year and possesses a great potential to carry the momentum forward. Therefore, if you have not taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, it's time you add this gaming stock to your portfolio now.Here are a few reasons why the stock is worth considering.A look at the company's price trend reveals that the stock has had an impressive run on the bourse over the past year. Fiserv has gained 23.3%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's rally of 12.2%.In the current year, 15 estimates moved north over the past 60 days versus no southward revisions, reflecting analysts' confidence in the company. Over the same period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year increased 8.4%.Fiservhas a descent earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive earnings surprise of 0.8%. | The company's Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings of $3.11 reflects year-over-year growth of 21.5%. Moreover, earnings are expected to register 13.1% growth in 2019. The stock has long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 11.5% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Fiserv's dominant position in the financial and payments solutions business is a big positive. We believe that the broad and diverse customer base, efforts to enhance operational efficiency, high recurring revenues and continued technology upgrades should help the company to drive growth. The company is also expected to achieve savings of $250 million from its new five-year operational effectiveness program.Accretive acquisitions have been a key growth factor for Fiserv over the years. In the third quarter of 2017, the company completed the acquisitions of Monitise, PCLender and Dovetail Group. The product-oriented acquisitions are expected to further enhance its clientele in the United States as well as in international markets. Last December, the company acquired Online Banking Solutions Corp to improve digital banking business and cash management capacities.In 2017, the company also completed the acquisitions of ACI Worldwide's Community Financial Services business and Architect, an online and mobile banking solution for retail and business customers. Furthermore, it acquired a small business - Billers Solutions - which has expanded its presence on the SaaS platform. In early 2013, it acquired Open Solutions - a leading technology provider - for approximately $850 million.Also, most of the Open Solutions contracts are long term in nature, thus adding recurring revenues to the company's top line. We believe that the company will continue to pursue accretive acquisitions, which are likely boost its market share and customer base going forward.Additionally, Fiserv is focused on returning value to shareholders through buybacks. The company bought back 1.5 million shares for $189 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Fiserv had 10.7 million shares remaining for buyback as of Dec 31, 2017.Some other top-ranked stocks in the business services sector are Mastercard  , VeriFone Systems  and Fidelity National Information Services  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2.

Shares of Verifone have lost 14.1% against the  's gain of 3.0% in the said timeframe.VeriFone's business continues to be affected by macroeconomic headwinds in emerging markets such as China and India. Further, VeriFone faces significant competition from a number of local providers in the domestic as well as international markets. Notably, non-GAAP revenues from North America and Asia Pacific declined drastically by 21.7% and 30.7%, respectively, in first-quarter fiscal 2018, on a year-over-year basis.Meanwhile, Verifone reported mixed financial results for first-quarter fiscal 2018. Earnings per share met the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved fr om the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP revenues, despite beating estimates, declined 4.3% year over year. The company's System Solutions revenues declined 7% year over year to $243.1 million, owing to the headwinds arising from the U.S. petro business and Indian markets. | Apart from this, the Electronic payment system and services market is highly competitive and fragmented. New market entrants such as non-card payment methods (using Internet and cloud instead of using physical cards) are expected to gain significant traction in the long run. Increased pricing pressure is another headwind. We believe the market is getting more competitive with the introduction of new market entrants and latest technologies.The divestitures of China business, Petroleum Media business and Taxi Solutions business during 2017 are anticipated to hurt top-line growth in the near term. Multiple acquisitions, despite improving revenue opportunities, increase the company's exposure to integration risks.

Higher interest rate on debt is expected to negatively impact profitability.Recent launches like Carbon Mobile 5 device and Verifone e280 mobile point-of-sale (mPOS) solutionwill take some time to contribute to growth.The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock. Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter earnings declined 12.1% to 29 cents per share. Full-year 2018 earnings estimates however remained unchanged at $1.48 per share in the last 60 days.Further, current quarter and full-year 2018 sales are estimated to decline 8.1% and 4.2%, respectively.The downward estimate revisions reflect pessimism over the prospects of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. You can see  .Return on Capital (ROC) of Verifone is 7.1% compared with 19.9% for the industry. This implies that the company generates a lower return on investment than its industry.Return on Equity (ROE) is a measure of a company's efficiency in utilizing shareholders' funds. Verifone's trailing 12-month ROE undercuts its growth potential. The stock's current ROE stands at 18.9% compared with the industry's ROE of 37.2%.The debt-to-equity ratio is a good indicator of the financial well-being of a company. To this end, Verifone seems to be a highly leveraged stock with a reading of 93.5% compared with 61.7% for the industry.Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader  include Fiserv  , Global Payments  and Mastercard  . All the stocks currently carry a Zacks Rank #2.The projected earnings growth rate (3-5 years) for Fiserv, Global Payments and Mastercard is 11.5%, 15.8% and 18.3%, respectively.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

Reportedly, Alipay has more than 600 million registered users in China and 200 million of financial institution partners. Therefore, the deal will help First Data to expanding its client base, increasing its top-line numbers.Also, the deal will allow Alipay to expand its reach across North America. With the ease of the online payment application, the merchants in the United States will also be able to serve the travellers from China in a better way.This new tie up is a follow on deal of First Data's previous partnership with Alipay that took place last year to deploy the payment platform at the Clover POS for four million U.S. business clients.Alipay is an online and mobile payment platform that allows customers in China to make payments for taxi rent, movie tickets, doctor fees, utility bills and many more by using the application.Coming to the price performance, the shares of First Data have returned 8.6% over a year, underperforming the  rally of 10%.We believe that the partnership will help First Data to gain momentum in its Global Business Solutions business. Alipay integrated into Clover POS is certainly helping the merchants to grow their business.First Data's merchant clients across North America are likely to increase with the rising demand for Alipay among the Chinese customers. Thus, the company's performance is likely to improve.Reportedly, businesses ranging from small merchants to large merchants who have deployed the app in their payment system are benefiting from the growing number of travellers from China to the United States.We believe First Data's business in North America will expand further with this deal as the U.S. is experiencing an upward trend in travellers from China. Per Curbed, there were 1.1 million travellers from China to the United States and they spent almost $1.6 billion on hotels, restaurants and other stores.According to Nielsen's latest report, over 90% of Chinese tourist would prefer mobile payment option while travelling abroad.Further, with Alipay, the company has entered the market of mobile and digital payments and in the U.S., total transaction value is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.1% between 2018 and 2022 as per the report from Statista.Over the past few years, strategic partnerships have played an important role in shaping First Data's growth trajectory.Recently, First Data joined partnership with RBL Bank which allows the bank to shift its credit card customers on the VisionPLUS platform.In late January 2018, the company also announced a partnership with SBI Card, a leading credit card issuer in India, which allows SBI Card to leverage VisionPLUS to enhance service offerings.Last quarter, the company also teamed up with AccorHotels Group which is benefiting its global and cross channel payments. | Currently, First Data carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Investors interested in the broader business service sector can consider WageWorks  , Global Finance Corporation  and Fiserv  .

(  ), a provider of financial services technology,  this month. 2017 was a fairly decent year for the company, with Q4 EPS marginally beating estimates. Overall, revenue for the company grew by 3.5% year-on-year to $53.6 billion, while the Diluted EPS increased from $4.15 in 2016 to $5.78 in 2017. The top line growth was driven by an expanding client base, and solid performance in card processing and account processing services.

Our EPS estimate for 2018 is around $6.20. Our  outlines the company's performance and the outlook for 2018, and you can modify key drivers and forecasts to see how changes would impact the company's results for this year.DNA is a real-time account processing platform, with an open architecture that allows it to be molded per client requirements. In 2017, DNA adoption grew by 30%. In 2018, we expect that Fiserv will engage with larger clients, as it did in Q4'17 by signing a deal with Sallie Mae. This, along with Agiliti, a cloud core banking service for the UK financial industry, will drive the Financial Segment Revenue to around $2.6 billion.Mobiliti ASP, which provides banking services on mobile devices, has more than 6.5 million users. With the acquisition of Monitise, Fiserv will be able to leverage FINkit which will further enhance its capabilities. Additionally, with the APAC region becoming more receptive to mobile payments, we expect Fiserv to secure more partnerships.What's behind Trefis?

The biggest growth is coming from Europe where $2.7 billion was raised by fintech companies in 2017, 121% higher than a year earlier.So, the answer is to invest in European-focused fintech businesses, right? Not so fast.Those numbers refer to VC-backed fintech companies. According to KPMGs Q4 2017 fintech report, $8.7 billion was invested in fintech on a global basis during the quarter and to over  for the entire year.Globally, there are 25 fintech unicorns (valuation > $1 billion) valued at $76 billion. Many of these are still are private but there ways to get in on the action via the public markets.Here are my ten fintech stocks to own for next ten years.The company's day job is helping banks and other financial institutions make that leap from physical to digital, a business model that's been so successful, its stock hasn't had a negative annual return since 2008.I recently  (NASDAQ:  ) one of seven stocks I thought were winning with technology. More specifically, it's the work the company is doing in fintech that stands out amongst its many positives.In 2016, Fiserv joined with several banks and other partners to start the INV fintech accelerator that promotes the development of financial services startups everywhere, not just in the tech hotbeds of Silicon Valley and New York.Innovation is a big part of Fiserv's DNA.\"As an experienced, hands-on, real-world resource to financial institutions, Fiserv is able to develop a fintech accelerator that's timely, relevant and productive,\"  Fiserv Senior Vice President Matt Wilcox in February 2016 on the company blog, The Point. \"Moreover, while operational demands may limit the resources financial institutions can dedicate to innovation initiatives, for Fiserv, innovation has always been a focus.\"When it comes to fintech, Fiserv is out in front leading the charge.If there's a segment of fintech that plays to the millennials, it would have to be the payments market. Younger people have grown up with the smartphone being the center of their universe and online payments have been an essential part of how they handle their financial matters.\"If you think about the under-30 generation, the millennial generation - GenTech, as I call them - they grew up with a screen in front of them. And so they think about everyday processes, like payments, differently than you and I do,\"  (NASDAQ:  ) CEO Dan Schulman  CNBCs Jim Cramer in November. \"The public-private boundaries are different than what you and I grew up with.\"Whether we're talking about Venmo, PayPal's mobile payment app, or PayPal itself, the market is big and getting bigger by the year.The person-to-person payment business is projected to reach $335 billion by 2022; it's currently around $35 billion. As for online digital payments, the market is around $3 trillion globally and expected to hit $8 trillion by 2020.PayPal is front and center in both these markets with 218 million people using its payments platform.Whatever the future brings in Fintech, I'm confident PayPal; will be a part of it.This next stock I had to put on the list because I've always had a fascination with special purpose acquisition companies (SPAC for short).Also referred to as a blind pool or blank-check company, the sponsors SPAC do an IPO to raise capital to be used to acquire an operating company within 24 months or the funds are returned to investors. (NASDAQ:  ) is one such company. In January 2017, it raised  in its IPO and an additional $4.2 million from a private placement with the sole purpose of acquiring a business operating in the fintech space.Less than a year later on December 19, 2019, FNTE announced that it would merge with Intermex Wire Transfer, LLC, a Florida-based wire transfer and financial processing solutions provider that operates primarily in the Southeastern U.S. for those wanting to send money to Latin America.Paying $99 million in cash and issuing $161 million in FNTE stock, Intermex's current management will continue to run the company and the FinTech Acquisition sponsors will step aside.The goal of Intermex is to continue to grow its business.

The company's products are used by more than  property and casualty firms around the world.Guidewire's core software products - Guidewire InsuranceSuite and Guidewire InsuranceNow - enable P&C companies to seamlessly operate their businesses across various stops along the insurance lifecycle.The company, like a lot of tech companies today, is moving from a perpetual and term sales approach to one where customers subscribe to the products and services they need on a monthly basis and are accessed from the cloud.\"This year our new cloud-based solutions received strong positive feedback, and we noted an increased willingness to consider cloud-based core systems as well,\"  Guidewire CEO Marcus Ryu in the company's Q1 2018 press release. \"As a result, today we expect our mix of sales to feature more subscriptions and fewer perpetual and term sales than our initial expectations for fiscal 2018.\"Profitable and growing, one only needs to look at what  (NASDAQ:  ) is doing in the cloud to know this is the right move for Guidewire.The insurance industry is historically one of the last segments in financial services to innovate giving the company a strong position in a niche area.It should pay off nicely for shareholders.Ever since my local farmers market started using some of the payment processing products from  (NYSE:  ), I've admired it from afar.True, I don't own the stock, nor do I own Twitter, the other company that Jack Dorsey runs, but if I had to pick one of these stocks to own, Square would hand's down be the winner.While Twitter has changed how we communicate with the world and express our opinions on subjects that are close to us, Square enables small businesses everywhere to set up shop and make a go of it.InvestorPlace's Nicolas Chahine recently discussed why he likes going long SQ stock and it's not your usual reason like earnings or revenue growth but has everything to do with fintech.\"Going long SQ stock has been my way of trading bitcoin without exposing myself to its volatility,\"  Chahine February 28. \"Yes, SQ does move in sympathy with BTC but to a degree and then it rejoins its sector trends.\"Interestingly, Square and Twitter are almost in the same financial position, transition from a money loser to a money maker.I expect Dorsey to continue to do a good job growing Square's business while remaining cautiously optimistic about the future.As Chahine says, Square gives you fintech with a little less risk. (NASDAQ:  ) was the original fintech company when it introduced its Quicken and Quickbooks accounting and tax software and then transitioned everything online.Now, it seems, it's going to go up against Square in the lending business.In November, Intuit announced that it was creating QuickBooks Capital, a lending platform for businesses using its bookkeeping software, which will make available short-term loans of up to $35,000 over terms of three and six months.While people like Square already do this, Intuit is using data analytics combined with artificial intelligence to more quickly establish a businesses creditworthiness through the analysis of their finances.\"We give small businesses the ability to get credit for future profits by looking at things such as open invoices,\" Rania Succar, head of QuickBooks Capital  CNBC. \"Using machine learning, we're able to predict when those invoices are likely to be paid, thereby providing an extremely detailed picture of a business' cash flow.\"Who says you can't teach an old dog new tricks?Global X offers some of the most unique ETFs in the ETF marketplace.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 14 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Fiserv Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $120.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $161.00. The standard deviation is $13.591.But the whole reason to look at the  FISV price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.

These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photoIn early trading on Thursday, shares of Fiserv (  ) topped the list of the day's best performing components of the Nasdaq 100 index, trading up 6.3%.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the FISV options chain for the new April 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $135.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.40. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $135.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $133.60 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of FISV, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $143.09/share today.Because the $135.00 strike represents an approximate 6% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["For the details of LORING WOLCOTT & COOLIDGE FIDUCIARY ADVISORS LLP's stock buys and sells, go to http://www.gurufocus.com/StockBuy.php?GuruName=LORING+WOLCOTT+%26+COOLIDGE+FIDUCIARY+ADVISORS+LLPLoring Wolcott & Coolidge Fiduciary Advisors Llp initiated holdings in iShares Core S&P 500.

However, it improved 10.2% from the year-ago quarter. Notably, the company has beaten the Zack Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 0.89%.Total revenue increased approximately 1.7% year over year to $1.39 billion but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.42 billion.Notably, shares of Fiserv have gained 20.7% year to date, significantly underperforming the  31.8% rally.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Fiserv holds a dominant position in the financial and payment solutions business backed by a broad customer base and key contract wins. We believe product-oriented acquisitions will drive growth for the company.Reportedly, in the third quarter, Fiserv completed the acquisitions of Monitise, PCLender and Dovetail Group.Moreover, Fiserv's focus on expanding its product portfolio is also a positive. We believe the company's launch of products like Prologue Credit Loss Manager, Instant Issue Advantage and Integrator Advance in the September quarter to have led to a steady flow of customers.Further, Fiserv's digital banking solutions are gaining momentum among the financial institutions. The company announced in August that its Statement Advantage solution has been selected by about 600 banks and credit unions.However, we note that lower termination fees, EMV deferral and adverse foreign currency translations are negatively impacting the company's sales.Moreover, increasing regulations in the banking and financial services industry and intensifying competition from the likes of Equifax Inc.  and Fidelity National Information Services Inc.  remain concerns. Given the attractive prospects in the financial services market, there are always new entrants who seek to leverage on shifts in technology or product innovation to attract customers.Fiserv's policy of acquiring a large number of companies results in some integration risk. The company's highly leveraged balance sheet will continue to weigh on its profitability. | According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

While the industry gained 21.9%, the stock yielded a return of just 20%.Total revenues in the third quarter came in at $562.6 million, up 45.5% from the year-ago quarter. Excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements, consolidated operating revenues increased 43.6% year over year to $524.8 million, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $511 million. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to synergies from Boston Financial Data Services (\"BFDS\") and International Financial Data Services U.K. (\"IFDS U.K.\") acquisitions.In first-quarter 2017, DST changed reportable segment structure, which splits the previously reported Financial Services segment, into two new segments, Domestic Financial Services and International Financial Services. The Healthcare Services segment remains unchanged.Domestic Financial Services operating revenues (excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements) rose 23.4% year over year and came in at $305.3 million. Benefits from businesses acquired from BFDS in 2017 and increased revenues from organic growth along with positive market movement at ALPS positively impacted the segment.International Financial Services Segment increased from $26.9 million reported in the year-ago quarter to $129.4 million, primarily owing to synergies from IFDS U.K acquisition.Healthcare Services operating revenues were down 1.8% on a year-over-year basis and came in at $104.2 million, primarily due client migrations.Total cost and expenses soared 63% from the year-ago quarter to $472.1 million. Also, as a percentage of revenues, costs and expenses increased from 79.2% to 89.9%.Non-GAAP operating income decreased 1.5% year over year and came in at $72.5 million, primarily due to higher stock compensation expenses.

Long-term debt (including current portion) was $644.8 million compared with $645.4 million in the previous quarter.During the third quarter, DST Systems repurchased roughly 1.2 million shares worth $75 million. The company has $225 million shares remaining under the current share repurchase program.Additionally, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of 18 cents per share.DST Systems reported stellar third-quarter results. Further, revenues grew year over year, primarily due to BFDS and IFDS acquisitions.We believe that DST Systems' business volume and massive scale of operation in Financial Services will attract new customers. Moreover, we expect steady contributions from acquisitions to support revenue growth. Continued share buybacks and dividend payments are the other encouraging factors.However, persistent decline in registered accounts, ongoing consolidation in the U.S. financial services market and stiff competition from International Business Machines Corporation  and Fiserv Inc.  might put its fundamentals under pressure.

However, Cavendish Asset Management, which owned almost 4.84% of stake, considered the offer too low.Last month, Fiserv sweetened the offer to \u00a375 million ($98 million) or 3.1 pence in cash, representing a premium of 34.8% more than Monitise's closing price on Jun 12, per Reuters.

Moreover, Monitise has significant geographic penetration into European and Middle-East markets, which was a major attraction for Fiserv.Currently, Fiserv has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

As customers can immediately start using these cards, engagement and satisfaction levels are anticipated to improve.This is significant for banks as delay in card issuance as well as activation can result in customer loss. Customer retention has become a major concern for banks amid intense competition from fintechs and traditional retailers offering disruptive financial services.We believe that instant issuance and activations of cards can act as a differentiator in this regard. The instant service will help in establishing banks as the primary financial institutions as compared with the aforesaid organizations, whose offerings are primarily online based. They are also not well-equipped to issue instantly activated cards due to the regulatory and certification process and PCI compliance procedures.Moreover, per Fiserv, the Consumer Preferences research highlights the gap between people receiving their cards and activating them. Only 63% of consumers activated their debit card the day it arrived in the mail. This habit significantly hurts interchange revenues, which can be improved through in-branch issuance and activation.Additionally, Fiserv's expertise in effectively addressing challenges - primarily fraud - which banks and financial institutions face in case of instantly issued cards is a game changer. The adoption of company's solution will mitigate risks related to issuance and activation of instant cards.Fiserv remains focused on expanding its product portfolio. The company recently launched Integrator Advance that offers multiple tools, including research-based segmentation, cross-sell intelligence, campaign management and reporting in a single platform. | Moreover, the company commands a leading position in the financial and payment solutions business backed by a broad customer base and key contract wins.

The company had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire ID Watchdog on Jun 16, 2017.Per the agreement, Equifax will pay approximately $63 million in cash, which translates to nearly 40 cents per share, to acquire all outstanding shares of ID Watchdog. The buyout is aimed to provide a boost to Equifax's capabilities to serve customers better.Founded in 2005, ID Watchdog is one of the leading providers of identity theft protection and resolution services to the Employee Benefits marketplace. The acquisition is anticipated to further strengthen Equifax's identity theft protection services and fortify its presence in the employee benefits space.According to Dann Adams, President of Global Consumer Solutions at Equifax, \"\"We are excited to have ID Watchdog's industry leading products become an important part of our organization.\" Adams further added, \"Merging our Identity solutions and industry relationships will significantly increase the access, range, and depth of our employee benefits solutions.\"Equifax is the world's largest data management company which organizes and assimilates data related to more than 820 million customers, and 91 million businesses globally.The company has made strategic acquisitions to supplement its core business. In 2014, the company acquired TDX Group and Forseva, while it closed the Veda Group Limited buyout in first-quarter 2016.We believe that management's efforts, such as strategic initiatives for product innovation, expansion of data assets through acquisitions and continuous share gains in North America, should act as tailwinds. Moreover, the company's strong correlation with the consumer and financial markets, as well as exposure in the U.S. and Europe are likely to propel growth, moving ahead.However, we foresee the company's investments in new initiatives to weigh on its upcoming quarterly earnings. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding IT spending and the strengthening U.S. dollar remain concerns.Moreover, increasing competition from the likes of Fiserv  , Automatic Data Processing Inc  and Total System Services  are other factors likely to affect earnings in the near term.Since 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars.But here's something even more remarkable: You can master this proven system without going to a single class or seminar.

Results reflected strong operating performance at both its Consumer and Commercial Insurance segments, favorable alternative investment return and lower-than-expected catastrophe losses.The company, however, does not have an impressive surprise history. Although it beat estimates in two of the last four quarters and missed in two, it witnessed an average negative surprise of 4.85%. This is depicted in the graph below: | Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We expect performance at its Commercial Lines segment to remain stressed. Net premium written in the segment decreased 25% in 2016 and the decline continued in the first quarter. Given that the company has exited some of its casualty lines business, we expect the top line to remain under pressure over the coming quarters. The effect of the same will be seen in the to-be reported quarter.The company's Individual Retirement business is weighed down by uncertainty stemming from the Department Of Labor's fiduciary rule and lower fixed annuity sales due to the prevailing low interest rate environment. This resulted in lower sales in the past several quarters. Though the company has undertaken remedial measures such as making changes to product pricing, product features and asset quality, we don't expect much improvement in sales in the upcoming release.In its Life Insurance business, recently, the company introduced a new administrative platform and digital capabilities, revamped its product suite, and substantially exited its U.S. life career distribution channel, service agent channel, and subscale group benefits business. These steps were undertaken to enhance ROE from this line of business. The efforts paid off as evident by an increase in life insurance sales in the first quarter as we expect to see further sales growth in the second quarter.Management's efforts toward saving costs will accrue to its bottom line. In 2016, the company was ahead of its expense reduction target of $1.4 billion and decreased the same by over $1 billion or 10%. In the first quarter, its general operating and other expenses declined 18.6%. We expect to see a moderation in expenses in the to-be reported quarter.The company is also aggressively buying back shares in sync with its capital return target of $25 billion. In the first quarter, the company committed $7 billion of capital for share buyback and dividend for rest of the year. We believe substantial repurchase of shares will aid the company's bottom line.We also expect to see an improvement in return on equity driven by the company's continued active capital management and operating improvement.Our proven model does not conclusively show that AIG is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below. AIG has an Earning ESP of -0.83%.

Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model.CA has also adopted a \"go to market\" sales strategy. This brings together all the commercial functions including sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight. The integration of the marketing functions helps to lower costs, consequently improving the bottom line.Apart from pursuing growth through acquisitions, the company is leveraging cloud computing to enable organizations to source the best components - internal, external, private cloud, public cloud, mobile and more - to construct the most competitive business applications without wasting much time and resource.Further, the company is focused on providing advanced management and security software required by organizations to take complete advantage of this evolution.Here are some other companies you may consider as our proven model shows they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Fiserv, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +1.63%.

Apple's revenues will continue to be driven by the fast growing \"Services\" segment as well the sales (albeit slowing down) of iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Services include revenues from App store, Apple Music and Apple Pay.Investors are more interested in the second half of fiscal 2017. This is because Apple will be launching its mega edition, iPhone 8, around September.iPhone 8 is set to be launched to mark the tenth anniversary of the revolutionary iPhone. It is reported to have amazing features like a glass body, a dual-curved edge-to-edge OLED display with a built-in Touch ID sensor and wireless charging. iPhone 8 is already dubbed a \"super cycle\". However, there are rumors that the launch might be delayed, which could mar its September-ending quarter results.Meanwhile, the company remains focused on finding newer growth avenues. It is also working on developing technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and augmented reality/ virtual reality (AR/VR), which are fast emerging as lucrative business opportunities. The company's interest in the autonomous car project is understandable as it is now being labeled as a big business opportunity. Apple also remains focused on increasing its market share in India.Over the past one year, the stock has registered growth of 44.3% compared with the  gain of 43.7%.Despite these, Apple continues to face a plethora of challenges. Competition from local players has been hindering iPhone growth in China. In the last reported quarter, owing to persistent macroeconomic weakness, Apple revenues declined around 14% year over year in the Greater China region to $10.7 billion.For third-quarter fiscal 2017, Apple forecasts revenues in a range of $43.5-$45.5 billion. Gross margin is expected within 37.5-38.5%, while operating expenses are projected within $6.6-$6.7 billion.

Excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements, consolidated operating revenues increased 68.3% year over year to $629.4 million, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $541 million.According to Steve Hooley, Chairman, CEO and President of DST, \"\"Our second quarter results demonstrate execution on our organic growth initiatives and reflect the value potential of our acquisitions of Boston Financial Data Services, Inc. (\"BFDS\") and International Financial Data Services Limited (\"IFDS U.K.\").\"In first-quarter 2017, DST changed its reportable segment structure, which splits the previously reported Financial Services segment, into two new segments, Domestic Financial Services and International Financial Services. The Healthcare Services segment remains unchanged.Domestic Financial Services operating revenues (excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements) rose 22.9% year over year and came in at $312 million. Benefits from businesses acquired from BFDS in 2017 and increased revenues from organic growth along with positive market movement at ALPS positively impacted the segment.International Financial Services Segment increased from $31.2 million reported in the year-ago quarter to $231.1 million, primarily due to synergies from IFDS U.K acquisition.Healthcare Services operating revenues were down 2.6% on a year-over-year basis and came in at $101.3 million, primarily due client migrations, reductions in membership and decline in healthcare technology spending resulting from changes in government policy.Total cost and expenses soared 63.9% from the year-ago quarter to $525.2 million. Also, as a percentage of revenues, costs and expenses were up 230 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 83.4%.Non-GAAP operating income increased 11% year over year and came in at $76.5 million, primarily due to the acquisition of BFDS in 2017. Operating margin was however down 620 bps on a year-over-year basis to 12.2%, primarily due to higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.DST Systems reported non-GAAP net income of $47.3 million compared with $47.6 million reported in the year-ago quarter.The company exited the quarter with $139.1 million in cash and equivalents compared with $260.4 million in the previous quarter. Long-term debt (including current portion) was $645.4 million compared with $730.7 million in the previous quarter.During the second quarter, DST Systems repurchased roughly 1.2 million shares worth $75 million which exhausted the previous $300 million share-repurchase plan. Furthermore, in May 2017, the company authorised a new $300 million share repurchase program.Additionally, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of 18 cents per share (an increase of 3% quarter-over-quarter).DST Systems announced the completion of the acquisition of State Street's ownership interest in both Boston Financial Data Services, Inc. and International Financial Data Services Limited. According to Steve Hooley, Chairman and CEO of DST, \"We are confident that the single-operator model for these businesses will allow us to significantly enhance our clients' experience and improve the execution of our long-term growth strategy.\"DST Systems reported mixed second-quarter results, wherein earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues surpassed the same. However, both revenues and earnings grew year over year.We are still of the opinion that DST Systems' business volume and massive scale of operation in Financial Services will attract new customers. Moreover, we expect steady contributions from acquisitions to support revenue growth. Continued share buybacks and dividend payments are the other encouraging factors.However, persistent decline in registered accounts, ongoing consolidation in the U.S. financial services market and stiff competition from International Business Machines Corporation  and Fiserv Inc.  might put its fundamentals under pressure. Moreover, a high debt burden remains a major concern.Currently, DST Systems carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Another top-ranked stock worth considering in the broader technology industry is Applied Optoelectronics, Inc.  , which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  .Applied Optoelectronics has an expected long-term EPS growth rate of 18.75%.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

The company's adjusted earnings (excluding amortization expenses, Veda Group acquisition-related charges and other one-time items) per share from continuing operations of $1.60 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.57 and also jumped 11.9% year over year.On a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings of $1.36 per share, up from the year-ago quarter tally of $1.08 per share. The strong year-over-year bottom-line growth can primarily be attributed to solid top-line performance and stringent cost management, which was partially offset by a marginal increase in the number of total outstanding shares.Notably, the stock's share movement has compared unfavorably with the  in the past one-year period. Equifax returned 9.5% while the industry gained 22.6%.Equifax's revenues of $856.7 million lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $861 million as well as management's guided range of $857-$862 million. However, the figure was up 6% on a year-over-year basis.According to Richard F. Smith, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Equifax, \"Second quarter performance reflects outstanding execution by the team and the strength of our unique portfolio of businesses.\"The company made slight changes in its reportable segments from first-quarter 2016. The U.S. Information Solutions (USIS) and Workforce Solutions remained unchanged, while Personal Solutions was renamed to Global Consumer Solutions.Segment wise, total USIS revenues were up 8% year over year to $331.9 million. Among its sub-segments, growth was recorded in Online Information Solutions (6%), Mortgage Solutions Services (10%) and Financial Marketing Services (15%).International revenues (including Europe, the Asia Pacific, Canada and Latin America) advanced 6% year over year to $231.4 million. On a constant-currency basis, revenues increased 10%. Growth was mainly driven by the Veda Group acquisition, which increased the Asia-Pacific region's contribution to revenues to $76.5 million, up 6% year over year. Moreover, revenues registered an increase of 13%, 4% and 2% in Latin America, Canada and Europe, respectively.Revenues from the Workforce Solutions segment climbed 10% year over year to $194.5 million, primarily on the back of 19% revenue growth in Verification Services, which more-than offset 5% decline in Employer Services.Global Consumer Solutions contributed $98.9 million to total revenue, reflecting an 8% year-over-year decline. On a constant-currency basis, revenues dropped 7%.Equifax's adjusted EBITDA increased approximately 13% to $334.7 million. Consequently, adjusted operating EBITDA margin expanded 250 basis points (bps) to 39.1%. Adjusted net income came in at $194.8 million or $1.60 per share compared with $172.7 million or $1.43 per share reported a year ago.Equifax exited the quarter with $403.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, up from the previous quarter's balance of $123.2 million. Total long-term debt (excluding current portion) was $2.04 billion, flat quarter over quarter. During six months ended Jun 30, 2017, Equifax generated cash flow of $329.1 million from operational activities. The company paid 39 cents per share as dividends in the second quarter.For the quarter, Equifax projects revenues in a range of $853-$861 million (mid-point: $857 million), while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $855 million. Adjusted earnings per share are projected to be between $1.50 and $1.54 (midpoint: $1.52). The earnings guidance range at its mid-point is slightly lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.53.Furthermore, Equifax updated full-year 2017 outlook. The company now expects revenues in the range of $3.395-$3.425 billion (previous guidance $3.375-$3.425 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.41 billion. Adjusted earnings per share are now anticipated to be between $6.02 and $6.10 (previous guidance $5.96 and $6.10). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $6.06.Equifax posted mixed results for the second quarter. However, earnings and revenues both recorded year-over-year growth. The company also updated outlook for full-year 2017.We believe that management's efforts, such as strategic initiatives for product innovation, expansion of data assets through acquisitions and continuous share gains in America, should act as tailwinds. Further, the company's strong correlation with the consumer and financial markets, along with exposure in the U.S. and Europe are likely to propel growth, moving ahead.However, we expect the company's investments in new initiatives to weigh on its upcoming quarterly earnings. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding IT spending and the strengthening U.S. dollar are concerns.

The company exceeded earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters with an average positive surprise of 0.85%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Aflac has huge exposure to the life insurance business in Japan and has thus been suffering from a persistent low interest rate in the region. The same is expected to have impacted earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.Nevertheless, sales from this segment will benefit from an increase in third-sector sales given the company's emphasis on promoting these products which are less interest rate sensitive and carry strong and stable margins.Also, the introduction of third-sector products such as a cancer insurance product early last year, revised EVER and get products in the first quarter have been well received in the market place and will contribute to top-line growth.On the other hand, the company's efforts in pulling out first-sector products and repricing other products in this category to fight the prolonged low interest rate environment may continue to restrict their sales..In its U.S. business segment, we expect to see improved persistency, which in turn should support premium growth. The segment's expense ratio is expected to remain high due to investments in a certain platform, including group administrative platform, enrollment platform and related technology.However, the company's continuous efforts to return capital to its shareholders via share buyback will cushion its bottom line.The company will, however, incur high cost on account of its Japan branch conversion. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Aflac is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

It should be noted that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings.Conversely, stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Fiserv's Zacks Rank #2 and a positive ESP make us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. | Fiserv holds a dominant position in the financial and payment solutions business backed by a broad customer base and key contract wins. Additionally, strong user base of Mobiliti ASP is a key driver. Moreover, Fiserv remains focused on expanding its product portfolio and thus product-oriented acquisitions are leading to a steady flow of customers.In May 2017, First National Bank of Pandora and Apple Creek Bank chose Fiserv as their new technology partner. The company is also rapidly expanding in the overseas markets. In recent times, Fiserv's offerings like Signature core account processing platform and DigitalAccess have been selected by BDO Unibank - the largest bank in Philippines - and Australia-based Bank of Sydney, respectively.We note that across Asia-Pacific, Fiserv supports approximately 68 clients in 13 countries, including some of the largest banks in Australia, Thailand and Indonesia.In Jun 2017, Affinity Plus Federal Credit Union chose to implement the company's Architect Digital Banking and Payments Platform Solution.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 10 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Fiserv Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $104.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $146.25. The standard deviation is $13.053.But the whole reason to look at the  FISV price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with FISV crossing above that average target price of $123.62/share, investors in FISV have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $123.62 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Fiserv Inc:\n  \nThe average rating presented in the last row of the above table above is from 1 to 5 where 1 is Strong Buy and 5 is Strong Sell.

The acquisition, which is anticipated to close in third-quarter 2017, is aimed at boosting Equifax's capabilities to serve its customers better.Per the agreement, Equifax will pay approximately $63.34 million in cash, which translates to nearly 40 cents per share, to acquire all outstanding shares of ID Watchdog. The purchase price is approximately 77% premium to ID Watchdog's shares closing price on Jun 15.Founded in 2005, ID Watchdog is one of the leading providers of identity theft protection and resolution services to the Employee Benefits marketplace. Per the company, it \"leverages proprietary technology that searches billions of data points to detect changes in the personal identity profiles of each subscriber and provides immediate resolution services.\"The acquisition is anticipated to further strengthen Equifax's identity theft protection services and fortify its presence in the employee benefits space.Equifax is the world's largest data management company which organizes and assimilates data related to more than 820 million customers, and 91 million businesses globally.Equifax has made strategic acquisitions to supplement its core business. In 2014, the company acquired TDX Group and Forseva, while it closed the Veda Group Limited buyout in first-quarter 2016.Notably, the stock movement has been impressive when compared with the Zacks categorized  industry in the year-to-date period. Equifax gained 20.5% during the period compared with the industry's return of 16.6%.We believe that management's efforts, such as strategic initiatives for product innovation, expansion of data assets through acquisitions and continuous share gains in North America, should act as tailwinds. Also, the company's strong correlation with the consumer and financial markets, as well as exposure in the U.S. and Europe are likely to propel growth, moving ahead.However, we foresee the company's investments in new initiatives to weigh on its upcoming quarterly earnings. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding IT spending and the strengthening U.S. dollar are a few concerns. Moreover, increasing competition from the likes of Fiserv  and Total System Services  are other factors likely to affect earnings in the near term.Currently, Equifax carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the Financial Transaction Services space is Visa Inc.  , which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Cavendish Asset Management, which owns almost 4.84% stake per Reuters, stated that Fiserv's offer of \u00a370 million (almost $89.35) was too low.Fiserv's offer of 2.9 pence in cash per share represented a premium of 26.1% as compared with Monitise's closing share price of 2.30 pence on Jun 12. According to Reuters, Monitise had considered the terms to be \"fair and reasonable\" at the time of announcement.Following the acquisition news, Montise's share price surged almost 22.2% to close at 2.81 pence on Jun 13. The share price momentum continued over the next two trading sessions and closed at 2.84 pence on Jun 15. Even when compared with this level, Fiserv's offer price still presents a premium of 2.1%.We note that Fiserv's share price inched up 0.7% to close at $125.47 on Jun 15. The stock has return 18.1% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the S&P 500's gained of 9.3%.Monitise is a top brand in the digital banking arena due to its robust product portfolio and strong clientele. Moreover, the company has significant geographic penetration into European and Middle-East markets. These factors were a major attraction for Fiserv.Per Reuters, Monitise was worth \u00a32 billion at its peak in 2014. However, the company lost most of the valuation due to weak execution and stiff competition from free mobile payment solutions provided well established players like Alphabet  and Apple  .Notably, revenues plunged almost 25% over fiscal 2015 to \u00a367.7 million in fiscal 2016 primarily due to these factors. The first half of 2017 also didn't get any better, as revenues continued to decline (down 15.6%). However, EBITDA decline moderated reflecting positive impact from restructuring, which resulted in lower operating expenses.We note that management has been trying to reinvigorate the business in recent times. The company relaunched Create platform as Big Radical, gaining a number of customers in first-half fiscal 2017.Moreover, Monitise's cloud-based FINKit platform (focused on the U.S. and U.K. market) has gained significant interest within a short-span of time since its launch in fiscal 2016. The company stated that the platform has significant growth opportunities owing to increasing regulatory requirements related to compliance and digital banking.We believe that if the acquisition proceeds as planned, it will significantly boost Fiserv's capabilities in providing mobile payments solutions globally. This market has immense growth opportunities, according to Visa  , which believes that by 2020 \"  .\" | Per data from epam, the market for mobile payments is anticipated to be worth $720 billion in 2017, a significant increase from $235 billion in 2014.According to Juniper Research, number of people using a mobile device to conduct some form of banking (either account management or payments) is expected to reach 2 billion in 2018, which is almost 38% of the population. This reflects the growing importance of mobile banking, which is simply hard to ignore for banks and financial service providers like Fiserv.Considering Monitise's robust product portfolio and growth potential we believe that the current valuation is quite cheap, making it an attractive investment. This along with the shareholder activism may prompt Fiserv to raise its offer price going forward.Currently, Fiserv carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

We also note that solutions like Notifi, Architect, Premier, and Precision platforms are not only aiding it to win new customers but also expanding relationship with the existing ones.Moreover, recent acquisitions like British financial services technology firm Monitise Plc and Online Banking Solutions (OBS) will help it to fast penetrate the mobile and digital as well as commercial banking arena.

Another acquisition - Architect digital banking solution - has gained significant traction (14 clients at the end of first-quarter) within a short span of time.

The agreement aims at enhancing Equifax's capabilities to serve its customers better.Per the agreement, the companies will introduce a business valuation tool (BizEstimate Score) that will \"help financial professionals prospect more effectively and small business owners better understand their business worth\".BizEquity's patented cloud-based service is being used by several small business houses to better understand and address their insurance, wealth management, and lending needs and potential.As part of the expanded arrangement, Equifax will offer BizEquity a new leading indicator, Equifax Marketing Data Services (MDS). BizEquity has covered the valuation up to 143 million private businesses so far.Equifax claims that the new valuation tool will enable financial professionals provide real-time information to businesses about their current valuation as well as their performance. Also, it will help in determining further lending, insurance and wealth management opportunities. However, compared with traditional business valuation methods, the new offering will only take a fraction of time, thereby saving both time and effort for financial professionals.According to Scott Wagner, senior vice president at Equifax, \"Our MDS file has helped hundreds of financial and commercial institutions better market their product and services to business leaders and owners.\" He added, \"The addition of the BizEstimate model and attribute will help the clients we serve by providing a forward indicator of risk and revenue opportunities.\"Customers are now looking for solutions to streamline data collection capabilities. We believe that by leveraging BizEquity's services, Equifax will be able to offer better data, technology and advisory solutions, besides being positioned as a leader in important markets.We also believe that the agreement will benefit the company by expanding its customer base and boosting its top-line performance.Notably, Equifax's international revenues (including Europe, the Asia-Pacific, Canada and Latin America) surged 37% year over year to $216.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. On a constant-currency basis, revenues soared 41%. Growth was mainly driven by the Veda Group acquisition, which increased the Asia-Pacific region's contribution to revenues to $72 million from $27.6 million. Moreover, revenues increased 20%, 15% and 2% in Latin America, Canada and Europe, respectively.We believe that management's efforts, such as strategic initiatives for product innovation, expansion of data assets through acquisitions and continuous share gains in North America, should act as tailwinds. Also, the company's strong correlation with the consumer and financial markets, and exposure in the U.S. and Europe are likely to propel growth, moving ahead.However, we expect the company's investments in new initiatives to weigh on its upcoming quarterly earnings. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding IT spending and the strengthening U.S. dollar are a few concerns. Moreover, increasing competition from the likes of Fiserv  and Total System Services  are the other factors likely to affect earnings in the near term.Notably, the stock movement has been disappointing when compared with the Zacks categorized  industry in the last one year.

DST Systems' non-GAAP earnings also registered a year-over-year increase of 28.3%, primarily driven by higher revenues, effective cost management and lower share count.Total revenue in the first quarter came in at $405.5 million, up 6.5% from the year-ago quarter. Excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements, consolidated operating revenues increased 5.1% year over year to $379.7 million, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $373 million.In first-quarter 2017, DST changed its reportable segment structure, which splits the previously reported Financial Services segment, into two new segments, Domestic Financial Services and International Financial Services. The Healthcare Services segment remains unchanged.Domestic Financial Services operating revenues (excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements) were up 3.1% year over year and came in at $254 million. Benefits from businesses acquired from KRFS and BFDS in 2017 and increased revenues from organic growth and positive market movement at ALPS coupled with new client growth positively impacted the segment.International Financial Services Segment went up 34.9% to $32.8 million, primarily due to synergies from IFDS U.K acquisition.Healthcare Services operating revenues were up 3.4% on a year-over-year basis and came in at $107.7 million, primarily due to expansion in high-value services for medical and pharmacy businesses, new medical claims, and organic growth.Total cost and expenses were up 6.4% from the year-ago quarter to $326.4 million. Also, as a percentage of revenues, costs and expenses were up 100 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 85.9%.Non-GAAP operating income increased 12.1% year over year and came in at $66.6 million. Operating margin was also up 110 bps on a year-over-year basis to 17.5%. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by cost-cutting measures within the Domestic Financial Services segment and growth in the Healthcare Services segment.DST reported non-GAAP net income of $46.5 million compared with $38.7 million reported in the year-ago quarter.The company exited the quarter with $260.4 million in cash and equivalents compared with $195.5 million in the previous quarter. Long-term debt (including current portion) was $730.7 million compared with $508.2 million in the previous quarter.During the first quarter, DST Systems repurchased roughly 0.666 million shares worth $75 million. Furthermore, during April 2017, the company repurchased $75 million worth of its common stock which exhausted the existing share-repurchase plan.DST Systems announced the completion of the acquisition of State Street's ownership interest in both Boston Financial Data Services, Inc.

Moreover, both revenues and earnings grew year over year.We are still of the opinion that DST Systems' business volume and massive scale of operation in Financial Services will attract new customers. Moreover, we expect steady contributions from acquisitions to support revenue growth. Continued share buybacks and dividend payments are the other encouraging factors.However, persistent decline in registered accounts, ongoing consolidation in the U.S. financial services market and stiff competition from International Business Machines Corporation  and Fiserv Inc.  might put its fundamentals under pressure. Moreover, a high debt burden remains a major concern for the company.The stock price underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry over the past one year.

The strong year-over-year bottom-line growth was mainly stemmed by solid top-line performance and stringent cost management, which was partially offset by a marginal increase in the number of total outstanding shares.Despite this, shares dropped over 4% in the after-hour trade as the company's second-quarter revenue guidance fell short of analysts' estimates. Notably, the stock's share movement has been almost in line with the Zacks categorized  industry in the past one-year period. Equifax gained 16.9% during the said period compared with the industry's return of 16%.Equifax's revenues of $832.2 million came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $825 million as well as management's guided range of $822-$826 million (mid-point $824 million).

On a constant-currency basis, revenues soared 41%. Growth was mainly driven by the Veda Group acquisition, which increased the Asia-Pacific region's contribution to revenues to $72 million from $27.6 million. Moreover, revenues registered an increase of 20%, 15% and 2% in Latin America, Canada and Europe, respectively.Revenues from the Workforce Solutions segment climbed 11% year over year to $200 million, primarily on the back of 16% revenue growth in Verification Services and 5% in Employer Services.Global Consumer Solutions contributed $105.9 million to total revenue, reflecting an 11% year-over-year jump.Equifax's adjusted operating income increased approximately 22.7% to $273.2 million.

Adjusted earnings per share are projected to be between $1.55 and $1.58 (midpoint: $1.565). The earnings guidance range at its mid-point is also lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.58.Furthermore, Equifax reiterated its full-year 2017 outlook. The company continues to expect revenues in the range of $3.375-$3.425 billion (mid-point $3.40 billion). The revenue outlook at the mid-point is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.39 billion. Adjusted earnings per share are still anticipated to be between $5.96 and $6.10 (midpoint: $6.03). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $6.06.Equifax posted better-than-expected results for the first quarter. Earnings and revenues both recorded year-over-year growth. However, the company provided a soft outlook for the second quarter.Nonetheless, we believe that management's efforts, such as strategic initiatives for product innovation, expansion of data assets through acquisitions and continuous share gains in North America, should act as tailwinds.

It offers tools for software developers consisting of FishEye, Bamboo and SourceTree.During the quarter, the company acquired Trello, a cloud collaboration services provider that has more than 19 million users. The acquisition has not only strengthened Atlassian's leadership position, but also enhanced its client base, which, we expect, will drive the company's top- and bottom-line performances over the long run. We anticipate benefits of the acquisition to be reflected in the to-be-reported quarter results.Furthermore, we believe that continuous investments in product development (mainly the launch of three purpose-built versions of JIRA products) and a significant number of customers on an active subscription or maintenance agreement are a few of the positives, which may drive the fiscal third-quarter results.Nonetheless, a volatile spending atmosphere and competition from other privately held players in the space such as Dynport and PBworks remain concerns. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Atlassian is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in its upcoming release.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Fiserv's first-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $1.25 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.18 and improved 17.9% from the year-ago quarter.Total revenue increased approximately 4.7% year over year to $1.394 billion and also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.393 billion.

Notably, Check Point Software outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice, while matching the same once, over the trailing four quarters. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 6.02%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We believe that Check Point Software will continue to benefit from strong demand for cybersecurity solutions. It should be noted that the financial well-being, brand image, and reputation of enterprises and governments are always exposed to the risk of cyber threats. Consequently, cybersecurity has become a mission-critical, high-profile requirement.With rapid technological advancement, organizations are increasingly adopting the \"bring your own device\" (BYOD) policy to enhance employee productivity with anytime/anywhere access. This trend, in turn, calls for stricter data security measures.Moreover, various independent research firms had forecast strong demand in 2017. Gartner had predicted that worldwide Information Security Spending would reach $90 billion in 2017, marking 7.6% growth from the 2016 level of approximately $83.6 billion.We believe that Check Point Software must have capitalized on this opportunity and anticipate that this might be well reflected in the company's results in the quarter to be reported.Furthermore, the rapid adoption of Check Point's data center appliances and the consistent enhancements in data center product lines are anticipated to provide adequate support to revenue growth. Additionally, the company's continuous share buybacks bode well for investors.However, competition from Cisco, Juniper Networks and Fortinet  , an uncertain economic environment and currency headwinds remain concerns. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Check Point Software will beat earnings estimates this quarter.

It has beaten estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average beat of 14%. Year to date, the stock has outperformed the Zacks  industry. It has gained 28.2% compared with the industry's gain of 22.2%.The company's earnings per share (EPS) and revenues exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues and earnings grew 23.5% and 46.2% year over year, respectively driven by strong demand in wafer fab equipment market and customer acceptance for the company's new products.At the call, management was found upbeat on KLA's technology leadership position and the pace of execution of a product strategy focused on innovation and differentiation. | We expect strong demand for more efficient manufacturing processes and the preference for mobile to work in favor of the company. The technical complexity of manufacturing semiconductors and increasingly challenging yield issues remain revenue drivers for this leading manufacturer of process control equipment.Note that since each system is high valued, customer concentration is obviated, which results in significant fluctuations in revenue/orders in times of uncertain demand.For the third quarter, KLA expects shipments of $850-$930 million, up 0.34% sequentially at the mid-point. Quarterly revenues are expected between $860 million and $920 million, reflecting an increase of 1.5% sequentially at the mid-point. Non-GAAP EPS is expected in a range of $1.42 to $1.62.KLA's comprehensive product line, cost reduction initiatives and strong balance sheet remain positives that will generate growth whenever cyclical pressure permits. Though competition and a concentrated customer base increase execution risk, accelerated process control spending across foundry, memory and logic players through 2017 and beyond will enable KLA to deliver stronger results.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Fiserv is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings-with the most up-to-date information possible-is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for FISV in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.19 per share for FISV, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.18 per share.

It has gained 18.7% compared with the industry's gain of 6.3%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcementAlthough MobileIron posted a loss in terms of the bottom line, the fourth quarter was the strongest ever in the company's history.

Its business is gaining strength both from new as well as existing customers. At the fourth-quarter call, management stated that the company's customer satisfaction scores and customer engagement scores were trending up.Given the fact that mobile threats are on the rise, MobileIron's Enterprise Mobile Management (EMM) platforms that enable a company to detect whether a device or an app is being compromised and enables them to take the required corrective action bodes well.Also, MobileIron Access, the facilitator between the mobile app and cloud service,s could see greater adoption, given the growing demand for cloud. Further, we believe that strong renewal rates in the Software Support and Services segment augur well. | For the first-quarter, management expects first-quarter 2017 revenues to remain in the range of $41 million to $43 million. Gross billings are projected in the range of $44 million to $46 million, registering growth of 16% to 21% on a year-over-year basis.Non-GAAP gross margin is expected in the range of 81% to 83%.

Therefore, in Amazon's case, its Zacks Rank #3 and an  of +10.68% seems to indicate a positive surprise this quarter. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .Amazon's earnings surprise history has been impressive with the company beating estimates in three of the last four quarters with an average beat of 25.7%. In the last one year, the stock outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry. It gained 43.4% compared with the industry's gain of 40%.Amazon's fourth-quarter 2016 earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate but missed on revenues. Though the highest-margin Amazon Web Services (AWS) business was up 9.4% sequentially and a massive 47% year over year, its revenue share was around 8%. The North America segment accounted for around 60% of sales, representing a sequential and year-over-year increase of 39% and 22%, respectively. The International segment accounted for 32%, up 31.6% sequentially and 17.9% year over year. This resulted in a positive mix of business and contributed to Amazon's increased profitability.Amazon generated fourth quarter net income of $749 million, or 1.7% of sales, compared with $252 million, or 0.8% in the previous quarter and $500 million, or 1.3% of sales in the same quarter last year. |  It's a multi-billion-dollar business and the cash cow for Amazon. It has millions of customers and generates much higher margins than retail. It is the key driver of Amazon's profitability.We remain optimistic about the functionality, partner ecosystem and the experience AWS offers and believe this will lead to continued customer wins. If AWS continues to witness the same kind of success, investors can hope for significant growth this time as well. Amazon's retail business remains very hard to beat on price, choice, convenience, you name it. The company has a solid loyalty system in Prime and its FBA strategy, and content addition continues to add selection to Prime memberships. It is focused on building video content, primarily for Prime subscribers because the growth prospects in that market are considerable.Prime is now widely available and generates increased sales for Amazon. Prime Now, the company's super-fast delivery service, is expanding rapidly in the U.S. and is now available in more than 30 cities. Alexa powered Echo devices are going great guns and help the company sell products and services. Alexa has already been integrated into a host of everyday devices for the digital home and there are agreements for more.Amazon has already gone brick-and-mortar with books and is treading the same path with other merchandise as well. The company is targeting the considerably large customer base that still prefers to shop at physical stores.Amazon Go, the no-queue-checkout-counter grocery store, is going to be a boon for customers who are too worn-out to stand in long lines at physical cash counters or are baffled at complicated self-checking counters. It has the ability to completely shatter the traditional brick-and-mortar convenience stores.Amazon continues to invest heavily in fulfillment centers, AWS, video streaming, offline retail, logistics, India expansion plans and what not. Its global margins are already under pressure and are likely to be so at least for a few years.In the first quarter, management expects revenues to include a 250 bps positive FX impact and come in around $33.25-33.75 billion. Operating income is expected to come in at approximately $250-$900 million.If we delve deeper into Amazon's key investment areas, we see a futuristic approach. Amazon's long history of execution, growing focus on innovation, technological prowess and huge cash balance, not only give it the flexibility to pursue growth in any area that exhibits true potential but also to create value for investors.Here are some stocks that you may want to consider as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to post a positive earnings surprise:Seagate Technology plc  , with an Earnings ESP of +3.77%, and a Zacks Rank #2.

In the last one year, the stock outperformed the Zacks  industry. It gained 10% compared with the industry's gain of 8.7%.PayPal is performing strongly in global payments, both online and mobile. It is also doing well with the Customer Champion strategy and enhancing value for customers and merchants.The company is riding high on partnership and mobile centrism. PayPal recently partnered with Discover Financial Services to link PayPal wallet with Discover cardholders and merchants and extended its partnership with cellular carriers. It also added a number of brands such as auto. DE (Europe's second-largest retailer), Barrel, Crate and Squarespace. | Its strategic partnerships with Visa and MasterCard offer great flexibility and choice to consumers. Partnerships with Facebook  , Alibaba's AliExpress, Google, Intuit and other major retailers and financial institutions are also positives.The company is also exploring partnerships across multiple original equipment manufacturers (OEM), technology companies, mobile-carriers, retailers and financial institutions.PayPal's accelerated push into mobile with Venomo will bolster its stake in mobile payments. We expect this momentum to continue going forward.PayPal expects revenues to grow 16%-18% on an Fx-neutral basis to $2.90 billion - $2.95 billion in the first quarter. Non-GAAP earnings are expected within 40 cents-42 cents.We believe PayPal's two-sided platform, safety and simplicity of transactions, opportunities in the fast-growing mobile space, strategic partnerships and a strong balance sheet are major tailwinds. On the flip side, PayPal operates in a highly competitive global payments industry that is exposed to foreign exchange and interest rate risks on a continuous basis, which may adversely impact its performance.Here are some stocks that you may want to consider as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to post a positive earnings surprise:Seagate Technology plc  , with an Earnings ESP of +3.77%, and a Zacks Rank #2.

Last quarter, the company posted a remarkable positive earnings surprise of 125%. Notably, Fortinet has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice and missed in one occasion, over the trailing four quarters. It has an average negative earnings surprise of 47.92%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Fortinet's network security solutions include firewall, VPN, application control, antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, anti-spam and WAN acceleration.For the last two quarters, there has been a slowdown in Fortinet's sales. The company observed that organizations have been breaking their cybersecurity investment plans into phases and implementing the same over longer periods of time instead of making a single large investment. Therefore, the aforementioned factor is likely to affect the to-be-reported quarter revenues.Nonetheless, we opine that Fortinet's initiative to change its business model to subscription-based service provider will continue to drive the company's bottom-line results. Subscription-based service is a high gross margin business (approximately 80%) compared with the hardware-centric model.Notably, the company generates over 50% of the total revenue from these services, which helped it generate a 250 basis points gross margin expansion in fourth-quarter 2016. We believe that the strategy will continue to improve the company's bottom-line performances. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Fortinet will beat estimates this quarter.

The company operates across various geographical regions and its increasing popularity among major tech industry players looking for data management should drive revenues in the fourth quarter.Acquisitions have been a major growth driver for Equinix and helped it to expand data center capacity in many of its key markets since 2003. We expect the company's buyouts of Telecity Group, Bit-isle and Nimbo, to boost the top line in the quarter.Expansion in important markets and consolidation of facilities in existing ones have been important parts of Equinix's core strategy. We believe that the company's focus on offering upgraded technology to attract clients will bolster its revenues and profitability in the to-be-reported quarter.However, we remain slightly cautious about the huge capital outlays, which may hurt Equinix's first-quarter profitability. It should be noted that, Equinix had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $751.9 million, while the total debt principal outstanding was $6.82 billion as on Dec 31, 2016. Growing debt burden will affect the company's profitability in the quarter as interest expense would go up.Moreover, increasing competition from established Internet data center operators, such as AT&T  , Level 3 Communications, COLT and Verizon, will affect product pricing, thereby denting margins. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Equinix is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in its upcoming release.

However, share price of the stock dropped 2.89% ($2.99) at the close of the Apr 21 trading session, post the earnings release. We view the company's weaker-than-expected bottom-line performance during the reported quarter as the primary reason responsible for this negative sentiment.Quarterly adjusted earnings came in at $1.09 per share, up 11.2% year over year.However, the bottom line fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.11.The company noted that restructuring expenses hurt quarterly earnings by nearly 30 cents per share, however a lower income tax rate benefited the same by roughly 20 cents per share.

However, on the other hand, adverse foreign currency translation impact is expected to hamper near-term results.The company anticipates earnings within the range of $1.67-$1.75 per share in second-quarter 2017. The guidance includes the predicted negative currency impact of 8 cents per share, but excludes the effect of restructuring charges.Bullish factors such as increasing global demand, service diversification and greater operational efficacy are anticipated to drive near-term top- and bottom-line performance for the company.

Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).

Its efforts are reflected in its share price which gained 35.3% over the past two years, significantly outperforming the Zacks Categorized  industry's gain of 26.5%.Visa Checkout offers consumers an expedited and secure payment experience for online transactions wherever this service is enabled. It helps merchants convert higher numbers of consumers to sale, a particularly important issue, as digital commerce shift from desktop to mobile devices has lower conversion rates.At the end of fiscal 2016, Visa Checkout had over 15 million consumer accounts in 21 countries, seven languages and over 1,400 financial institution partners across the globe. More than 300,000 merchants, including some of the largest global retailers accept Visa Checkout. The expansion to 20 million enrolled accounts must have been driven by higher acceptance from the rollout of a redesigned Visa Checkout service in Oct 2016.The latest version made it easier for consumers to enroll and complete purchases on mobile devices. The company recently announced the opening of the Visa Checkout platform to clients and partners, allowing them to integrate their digital wallets into Visa Checkout for streamlined authentication and checkout.Visa Checkout is also gaining increased acceptance from merchants. The company's merchant list already has 300,000 names on it and is continuously growing. Some of the big brand names that recently adopted this service are HSN, Alaska Airlines, Avis Budget, Cole Haan, Emirates Airline, FIFA, Marriott, Sam's Club and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.  .The company doesn't seem to be resting here. It is eyeing further expansion of Visa Checkout in 2017. Some of its targeted markets are Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Ukraine. This service is already or very soon going to be present in the regions of Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China1, Colombia, France, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Poland, Singapore, Spain, South Africa, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom and the United States.To make things all the more easier for its consumers and merchants, the company recently joined forces with Samsung Pay. The pact will allow Samsung Pay users in the U.S. to link their Samsung Pay account with a Visa Checkout account. This will give them a seamless way to pay for shopping at more than 300,000 merchants that accept Visa Checkout.Last year, another industry player, MasterCard Inc.  , announced an agreement with Samsung to enable Samsung Pay users to shop online at hundreds of thousands of merchants around the world where Masterpass is accepted.Visa however remains a forerunner in the digital payments market. Other than Visa Checkout, Visa Direct and Visa Token Service are some its popular payment platforms. Visa Direct is a push payment product platform that facilitates payer-initiated transactions sent directly to the Visa account of the recipient. Its Visa Token Service replaces the card account numbers from the transaction with a token. Tokenization helps to protect consumer financial information and lessen the risk of stolen card credentials.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The company is on a growth trajectory, gathering momentum from its positive earnings surprise history and robust fundamentals.Equifax's share price movement has been quite favorable. In the year so far, its shares gained 15.1%, while the Zacks categorized  industry returned 9.6%.For the last few years Equifax has been focusing on expanding its international footprint. Last year in September, the company opened a second office in Dublin, and employed more than 100 people at the new facility.Apart from this, the company resorted to acquisitions and joint ventures to drive growth. In Feb 2016, Equifax acquired Australia-based data and analytic services provider - Veda - for a cash consideration of approximately $1.7 billion (2.4 billion Australian dollars). Veda has been integrated into the newly created Asia-Pacific reporting unit within the International segment.Notably, international revenues (including Europe, the Asia Pacific, Canada and Latin America) surged 49% year over year to $212.4 million in fourth-quarter 2016. On a constant-currency basis, revenues soared 62%. The Veda buyout bolstered the Asia-Pacific revenues from $2.6 million in fourth-quarter 2015 to $70.7 million in fourth-quarter 2016.Furthermore, Equifax remains enthusiastic about forming joint ventures that could expand its business internationally. Joint ventures keep operating costs down and need no integration time while diversifying the revenue source. To tap the immense growth opportunity in the Brazilian credit data market, Equifax merged credit reporting operations of its Brazilian subsidiary with Boa Vista Servicos S.A., the second largest consumer credit bureau in Brazil.Equifax also owns roughly 50% in Russia-based credit reporting agency, Global Payments Credit Services LLC, and 49% interest in the Indian credit reporting agency, Equifax Credit Information Services Private Limited (a joint venture between Equifax and 6 Indian financial institutions). The company expects its investments in the joint ventures to yield desired results and help it to register solid growth over the long term.Management's efforts, such as strategic initiatives for product innovation, expansion of data assets through acquisitions and consistent share gains in North America, should prove to be tailwinds. Also, the company's strong correlation with the consumer and financial markets, and exposure in the U.S. and Europe are likely to propel growth, going ahead.The ongoing initiatives have helped the company to post splendid financial results for the last quarter. Equifax's top- and bottom-line results for fourth-quarter 2016 not only came ahead of estimates, but also marked solid year-over-year improvement. Moreover, its optimistic full-year guidance for revenues and earnings indicates that its growth initiatives are aimed in the right direction.Nonetheless, we anticipate the company's investments in new initiatives to weigh on its bottom-line results in the near term. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding IT spending and the strengthening U.S. dollar are some concerns. Further, increasing competition from the likes of Fiserv  and Total System Services  are the other factors likely to affect earnings in the near term.Currently, Equifax has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the Financial Transaction Services industry is Green Dot Corporation  , which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  .Green Dot witnessed upward estimate revision for 2017 and 2018 in the last 30 days, and has an expected long-term EPS growth rate of 15%.While we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

The Competition & Markets Authority of UK passed the deal after being satisfied with the remedial measures taken by MasterCard to address competition concerns.The regulators were bothered about competition to the LINK ATM network, serviced by VocaLink.The deal valued at \u20ac700 million, will very soon see the light of day. It will be one of the company's strategic steps to broaden its payments system by providing bank accounted transfers. Shares of the company returned 21.2% since last July when the deal was announced, significantly outperforming the gain of 11.2% logged by the Zacks categorized  industry.VocaLink is a leader in bank account-based payments. Its technology allows bank account transfers in some of the major financial centers across the world which includes UK, Singapore and Thailand. With this acquisition the service will be made available in the U.S too.With VocaLink, MasterCard seeks to capture more payment flows by adding automated clearing house (ACH) payments to its core card-based business since ACH payments constitute a significant amount of all payments made by companies, businesses and governments.The deal will provide MasterCard a greater foothold in the U.K. payments industry. The company is keen on making it big in the ACH space since it is at the center of commerce in the U.S., moving money and information from one bank account to another. According to NACHA, The Electronics Payments Association, each year the ACH network moves more than $41 trillion and 24 billion electronic financial transactions. The ACH Network is continuously growing and is now one of the largest, safest and most reliable payment systems in the world, creating value for all participants.Last month, the company announced another acquisition of NuData Security, a privately held global technology company. This buy will enable MasterCard to provide greater security to online transactions.These deals will also help the company to source newer avenues of growth in the wake of the recent loss of one of its big client, the USAA, to another player Visa Inc.  .The company has been seeking inorganic growth via acquisitions. To this end, it acquired two businesses for $609 million in cash in 2015, and eight businesses for $575 million in 2014.MasterCard carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the space are Fiserv, Inc.  and Total System Services Inc.  . Each of these stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .Fiserv beat estimates in two of the last four reported quarters with an average surprise of 1.2%.Total System Services beat estimates in three of the last four reported quarters with an average surprise of 3.7%.While we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

Paypal also formed a similar alliance with another credit card processor MasterCard Inc.  .Visa has been busy forming numerous pacts and alliances which have beefed up its business volumes. The company's strong performance is also reflected in its share price which added 13.02%, higher than the 10.9% gain for the Zacks categorized  industry, since it forged the partnership with Paypal.Visa and PayPal's joint presence in Asia Pacific is an extension of the partnership between the two. Their partnership will help those banks issuing Visa cards in Asia Pacific to check out wherever PayPal is accepted online. It also expands the use of PayPal to retailers that accept Visa in physical locations.Consumers and merchants will be benefited from this alliance and the joint service by both Visa and Paypal since it will provide them a secure, reliable and convenient digital and mobile payments option.While Visa provides a card network, PayPal acts as a payment gateway for processing payments. Both companies are leaders in their space and a partnership between them largely benefits for companies as well as consumers.Visa with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) is an attractive investment opportunity. The stock witnessed an upward revision in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 earnings over the past 90 days to $3.31.

This burgeoning industry provides a unique growth opportunity for companies like Visa Inc.  and MasterCard Inc.  given their strong international brands and state-of-the-art payments network.Shares of both players have performed strongly over the last one year. Visa was up 24.3%, almost the same as MasterCard's gain of 24.4%. The returns compare favorably with the Zacks categorized  industry's gain of 22.3% over the same time frame.Although both companies boast strong business lines and solid growth prospects, Visa with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) looks comparatively better as an investment than Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) MasterCard. Below we will substantiate our reasoning. You can see  .A look at the most recent earnings performance states that Visa scored better than MasterCard. While Visa beat earnings estimates by a good 10.3%, MasterCard delivered a positive earnings surprise of only 1.2%. MasterCard missed on revenues while Visa outperformed its revenue expectations.Both companies, however, have performed well over the past 28 quarters. Visa exceeded expectations in 24 of the last 28 quarters, while met estimates in the remaining four. The average earnings surprise for the last four quarters is 5.8%. On the other hand, MasterCard exceeded expectation in 25 of the last 28 quarters, met estimates in two and missed only in one. The average positive surprise for the past four quarters is 4.81%.For fiscal 2017 (ending on Sep 30, 2017), the earnings estimates for Visa have moved north while that of MasterCard have moved in the opposite direction. Out of 16 analysts covering Visa's stock, 13 revised the 2017 earnings estimates up by 1.2% to $3.31 over the past 60 days. The same for MasterCard have gone down by 0.9% to $4.26 over the same time frame as eight out of the 15 analysts covering the stock made downward revisions.MasterCard's U.S business has been soft, particularly the higher-profit consumer credit business. This is primarily due to the loss of its 30-year old key client, United Services Automobile Association (USAA), one of the largest issuers of credit and debit cards in the United States to Visa. The loss of this client is a huge blow to MasterCard and is likely to put pressure on its domestic credit business through 2017.On the other hand, Visa is riding high with the gain of USAA and Costco (another major client) from American Express Inc.  . We expect payments volume at Visa to be aided by the addition of USAA and Costco.MasterCard is facing regulatory as well as economic challenges in Europe. On the contrary, Visa's acquisition of Visa Europe could bolster its cross-border business, positioning it for higher payments volume. The acquisition of Visa Europe has helped the company address its own weakness of lacking meaningful earnings contribution from Europe for long. It will also help the company to avoid the negative impact of currency fluctuation.Visa's expected EPS growth for (3-5 years) is 16.63%. This is better than MasterCard's growth rate of 15.5%.Moreover, Visa's PEG ratio is 1.63, which is better than MasterCard's 1.67Also, beta for Visa is 0.94, which shows less volatility than MasterCard's stock beta of 1.18.Net profit margin for Visa is 38.3% compared with MasterCard's net profit margin of 37.67%. However, both numbers are better than the industry's net profit margin of 7.25%.Finally, Visa has a lower leverage as evident by its debt to equity ratio of 0.54 compared with MasterCard's debt to equity ratio of 0.91.While both stocks are part of a booming industry, it's clear that Visa has better growth prospects. This make it a more obvious choice for investors when it comes to picking between Visa and MasterCard stocks.Another stock with the same Zacks Rank as Visa is Fiserv, Inc.  . The stock beat estimate in two of the last four reported quarters with an average surprise of 1.2%.Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Masterpass provides an easy and secure way to shop by storing payment information in a secure connected wallet of consumers' choice and giving them access to information for payment with a simple click or touch. The company continued to use its digital technologies and security protocols to enhance the suite of digital token services available through its MasterCard Digital Enablement Service (MDES).The company also re-launched Mastercard Developers, and expanded Mastercard Send\u2122, connecting more consumers, businesses and governments to facilitate the transfer of funds via financial institutions quickly and securely.Along with investing continuously in technology, the company is making aggressive efforts to shore up security of payments made via its network.

This is primarily due to the loss of its 30-year old key client, United Services Automobile Association (USAA), one of the largest issuers of credit and debit cards in the country to Visa. The loss of this client is a huge blow to MasterCard and is likely to put pressure on its domestic credit business through 2017.

The industry is also witnessing a rapid shift from physical money transfer to electronic money transfer. A number of companies operate in this industry. Given its superior brand name and a vast global network with growing electronic business, Western Union Co.  is one of the leaders in this industry.Despite this, shares of Western Union have underperformed. Over the past one year, Western Union shares gained a mere 1.8% faring poorly against15.8% growth for the Zacks categorized  industry. We see limited upside for the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock in the near term given several challenges.Below we point out some facts troubling the stock: For 2017, management anticipates constant-currency revenues to grow at a low single-digit rate (versus 4% in 2015 and 3% in 2016), and anticipates adjusted EPS of $1.63-$1.75, which includes about of 9 cents of foreign exchange headwinds. The company has witnessed a 2.9% decline in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in 2017 to $1.68 per share over the past 30 days. It also translates into a year-over-year decline of 4.04%. The company continues to operate amid several global economic headwinds, including foreign exchange volatility, limiting its profitability. Remittance flows from the oil producing countries will continue to be affected by the softness in oil price environment, thereby hurting revenues in the Middle East and Africa as well as part of the Asia Pacific region. Notably, management expects the overall macro environment in 2017 to be largely similar to 2016, with persistent challenges, including strengthening of the U.S. dollar, soft economies in oil producing nations and an uncertain geopolitical environment. These headwinds will exert pressure on the company's top line. : The company continues to face an increase in compliance costs. It is expected to represent the upper end of 3.5% to 4.0% of revenue in 2017 (versus 3.6% in 2016). It increased from $180 million in 2014 to approximately $195 million in 2016. - Western Union's valuation looks stretched when compared with its industry average. Looking at the company's price-to-book ratio, which is the best multiple for valuing companies in Financial Transaction Services industry because of large variations in their earnings results from one quarter to the next, investors might not want to pay any further premium. The company currently has a trailing 12-month P/B ratio of 10.66, which is higher than the industry range of 4.44Also, the company is expected to grow at a rate of 5.10% for the next five years which is lower than industry growth rate of 11.30. The past five years' growth rate of 2.10% compares unfavorably with the industry growth rate of 13.8%.Some better-ranked stocks are Envestnet, Inc.  , Fiserv, Inc.  and Vantiv, Inc.  . Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see  .Envestnet carries a VGM score B and surpassed earnings estimates in the last reported quarter by 12.5%.Fiserv beat estimates in two of the last four reported quarters with an average surprise of 1.2%.Vantiv beat earnings estimate in three out of the last four quarters with an average surprise of 3.7%.Did you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

The company's adjusted earnings (excluding amortization expenses, Veda Group acquisition-related charges and other one-time items) per share from continuing operations of $1.42 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.38 and surged 24.7% year over year.On a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings of $1.01 per share, up from the year-ago quarter tally of 93 cents. The strong year-over-year bottom-line growth was mainly aided by solid top-line performance and stringent cost management, which was partially offset by a slight increase in the number of total outstanding shares.The overwhelming fourth-quarter results boosted investors' confidence as shares gained 2.5% in after hour trade. Notably, the stock has outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry in the past three month period. Equifax has gained 9.3% during the said period compared with the industry's return of 4.3%.Equifax's revenues of $801.1 million came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $800 million as well as management's guided range of $797 million to $801 million (mid-point $799 million). The figure was also up 20.2% on a year-over-year basis.The company made slight changes in its reportable segments from first-quarter 2016. The U.S. Information Solutions (USIS) and Workforce Solutions remained unchanged, while Personal Solutions was renamed to Global Consumer Solutions. Under the International segment, Equifax has \"created a new Asia Pacific reporting unit, including the Veda acquisition as well as TDX Australia and India operations, which previously were part of the Europe reporting unit.\"Segment-wise, total USIS revenues were up 7% year over year to $316.2 million. Among its sub-segments, growth was recorded in Online Information Solutions (4%), Mortgage Solutions Services (29%) and Financial Marketing Services (7%).International revenues (including Europe, the Asia-Pacific, Canada and Latin America) surged 49% year over year to $212.4 million. On a constant-currency basis, revenues soared 62%. Growth was mainly driven by the Veda Group acquisition, which increased the Asia-Pacific region's contribution to revenues to $70.7 million from $2.6 million. Moreover, the company registered an increase of 4% each in Europe and Canada. However, revenues from Latin America dropped 4%.Revenues from the Workforce Solutions segment surged 21% year over year to $173.6 million, primarily on the back of 24% revenue growth in Verification Services and 15% in Employer Services.Global Consumer Solutions contributed $98.9 million to total revenue, reflecting an 18% year-over-year jump.Equifax's adjusted operating income increased approximately 32% to $267.2 million. Consequently, adjusted operating margin expanded 300 basis points (bps) to 33.4%. Adjusted net income came in at $172.4 million or $1.42 per share, compared with $137.5 million or $1.14 per share reported a year ago.Equifax exited the quarter with $129.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, up from the previous quarter's balance of $111.5 million. Total long-term debt (excluding current portion) was $2.09 billion, down from $2.14 billion at the end of third-quarter 2016. During 2016, Equifax generated cash flow of $784.5 million from operational activities. The company paid $157.6 million as dividends in 2016.Buoyed by strong fourth-quarter results, Equifax provided an optimistic outlook for the first quarter and full year 2017. For full year 2017, Equifax expects revenues to come in a range of $3.375-$3.425 billion (mid-point $3.40 billion). The revenue outlook at mid-point is much higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.38 billion. Adjusted earnings per share are forecast to be between $5.96 and $6.10 (midpoint: $6.03). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $5.96.For the first quarter, Equifax projects revenues in a range of $822 million to $826 million (midpoint: $824 million), while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $820.5 million. Adjusted earnings per share are projected to be between $1.39 and $1.42 (midpoint: $1.405). However, the earnings guidance range was lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.43.Equifax posted better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter. Earnings and revenues both recorded year-over-year growth. Moreover, its optimistic full-year guidance for revenues and earnings indicates that its growth initiatives are aimed in the right direction.Management's efforts, such as strategic initiatives for product innovation, expansion of data assets through acquisitions and continuous share gains in North America, should prove to be tailwinds. Also, the company's strong correlation with the consumer and financial markets and exposure in the U.S. and Europe are likely to propel growth, going ahead.However, we expect the company's investments in new initiatives to weigh on its upcoming quarterly earnings. Additionally, uncertainty surrounding IT spending and strengthening U.S. dollar are some concerns. Moreover, increasing competition from the likes of Fiserv  and Total System Services  are the other factors likely to affect earnings in the near term. | Currently, Equifax has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the financial transaction services industry is Envestnet Inc.  , which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 10 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Fiserv Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $100.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $127.00. The standard deviation is $9.554.But the whole reason to look at the  FISV price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with FISV crossing above that average target price of $110.80/share, investors in FISV have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $110.80 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

And it boasts 75,000 employees in 25 countries.For the fourth quarter, G stock posted earnings growth of 21%, while its full-year earnings growth was around 16%. That's solid considering Genpact is facing difficult currency exchange.But despite those headwinds, Genpact still offers great deal for shareholders, as stock has a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 21, which is well below the industry average of 35, and a forward P/E of just 16. This latest earnings beat wasn't a surprise either, as Genpact has posted an earnings beat in each of the last four quarters as well.The previous quarter represented the smallest beat thanks in part to lower technology spending in the investment banking and healthcare markets. But it wasn't too bad: non-GAAP earnings still grew 9% year over year to  - 3 cents better than Wall Street hoped.Plus, a recent acquisition by Genpact could fuel more growth down the line. The company just reached an agreement to acquire an Australian arm of  (NASDAQ:  ), which serves three of the four major retail banks in Australia, handling approximately 70% of all checks processed in the Australian market, according to the press release.Looking forward a bit further, Genpact's earnings are expected to maintain a double-digit average over the next five years, smoothing out right around 12%. That's almost double the average of the last five years, when Genpact stock still managed average gains of almost 7%.Add it up, and I like the moves Genpact is making and I like the estimates on tap. Efficiency is never going to go out of style across industries. Even if discretionary spending on B2B tech has been soft in spots of late, I like the prospects for the near-term and believe Genpact stock has some immediate value to realize.I expect investors to realize that now that the latest earnings report has come out, and recommend a buy before Genpact gets its post-earnings pop.The post ) Stock Has Room to Grow appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the Vanguard Mid-Cap ETF (Symbol: VO) where we have detected an approximate $59.2 million dollar inflow -- that's a 0.3% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 131,963,357 to 132,388,803).

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Earnings season continues to provide both pre- and post- announcement trading opportunities from the charts. Today's three big stock charts look at charts for  (NYSE:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) as both companies' stocks are seeing strong technical reactions to their earnings. In addition, we'll check in on the chart of  (NASDAQ:  ) ahead of their earnings announcement Wednesday after the close.Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb shot more than 12% lower after news that the company would not be moving forward with an accelerated regulatory pathway for a combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy in first-line lung cancer in the U.S. BMY shares fell another 5% ahead of its earnings announcement, which followed the initial drop.Bristol-Myers' earnings report, which missed expectations and included lowered guidance from the company, was almost lost in the massive decline that BMY shares had already seen, allowing the stock to rally from an oversold situation to their current price of $51.Now, Bristol-Myers shares are facing technical resistance from the charts as the $51- to $52-level has held as both support and resistance for Bristol-Myers in the past.In addition, volume on BMY shares took a drop last week, indicating that buying interest in the stock died-off as the week ended. This suggests to our charts that the stock may see a vacuum left behind by a lack of buyers that will easily be filled by short-term fast-trading sellers.Any selling pressure at this point should be easily able to turn BMY shares lower with a target of $46.Visa shares surged higher last week as the company beat expectations and raised their guidance, despite potential foreign exchange headwinds. The number was well received as V stock jumped more than 5% to new highs.Visa shares are now breaking through to new all-time highs with investors and traders chasing them higher.The one-day rally in Visa rang the overbought bell, indicating that we are likely to see some selling pressure hit V stock on any market weakness. This is since the traders will 1) look to cash in some profits and 2) look for an opportunity to buy the shares back at a lower price.In addition, Visa stock broke above its top Bollinger Band on Friday's rally. A very key point that the traders will watch is V stock's ability to remain outside of this band in order to gauge the likelihood of a continuation of the rally. A break back below, which we see as likely, will turn a short-term selloff into a buying opportunity.This sets up a potentially easy play for Visa chart watchers.Fiserv announces their earnings later this week as the company's stock moves into a must-win situation with its chart.Since Jan. 12, shares of FISV have dropped by more than 5%, putting the stock in position to benefit from its 100- and 200-day moving averages. These trendlines are currently housed at the $104 price level.A similar combination of these trendlines in December provided support for Fiserv stock and allowed it to rally from $103 to $112 over a month, but the situation is a little different this time around.Currently, FISV shares' 50-day moving average is hovering above the stock at $107.50 and has been in the process of transitioning into a bearish pattern. This has the potential to add some resistance to any rally that may happen after the stock's earnings announcement.From a bullish perspective, Fiserv stock did just hit an oversold reading from its short-term RSI, which could help the shares bounce a bit ahead of the earnings announcement. The bad side of that is that we tend to notice stocks that see this type of setup ahead of earnings tend to see a \"sell the news\" reaction to their earnings results more often.The latter of these situations could break support for Fiserv by moving below the 100- and 200-day moving average, which would increase selling interest from the technicians that are watching the stock test these important trendlines.Bottom line for the FISV bulls is that this earnings announcement may be worth sitting on the sidelines for as the stock's downside risks appear to outweigh the upside potential.The post ), Visa Inc () and Fiserv Inc () appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" is set to release fourth-quarter 2016 earnings results on Feb 7.

Mobile banking is developing into an essential extension of online banking with accelerating smartphone and tablet usage. Fidelity's recent partnership with PayPal  for digital payments is likely to boost its customer engagement.Per media reports, the company inked a deal in Dec 2016 to sell SunGard Public Sector and Education businesses to Vista Equity Partners for $850 million. The sale of the units is in line with its strategy to focus more on its core operations of providing software, technology and processing services to the retail and institutional banking, payments, and asset and wealth management sectors.The company intends to utilize the expected cash proceeds (net of taxes and deal-related expenses) of $500 million in reducing its outstanding debt.Nevertheless, increasing consolidation in the banking sector, challenging environment for the Payments Solutions business and sluggish demand of people-based professional services are the primary headwinds.

Fiserv shares have increased 16.25% compared with the industry's gain of 29.72% during the period.Fiserv commands a leading position in the financial and payment solutions business backed by a broad customer base and key contract wins. Additionally, the strong user base of Mobiliti ASP remains a major growth driver.

The company's top and bottom line results not only surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate but also improved year over year.The company posted non-GAAP earnings (excluding discontinued operations and one-time items) of $1.66 per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.51. DST Systems' non-GAAP earnings also registered a year-over-year increase of 18.6%, mainly driven by higher revenues, effective cost management and lower share count.Shares of DST Systems gained 2.6% yesterday. | Total revenue in the fourth quarter came in at $398.8 million, up 4.1% from the year-ago quarter. Excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements, consolidated operating revenues increased 3.1% year over year to $373.7 million, which was way ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $366 million.Financial Services operating revenues (excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements) remained almost flat year over year at $272.7 million. Benefits from businesses acquired during 2016 and increased revenues from professional services were largely offset by extension of certain long-term contracts with lower pricing and a fall in mutual fund registered shareowner account processing revenues.Healthcare Services operating revenues were up 13.7% on a year-over-year basis and came in at $111.9 million, primarily due to expansion in high-value services for medical and pharmacy businesses, new medical claims and organic growth.Non-GAAP cost and expenses were up 1.2% from the year-ago quarter to $315.6 million. However, as a percentage of revenues, costs and expenses were down 230 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 79.1% due to better cost management.Non-GAAP operating income increased 16.7% year over year and came in at $83.2 million. Operating margin was also up 230 bps on a year-over-year basis to 20.9%. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by cost-cutting measures within the Financial Services segment.DST reported non-GAAP net income of $53.9 million compared with $48.9 million reported in the year-ago quarter.The company's balance sheet as of Dec 31, 2016 looked very impressive as it has managed to lower its long-term debt and increased available cash and cash equivalents during the quarter by generating funds through the sale of the North American Customer Communications (NACC) business.The company exited 2016 with $195.5 million in cash and equivalents compared with $79.5 million at the end of 2015. Long-term debt (including current portion) was $508.2 million compared with $562.1 million as of Dec 31, 2015.During the fourth quarter, DST Systems repurchased roughly 0.675 million shares worth $75 million. Furthermore, since the beginning of Jan 2017, the company has repurchased $47 million worth of its common stock. It now has $103.0 million remaining under the existing $300 million share repurchase plan announced in Jun 2016.On Jul 1, 2016, DST Systems announced the completion of the sale of the NACC business to Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc. (BR) for a cash consideration of $410 million. The company recorded an estimated $340.1 million pretax gain on the transaction during the last reported quarter.DST Systems' NACC was the largest transactional printer in North America. The unit offers customers communication services including print and digital communication solutions, content management, postal optimization and fulfillment.DST Systems reported splendid fourth-quarter results, wherein earnings and revenues both surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, both revenues and earnings grew year over year.We are still of the opinion that DST Systems' business volume and massive scale of operation in Financial Services will attract new customers. Moreover, we expect steady contributions from acquisitions to support revenue growth. Continued share buybacks and dividend payments are the other encouraging factors.However, persistent decline in registered accounts, ongoing consolidation in the U.S. financial services market and stiff competition from International Business Machines Corporation  and Fiserv Inc.  may put its fundamentals under pressure. Moreover, a high debt burden still remains a major concern for the company.Notably, the stock price has underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry over the past one year. While the industry gained 24.4%, the stock gained only 12.3%.Currently, DST Systems carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock worth considering in the Computer-Software industry is Check Point Software  , which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Going by the Zacks model, companies holding a Zacks Rank #5 are likely to underperform the broader market.There have been frequent downward estimate revisions of late. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter went done 5% (8 cents) to $1.52 per share over the last 60 days. For fiscal 2017, two out of the three estimates were lowered over the same time frame. The Zacks Consensus Estimate went down approximately 11.1% (57 cents) to $6.21 per share.DST Systems reported mixed third-quarter 2016 results, wherein its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missed the same. Total revenue in the third quarter came in at $386.7 million. Excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements, consolidated operating revenues were $365.5 million, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $384 million.Moreover, DST Systems' balance sheet appears highly leveraged. The company exited third-quarter 2016 with $180.9 million in cash and equivalents compared with $72.7 million in the previous quarter. Long-term debt (including current portion) was $428.7 million compared with $712.2 million in the previous quarter.DST has divested its Customer Communications division to focus on financial services and health care segments. In the second quarter, the company successfully sold its North American Customer Communications division to Broadridge Financial Solutions  for a cash consideration of $410 million. It also divested its UK Customer Communications Bristol production facilities in exchange for net pretax proceeds of approximately $16 million. The proceeds from the aforementioned divestments will facilitate the acquisition of new businesses in addition to improving flexibility to capitalize on new opportunities in health care and financial services. However, all of this depends how the company utilizes these funds to drive future growth. Furthermore, loss of revenues due to divestments has made us increasingly cautious about the stock's future performance. Notably, DST's Customer Communications segment had contributed over 30% to its 2015 total revenue.The company faces stiff competition from the likes of BroadridgeFinancial Solutions' BEA, Lombardi, Savvion, and TIBCO Software, which offer their premium services at more competitive prices. Some of the company's clients are in a position to develop in-house capacity to perform transaction processing, recordkeeping and output generation services. In-house facilities of these companies could increase competition, leading to lower prices and profits for DST.Furthermore, decreasing organic revenue growth, tough competition from International Business Machines Corporation  and Fiserv Inc.  , and a high debt burden remain concerns.You can see  | Beyond this Analyst Blog, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are not available to the public?

Of course, most investors are asking \"can we believe in this rally?\" or \"Can this rally last?\" The answer is detailed in the charts of those stocks that have made some of the larger moves since the beginning of November.Today's three big stock charts look at Trump Rally victors with  (NYSE:  ),  (NYSE:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) asking and answering the question, \"Can these rallies continue?\"The steel industry has received a great bump from the election results as the market and the industry see President Trump as a plus for their business. Why not? We're clearly going to see a massive increase in infrastructure and defense spending, both which will create demand for steel products.Also, the focus on \"Made in America\" means that we are likely to see tariffs on products that other countries have been crushing with cheap alternatives and steel is high on that list.U.S. Steel shares have rallied more than 80% since the beginning of November. While the run in X stock looks over, it may just be the beginning.Oversold conditions on U.S. Steel shares suggest that the market is likely to see their price fall a bit, but you're almost guaranteed that there are buyers waiting in the wings to scoop X shares up on any dip.The current prices in U.S. Steel, above $32, take out some historical chart resistance at the $32-level, potentially opening-up more movement to the upside.From a long-term perspective, X shares are trading well above their 20-month moving average, which is now moving higher itself. This matches the terms of a long-term bull market being drawn for U.S. Steel stock and suggests higher prices through 2017.For now, X stock is likely to show some consolidation at the $32- to $33-level; however, we may see another round of buying come in without a significant decline in shares. U.S. Steel is one of those stocks where investors have to avoid getting greedy by waiting for a large pullback and remember that overpriced can always become more overpriced, leaving you behind.Retail results will be flowing into the market throughout the week as retailers tally up their Black Friday take. Initially, the numbers haven't been as good as some analyst expected. The reason? More of us are combining our online shopping with brick-and-mortar shopping.Home Depot shares just crossed over their 50-, 100- and 200-day moving averages within the last week of trading. The move in HD stock improves its technical outlook.At the same time, Home Depot shares have peaked into overbought territory according to their RSI reading. This causes some concern, but it is somewhat offset by the growing momentum readings on HD shares. In other words, the strength of the trend looks to override concerns that Home Depot shares are overbought for now.Movement has been on heavy volume, telling us that there is a migration of cash into HD stock. This suggests that the stock will find buyers on dips as investors continue to chase the performance of Home Depot shares into the New Year.Fiserv shares have struggled over the company's last two earnings reports, lagging the market in performance for the first time in more than a few years. Now, FISV stock is starting to make a strong move higher after months of consolidation.We watched Fiserv shares consolidate at the $100-level, which has chart implications just because of its round-numbered quality. After dipping below this critical mark just ahead of earnings season, FISV stock finally got some strength as the company beat earnings and confirmed its outlook.Fiserv's key trendlines have all transitioned into bullish catalysts over the last two weeks with the key 200-day trendline moving into a support position at $103. This will help the technical traders continue to move cash into FISV shares.We may see some resistance at $110, but the way Fiserv's momentum is building, it should be just a short endeavor that leads to higher prices.The post ), Fiserv Inc () and United States Steel Corporation () appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" 's  third-quarter 2016 adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $1.14 per share came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a cent and improved 10.7% from the year-ago quarter.Total revenue increased approximately 5.1% year over year to $1.38 billion but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.40 billion.

The company remains focused on expanding its product portfolio.However, the company's sales are being negatively impacted due to lower termination fees, EMV deferral and adverse foreign currency translations.

The company delivered positive earnings surprises in three out of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.58%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Fidelity delivered mixed results in the second-quarter of 2016. While earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues missed the consensus mark. On a year-over-year basis, both the top line and the bottom line registered decent growth.Fidelity has strengthened its dominant position in the financial and payments solutions business, primarily based on its superior product portfolio.Also, Fidelity is well positioned to benefit from increasing investment in mobile banking and innovative products such as PayNet. Mobile banking is developing into an essential extension of online banking as smartphone and tablet usage continues to accelerate globally.We believe that banks and financial institutions will choose the company's innovative solutions (such as mobile wallet) in order to differentiate their services, thereby driving top-line growth.Moreover, Fidelity's Open Payment Framework has witnessed consumer adoptions this year in Hong Kong, India and Canada. We believe new customer wins as well as accretive acquisitions are key catalysts in the near term. Nevertheless, increasing consolidation in the banking sector, challenging environment for the Payments Solutions business and uncertain regulatory environment are the primary headwinds. Also, intensifying competition from the likes of Fiserv Inc.  , Global Payments Inc.  and Alliance Data Systems Corp. remains a concern.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Fidelity National is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.

The company's adjusted earnings (excluding amortization expenses, Veda Group acquisition-related charges and other one-time items) per share from continuing operations of $1.44 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.36 and surged 26% year over year.On a GAAP basis, the company reported earnings of $1.09 per share, up from the year-ago quarter tally of 98 cents. The strong year-over-year bottom-line growth was mainly aided by solid top-line performance and stringent cost management, which was partially offset by a slight increase in the number of total outstanding shares.The overwhelming third-quarter results boosted investors' confidence as shares gained 1.5% in after hour trade.Equifax's revenues of $804.1 million came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $801 million and were toward the higher-end of management's guided range of $795-$805 million (mid-point $800 million). The figure was also up 20.5% on a year-over-year basis.The company made slight changes in its reportable segments from first-quarter 2016. The U.S. Information Solutions (USIS) and Workforce Solutions remained unchanged, while Personal Solutions was renamed to Global Consumer Solutions. Under the International segment, Equifax has \"created a new Asia Pacific reporting unit, including the Veda acquisition as well as TDX Australia and India operations, which previously were part of the Europe reporting unit.\"Segment-wise, total USIS revenues were up 9% year over year to $317.4 million. Among its sub-segments, growth was recorded in Online Information Solutions (7%), Mortgage Solutions Services (24%) and Financial Marketing Services (3%).International revenues (including Europe, the Asia-Pacific, Canada and Latin America) surged 47% year over year to $214.3 million. On a constant-currency basis, revenues soared 60%. Growth was mainly driven by the Veda Group acquisition, which increased the Asia-Pacific region's contribution to revenues to $73.6 million from $2.3 million. Moreover, the company registered an increase of 2% in Europe and 4% in Canada. However, revenues from Latin America dropped 9%.Revenues from the Workforce Solutions segment surged 23% year over year to $171.3 million, primarily on the back of 23% revenue growth registered in both, Verification Services as well as Employer Services.Global Consumer Solutions contributed $101.1 million to total revenue, reflecting a 12% year-over-year jump.Equifax's adjusted operating income increased approximately 30% to $265.9 million. Consequently, adjusted operating margin expanded 240 basis points (bps) to 34.4%. Adjusted net income came in at $175.2 million or $1.44 per share, compared with $137.6 million or $1.14 per share reported a year ago. | Equifax exited the quarter with $111.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, up from the previous quarters' balance of $96.8 billion. Total long-term debt (excluding current portion) was $2.14 billion, down from $2.5 billion at the end of second-quarter 2016. During the first three quarters of 2016, Equifax generated cash flow of $524.5 million from operational activities. The company paid $118.1 million as dividends in the first nine months of 2016.Buoyed by strong third-quarter results, Equifax raised its earnings guidance for the full year. Adjusted earnings per share are now forecast to be between $5.45 and $5.48 (midpoint: $5.465), compared with the previous projection of $5.35-$5.40 (midpoint: $5.375). The earnings guidance range is significantly above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.31.However, Equifax now expects revenues to be slightly over $3.14 billion, which is lower than the mid-point of its earlier projection of $3.13-$3.16 billion (mid-point $3.15). Moreover, the revenue outlook is also lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.15 billion.Coming to the fourth-quarter outlook, Equifax projects revenues in the range of $797 million to $801 million (midpoint: $799 million), while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $806.9 million. Adjusted earnings per share are projected to be between $1.35 and $1.38 (midpoint: $1.365). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.37.Equifax posted better-than-expected results for the third quarter. Earnings and revenues both recorded year-over-year growth. Moreover, its upbeat full-year guidance for earnings indicates that its growth initiatives are aimed in the right direction.Management's efforts, such as strategic initiatives for product innovation, expansion of data assets through acquisitions and continuous share gains in North America, should prove to be tailwinds. Also, the company's strong correlation with the consumer and financial markets as well as exposure in the U.S. and Europe are likely to propel growth, going ahead.However, competition from the likes of Automatic Data Processing Inc.  , Fiserv Inc.  and Moody's Corp.  , along with uncertainty in the mortgage sector, raises concerns.Currently, Equifax has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Today we look at two noteworthy recent insider buys.At Medley Capital Corporation (  ), a filing with the SEC revealed that on Friday, Director Seth Taube purchased 202,800 shares of MCC, at a cost of $7.45 each, for a total investment of $1.51M.

Going by the Zacks model, companies holding a Zacks Rank #5 are likely to underperform the broader market.There have been frequent downward estimate revisions of late. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter dropped 15.9% to $1.48 per share over the last 60 days. For fiscal 2017, one out of the two estimates was lowered over the same time frame. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was down approximately 11.1% to $6.78 per share.Moreover, DST Systems' balance sheet appears highly leveraged. The company exited second-quarter 2016 with $72.7 million in cash and equivalents compared with $73.4 million in the previous quarter. Long-term debt (including current portion) was $712.2 million compared with $721.5 million in the previous quarter.It is worth mentioning that DST has divested its Customer Communications division to focus on financial services and health care segments. During the second quarter, the company successfully sold its North American Customer Communications division to Broadridge Financial Solutions  for a cash consideration of $410 million. It has also divested its UK Customer Communications Bristol production facilities in exchange for net pretax proceeds of approximately $16 million. The proceeds from the aforementioned divestments will facilitate the acquisition of new businesses in addition to improving flexibility to capitalize on new opportunities in health care and financial services. However, all of this depends how the company utilizes these funds to drive future growth. Furthermore, loss of revenues due to divestments has made us increasingly cautious about the stock's future performance.The company faces stiff competition from the likes of Broadridge Financial Solutions' BEA, Lombardi, Savvion, and TIBCO Software, which offer their premium services at more competitive prices. Some of the company's clients are in a position to develop in-house capacity to perform transaction processing, recordkeeping and output generation services. In-house facilities of these companies could increase competition, leading to lower prices and profits for DST.Furthermore, decreasing organic revenue growth, tough competition from International Business Machines Corporation  and Fiserv Inc.  , and a high debt burden remain concerns. | Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

One interesting put contract in particular, is the March 2017 put at the $90 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.50. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 1.7% return against the $90 commitment, or a 3.1% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to FISV's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $90 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Fiserv Inc sees its shares fall 13.8% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $88.50 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.50 from $90), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.1% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Fiserv Inc, and highlighting in green where the $90 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the March 2017 put at the $90 strike for the 3.1% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Fiserv Inc (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $104.37) to be 19%.

In other words, if we look at the number of call buyers and then use the long-term median to project the number of put buyers we'd expect to see, we're actually seeing more put buyers than expected out there in  so far today.  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Most stock mutual funds, especially those that are actively managed, aim to beat one benchmark - the  index. Source: iStockPhoto.com/VadmaryHowever, the fundamental reason index funds were invented in the first place is because many of those actively managed mutual funds don't beat the S&P 500 in the long run. Still, there are a few funds that can beat the bogey in the long run.Although index funds can make smart investment choices, they're only designed to track the performance of an index, less the expenses to operate the fund.Of course past performance is no guarantee of future results, but there are a handful of mutual funds that have beaten the S&P 500 in the past and there is a reasonable expectation that they can repeat that performance in the future.So without further ado, here are three mutual funds in different categories that can perform better than the S&P 500 over time: 0.2%, or $20 per $10,000 invested annually $3,000One way to beat the S&P 500 is to buy a fund with low expenses that tracks a mid-cap index, and one of the best mutual funds to do this is  (MUTF:  ).Mid-cap stocks as a collective whole have been said to be the \"sweet spot\" of the total stock market because they tend to outperform the S&P 500 index in the long run but don't carry as much market risk as small-cap stocks.VIMSX tracks theCRSP US Mid Cap Index , which recently represented about 340 holdings like  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NYSE:  ).For example of its historic out-performance, the 10-year annualized return for VIMSX is 8.6%, whereas the S&P 500 has a return of 7.9%.When it comes to private investments, the fund held 25 at the end of April 2016, totaling $387 million in value and representing 8.5% of the $4.3 billion in total net assets. 0.77% $2,500Another good way to beat the S&P 500 index is to invest in a sector that has strong long-term potential for market leading performance and  (MUTF:  ) is one of best mutual funds to do the job.Although technology can have periods of underperformance compared to the broader market, the long-term performance for technology has trended much better than the S&P 500. The 10-year return of 14.8% for FSCSX crushes that of the S&P 500 at 7.9%.For a bit of perspective, think of some of the biggest companies in the world today and many are tech firms.For example FSCSX holdings like  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  , NASDAQ:  ), either didn't exist or were not publicly traded 15 years ago. These companies can be the large, mature leaders of the future, such as  (NASDAQ:  ), while other technologies that we can't imagine yet are sure to be the big growth stories of tomorrow. 0.76% $2,500Another sector that shows promise of beating the S&P 500 in the future is healthcare and  (MUTF:  ) is one of the best mutual funds to capture that potential.Although like many health sector funds, PRHSX has taken an recent hit in performance from a big dip in biotechnology stocks, the same strengths that made this five-star fund one of the  look to keep the fund a market-beater going forward.With an aging U.S. population and with more support from advances in health products, services and devices, PRHSX's top holdings like  (NYSE:  ),  , Inc. (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NYSE:  ), can enjoy performance that beats the S&P 500 over the next decade and beyond.One other caveat to PRHSX is that the fund has a new manager, Ziad Bakri. However, Bakri has been on the healthcare research team with T. Rowe Price for five years. Also PRHSX has changed managers in the past 10 years and the performance during that time still beats 99% of health sector funds during that time frame.In summary, to beat the S&P 500 index, investors should have a long-term outlook and therefore must be willing to see short-term periods of under-performance.Note: PRHSX is closed to new investors as of this writing.

Last quarter, it posted earnings in line with expectations. The company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.53%.Despite the earnings beat in the last quarter, Fiserv's top line ringed some warnings bells as it missed expectations. The company's sales are being negatively impacted due to lower termination fees, EMV deferral and adverse foreign currency translations.We expect sales in the to-be-reported quarter to remain muted as well. This apart, the company has a highly leveraged balance sheet. Moreover, investors should keep in mind that increasing regulations, ongoing consolidations in the banking and financial services industry and intensifying competition from peers remain pressing concerns.Nonetheless, its broad customer base especially for its Mobiliti ASP solution remains a growth driver. The company also expects revenues from base solutions like DNA, Agiliti, EMV and Now to drive growth.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Fiserv will beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.

The flagging of the markets has a lot of investors looking harder for opportunities at the stock level, which is the right strategy as we head into the end-of-the-month trading.Today's technical scan give us one bull and two bears to position in our portfolios,  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NYSE:  ) and  (NYSE:  ).This electronic payments company has been in a very long-term bullish pattern with one of the smoothest monthly trends that you can find in the S&P 500 that took Fiserv from $25 to $110 in the last five years. Year-to-date, Fiserv is outpacing the market, returning more than 12% against the 8% of the S&P 500.Short-term, Fiserv has seen some selling pressure after the company had an in-line earnings report. The selling brought shares from their all-time highs over $111 to the current $102.78, a decline of almost 10%. This move has opened a short-term bullish trading opportunity for this long-term performer.The charts show support in two ways. First, the sharp decline in shares has forced Fiserv into a technically oversold situation, suggesting that the selling pressure has likely been exhausted. We haven't seen an oversold reading like this since January 16, 2016 when the stock started a rally that shot it from $87 to $100.Second, shares are bouncing off of the $102 level. This has been identified as chart support before as Fiserv shares have found support at this price twice since May. In addition, the $102 price was resistance prior to May, strengthening the case that the $102 level should hold shares.If $102 doesn't hold, Fiserv shares have the benefit of their 200-day moving average sitting just below $100 as another source of technical support.Either way we look at it, the chart suggests that the downside on Fiserv is limited to $100 while the upside is open back to the $111.Salesforce shares have been consolidating in a tightening range since May - a range that now looks ready to squeeze the shares lower.The bottom of this range has been around the $76 level while the top has dropped from $84 in May to $82 in July. Typically, a pattern of lower highs is not good for a stock. The $76 level has held sellers at bay twice. Yesterday, the stock fell to this price, but there's more pressure for the $76 level to hold this time around.While $76 has been the bottom of the range, it is also now the site of Salesforce stock's 200-day moving average. This is one of the more widely watched trendlines by technicians. A break below $76 would now not only mean that shares had broken through the bottom of the range, but also that they had broken below the 200-day, which will bring more technical sellers into the market.Given the chart, a move below $76 will set Salesforce up for a 10% decline to $68 with potential for negative momentum to continue the drop to more secure technical support at $60.Oil prices are hovering close to the $50 level and the rally has paid off for the Oil and Energy stocks. That said, the easy money appears to have been made trading this sector and it may be time to take some profits or even short a few names.Baker Hughes is among our short-term technical bears for a few reasons.First, Baker Hughes shares just made a rapid run to try to break through their top Bollinger Band. It appears now, that the band is going to hold, signaling that the stock is more likely to regress back to its mean patter, which targets a move to $47.Second, as is normal, a fast and furious rally usually takes stocks into technically overbought territory and Baker Hughes shares are no different. The current RSI reading of 71.4 is unmatched for oversold readings over the last year. The closest was on June 6, just before the shares declined $50 to $45 and then after a short rally from $45 to $42.Momentum is still very strong for Baker Hughes shares, which means that we would consider a decline of 10% as a potential buying opportunity, especially if it were accompanied by an oversold reading from its RSI. We will monitor for this, but for now, Baker Hughes is a stock that traders should consider taking profits from as a decline appears imminent.The post ), Salesforce.com, Inc.

The figure was also up 19.6% on a year-over-year basis.Since the first quarter of 2016, the company has been making slight changes in its reportable segments. The U.S. Information Solutions (USIS) and Workforce Solutions remained unchanged, while Personal Solutions has been renamed to Global Consumer Solutions. Under the International segment, Equifax has \"created a new Asia Pacific reporting unit, including the Veda acquisition as well as TDX Australia and India operations, which previously were part of the Europe reporting unit.\"Segment-wise, total USIS revenues were up 3% year over year to $307.9 million.

On a constant-currency basis, revenues soared 62%. Growth was mainly driven by the Veda Group acquisition, which increased the Asia-Pacific's contribution to revenues to $72.3 million from $1.9 million. Moreover, the company registered an increase of 12% in Europe. However, revenues from Latin America dropped 8% while Canada's revenues were flat.Revenues from the Workforce Solutions segment surged 21% year over year to $177.3 million, primarily on the back of 17% revenue growth in Verification Services and 29% in Employer Services.Global Consumer Solutions contributed $107.3 million to the total revenue, reflecting a 21% year-over-year jump.Equifax's adjusted operating income increased 24% to $279.3 million.

Total long-term debt (excluding current portion) increased to approximately $2.5 billion from $1.88 billion at the end of first-quarter 2016 mainly due to the acquisition of Veda Group.

One of my objectives is to understand what itAAAs like to run a community bank from the perspective of executive management.Luckily, the FDIC held an all-day conference titled AAACommunity Banking: Strategies for Long-Term SuccessAAA earlier this year and posted it on its website. There are morning session and afternoon session recordings. Combined, the sessions last seven hours. I found the videos to be highly informative for strategy but also for operational fundamentals related to running a bank. The speakers included bank executives, regulators and academics. The conference focused on four themes.The morning session covered the first two topics and the afternoon session the remaining topics. Each topic was covered by a panel, and there was a Q&A session following each topic. The conference started with an introduction from FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg in which he highlighted the importance of community banks to our economy. Here are some of the interesting bits of information.The panelists for this section consist of four community bank executives and one panelist from academia. The biggest takeaway is that community banks fill a void in lending to small businesses where big banks struggle. Big banks have such a large and diverse customer population that itAAAs difficult to understand all of the types of industries to which small businesses cater. As a result, big banks reject many small business loan applications whereas community banks can be more flexible.For example, one of the panelistsRead More: About GuruFocus: GuruFocus.com tracks the stocks picks and portfolio holdings of the world's best investors.

Mobile banking is developing into an essential extension of online banking as smartphone and tablet usage continues to accelerate globally. We believe that banks and financial institutions will choose the company's innovative solutions (such as mobile wallet) in order to differentiate their services going forward. This will provide a significant growth opportunity over the long term.Also, accretive acquisitions have played an important role. In Nov 2015, the company acquired prominent financial software and technology services provider, SunGard for approximately $9.1 billion.Increasing consolidation in the banking sector, challenging environment for the Payments Solutions business and uncertain regulatory environment are the primary headwinds, in our view.

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" is set to release second-quarter 2016 earnings results on Jul 26. In the last quarter, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 6.76%. The company delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.47%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Fidelity holds a prime position in the financial and payments solutions business, primarily because of its diversified product portfolio. This apart, increasing international exposure, recurring revenue model, cost synergies from acquisitions and a loyal customer base are significant positives.We also believe that Fidelity is well positioned to benefit from increasing investments in mobile banking and innovative products such as PayNet. Also, accretive acquisitions have played an important role.However, in the past, the company witnessed weakness in its Professional Services business and sluggish demand from its large and global financial institution clients.In addition, ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties, increasing consolidation in the banking sector, challenging environment for the Payments Solutions business and uncertain regulatory environment are the primary headwinds, in our view. Also, intensifying competition from the likes of Fiserv  , Global Payments Inc.  and others remain a concern.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Fidelity National is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. Fidelity's Earnings ESP is +2.33%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 88 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 86 cents per share. Fidelity carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum. | Here is a company that, as per our model, has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Post Holdings Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of +12.77% and a Zacks Rank #1.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

One interesting put contract in particular, is the December put at the $100 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $3.70. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 3.7% return against the $100 commitment, or a 6.9% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to FISV's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $100 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Fiserv Inc sees its shares fall 5.5% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $96.30 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $3.70 from $100), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 6.9% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Fiserv Inc, and highlighting in green where the $100 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the December put at the $100 strike for the 6.9% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Fiserv Inc (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $105.92) to be 21%.

In other words, if we look at the number of call buyers and then use the long-term median to project the number of put buyers we'd expect to see, we're actually seeing more put buyers than expected out there in  so far today.  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" recently announced the pricing of senior unsecured notes aggregating $2.5 billion.

Before Thursday afternoon's earnings announcement, shares were down 25% in 2016 and 53% in the last year.For a stock that's been tied to ( ) for so long, it sure is nice to \"de-couple\" from the wearable action camera company, who's seen its shares take a beating as sales fall off an unforgiving cliff. But things may finally be starting to look up for Ambarella shareholders, especially after the company crushed earnings expectations in the fiscal first quarter. AMBA is up more than 10% in early trading today.The company, a supplier of chips that enable high-definition video recording, initially rose to prominence as a  (  ) supplier, but AM  has been punished as its largest customer started having struggles of its own.And while Ambarella's CEO still sees some \"near term headwinds\" from GoPro's weakness, the company's other business lines are doing well enough that some are even saying AMBA has finally \"  \" from GPRO, meaning the two stocks will no longer trade in sympathy.If true, that's undoubtedly a good thing for AMBA stock owners.Let's get to the numbers: Adjusted earnings per share came in at 34 cents per share, on revenue of $57.2 million. Both figures surpassed consensus  , which called for EPS of 28 cents on revenue of $57 million.The chipmaker also announced the authorization of a plan to buy back $75 million of AMBA stock over six months. That may not sound like a lot, but let's remind ourselves that Ambarella isn't  (  ), which is worth roughly 100 Ambarellas.In other words, the $75 million buyback over half a year represents 4.8% of Ambarella's $1.57 billion market capitalization. If Intel executed a similar buyback relative to its size, it would be about $7.15 billion, or $14.3 billion annualized. Currently INTC has authorized buybacks of up to $8.6  , although last year it only bought back $3 billion worth of its shares.Back to Ambarella: The idea that it could be \"decoupling\" from GPRO would be a dream come true for AMBA stock owners, and is somewhat supported by the divergent revenue estimates for each company. Wall Street expects GoPro's revenue to fall 17.6% this fiscal year, but for Ambarella's to fall just 1.5%.Admittedly, it's a little too romantic to think that AMBA will  decouple from its largest customer. GoPro's revenue cratered in its first quarter, which ran through March, falling 49.5%. Ambarella's quarter didn't overlap entirely - it ended in April - but revenue was still down 19.5%. GoPro's woes are still largely Ambarella's.However, two quotes from Ambarella CEO Fermi Wang are worth noting, and I think we can see from the price action today that markets aren't ignoring  :\"We are pleased with our execution during the first fiscal quarter of 2017, as we introduced our first 14nm IP camera SoC and continued to see strong design win momentum for our new 4K and HEVC SoC families across all market segments.\"And:\"\u2026 we remain confident of renewed revenue growth based on our technology leadership, product roadmap and the potential of our current and future markets.\" That's the ticket right there - that's the phrase that got investors going. It's also a horrible thing for people shorting AMBA stock - and there are quite a lot of them.As of mid-May, over 10 million Ambarella shares were being shorted. With average trading volume around 1 million shares per day, it would take shorts about 10 trading days to buy back in and cover their position. No doubt, a short squeeze is a big part of today's rally as well.Going forward, this could be a good inversion point for Ambarella, which remains a fundamentally strong company. Its current ratio, which measures liquidity and specifically the ability to pay back short-term obligations, sits at an absurd reading of 7.57. Ambarella could cover its short-term obligations several times over.Also, long-term debt is virtually nonexistent, sitting at $2.8 million. Ambarella could be much more aggressive and leverage itself to magnify returns if it wants to take more risk, which is a nice luxury to have.All things considered, I'm a fan of AMBA stock, which may have finally found its bottom.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["inancial transaction service company  recently announced the launch of Green Dot Money.

And that doesn't even include the newest growth area, mobile banking and financial services.Whether using a computer or a smartphone, its applications help these institutions serve their customers in a way that is most effective for each individual or organization.Its leadership in the area is obscured by the foggy initial days of the potential of the internet. For example, in 1997, before  's (  ,  ) Google and  (  ) were even founded, Fiserv was already allowing its financial clients to use e-bills to send to customers.Since those days, FISV has expanded strategically in the electronic billings and payments space to be one of the top companies in the world. It now has 13,000 clients worldwide, with over 700 solutions in 148 offices around the globe.The new growth that will be part of Fiserv's next wave is mobile payment solutions. As millennials begin to move into the workforce they are the first generation truly raised on mobile communication and transactions.Deposit a check by snapping a picture of it and sending it to your bank. Buy an item off  's (  ) webpage and pay for it through your bank or  (  ) while sitting on the beach. Allow your bank to send checks out for you through automated systems. These are all current technologies that are already used with increasing frequency by individuals as well as institutions.And the proof that this is more than just a fad is in the numbers. FISV reported for Q1 in early May and numbers prove the claims. According to  , revenue was up 4% for the quarter. In general, this was very good number because spending was off significantly in the broader market during that time.Adjusted earnings per share were up 19% - again, this is a powerful number when many companies were lucky to have even positive earnings versus the same quarter a year ago. Operating income was up 8%.Its Mobiliti ASP subscribers jumped 40% from the prior year, and 9% sequentially. This solution helps community banks and savings and loans access mobile banking platforms, transactions and services without having the costs and human resource commitments that larger national banks can more easily absorb.In the last 12 months, Fiserv stock is up more than 30%, but its growth track is far from ending. As more banks of every size look to save money by automating their services, and FISV can provide them with more solutions to do that, the bigger the general market for financial technology will be.And as the sector expands, FISV will be one of the biggest beneficiaries.The post ): This Growth Machine Is Just Getting Started appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["One of the most effective rules that we developed over the last 20 years is that it is always best to avoid the crowd when you're investing. What do we mean by that? Most investors are familiar with the contrarian idea of buying into the market when everyone else is selling and then selling when everyone has been buying.The group\u00a0I'm\u00a0talking about is what I refer to as the \"under-loved performers\". Stocks that are turning in strong performances that are among the least recommended by Wall Street analysts fall into this category. This \"rule\" is familiar because it works!The same strategy can be applied to investing in individual companies as well. One of the more effective measures to determine when the crowd has been buying too much is the stock's Wall Street analyst ranking. Historically, top-ranked stocks have tended to underperform the market and vice versa as the lower-rated stocks tend to outperform.Of course, it's not as easy as saying that if Wall Street hates a stock it's going to go up. No, you have to follow what we refer to as the \"Smart Contrarian\" approach and find those stocks that Wall Street SHOULD like, but doesn't. A backdrop of positive fundamentals and technicals is part of this contrarian calculus.A scan of our database models generated a list of companies that the analysts should be eyeing for upgrades based on their relative strength performance, strong technicals and a positive fundamental backdrop.The following are three under-loved stocks that Wall Street is overlooking.Industrial-related companies have led the market through 2016, as signs that the economy may not go into a recession are starting to build. When it comes to distribution of industrial goods,  (  ) is a leader.Grainger shares are trading 14% higher on a year-to-date basis, besting the  that sits at just over one percent. The stock's strength has it trading above intermediate- and long-term support levels, unlike a growing majority of the market that is beginning to see a technical slide. But there's one catch: Grainger stock recently moved below its 50-day trendline, which always lights-up the caution light for technical traders.Look at the Grainger operations and the fundamentals are bullish. Operating and profit margins that are among the strongest in their peer group and the company just raised their dividend 4.3% after announcing earnings results that beat the Street's expectations by 12%.Despite strength in the shares, Grainger stock is only recommended as a buy by 25% of the analysts that are currently covering the stock. The last upgrade came on April 5 when BMO Capital Markets initiated the stock as \"Outperform\" with a price target of $300.Analysts in the hold and sell camp will likely feel the pressure of this one getting away from them, resulting in some upgrades that will help Grainger shares move higher.For the life of it, we can't figure out how  (  ) continues to stump the analysts. Currently, 25% of the group has the stock ranked a buy, while the other 75% are sitting on the fence as holds. You know how many analysts recommended the stock as a buy last year at this time? Twenty-seven percent. FISV stock is trading 30% higher now.Technically, the stock is a leader. Year-to-date returns are over 14.5% and the shares have only had two short periods where they weren't pacing faster than the broad market.Furthermore, Fiserv's earnings announcement at the beginning of May beat analyst expectations \u2026 again. The company hasn't fallen short on the earnings side in the last two years. Despite the huge rally, FISV stock's forward price-to-earnings ratio is 21, putting it right in the middle of its peer group.We're expecting the continued relative strength of Fiserv shares to generate some upgrades and higher price targets with our own target of $120 during 2016.The utility sector continues to garner attention as interest rates show no decisive outlook for 2016. The debate between one hike and two has income investors still looking at dividend-yielding stocks to help fill the income gap. (  ) shares have been a leader against the market over the last year, while lagging many of its peer stocks. Shares have accumulated gains of 4% over the last 12 months against a slight loss of 1% for the S&P 500. The company announced earnings results that fell short of analyst expectations by a penny - a trend that has been seen through much of the utility sector.In addition to low analyst expectations, the short sellers have been very active on DUK stock. Currently, the short interest ratio for the shares sits at 8.3, which adds a potential short-term catalyst for the stock. A break above the $80 level is likely to initiate a short covering rally that will also bolster prices.Despite the earnings miss, expect to see a strong technical trend continue as investors march towards dividend-yielding stocks in 2016.

Last quarter, it posted in-line earnings. It is noteworthy that Fiserv has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.69%.Fiserv commands a leading position in the financial and payment solutions business driven by its strong customer base and various contract wins from the likes of Citizens Bank, U.S. Bank and Swift. Additionally, Fiserv continues to add retail and business clients to its Mobiliti ASP solutions, which are expected to drive growth. With over four million users on Mobiliti ASP, it remains a major growth driver.Accretive acquisitions have been a key growth factor for Fiserv over the years. Recently, the company completed the acquisition of ACI Worldwide Community Financial Services business (announced in Jan 2016 and including employees, contracts, IP and technology assets) in an all cash deal valued at $200 million. Though the details aren't available as of yet, Fiserv expects ACI's CFS business, which adds to its digital banking and electronic payments solutions, to be accretive to financials beginning 2017.However, investors should keep in mind that increasing regulations in the banking and financial services industry and intensifying competition from the likes of Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.  and others remain pressing concerns.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Fiserv will beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Ranks #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Fiserv has an earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.02. Fiserv currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP.

After conquering the world, where else can it go?That's a question being closely monitored by the markets. If things don't turn around quickly for GOOGL stock, it's staring at a 3% loss for the second quarter or worse. This isn't the follow-up Alphabet needed to a recent  that broke a three-win streak.Can the king regain the throne?Click to EnlargeThe key here is the context of Alphabet's nearer-term troubles. Earnings results for GOOGL stock in Q1 of fiscal year 2016 weren't bad by any means.According to  , \"Alphabet earned $7.50 per share on $16.47 billion in revenue.\" Year-over-year, this translates into a 16% gain on earnings per share, and a 17% improvement on revenue.As Brumley points out, there are a slew of companies that will take double-digit growth in any income category. However, GOOG failed to meet Wall Street's lofty expectations and paid a big price in the markets shortly thereafter.Of course, the company is by no means taking this lying down. On Wednesday, Alphabet launched Google Express - a delivery service-matching retailers to customers - in the  .GOOGL is eager to expand this venture, with additional markets in Texas and Oklahoma on their sights. While it won't wrest control of the e-commerce sector from  . (  ) overnight, it's a signal of intent by GOOG that they're willing to wade in to contested territory.This is especially relevant considering Amazon's \"Echo\" project, a digitalized  that is powered through artificial intelligence technologies. While artificial intelligence tech seems to be more Google's fare, AMZN is coming to market first.Despite claims from GOOGL management that the impact of such an advantage is often exaggerated, it's not unreasonable to speculate that they feel threatened. The recent high profile  of Sam Schillace - former senior vice president of engineering for  (  ) - to drive improvements in their cloud computing division reflects this unease.Click to EnlargeThe markets might be reacting to those concerns. GOOGL stock has failed to impress, trending sideways to a year-to-date performance down 4%.Worrisome for investors is the inability to break past upper resistance at the psychological $800 level. However, it may be premature to call GOOGL a bust.Historically, Alphabet has trended in a step-wise pattern in the markets. This is characterized by a strong uptrend, followed by a relatively lengthy sideways consolidation. Also, the price action for GOOGL is still inside a bullish trend channel. Only if it breaks below support would a red flag be raised.Further, the inability of GOOGL stock to get anything going in the last two months doesn't necessarily spell disaster. In fact, this would be the third consecutive time in Q2 that the stock has fallen against the prior quarter. And from 2010 to 2012, GOOG has gone negative in the markets in Q2. Yet, only one time did Alphabet go underwater for the year, back in 2014.Those that are overly pessimistic on GOOGL stock may also be failing to account for the company's utter dominance in the online advertising market. Combined with  (  ), the two internet titans  of this lucrative area.Better yet, business continues to grow. Even though the profitability margin per advertisement has fallen, the total number of advertisements has risen substantially. This is primarily due to the rapid expansion of smart devices, which typically feature greater user engagement.In other words, GOOGL isn't going anywhere.Sure, some investors may no longer feel comfortable with the company's premium valuation, and they've gotten out at an ideal time. But fundamentally, Alphabet has a very strong business.They're also aggressively expanding into other markets, helping to ensure that they're not too levered on any one area. Until we see compelling evidence to the contrary, GOOGL stock is merely taking an extended break.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["hares of premium technology, engineering, procurement and construction company  rallied 3.2% on Apr 29, following impressive first-quarter 2016 earnings performance.KBR maintained its earnings streak for the fifth consecutive quarter with adjusted earnings of 30 cents surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 27 cents by 11.1%. Meanwhile, the earnings figure was in line with the year-ago tally.KBR's bottom-line performance was boosted by its relentless focus on operational execution, margin improvement and operating expense reduction. However, high legal expenses offset earnings growth while the dismal revenue performance proved to be a drag.Revenues fell 30.6% year over year to $996 million, owing to absence of revenues from the deconsolidation of certain businesses in 2015. Also, low  have been restricting the capital spending by clients which in turn compounded the top-line decline. Also, revenues lagged the consensus mark of $1,064 million by 6.4%.Segment-wise,  revenues were up 34.7% year over year to $97 million on the back of increased proprietary equipment sales and $10 million inorganic revenue growth from the previously completed acquisitions.Additionally,  revenues soared 35.5% to $210 million on a year-over-year basis. Revenues benefited from the solid performance of the base operating contracts and task orders supporting the U.S. Military.However,  revenues deteriorated 38% year over year to $606 million. Reduced activities in a major LNG project and several other projects as they approach completion hurt segmental revenues. Also, deconsolidation of KBR's Americas Industrial Services business proved to be a major headwind.Also, non-strategic business revenues plummeted 64.2% year over year to $83 million owing to lower revenues from two recently completed power projects as well as divestiture of the Building Group business in second-quarter 2015. Also, remaining power projects are scheduled to be completed by 2017 that signals at a revenue decline for this segment going ahead.As of Mar 31, 2016, the company's total backlog was $12.0 billion, up a decent 16.8% on a year-over-year basis. Of the total backlog, about $6.9 billion is booked under the Government Services segment (up 331.2% on a y-o-y basis) and around $4.6 billion under the Engineering & Construction segment (down 40% on a y-o-y basis). While Technology and Consulting accounted for $394 million of the backlog (flat on a year-over-year basis), non-strategic Business had $165 million in backlog (down 76.6%).Concurrent with the earnings release, KBR declared that it is progressing with its plans to achieve $200 million in annual cost savings in 2016 and has identified more than $180 million of the target at the end of first-quarter 2016. Furthermore, the company is strategically pursuing its restructuring activities and has incurred $2 million in pre-tax restructuring costs during the first quarter of 2016.Also, sale of assets associated with the Infrastructure business during the fourth quarter of 2015 helped the company garner $4 million in pre-tax gains. Going forward, KBR plans to continue with its portfolio restructuring actions and thereby channelize resources specifically into the International Government Services and Global Hydrocarbons segments to maximize profits.In addition, KBR and its joint venture (JV) partner won a \u00a3500 million worth of procurement, operations and maintenance contract from the U.K. Ministry of Defence's Fixed Wing Training system. Per the contract, the company has provided $14 million in cash to the JV. This long-term project will be booked as equity in earnings over an 18-year period.As of Mar 31, 2016, KBR's cash and equivalents were $824 million, down from $883 million as of Dec 31, 2015.As of Mar 31, 2016, cash flow used in operating activities during the quarter totaled $21 million, compared with cash utilization of $108 million as of Dec 31, 2015.KBR has reiterated its guidance for full-year 2016. The company expects earnings per share within $1.20 to $1.45, excluding legal costs associated with the legacy U.S. government contracts. Legal costs are projected at around $15 million or $0.11 per share for 2016.KBR's ability to sustain its earnings streak over the past few quarters bears a testimony to the company's diligent restructuring actions. Going forward, KBR believes that its Government Services will continue to act as a strong growth driver as continues to enhance technical knowhow and advance support services to intelligence agencies. Overall, the company's lucrative contract wins and its ability to execute large-scale logistics and project management services efficiently adds to its strength and is expected to boost its financials. In addition, the company's capital allocation strategies and partnerships are expected to propel growth in the forthcoming quarters.Despite these positives, KBR's precipitous revenue decline over the past few quarters owing to macroeconomic concerns are putting the company's financials under pressure. Also, the slump in oil prices are compounding the challenges for the hydrocarbons markets, thereby thwarting top-line performance.KBR currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the broader sector include TransUnion  , Omnicom Group Inc.  and Fiserv, Inc.  .

Adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in a range of $3.70 to $3.80, representing an increase of 15% to 18% over 2015 levels.Fidelity's commanding position in the financial services market, increasing international exposure, recurring revenue model, diversified product portfolio, cost synergies from acquisitions and a loyal customer base are significant positives.Moreover, we believe that Fidelity is well positioned to benefit from increasing investment in mobile banking and innovative products such as PayNet. Mobile banking is developing into an essential extension of online banking as smartphone and tablet usage continue to accelerate globally.Also, accretive acquisitions have played an important role. In Nov 2015, the company acquired prominent financial software and technology services provider, SunGard for approximately $9.1 billion. The new company is expected to generate pro forma revenues of $9.3 billion in a year with employee strength of 55K.However, in the past, the company witnessed weakness in its Professional Services business and sluggish demand from its large and global financial institution clients.

The company's adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.23 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.16 and jumped 15% year over year.Equifax's revenues of $728.3 million came ahead of both the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $689 million and management's guidance range of $685-$695 million. Additionally, the figure soared 11.7% year over year.From the first quarter onward, the company has been making slight changes in its reportable segments. The U.S. Information Solutions (USIS) and Workforce Solutions remained unchanged, while the name of Personal Solutions has been changed to Global Consumer Solutions. Under the International segment, Equifax has \"created a new Asia Pacific reporting unit, including the Veda acquisition as well as TDX Australia and India operations, which previously were part of the Europe reporting unit.\"Segment-wise, total USIS revenues were up 4% year over year to $294.9 million. Among its sub-segments, revenue growth was recorded in Online Information Solutions (5%), Mortgage Solutions Services (1%) and Financial Marketing Services (1%).International revenues (including Europe, the Asia-Pacific, Canada and Latin America) surged 17% year over year to $158.1 million. Moreover, on a constant currency basis, revenues climbed 30%. The company registered an increase of 10% in Europe. However, revenues from Latin America and Canada tanked 11% and 10%, respectively.Revenues from the Workforce Solutions segment surged 21% year over year to $180.1 million, primarily on the back of revenue growth of 16% in Verification Services and 29% in Employer Services.Global Consumer Solutions contributed $95.2 million to the total revenue, reflecting a 14% year-over-year jump.Equifax's adjusted operating income increased 23.2% to $222.7 million. Consequently, adjusted operating margin expanded 290 basis points (bps) to 30.6%. Adjusted net income came in at $148.9 million or $1.23 per share, as against $129.7 million or $1.07 per share reported a year ago.Equifax exited the quarter with $96.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared with $93.3 million at the end of fourth-quarter 2015. Total long-term debt (excluding current portion) was approximately $1.88 billion. During the quarter, Equifax generated cash flow of $90.3 million from operational activities. The company paid $39.7 million as dividends in the first quarter.Buoyed by strong first-quarter results, Equifax raised its guidance for the full year. The company now expects revenues between $3.05 billion and $3.15 billion (midpoint: $3.10 billion), up from the earlier projection of $3.0-$3.1 billion (midpoint: $3.05 billion). The revenue outlook at the midpoint is above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.051 billion.Adjusted earnings per share are now forecasted between $5.15 and $5.25 (midpoint: $5.20), up from previous projection of $4.95-$5.05 (midpoint: $5.00). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged slightly higher at $5.04.Coming to the second-quarter outlook, Equifax projects revenues in the range of $795 million to $805 million (midpoint: $800 million), while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $791 million. Adjusted earnings per share are forecasted between $1.34 and $1.36 (midpoint: $1.35). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at $1.32.Equifax posted better-than-expected results for the first quarter, which also grew year over year. Moreover, the company issued an encouraging outlook for 2016, wherein both revenues and earnings guidance were above the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate at the midpoint.Management's efforts, such as strategic initiatives for product innovation, expansion of data assets through acquisitions and continuous share gains in North America, should provide tailwinds. Also, the company's strong correlation with the consumer and financial markets as well as exposure in the U.S. and Europe are likely to propel growth, going ahead.However, competition from the likes of Automatic Data Processing Inc.  , Fiserv Inc.  Moody's Corp.  and uncertainty in the mortgage sector raise concerns.Currently, Equifax has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

One of the major reasons behind this could be the company's better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2015 results that also improved year over year. Also, an encouraging first-quarter and full-year 2016 outlook drove the shares higher.Notably, the company has gained over 22% since it reported fourth-quarter results on Feb 10. Its adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.14 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.11 and surged 11.5% from the year-ago quarter mainly backed by 6.7% revenue growth.In fact, Equifax has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 3.95%. Backed by the strong results, the company has issued an encouraging outlook for both the first quarter and the full year.Furthermore, some of the optimism surrounding the stock may be attributed to the company's strong correlation to consumer and financial markets as well as its U.S. and European exposure, which is seeing a gradual uptick. Moreover, strategic initiatives, such as product innovation, expansion of data assets through acquisitions and continuous share gains in North America, are encouraging.Equifax has pursued strategic acquisitions to supplement its core business. Most recently, the company acquired Veda Group Limited, a leading Australian credit information provider, in a transaction that should be accretive to its bottom line in the long run.In 2014, Equifax had acquired two companies, namely TDX Group, a UK-based debt-management firm, and Forseva, a provider of cloud-based credit management software solutions. The company expects to derive 1-2% revenue growth from these buyouts over the long term.Apart from these efforts, Equifax also expands internationally through joint ventures that contain its operating costs and do not require integration time while diversifying the revenue source.The company's policies of regular dividends and share repurchases also keep investors interested in the stock. During 2015, the company paid $137.8 million as dividend and repurchased shares worth $196.3 million.However, stiff competition and a highly leveraged balance sheet are its primary concerns.Equifax currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other well-ranked stocks in the same space are Green Dot Corporation  , Fiserv Inc.  and Total System Services Inc.  . While Green Dot sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Fiserv and Total System Services have the same Zacks Rank as Equifax.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The company routinely generates single-digit sales gains and low-double-digit earnings growth, aided by share buybacks.Following the Fed's rate hike last year and forecasts for fatter industry tech budgets, more of the same could be in store despite worries over a downturn and consolidation, the company and analysts say. That's due primarily to a steady income base.\"When you have 85% of revenue recurring, it gives them a very good visibility into their numbers,\" helping enable more accurate guidance and minimizing surprises when earnings season rolls around, Monness Crespi Hardt analyst Alexander Veytsman told Investor's Business Daily.\"They do increase pricing, but given the longevity of those contracts and given the fact that these clients have been with them for a number of years, I would say they're growing it slowly and steadily,\" Veytsman said.The nature of the company's contracts with clients helps Fiserv maintain its firm footing. Many deals are longer-term and retention is high, Morningstar notes in its research on the company. In addition, it's costly and potentially hugely disruptive for financial companies to switch from one core-processing service to another, helping Fiserv keep customers in the fold.And even amid Wall Street's hand-wringing over a possible recession, Chief Executive Jeffery Yabuki told IBD that he sees the trends in tech spending among Fiserv's own clients continuing.\"Most of our revenue is based on non-discretionary, mission-critical technologies under longer term contracts and is not subject to dramatic fluctuation,\" he said via email. \"We are seeing stable and growing demand for newer technologies that enhance experiences in the increasingly digital world.\"Brookfield, Wis.-based Fiserv serves 13,000 banks, credit unions, retailers and other clients around the world. If you've withdrawn money from an automated teller or transferred a balance from one account to another, there's a good chance it went smoothly in part because of Fiserv.Created in 1984 through a merger, Fiserv handles everything from transaction processing to data analysis to person-to-person payment systems. With this year's technology spending seen growing 4%-5% among banks and credit-union customers -- Fiserv's bread and butter -- the company is set to follow, Argus Research says.\"We believe that Fiserv remains well positioned to benefit from technology infrastructure spending among its primary customers (banks and credit unions), many of whom are working to improve processing efficiency for online bill payment and debit card transactions,\" Argus analyst Stephen Biggar said in a research note last month.\"This should help revenue to keep rising at a modest mid-single-digit pace,\" Biggar said, adding that Argus sees 5.5% in sales growth this year.Shares are up 25% over the past 12 months. The company has a Composite Rating of 93 out of a best-possible 99, boosted most recently by its strong fourth-quarter results that were marked by better-than-expected operating margins.The company also has tried to stay relevant through acquisitions. In 2011, Fiserv snapped up mobile banking company M-Com and digital payments outfit CashEdge, which gave it Popmoney, a bank-based person-to-person payments system for participating institutions that has helped drive sales growth. The company in 2013 announced that it acquired Open Solutions, giving it real-time account-processing technology.\"You don't need a new product every day,\" Biggar said, \"but you need something fairly significant every 2-3 years that would have its own sort of life cycle.\"Last month, Fiserv said the United Nations Federal Credit Union for U.N. employees, among the largest in the U.S. by assets, will begin using Fiserv's core account-processing technology. Analysts say the Federal Reserve's rate hike in December could help strengthen banks' finances, potentially freeing up cash for their technology budgets.\"We view the Fed rate increase for the first time in a decade as good news for banks and a way to help fund needed increases in IT spend, as institutions look for ways to keep up with the broad changes across the technology landscape,\" CEO Yabuki said on the company's fourth-quarter  last month.Some concern persists that Fiserv could make less money if consolidation continues within the banking industry, either due to tightening regulations or an event like the 2008 financial crisis. Mergers and acquisitions could reduce client count and give those bigger, combined companies more muscle in negotiating cheaper contract prices with companies like Fiserv.However, the reduction in clients hasn't materialized, Veytsman said, and the prospect of more banks bringing tech operations in-house seems unlikely. Fiserv counts  (  ) among its big clients, potentially signaling a stronger shift to outsourcing among larger banks.Monness Crespi's Veytsman said consolidation could actually accelerate the trend of tech outsourcing.\"When they consolidate they also look to see what's happening with the bottom line and what they're doing around the costs,\" he said. \"And if someone was not considering using Fiserv as a client, maybe together, they will.\"Yabuki sees consolidation continuing, but stressed that the number of accounts and transactions has kept rising for the company.Foreign exchange amid a stronger dollar could also hurt the company, although its international exposure is limited, Veytsman said. Jack Henry & Associates and FIS are among the company's primary competitors. Concern also lingers about Fiserv's debt, although Yabuki cites the company's $1-billion-plus free cash flow last year.Still, both Biggar and Veytsman say the company's acquisitions have been relatively focused and restrained.And one might be forgiven for wondering whether a person-to-person service like Popmoney can compete with  (  ) Venmo, or payment-tech offerings from  (  ),  (  ) and, potentially,  (AAPL).However, Yabuki said P2P was in the early innings. And Veytsman said Popmoney is intended more as a side dish in its offerings to midcap banks than a main course.\"It's very hard to challenge PayPal,\" he said.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["here are numerous companies on the stock market that engage in cool, funky activities.  is not one of them. The company provides software solutions for banks and other financial enterprises that need to keep track of their money.It's been a reliable business for the company in spite of its seeming dullness. But the software ecosystem develops quickly, so can this last? Let's explore whether FIS's business is safe enough to consider investing in the stock.IMAGE SOURCE: FIDELITY NATIONAL INFORMATION SERVICESFIS is the dominant player in its segment. According to the company's website, it's \"the world's largest global provider dedicated to banking and payments technologies.\"It basically facilitates the IT functions that allow financial companies to conduct their operations, which can mean anything from ATM network services to treasury solutions, and everything in between. Essentially, whatever your bank does, FIS can provide the digital backbone for it.Although it isn't a well-known brand, it's nearly everywhere on planet Earth, being active in more than 130 nations and boasting over 20,000 clients. It's got a spot on the Fortune 500 (  's list of the 500 largest companies in the U.S. ranked by revenue), and is a component of the S&P 500 index.Any reasonably modern financial institution needs the kinds of products FIS specializes in, so the demand for those goods is fairly secure and steady. Revenue has grown quite consistently over the years, rising by nearly 20% from fiscal 2011 to 2015. Gross income has followed a similar trajectory. Although the bottom line has been more choppy due to items like interest expense, the company consistently lands in the black.What helps greatly is that much of the company's business is apparently of the repeat variety; banks like to lock in a reliable provider for these services. In its most recent 10K annual filing, FIS stated that \"A significant percentage of FIS' business with our customers relates to core processing applications and services provided under multi-year, recurring contracts.\"Recurring revenue is the gift that keeps on giving. It provides a strong foundation for a company's operations, and helps give it the financial muscle to pay dividends (FIS's yields 1.62% currently), buy back shares, and grow the portfolio with the occasional acquisition. In the case of FIS, its most recent buy was a $9.1 billion (including debt assumption) deal in cash and stock for SunGard, a fellow payment technology solutions specialist.The SunGard buy, which closed last November, is a big one for FIS. At a stroke, it'll boost the top line by nearly 50%, although net profitability might take a hit for some time due to the new asset's heavy indebtedness (around $4.7 billion in long-term borrowings as of last year).Regardless, it scales up FIS's business considerably, and it's complementary enough to be integrated relatively painlessly. Absorbing it will put the new owner even further ahead of rivals in the payment services game such as  and  . With SunGard, FIS stands to take in over $9 billion in annual revenue; Fiserv booked a little over $5.2 billion in 2015, while DST Services amassed $2.8 billion.By the way, FIS pays out a more generous dividend than its rivals. Its $0.26-per-quarter distribution yields 1.6% at the current stock price, compared to DST Services' 1.1%. Fiserv does not pay a dividend at the moment.So, no, FIS isn't the hottest or prettiest whiz-bang company on the market. But it provides a slate of crucial services that banks want and need, and are apparently eager to have the company provide them for years at a stretch. This is a good business to be in, and FIS operates in it very effectively. As such, its stock feels very safe to me.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

As of Friday, Apr 29, 2016, we have had results from 310 S&P 500 members or 72.8% of the index's total market capitalization. Total earnings for these index members are down 7.2% from the same period last year on 2.4% lower revenues.Notably, despite the pull back in estimates, the technology and finance sectors have disappointed investors. The first quarter results for the technology sector were marred by weaker-than-expected numbers from behemoths like Apple  , Microsoft  and Alphabet  while low interest rates weighed on finance companies' core lending margins and macro uncertainties dragged down their trading and investment banking businesses.Tech sector total earnings of the companies, representing 85.3% of the sector's total market capitalization in the S&P 500 index, were down 5.9% on 0.7% higher revenues. Finance sector total earnings of the companies, representing 72.7% of the sector's total market capitalization in the S&P 500 index, were down 5.5% on 2.4% lower revenues.Let's take a look at how Fiserv and other financial services stocks are poised ahead of their scheduled announcements. Brookfield, WI based Fiserv provides financial services technology solutions to over 16,000 clients worldwide in the banking, insurance, healthcare and investment industries. The company's broad customer base and strong contact wins are positives along with accretive acquisitions. However, tightening regulations in banking and intensifying competition can thwart the company's growth prospects. Currently, Fiserv carries a 0.00% ESP which when combined with Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) makes it difficult to predict earnings beat. (Read:  ). : Fidelity's commanding position in the financial services market, increasing international exposure, recurring revenue model, diversified product portfolio, cost synergies from acquisitions and a loyal customer base are significant positives. However, the business has been impacted by sluggish demand for people-based professional services from its large and global financial institution clients. Currently, Fidelity's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and earnings ESP of +2.70% make us reasonably confident in looking for an earnings beat this quarter. (Read:  ) Western Union's key business, Consumer-to-Consumer, is likely to have witnessed growth in the to-be-reported quarter owing to the healthy rise in worldwide immigration. Even International markets are expected to perform well due to its superior brand value and the lower level of competition it faces compared to the U.S. Nonetheless, challenging global economic growth and currency volatility, high compliance and investment costs are anticipated to mar the company's bottom line. Currently, Western Union has a 0.00% ESP which when combined with a Zacks Rank #2 makes it difficult to predict earnings beat. (Read:  )We do not expect much change in the general trend observed so far this earnings season. Despite widespread growth challenges, there have been numerous positive surprises, especially on the revenue front, as low expectations have provided an easy-to-beat hurdle for most companies.

Earnings improved 8.1% over the prior-year quarter figure of 37 cents.Moreover, the company raised its earnings and revenue guidance for fiscal 2016.The company reported non-GAAP earnings of 48 cents a share, up from 44 cents in the prior-year quarter.Revenues of $514 million increased 5.5% year over year and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $500 million. Sales were also better than management's projection of $500 million. The year-over-year upside was primarily driven by strong performance by the both the segments despite the weakness in most of the geographical regions except North America.System revenues (65.7% of total revenue) increased 7.7% year over year to $337.6 million. Rest of the revenues came from the Services division which inched up 1.8% year over year to $175.9 million.Revenues from North America increased 47% year over year to $235.7 million. The company's Petrol and small and medium business verticals posted solid growth in the quarter. In addition, the company continues to witness increased demand for EMV devices and services (including mPOS demand as well).Revenues from Latin America declined 22.9% year over year to $54.8 million. Unfavorable economic environment in Brazil, especially in regions like Argentina, Mexico and Chile, was the primary reason behind the decline.Revenues from EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) fell 5.4% from the year-ago quarter to $170.3 million. However, the company's business in Western Europe exhibited growth.Asia Pacific revenues plummeted 29.5% year over year to $52.7 million. The business was primarily impacted by the ongoing sluggishness in China which completely offset the growth in Australia, New Zealand and India.The company's adjusted gross margin improved 50 basis points (bps) year over year to 42.7%.Operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, declined 130 bps year over year to 34.9%. VeriFone's operating margin in the quarter came was 7%, up 220 bps on a year over year basis.As of Jan 31, 2016, VeriFone had approximately $185.7 million in cash compared with $208.9 million as of Oct 31, 2015. Long-term debt totaled $883.2 million at the end of the quarter.Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $63.2 million compared with $41.4 million in the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, free cash flow was $33 million in the quarter. VeriFone repurchased nearly $80 million worth of stocks in the first quarter.VeriFone provided its guidance for the second quarter and updated its outlook for fiscal 2016.The company projects non-GAAP revenues of approximately $530 million and non-GAAP earnings per share at 51-52 cents for the second quarter.For fiscal 2016, the company estimates non-GAAP revenues between $2.150 billion and $2.170 billion (earlier projection was $2,090 million to $2,110 million). Non-GAAP earnings per share are likely to be within $2.21 and $2.24 (up from prior expectation of $2.15 to $2.17).Region-wise, VeriFone expects revenue growth of 6% in North America as against 5% projected earlier. The guidance raise comes on the back of sizable EMV upgrade, SMB and greenfield opportunities. The company continues to expect mid single-digit revenue growth in EMEA and Asia Pacific whereas Latin American revenues are likely to remain flat or decline.Notably, the guidance takes into account the synergies from the acquisitions of InterCard AG and AJB Software Design Inc.VeriFone seems well-positioned to gain from the ongoing demand shift toward EMV and NFC-enabled terminals. Increasing adaptability of new payment solutions from Apple  , Alphabet  and Samsung in the mobile payment industry is a major positive for VeriFone.Additionally, the company is focused on increasing its operational efficiency through the adoption of a number of cost-cutting and streamlining measures. Moreover, accretive acquisitions have played an important role in VeriFone's business expansion. Over the past few months, the company acquired Curb, InterCard AG and AJB Software Design which are expected to drive growth. While the company boosted its presence in the \"taxi network of card acceptance\" with Curb, it expanded service offerings by leveraging InterCard's retail clientele across Europe. On the other hand, VeriFone is poised to benefit from AJB Software Design's payment gateway and switching solutions over the long haul.Nonetheless, VeriFone faces significant competition from a number of local providers in the domestic, international as well as emerging markets of China and India. At the same time, we believe that the company's highly leveraged balance sheet can limit its developmental activities.Currently, VeriFone carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). A better-ranked stock in the same space is Fiserv, Inc.  with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download  .

Adjusted earnings per share are expected to lie in the range of $3.70 to $3.80, representing an increase of 15% to 18% over 2015 levels.Fidelity's commanding position in the financial services market, increasing international exposure, recurring revenue model, diversified product portfolio, cost synergies from acquisitions and a loyal customer base are significant positives.Fidelity has been forming strategic partnerships with firms like Fifth Third Bank and American Blue Ribbon Holdings, which are expected to drive growth, going forward. Also, the company's initiatives to share profits with its investors like the recent dividend hike are positives.Moreover, we believe that Fidelity is well positioned to benefit from increasing investment in mobile banking and innovative products such as PayNet. Mobile banking is developing into an essential extension of online banking as smartphone and tablet usage continue to accelerate globally.Also, accretive acquisitions have played an important role. Acquisitions such as that of Metavante and Capco not only expanded its product and solutions portfolio but also provided significant synergies that drove top and bottom-line growth. In Nov 2015, the company acquired prominent financial software and technology services provider, SunGard for approximately $9.1 billion. The new company is expected to generate pro forma revenues of $9.3 billion in a year with employee strength of 55K.However, in the past the company witnessed weakness in its Professional Services business and sluggish demand from its large and global financial institution clients. In addition, increasing consolidation in the banking sector, challenging environment for the Payments Solutions business and uncertain regulatory environment are the primary headwinds, in our view. Also, intensifying competition from the likes of Fiserv  , Global Payments Inc.  and Alliance Data Systems Corp.  remains a concern.Currently, Fidelity has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Moreover, unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations impacted segmental revenues. Also, a volatile market negatively impacted the ALPS business.Healthcare Services operating revenues were down 3.3% on a year-over-year basis and came in at $98.4 million, primarily due to lower pharmacy claims.Customer Communications (previously Output Solutions) operating revenues were up 1.8% year over year to $150.3 million.

The company also declared a quarterly dividend of 33 cents per share (an increase of 10% quarter over quarter).DST reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, wherein both the top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Going forward, we are still of the opinion that DST Systems' business volume and massive scale of operation in Financial Services will attract new customers. Moreover, we expect steady contributions from acquisitions to support revenue growth. Continued share buybacks and dividend payments are the other encouraging factors.On the other hand, decreasing organic revenue growth, tough competition from IBM Corp.  and Fiserv Inc.  , and a high debt burden remain concerns.Currently, DST Systems carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the technology space is MeetMe, Inc.  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The stock closed at $113.61, representing a year-to-date return of 41.3%. The average trading volume for the last three months aggregated approximately 635K.An impressive track record of surpassing quarterly earnings expectations, an upbeat full-year 2015 earnings outlook, solid cash flow and continuous share buybacks and dividend payments continue to drive Equifax.Notably, Equifax beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the last four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 3.27%.In third-quarter 2015, Equifax's revenues of $678.1 million went up 8.8% year over year and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $666 million. Similarly, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.14 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.10 and jumped 12.9% from the year-ago quarter. Supported by the strong results, the company raised the full-year earnings outlook and issued encouraging fourth-quarter guidance.The regular dividends and share repurchases also keep investors interested in the stock. During the first nine months of 2015, the company paid $103.4 million as dividends and repurchased stocks worth $196.3 million.Apart from this, some of the optimism surrounding the stock may be attributed to Equifax's recent agreement to take over Veda Group Limited, the leading Australian credit information provider. Per the deal, Equifax will buy all the outstanding common stocks of Veda for AUD$2.825 each, higher than its earlier offer of AUD$2.70. If all goes well, this would be Equifax's biggest acquisition, surpassing the $1 billion CSC Credit Services buyout in 2012.Equifax has made strategic buyouts to supplement its core business. It expects to derive 1% to 2% revenue growth over the long term from TDX Group and Forseva acquired in 2014.Apart from acquisitions, Equifax is enthusiastic about joint ventures (JVs) to facilitate international expansion. JVs keep operating costs in check and need no integration time while diversifying the revenue source.To tap the immense growth opportunity in the Brazilian credit data market, Equifax merged the credit reporting operations of its Brazilian subsidiary with Boa Vista Servicos S.A., the second-largest consumer credit bureau in the country. The company expects its investments in the JVs to boost long-term growth.Also, the company's strong correlation with the consumer and financial markets as well as its exposure in the U.S. and Europe are likely to propel growth.

This also indicates disciplined working capital that can be deployed efficiently.However, increased expenses, significant exposure to interest rate risks associated with the investment of available cash and foreign exchange headwinds raise caution.

Yet, earnings of this company are anticipated to face pressure from foreign exchange volatility as well as higher incentives, rebates and expenses in the coming quarters.Currency fluctuation, along with higher volume and support incentives passed on to customers and intermediaries, might thwart expected revenue growth. Client incentives in 2016 are projected to be higher than that in fiscal 2015 due to expected renewals in 2016, and the USAA (mid-year) and Costco (late-year) conversions. This is also validated by management's estimation of incentives, as a percentage of gross revenue, of about 17.5-18.5% for fiscal 2016.The tax rate, which is expected in the low-30s, will also create as much as a 2% headwind for 2016 earnings per share.Moreover, Visa faces foreign exchange headwinds. Foreign currency is expected to adversely impact revenue by 3% in 2016. Going forward, the company's growth is predicted to remain sluggish in comparison to prior years. This is evident from its top-line growth guidance of high single-digit to low double-digit range on a constant dollar basis.At the same time, Visa faces several state and federal lawsuits related to interchange rate violation, currency conversion practices and pricing structure.A number of alternative payments systems have gained popularity in recent times, particularly in the area of Internet-based payments such as PayPal, Bill-Me-Later, etc. Given the rapid acceptance of these alternative systems, Visa may lose part of its share in the paperless payments market.Visa currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

The deal was announced in Oct 2015 and the company mentioned the receipt of regulatory approvals last week.Subsequent to closing of the acquisition, Interactive Data, which was a part of Silver Lake and Warburg Pincus has now become a wholly owned subsidiary of ICE. Since Interactive Data is a leading provider of financial market data, analytics and related trading solutions, its acquisition will allow ICE to provide data and valuation services to customers on a large scale.The transaction was valued at $5.2 billion comprising $3.65 billion cash and 6.47 million ICE common shares, valued at $1.55 billion as of Oct 23, 2015, based on the 10-day trailing volume-weighted average price of ICE shares. However, based on the 10-day trailing volume-weighted average as of Dec 10, 2015, the stock consideration of the deal is valued at $1.67 billion.To fund the cash portion of the transaction, ICE issued senior notes worth $2.5 billion in Nov 2015, comprising $1.25 billion notes due 2020 and another $1.25 billion notes due 2025. While the first set of notes carry an interest rate of 2.75%, the second set bears a 3.75% interest rate.The note issuance requires ICE to shed an aggregate of $81.25 million in the form of interest expenses, annually. Nevertheless, the company's strong financial position (evident from its strong balance sheet and cash flow statement at the end of the last reported quarter) should allow it to service debt uninterruptedly. Although debt levels and interest expenses are expected to weigh upon the company, the acquisition of Interactive Data is likely to have a much long-standing positive effect.Over the past few years there has been a rise in the demand for data and financial analysis globally. This has called for companies to upgrade themselves technologically with the appropriate tools and expertise. The aforementioned acquisition captures ICE's target of capitalizing on the market opportunities in this regard. The deal is expected to equip ICE with the right apparatus to meet the increasing demand and thereby fortifies the company's potential to achieve significant growth.ICE currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Also, shares of Equifax have been trending upward with a positive year-to-date return of over 39%.An impressive track record of surpassing quarterly earnings expectations, an upbeat full-year 2015 earnings outlook, solid cash flow and Equifax's continuous share buybacks and dividend payments remain the growth drivers.Notably, Equifax beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the last four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 3.27%. The company's third-quarter 2015 results fared better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as the year-ago level.Equifax's revenues of $678.1 million went up 8.8% year over year and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $666 million.

Supported by the strong results, the company raised the full-year earnings outlook and issued encouraging fourth-quarter guidance.The regular dividends and share repurchases also keep investors interested in the stock. During the first nine months of 2015, the company paid $103.4 million as dividends and repurchased stocks worth $196.3 million.Apart from this, some of the optimism surrounding the stock may be attributed to Equifax's recent agreement to take over Veda Group Limited, the leading Australian credit information provider. Per the deal, Equifax will buy all the outstanding common stocks of Veda for AUD$2.825 each, higher than its earlier offer of AUD$2.70.

In 2014, the company took over TDX Group and Forseva from which it expects to derive 1% to 2% revenue growth over the long term.Apart from acquisitions, Equifax has remained enthusiastic about forming joint ventures that could expand its business internationally.

However, the company's 2016 guidance was weaker than expected and resulted in nearly 3% drop in share price in the aftermarket session.The company reported non-GAAP earnings of 49 cents a share, up from 44 cents reported in the prior-year quarter.Revenues of $514 million increased 4.8% year over year and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $513 million. Revenues were also better than management's guided range of $510-$513 million. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by strong performance of the System Solutions segment.System Solutions revenues (65.9% of total revenue) increased 9% year over year to $338.9 million. Services revenues (34.1% of total revenue), however, fell 2.4% to $175.2 million.Non GAAP revenues from North America increased 54.3% year over year to $229.9 million. Sales of mobile products and security solutions remained strong in the reported quarter.Revenues from Latin America declined 23.5% year over year to $62.8 million. Unfavorable economic environment in Brazil was the primary reason.Revenues from EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) declined 13.3% from the year-ago quarter to $164.2 million. However, the company's business in Western Europe exhibited growth.Asia Pacific revenues plummeted 18.4% year over year to $57.3 million.The company's non-GAAP gross margin improved 110 basis points (bps) year over year to 43.4%.Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased 230 bps to 35.5% from 33.2% reported in the prior-year quarter. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses was due to higher general and administrative expenses in the quarter.Operating margin for the quarter came in at 14.8%.At the end of the quarter, VeriFone had approximately $208.9 million in cash compared with $250.2 million as of Oct 31, 2014. Long term debt was $760.2 million, down from $836.6 million as of Oct 31, 2014.Cash flow from operations for the year ended Oct 31, 2015, was $249.3 million compared with $199.1 million in the prior-year period. Free cash flow for the year improved 25.2% on a year- over-year basis to $142.9 million. VeriFone repurchased $100 million worth of stock in fiscal 2015.VeriFone expects non-GAAP revenues of approximately $500 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Management expects non-GAAP earnings per share to be 45 cents in the quarter.For fiscal 2016, the company expects non-GAAP revenues to be between $2,090 million and $2,110 million. Earnings are expected within the $2.15 to $2.17 per share range. As per regions, VeriFone expects North America to see a revenue growth of 5% as against 3% projected earlier driven by sizable EMV upgrade, SMB and greenfield opportunities. EMEA and Asia pacific will witness mid single digit revenue growth whereas revenues will either remain flat or decline for the Latin American region.Capex is expected to be $110 million for the fiscal while free cash flow is expected to be $175 million.VeriFone seems well positioned to gain from the ongoing demand shift towards EMV and NFC capable terminals. In fact, about a 30% increase in the EMV terminals market is expected after the EMV chip card fraud liability shift that came into effect this October. Thereafter, it has become mandatory for merchants to install EMV-capable terminals to enhance payment security. Furthermore, the company is benefiting from the presence of tech giants like Apple Inc.  , Alphabet, Inc  and Samsung in the mobile payments industry.Additionally, the company is also focused on increasing its operational efficiency by taking a number of cost-cutting and streamlining measures. This has increased margins over the past few quarters.Nonetheless, VeriFone faces significant competition from a number of local providers in the domestic, international as well as emerging markets such as China and India. At the same time, we believe VeriFone's highly leveraged balance sheet can limit its developmental activities.Currently, VeriFone carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Shares seem to have gained from the recent tie-ups and agreements forged by the company and strong third-quarter earnings results with raised 2015 top- and bottom-line estimates.Over the past 52 weeks, Total System shares have gained 67.8%, significantly higher than the gain of 0.1% by the S&P 500 index.In Oct 2015, the company signed a new five-year contract with Tangerine Bank in Canada and a new seven-year contract with Atlanticus Holdings formally known as CompuCredit. Recently, it also signed contract extensions with Premiere Bank, ING Bank, Metro Bank, First Hawaiian Bank and Servis1st Bank.The company also launched Apple Pay in the U.K. and TSYS was the only third-party issuer processor ready for the delivery of this major payments event. The company is now supporting 24 clients in North America and the U.K. for Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay and is expecting to add several more by year end.Investors are also impressed by the company's ability to integrate and derive synergies from the acquisition of NetSpend which was made back in 2013. NetSpend posted the 15th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth in the last reported quarter. The unit is poised for further grow given a series of key extensions and agreements that it has made. It signed a multi-year distribution relationship with Rite Aid, the third largest pharmacy chain in the United States. NetSpend also signed a five-year renewal contract for its distribution relationship with a retail aggregator who assists in delivering NetSpend, PayPal and Western Union branded products through their tier 1 retail convenience, pharmacy and dollar stores.Investors are also sanguine about the guidance increase. Total revenue guidance has been pulled up to a growth range of 11% to 12% from 9% to 11% previously. It also revised up its revenues before reimbursables guidance from the previous 10% to 12% growth range to 12% and 13%. Full-year adjusted EPS from continuing operations guidance was upped to the growth range of 24% to 26% from the previously guided 15% to 17%.

We expect the company to see l growth in the long run from a positive shift in long-term global immigration.The company's international business is its crowning glory. More than 80% of its agents are based internationally, where Western Union faces less competition than the U.S. market.The company has also been able to regain its lost market share in markets such as Mexico via pricing action taken during recent years. While the pricing reduction had initially caused a slump in the top line, these initiatives are now bearing fruit, by driving transaction growth in the targeted markets.Despite Western Union's wide agent network and market dominance in the money transfer industry, the company which derives a huge chunk of business from physical money transfer, faces threats from the proliferating use of electronic cash remittance which includes the use of mobile or Internet. Western Union is aggressively building up its digital platform but it will some take time before it can catch up with more established players offering niche electronic payment services. Electronic channels contributed about 7% to the company's revenues in the third quarter.The company is subject to stiff competition from the recently completed acquisition of Xoom by Paypal, which makes the most of its revenues from online purchases. The alliance of Xoom, one of the pioneers in digital money transfer business, with Paypal will create a big player in the digital payment space, where Western Union is still developing.Nevertheless, intelligent use of capital via share buyback will secure its bottom-line growth.Western Union carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

In this regard, it announced deals with JetBlue in the United States as well as a number of international partners, including CITS, the largest travel company in China.MasterCard generates 60% of its revenues from international regions, including the Asia-Pacific, Canada, Europe, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East - we believe these markets in aggregate can generate double-digit growth over the next several years, driven by consumer spending and the shift to cards. However, this exposure to international operations has caused the company's earnings to suffer from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Results this year have been adversely impacted on this account and are expected to remain volatile over the coming quarters.The company also faces headwinds from litigation risks relating to anti-trust and unfair competition which could lead to an unfavorable outcome and potential payments of damages and settlements.The termination of the USAA Bank partnership, integration of acquisitions, higher rebates and incentives are other factors which can suppress earnings over the next few quarters.MasterCard carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The use of forwards will protect these enterprises from the adverse effects of foreign exchange movements.Apart from shielding from currency risks arising from adverse movements, these risk management solutions will also enable the enterprises to reap the benefits of a favorable move in the currencies.Since the SMEs have substantial exposure to currency fluctuations because of their international trade, these risk management solutions offered by Western Union will go a long way in making it easy for them to make international payments. Because of uncertainty in movements of foreign currencies, the SMEs had difficulty in estimating the amount of potential payments to be made.

Per the deal, Equifax will buy all the outstanding common stocks of Veda for AUD$2.825 each, higher than its earlier offer of AUD$2.70.At the current exchange rate, the new offer brings the total deal value to about AUD$2.4 billion or US$1.8 billion. Equifax anticipates the acquisition, expected to close by the end of first-quarter 2016, to be accretive to the bottom line over the long run.On Sep 18, the Atlanta-based data management company offered to acquire all the outstanding Veda shares at a price of AUD$2.70, which was a premium of about 35% over its Sep 17 closing price of AUD$1.995. On the basis of that day's foreign exchange rate, the total deal value translated to roughly AUD$2.3 billion or US$1.6 billion.If all goes well, this would be Equifax's biggest acquisition surpassing even the $1 billion CSC Credit Services buyout in 2012.Veda, the leading Sydney-based data analytics provider, principally operates in Australia and New Zealand. The company tracks credit information of approximately 20 million people and 5.7 million organizations in the two countries.Equifax is the world's largest data management company which organizes and assimilates data related to more than 600 million customers and 81 million businesses globally, especially in the U.S. and Europe. The company entered the Australian market last year with the U.K.-based TDX Group buyout. The debt management software company also has a regional office in Sydney.Notably, financial scrutiny in Australia has become stricter of late as the government is adopting a comprehensive credit reporting regime to check money laundering and terrorist financing. So the recent move will give Equifax a substantial foothold in the country, in our view.The company's September bid came at an opportune moment as the Australian dollar weakened about 20% than the last year. Additionally, Veda shares were trading 20% lower on Sep 17 than its 52-week high value of AUD$2.50 hit on Sep 19, 2014.Customers are now looking for solutions to streamline data collection capabilities. We believe that by leveraging Veda's services Equifax will be able to offer better data, technology and advisory solutions and position it as a leader in important markets.Equifax has made strategic acquisitions to supplement its core business. In 2014, the company acquired TDX Group and Forseva from which it expects to derive 1% to 2% revenue growth over the long term.Additionally, Equifax expands internationally through joint ventures that keep operating costs down and require no integration time while diversifying the revenue source.Management's efforts such as product innovation, expansion of data assets through acquisitions and continuous share gains in North America are encouraging. Also, the company's strong correlation to consumer and financial markets as well as its U.S. and European exposure are likely to boost growth, going ahead.However, competition from the likes of Automatic Data Processing Inc.  , Fiserv Inc.  and Moody's Corp.  as well as uncertainty in the mortgage sector raise concern.Currently, Equifax carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Per the agreement, cross-border money transfer to 200 countries and territories will be offered.This looks like is a win-win deal for both parties. While Western Union will gain an enhanced presence in the digital money transfer space, WeChat will become the first social communication application to support the technology for person-to-person money transfer.While the service has initially been rolled out in the U.S., further expansion to other countries is also planned.The agreement with WeChat also gives Western Union the first-mover advantage on social media which is great for sharing pictures, messaging friends and following celebrities. Now, thanks to Western Union, social media can also be used to send cash around the world.World Bank estimates that over 90% of the funds that are transferred between family members, include those who are also connected on social networking websites. This connection between senders and recipients gives social media a huge potential to grow in the money transfer market.Other social networking sites and messaging apps such as Snapchat and Facebook Messenger provide peer-to-peer payments service but these are limited to payments within the boundaries of a country.Western Union carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  (  ),  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ). Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .San Francisco-based  (  ) is undoubtedly a pioneer in the global card transaction processing industry. The company has benefitted from a secular shift in cash to plastic payment. Now, Visa provides processing services to over 30 million merchants around the globe. Roughly 1.8 billion Visa-branded cards are currently in circulation, with total annual purchase volume of around $4.5 trillion.Nevertheless, the company is facing a number of headwinds that include consumer spending fluctuation, regulatory and litigation risks, currency fluctuations, international travel fluctuations, alternative payment systems, pricing pressure and acquisition integration risk.Among these, the worst threat facing the stock is the development of alternate forms of payment as the industry is shifting from plastic to mobile and now Internet-based payments. Some of the latest forms include developments in smart cards, eCommerce, mobile, radio frequency and proximity payment devices such as contactless cards. Technology has permeated into in the payments' industry where customers don't even need a physical credit card to spend money -- a smartphone with an app is all that it takes.With over six billion mobile phone subscriptions worldwide and more than one billion smartphones in the market, mobile payments are gaining increased acceptance against the bulky plastic cards which also carry the risk of loss or theft.According to Statista, mobile spending in 2015 will hit $431 billion globally, and by 2017 this figure will increase to more than $720 billion. This industry is expected to grow in the U.S. from $50 billion in 2014 to nearly $150 billion by 2019, according to research firm Forrester.Google, PayPal, Square, American Express, MasterCard and Visa, among others, have all developed mobile payment platforms.The introduction of apps like Google Pay, Apple Pay and Samsung Pay has given a boost to the mobile payments' space. BI Intelligence estimates that the number of people making a mobile payment at least once a year will grow from nearly 8% of the U.S. consumer population in 2014 to 65% by 2019.Facebook recently launched a payments' feature on Messenger, allowing Facebook friends to send one another money through the app. Customers also can pay for a product not in money but by sharing the details of the products and tweets that would contribute to in online marketing thereby help the retailer to reach a wider section of potential customers, rendering greater value than the price of the product.Banking apps are now become common since most banks allow the card-less cash facility. JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Capital One, and others are building their own mobile payments apps.The trend is also reflected at a number of retailers like McDonald's, KFC, Burger King and Subway that use cloud-based mobile wallet apps, enabling card-less transactions.However, it will not take long for the cards to lose appeal to the more convenient card-less payments' form. While Visa's contribution to the cash-less payment form cannot be ignored, its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) points to the technological challenges on its growth path.So until Visa revamps its business to catch up with the times, let's take at some stocks that are going with the tide. (  ) with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and long-term expected EPS growth of 13.5%, provides payment processing services in the United States. It offers end-to-end electronic payment processing services to merchants by facilitating the exchange of information and funds between them and cardholders financial institutions; and undertakes merchant set-up and training, transaction authorization and electronic draft capture, clearing and settlement, merchant accounting, merchant assistance and support, and risk management services. (  ) with a Zacks Rank #2 and an expected long-term EPS growth rate of 11.95%, provides financial services technology worldwide. The company provides debit, credit, and prepaid card processing and services; electronic bill payment and presentment services; Internet and mobile banking software and services; person-to-person payment services; and other electronic payments software and services. (  ) with a Zacks Rank #2 and an expected long-term EPS growth rate of 12.73%, provides electronic payment processing services to banks and other financial institutions in the United States, Europe, Canada, Mexico and internationally. The company offers account processing and output services, including processing of the card application, initiating service for the cardholder, processing card transaction for the issuing retailer or financial institution, and accumulating the accounts' transactions. (  ) carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an expected long-term EPS growth rate of 17.5% was an early entrant in the mobile payments space. It spun off from eBay in July and thereafter started trading on Nasdaq. The company is about to close the acquisition of Xoom Corp., which will make it a dominant player in the mobile payments' space.PayPal is gearing up to make a mark for itself in the fast-growing digital payment space and to this effect has bought two companies, Venmo, a person-to-person money transfer and digital wallet service; and Braintree, a service that allows small merchants to accept Apple Pay, credit cards, and other money transfer services. Both services doubled their transaction volumes in 2014.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Fidelity has undertaken the repayment of its existing debt while SunGard's senior notes are expected to be redeemed today (Dec 1, 2015).It's noteworthy that the addition of SunGard to its portfolio is not only in line with Fidelity's long-term goals but being a profitable business it is also likely to be immediately accretive to its business. The new company is expected to generate pro forma revenues of $9.3 billion in a year with employee strength of 55K.The acquisition of SunGard will expand Fidelity's offerings by allowing it to cater to a much wider set of clients in banking and capital markets (by serving existing clients and also acquiring new clients). Specifically, SunGard will open avenues for Fidelity to deliver solutions for asset managers and private equity firms, which were earlier inaccessible to the company. Additionally, SunGard will allow the company to grow its international revenues by approximately 4% to 5% going ahead.The combined company will be able to provide services in markets like retail and institutional banking, payments, risk management, asset solutions and insurance.Fidelity has expanded its business primarily through accretive acquisitions. The company has a track record of pursuing acquisitions that strategically fit its overall business mix and are easy to integrate over the long term. The acquisition of Reliance Financial in 2014 has aided expansion of its wealth management product portfolio while that of Clear2Pay (also in 2014) has contributed to its offerings in global payments, allowing it to provide differentiated enterprise payments solutions.The aforementioned acquisition will likely make the company a leading player in retail and wholesale financial technology. However, related costs will likely have some impact on its cash position in the near term. In May 2015, it had suspended its share repurchase program considering acquisition expenses.While this acquisition looks promising for the company's growth over the long run, we believe that for now integration related costs can weigh on its financials. This is a concern as the company is already going through a rough patch in its existing business owing to weakness in its Professional Services business and sluggish demand from its large and global financial institution clients. The last reported quarter was a soft one for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company with both top and bottom lines falling short of expectations.Nonetheless, barring the near-term headwinds, SunGard assets are a positive for the company and are likely to provide it an edge over peers like Fiserv  , Global Payments Inc.  and Alliance Data Systems Corp.  going ahead.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The momentum in the stock was driven by the company's third-quarter earnings which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.4% and were up 5% on a year-over-year basis.Investors were impressed at MasterCard's ability to outshine estimates, irrespective of a mixed global economic environment and foreign exchange headwinds.On the other hand, an improved top line on an increased number of processed transactions further cemented investors' confidence in the company.Notably, MasterCard's shares rose 20% over the past one year compared with a meager return of 1.7% by the S&P 500 during the same time frame. The average volume of shares traded during the day was approximately 4,334 K.MasterCard reported strong transaction and volume growth metrics, which signify business strength. The company reported a 13% increase in worldwide gross dollar volume, and global processed transaction growth was 12%. Globally, the number of cards grew 8%, with 2.2 billion MasterCard and Maestro branded cards issued.New deals and arrangement with different carriers also instill investors' confidence. These include the agreement with JetBlue to launch a new co-brand credit card and convert the existing credit card portfolio of the latter, deals with CIDF, the largest travel company in China; Coles, the largest supermarket in Australia; Aeroflot, the largest Russian airline in Russia; and a strategic agreement with Citi.MasterCard has also started providing Android Pay and Samsung Pay services. The company also initiated a Digital Enablement Express Program, which basically expedites the process of digitizing and tokenizing accounts using MDES.MasterCard's strong cash flow which enables intelligent capital management has also gone a long way in creating investors' wealth, which is viewed favorably.MasterCard carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the same space are Heartland Payment Systems, Inc.  Fiserv, Inc.  and Total System Services, Inc.  .

Adjusted EBITDA grew 9% year over year to $530.3 million while EBITDA margin grew 320 bps to 33.6%.Fidelity's balance sheet remained highly leveraged at the end of the reported quarter. As of Sep 30, 2015, cash and cash equivalents were $441.5 million and debt outstanding was $5 billion.Year-to-date, net cash provided by operations was $697.5 million and adjusted cash flow from operations was $828 million. For the first nine months of 2015, capital expenditures were $306 million while free cash flow was $522 million.Fidelity's commanding position in the financial services market, increasing international exposure, recurring revenue model, diversified product portfolio, cost synergies from acquisitions and a loyal customer base are significant positives.Fidelity has been forming strategic partnerships with firms like Fifth Third Bank and American Blue Ribbon Holdings, which are expected to drive growth, going forward. Also, the company's initiatives to share profits with its investors like the recent dividend hike are positives.Moreover, we believe that Fidelity is well positioned to benefit from increasing investment in mobile banking and innovative products such as PayNet. Mobile banking is developing into an essential extension of online banking as smartphone and tablet usage continue to accelerate globally.However, increasing consolidation in the banking sector, challenging environment for the Payments Solutions business and uncertain regulatory environment are the primary headwinds, in our view. Also, intensifying competition from the likes of Fiserv  , Global Payments Inc.  and Alliance Data Systems Corp.  remains a concern.Currently, Fidelity has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Stocks recently featured in the blog include  the  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ). Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .Global electronic payment processor,  (  ) announced that it will roll out the Apple Pay payment service by Apple Inc. (  ) in the key markets of Canada and Australia by the end of this year. Not only this, further expansion is in the cards as the same service will be made available in Singapore, Spain and Hong Kong from next year.This facility will allow users in this region to secure their payments with iPhone, iPad or Apple Watch in stores where contactless payments and American Express cards are accepted.In August, AmEx had struck a deal with Apple to integrate the Apple Pay services into its corporate card. While Apple Pay was already available to the non-corporate AmEx card users, this deal brought the corporate users under the umbrella of the service for the first time. Corporate cardholders were given access to in-app and in-store purchase payments, and thereby increased the number of Apple Pay users.Apple Pay has been steadily gaining traction, with a growing number of retailers and other service providers adopting the technology. The aim of Apple Pay, which was launched in Sep 2014, is to provide consumers a private and secure mode of payment with the help of a safe and convenient solution.When a consumer adds a credit or a debit card to Apple Pay, a unique Device Account Number is assigned, encrypted and securely stored in the Secure Element on the consumer's mobile device. Thereafter, every time the customer makes a payment using Apple Pay, a one-time unique dynamic security code is generated instead of using the security code from the back of the payment card.The solution that started in the U.S. with only 0.2 million locations has grown exponentially and Apple expects it to cross the 1 million mark soon. A loyal customer base along with the increasing usage of iPhone and adaptability the Apple ecosystem is driving growth for Apple Pay.On the other hand, stronger ties with Apple will likely be a long-term growth catalyst for American Express, as it enhances the secured and user-friendly contactless payments service (m-commerce) that these credit card giants are focusing on since the past few years. Going forward, this secured operational model and investment in technology upgrade is expected to boost investors' confidence in this card giant.American Express carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Meanwhile, wage growth - a catalyst to the Fed's to inflation rate target - also showed significant improvement last month. These factors indicate that the labor market is back on track to boost the economy after witnessing sluggish growth in previous few months.On Friday, the U.S. Department of Labor reported that the economy generated 271,000 nonfarm payroll jobs in October, witnessing its biggest monthly gain since Dec 2014. It also surpassed the consensus estimate of 182,000. It was also reported that the unemployment rate declined to 5% last month from 5.1% in September.Moreover, the report showed that average hourly earnings increased 9 cents in October to $25.20 after rising only 1 cent a month before. It also registered a 2.5% year-on-year gain, recording its biggest gain since the great recession.Jobs additions in sectors including professional and business services, health care, retail trade, food services and drinking places, and construction played the lead role in boosting the jobs data in October. Strong job generation in these sectors indicated that they hold promise for impressive growth in the near future. In this scenario, we have highlighted five stocks from these sectors that may benefit from this improving environment.The professional and business services sector was the biggest recruiter in October. The sector generated 78,000 new jobs, significantly higher than monthly average of 52,000 over the past year. The health care, retail trade, and food services and drinking places also played an important role in creating jobs last month. These three sectors added 45,000, 44,000 and 42,000 jobs, respectively, in October. Another major contributor, the construction sector, generated 31,000 jobs last month.However, the mining sector, which also includes oil and gas extraction, remained on weaker side. Employment in the sector declined 5,000 in October and total volume of jobs reduction in the sector since Dec 2014 came in at 109,000. The ongoing slump in  and weak global demand continued to have a negative impact on this sector.Meanwhile, the civilian labor force participation rate remained unchanged at 62.4% in October after declining 0.2% in September. The employment-population ratio improved slightly in October to 59.3% from September's 59.2. Separately, average workweek remained flat with September at 34.5 hours.Though the labor market indicated a strong recovery last month, several data showed that the economic environment is still remained weak overall. The \"advance\" estimate by the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed that growth in GDP slowed to an annual rate of 1.5% in the third quarter, down from 3.9% growth recorded in the second quarter. Meanwhile, other concerns including an oil price plunge, a stronger dollar and China-led global growth worries continued to affect the U.S. economy.Disappointing economic data continue to weigh on the broader markets. Economic data from retail sales to core durable goods all suggest that the U.S. economy is hitting a soft patch. Also, consumer spending recorded its smallest increase in September since January. Meanwhile, the third-quarter earnings performance also remained disappointing. As of Nov 6 (before the opening bell), 444 S&P 500 members reported third-quarter earnings results. Total earnings of these companies are down 2.5% on 4.6% lower revenues year on year.Despite several concerns, October's strong jobs report showed a ray of hope that the economy will rebound in the final quarter of the year. Though the pace of economic growth decelerated from the second quarter, analysts remained optimistic about a pickup in the final quarter, which primarily constitutes the holiday season. Thus October's positivity in the labor market is anticipated to continue in near future.In this environment, we have selected five stocks with strong fundamentals from the sectors (professional and business services, health care, retail trade, food services and drinking places, and construction) that played major roles in boosting jobs last month. Strong jobs additions, in turn, indicated favorable conditions prevailing in these sectors.We primarily screened stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy).

The company has benefitted from a secular shift in cash to plastic payment. Now, Visa provides processing services to over 30 million merchants around the globe. Roughly 1.8 billion Visa-branded cards are currently in circulation, with total annual purchase volume of around $4.5 trillion.Nevertheless, the company is facing a number of headwinds that include consumer spending fluctuation, regulatory and litigation risks, currency fluctuations, international travel fluctuations, alternative payment systems, pricing pressure and acquisition integration risk.Among these, the worst threat facing the stock is the development of alternate forms of payment as the industry is shifting from plastic to mobile and now Internet-based payments. Some of the latest forms include developments in smart cards, eCommerce, mobile, radio frequency and proximity payment devices such as contactless cards. Technology has permeated into in the payments' industry where customers don't even need a physical credit card to spend money -- a smartphone with an app is all that it takes.With over six billion mobile phone subscriptions worldwide and more than one billion smartphones in the market, mobile payments are gaining increased acceptance against the bulky plastic cards which also carry the risk of loss or theft.According to Statista, mobile spending in 2015 will hit $431 billion globally, and by 2017 this figure will increase to more than $720 billion. This industry is expected to grow in the U.S. from $50 billion in 2014 to nearly $150 billion by 2019, according to research firm Forrester.Google, PayPal, Square, American Express, MasterCard and Visa, among others, have all developed mobile payment platforms.The introduction of apps like Google Pay, Apple Pay and Samsung Pay has given a boost to the mobile payments' space. BI Intelligence estimates that the number of people making a mobile payment at least once a year will grow from nearly 8% of the U.S. consumer population in 2014 to 65% by 2019.Facebook recently launched a payments' feature on Messenger, allowing Facebook friends to send one another money through the app. Customers also can pay for a product not in money but by sharing the details of the products and tweets that would contribute to in online marketing thereby help the retailer to reach a wider section of potential customers, rendering greater value than the price of the product.Banking apps are now become common since most banks allow the card-less cash facility. JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Capital One, and others are building their own mobile payments apps.The trend is also reflected at a number of retailers like McDonald's, KFC, Burger King and Subway that use cloud-based mobile wallet apps, enabling card-less transactions.However, it will not take long for the cards to lose appeal to the more convenient card-less payments' form. While Visa's contribution to the cash-less payment form cannot be ignored, its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) points to the technological challenges on its growth path.So until Visa revamps its business to catch up with the times, let's take at some stocks that are going with the tide. with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and long-term expected EPS growth of 13.5%, provides payment processing services in the United States. It offers end-to-end electronic payment processing services to merchants by facilitating the exchange of information and funds between them and cardholders financial institutions; and undertakes merchant set-up and training, transaction authorization and electronic draft capture, clearing and settlement, merchant accounting, merchant assistance and support, and risk management services. with a Zacks Rank #2 and an expected long-term EPS growth rate of 11.95%, provides financial services technology worldwide. The company provides debit, credit, and prepaid card processing and services; electronic bill payment and presentment services; Internet and mobile banking software and services; person-to-person payment services; and other electronic payments software and services. with a Zacks Rank #2 and an expected long-term EPS growth rate of 12.73%, provides electronic payment processing services to banks and other financial institutions in the United States, Europe, Canada, Mexico and internationally.

It spun off from eBay in July and thereafter started trading on Nasdaq. The company is about to close the acquisition of Xoom Corp., which will make it a dominant player in the mobile payments' space.PayPal is gearing up to make a mark for itself in the fast-growing digital payment space and to this effect has bought two companies, Venmo, a person-to-person money transfer and digital wallet service; and Braintree, a service that allows small merchants to accept Apple Pay, credit cards, and other money transfer services. Both services doubled their transaction volumes in 2014.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Not only this, further expansion is in the cards as the same service will be made available in Singapore, Spain and Hong Kong from next year.This facility will allow users in this region to secure their payments with iPhone, iPad or Apple Watch in stores where contactless payments and American Express cards are accepted.In August, AmEx had struck a deal with Apple to integrate the Apple Pay services into its corporate card. While Apple Pay was already available to the non-corporate AmEx card users, this deal brought the corporate users under the umbrella of the service for the first time. Corporate cardholders were given access to in-app and in-store purchase payments, and thereby increased the number of Apple Pay users.Apple Pay has been steadily gaining traction, with a growing number of retailers and other service providers adopting the technology. The aim of Apple Pay, which was launched in Sep 2014, is to provide consumers a private and secure mode of payment with the help of a safe and convenient solution.When a consumer adds a credit or a debit card to Apple Pay, a unique Device Account Number is assigned, encrypted and securely stored in the Secure Element on the consumer's mobile device. Thereafter, every time the customer makes a payment using Apple Pay, a one-time unique dynamic security code is generated instead of using the security code from the back of the payment card.The solution that started in the U.S. with only 0.2 million locations has grown exponentially and Apple expects it to cross the 1 million mark soon. A loyal customer base along with the increasing usage of iPhone and adaptability the Apple ecosystem is driving growth for Apple Pay.On the other hand, stronger ties with Apple will likely be a long-term growth catalyst for American Express, as it enhances the secured and user-friendly contactless payments service (m-commerce) that these credit card giants are focusing on since the past few years. Going forward, this secured operational model and investment in technology upgrade is expected to boost investors' confidence in this card giant.American Express carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Financial Institution Services revenues increased to $613 million, up 4.1% year over year.Internal revenues rose 5% driven by growth in Payments (up 6%) and Financial (up 4%) segments. Foreign currency negatively impacted internal revenue growth by about 70 basis points (bps) in the quarter.Source-wise, Processing and services revenues increased 5.8% on a year-over-year basis to $1,125 million but Product revenues decreased 6% year over year to $188 million.Adjusted operating income increased to $411 million from $370 million in the year-ago quarter. The company's adjusted operating margin of 33.1% increased 190 bps on a year-over-year basis.Total expenses amounted to $971 million, up 2.4% year over year.As of Sep 30, 2015, Fiserv had cash and cash equivalents of $309 million compared with $294 million as on Dec 31, 2014. Fiserv's cash from operating activities in the nine-month period ended Sep 30, 2015 was $955 million, a decrease from $960 million in the prior-year period. The company's free cash flow in the nine-month period came in at $666 million, a decline of 1.2% on a year-over-year basis. The decline was owing to adverse working capital timings in 2015 that included a $60 million increase in tax payments from 2014. The free cash flow figure excludes $32 million that the company received in cash distributions from StoneRiver (total receipt was of $36 million).Long-term debt at the end of the reported quarter was $4.23 billion, up from $3.71 billion at 2014-end.Fiserv repurchased 6 million shares for $514 million in the quarter. As of Sep 30, 2015, the company had 6.9 million shares remaining under its repurchase authorization.For 2015, Fiserv increased its adjusted earnings per share guidance to $3.84 to $3.87 (up from the earlier projection of $3.73 to $3.83), representing 14% to 15% growth over 2014 levels. It expects adjusted internal revenues to increase 5% in 2015.Fiserv has expanded its foothold in the financial and payment solutions business supported by its broad customer base and various contract wins from Citizens Bank, U.S. Bank and Swift. Additionally, Fiserv continues to add retail and business clients to its Mobiliti ASP solutions, which are expected to drive growth.However, tightening regulations in the banking and financial services industry is expected to remain a concern in 2015.

As the \"cashless form\" of payment gains traction across Europe, the acquisition of InterCard AG will help VeriFone to expand its service offerings to its retail clientele across the region.VeriFone and InterCard AG combination will result in \"a point of sale terminal and multichannel Payment as a Service provider capable of offering merchants secure, simple and innovative end-to-end payment and commerce solutions.\"Markus Hoevekamp, GM of VeriFone's German division stated \"as the German market continues to evolve toward accepting more forms of cashless payment, VeriFone anticipates growing demand from its customers for a partner capable of helping merchants and financial institutions quickly adapt, reducing the complexity of managing their payment environments, and better leveraging their point of sale investments to engage consumers and grow sales.\"The transaction's closure is dependent on approval from German regulatory authorities. VeriFone will divulge more details about the transaction at its fourth quarter  on Dec 14, 2015.VeriFone has a dominant position in the electronic payment systems and services market which boasts of companies like Fiserv, Inc.  , Heartland Payment Systems, Inc.  and Total System Services, Inc.  . The company has around 27 million system terminals globally. The company provides more than 50% of the world's EMV capable terminals. Strategic acquisitions have played a key role in VeriFone's business expansion.Earlier in the year, the company completed the acquisition of GoPago, which was rebranded as VeriFone Cloud POS. The acquisition will aid the company in offering tablet point-of-sale solutions for the SMB market. The previous takeovers of Point and Hypercom not only expanded its product and solutions portfolio but also provided significant synergies that drove top- and bottom-line growth.The acquisitions have expanded the company's reach into regions and countries such as the Middle East, Northern Europe, South Africa and India. We believe that the company will continue pursuing acquisitions that strategically fit its overall business mix and are easy to integrate over the long term.We believe that VeriFone has significant growth opportunity in under penetrated countries such as India, China, Russia, Turkey and Mexico to name a few. Latin America remains a significant growth hub for the company, particularly Brazil, due to the increasing demand for its taxi and mobility solutions against the backdrop of 2016 Olympics. The company is also focusing on developing its footprint in the emerging economies of Asia. We believe that significant growth from these underpenetrated markets will offset sluggish demand from the saturated North America and EMEA markets in the long run.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because FISV is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings-with the most up-to-date information possible-is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for FISV in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.00 per share for FISV, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for FISV, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 3.09% heading into earnings season.A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that FISV has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Fiserv, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The company's consistent expansion of geographic footprint has resulted in increased membership and should in turn boost revenues.Balance sheet and capital return should also support the stock. We believe MasterCard will continue returning capital, likely through buybacks, which will drive the bottom line.Yet, there are several hurdles in the path of maintaining the cost of MasterCard's huge scale of operations. Higher expenses related to acquisitions, depreciation and capital costs will likely drain the quarter's earnings. An earnings drain is also likely from unfavorable foreign exchange rates.Higher rebates and incentives, increasing legal claims, tax expenses and a fixed overhead will further saturate earnings.Our proven model does not conclusively show that MasterCard is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. MasterCard has an ESP of -2.27% as the Most Accurate estimate of $0.86 is pegged lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.88. MasterCard has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). As it is the company does not have a positive Earnings ESP, on top of that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when it is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies in the financial sector you may want to consider as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Fiserv, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +3.09% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Last quarter, it posted a 1.06% positive earnings surprise. It is noteworthy that Fiserv has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 1.73%.Our proven model shows that Fiserv is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. The combination of Fiserv's Zacks Rank #2 and Earnings ESP of +3.09% makes us very confident in looking for an earnings beat this quarter.We believe Fiserv's dominant position in the financial and payments solutions business is expected to drive long-term growth. Management expects annual internal revenue growth of 5%-6% and earnings growth of 11%-14% over the long term. We believe that the broad and diverse customer base, efforts to enhance operational efficiency, high recurring revenues and continued technology upgrades will help the company to drive growth.In addition, the company's highly diversified product portfolio continues to yield a steady flow of customers. The company adds value to its platform through frequent updates of products that are user-friendly and flexible. The rapid emergence of the electronic payment system as a popular platform for transferring money provides immense growth opportunities. In 2014, it won customers both in mobile banking (400 new Mobiliti clients) and person-to-person payment services (300 new Popmoney clients).Strong demand for the DNA solution (11 new clients gone live in 2015) is expected to boost Fiserv's share in this market, going forward. The company expects total DNA customer wins for 2015 to be approximately 30.Also, accretive acquisitions have played a crucial role for Fiserv. However, tightening regulations in the banking and financial services industry and intensifying competition can have negative implications for the long term.Here are a few companies that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Facebook, Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of +5.71% and a Zacks Rank #1.Iron Mountain Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of +2.04% and a Zacks Rank #3.Apple Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of +1.60% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Revenues from Merchant Acquiring Services improved 6.7% to $143.1 million, NetSpend revenues were up 22.4% to $139.6 million, and Inter-segment revenues deteriorated 54.1% to a negative $8.5 million.As of Sep 30, 2015, total number of accounts on file was 760.4 million, reflecting a 25.6% surge year over year. The upside was primarily driven by consumer credit growth.Total System further reported an 11.8% year-over-year rise in total expenses that came in at $554.8 million. The increase was backed by a 12% rise in cost of services and a 10.3% increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.The company reported year-to-date free cash flow increase of 45.8% year over year to $324.4 million. With a strong cash backup, the company plans to continue its strategic goal of returning approximately 75% of available free cash flow to its shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.Total assets rose to $3.89 billion as of Sep 30, 2015 from $3.73 billion at year-end 2014, while total equity climbed to $1.88 billion as of Sep 30, 2015 from $1.70 billion at the end of 2014.Backed by solid third-quarter results, management at Total System raised its full-year 2015 guidance range for revenues before reimbursables to 12-13% from the previous range of 10-12%, and adjusted EPS to 24-26% from 15-17%.

Continued product launches, growing popularity of its self-service offerings and synergies from acquisitions are the other catalysts.During the third quarter, the company won various contracts including the deployment of APTRA OptiCash software at 600 ATMs of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Zhongshan Branch (\"ICBC Zhongshan\").

Telecity Group provides carrier-neutral data centers in Europe and offers secure and connected environments for IT and telecom equipment.

Additionally, the company has converted itself into a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), effective Jan 1 this year, which should maximize shareholders' value over the long run, in our view.Nevertheless, we remain slightly cautious about the huge capital outlays which may hurt Equinix's third-quarter profitability. Moreover, increasing competition from established Internet data center operators such as AT&T  , Level 3 Communications, COLT and Verizon will affect product pricing, thereby reducing the company's margins.Additionally, the telecommunications industry is undergoing consolidation.

Excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements, consolidated operating revenues decreased 1.6% year over year to $502.6 million but surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $496 million.Financial Services operating revenues (excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements) decreased 3.2% year over year to $260.6 million, primarily due to the sale of Global Solutions in the fourth quarter. Moreover, unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations impacted segmental revenues.Healthcare Services operating revenues were down 1.6% on a year-over-year basis and came in at $94 million, primarily due to lower pharmacy claims.Customer Communications (previously Output Solutions) operating revenues were up 2.6% year over year to $147.1 million. Contribution from North America remained strong due to client wins.Apart from this, Investments and Other Segment operating revenues decreased 60.9% year over year to $0.9 million. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to lower occupancy revenues.Cost and expenses were up 6.2% year over year to $598.2 million, primarily due to increased investments for new business expansion. As a percentage of revenues, costs and expenses were up 868 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis. This in turn impacted operating results. Non-GAAP operating margin was down 186 bps on a year-over-year basis to 15.1%.DST reported non-GAAP net income of $53.9 million or $1.49 per share compared with $61.2 million or $1.54 per share reported in the year-ago quarter.DST Systems' balance sheet appears highly leveraged. The company exited the quarter with $152.5 million in cash and equivalents compared with $103 million in the previous quarter. Long-term debt (including current portion) was $765.2 million compared with $498.2 million in the previous quarter.During the third quarter, DST Systems repurchased roughly 1.6 million shares worth $175 million and paid a dividend of 30 cents per share.DST reported encouraging third-quarter results, wherein both the top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, lower client additions, unfavorable market conditions and lower-than-expected revenues from its operating segments adversely impacted the quarter's results.Nevertheless, we are still of the opinion that DST Systems' business volume and massive scale of operation in Financial Services will attract new customers. Moreover, we expect steady contributions from acquisitions to support revenue growth. Continued share buybacks and dividend payments are the other encouraging factors.On the other hand, declining organic revenue growth, tough competition from International Business Machines Corporation  and Fiserv Inc.  , and a high debt burden remain concerns.Currently, DST Systems carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the technology space is Juniper Networks, Inc.  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The average beat for the trailing four quarters is 10.7%.Will Total System deliver a positive earnings surprise this quarter as well? Let's see what factors might have influenced the earnings report this time around.Total System's earnings during the quarter will likely be affected by stressed revenues at its merchant segment, which will face year-over-year comparison pressure.In its subsidiary, NetSpend, the company expects the margin to contract from the 2014 levels largely due to investments being made to support new relationships, launch of new products and features and other investments.Increased expenses, significant exposure to interest rate risks associated with the investment of available cash and foreign exchange risks raise caution. Additionally, an increased debt burden and a high backlog of accounts can affect earnings.We, however, expect higher electronic payment processing services revenues which are generated from charges based on several factors. One of these factors - the number of accounts on file - has been increasing over the last few years and the third quarter of 2015 was no exception.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Total System is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or at least 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But this is not the case here as elaborated below. Total System's Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 57 cents per share, which is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The Earnings ESP is thus 0.00%. Total System has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). As it is Total System does not have a positive Earnings ESP, on top of that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when it is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Fiserv, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +3.09% and a Zacks Rank #2.

Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We believe strength in both PC and mobile games is a key growth factor for Changyou. The company's offerings like Tian Long Ba Bu (TLBB) have been well received. Also, the company unveiled TLBB 3D last year, which continues to drive demand. Changyou intends to issue TLBB 3D expansion pack in the second half of 2015.In the wake of the company's new mobile games Dashfire and Twin of Brothers underperforming expectations, Changyou has stepped up R&D efforts. The company expects to launch one to two in-house developed mobile games in the second half of 2015.We believe that TLBB in combination with the other games will be a significant growth driver for Changyou.However, the company has been facing operational challenges from the ongoing transition. Also, sluggishness in the online game and advertising businesses is resulting in compressed margins for Changyou.Increasing expenses from game operations along with losses in the new RaidCall business remain the primary headwinds for the company. The company expects to complete divestment of 7Road this year.Further, the company has already given soft revenue guidance for third quarter 2015, given declines in mobile games business. Revenues from PC games are expected to be stable.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Changyou is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Changyou currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 55 cents.

Last quarter, it posted a 20.83% positive earnings surprise. It is noteworthy that Twitter has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 13.54%.Our proven model shows that Twitter is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. The combination of Twitter's Zacks Rank #3 and Earnings ESP of +8.00% makes us very confident in looking for an earnings beat this quarter.The last few weeks have been pretty interesting for Twitter. After being without a CEO for three months, Twitter finally zeroed in on co-founder Jack Dorsey. Dorsey was serving as the interim CEO since Jul 1 when Dick Costolo stepped down.Once back at the helm, the first thing Dorsey did was slash 8% of its workforce, or 336 employees. Engineering staff bore the brunt of this. Layoffs aren't great, but at this point Twitter needs to rein in escalating costs and make the company more cost efficient.In addition, the company also said that it expects to report third quarter revenues and EBITDA at the higher end of its earlier guided range. Revenues were earlier expected to be in the range of $540 to $565 million while EBITDA was guided in the range of $110 million to $115 million.Twitter hasn't provided any insight into its dwindling user growth rate. This remains investors' key area of concern. Currently, Twitter has a user base of 316 million, not anywhere close to rival Facebook's over 1.5 billion user base. Even the photo sharing app, Instagram has crossed the 400 million user mark.As the interim CEO, Dorsey has been vocal about Twitter's future. Criticizing some of the product changes himself, he admitted that Twitter needed to go mainstream. This led him to rethink the product and introduce enhancements that can appeal to the masses and expand its user base.Dorsey has been trying new means to increase the user growth rate and engagement levels. The launch of the news curation feature, Moments, is not only an attempt to make the Twitter experience better for current users but also an effort to rope in new users who find the site too confusing or unnecessary. Moreover, Twitter is supposedly mulling the idea of increasing its signature 140 character limit, thus enabling people to post longer tweets.As more users spend time on Twitter, the company expects to bring in more ad dollars to boost the top line. With the Buy Now feature, the company is banking on its e-commerce platform to generate additional value.Acquisitions like Periscope, Cover, Gnip, TapCommerce and Namo Media will expand Twitter's product portfolio and monetization capability. The Omnicom partnership deal will boost its status as an advertising platform and the integration with MoPub will drive the top line in the near term.Here are some other stocks that, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Fiserv, Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of +3.09% and a Zacks Rank #2.Apple Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of +1.60% and a Zacks Rank #2.Computer Sciences Corp.  with an Earnings ESP of +3.48% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The top line was almost in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Operating expenses increased nearly 30% year over year to $1.3 billion primarily due to an increase in cost of operations, higher provision for loan losses and regulatory settlement in the quarter.Third-quarter adjusted earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were $453 million, up 20% year over year.

A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. The combination of Roper Technologies' Zacks Rank #3 and Earnings ESP of +1.27% makes us very confident in looking for an earnings beat this quarter.We believe Roper's unique asset-light business model helps it to remain less dependent on large-scale production equipment. This enables the company to remain profitable even when sales decline during recession. Moreover, higher infrastructure related spending bodes well for the company. We believe that large project wins, strong order trends and improving backlog will drive the top line in the long run.In addition, the company's optimum mix of highly engineered, niche-oriented product helps it to gain market share. Though Roper operates in a cyclical business environment, its diversified revenue stream has helped it to counter the headwinds. We believe that Roper's innovative product pipeline will be a major growth catalyst over the long term.Also accretive acquisitions have played a crucial role. Roper has a history of acquiring smaller, asset-light businesses with high profit margins, particularly companies providing medical solutions. Successful integration of the acquisitions has contributed meaningfully to the top line and margins. In 2014, acquisitions contributed 3% each to revenue and order growth.Over the last three years (2012-2014), it has acquired 11 companies. Recently, the company announced the acquisition of Aderant Holdings, Inc. for $675 million and expects the buyout to generate $125 million in revenues in 2016. Apart from that, the company also acquired RFIDeas, Inc. and Atlantic Health Partners, LLC for $277 million in September.Earlier this year, Roper acquired Strata Decision Technology, L.L.C and two medical software companies, namely, Data Innovations, LLC and SoftWriters, Inc. Roper expects to generate about $100 million in revenues per year from these three acquisitions.We believe that the company will continue pursuing small acquisitions that strategically fit its overall business mix and are easy to integrate over the long term. However, the company's high debt levels may limit its future expansion and worsen its risk profile. As of Jun 30, 2015, the company had a net debt position of $1.8 billion and debt-capital ratio of more than 33.4%.

Also, revenues compared favorably on a year-over-year basis.The year-over-year improvement was primarily aided by solid yields from sales and marketing strategies and strength in the network security market. A large number of deal wins and addition of customers during the quarter also contributed to the robust top line.Recently, Fortinet in partnership with Splunk, Inc., a provider of a platform for machine data analytics software, had launched a cyber security app for enterprises and service providers.Fortinet's FortiGate App for Splunk Enterprise uses the latter's platform to analyze log data produced by FortiGate appliances and thereby boosts threat detection and response times. It offers real time multivariate threat uncertainty, visualization and strange behavior detection within the framework of the organization's entire security data. Therefore, it enables enterprises and service providers to protect their networks from cyberattacks.We believe that Fortinet is positive on a healthy network security market, its product line-up and investment plans.Margin contraction due to continuous investments in research and development and competition from key network security players such as Cisco Systems Inc., Check Point  , Juniper Networks and Palo Alto Networks remain concerns.

Moreover, strong growth potential exists in the online gaming business. Additionally, the partnership with Tencent will boost Sogou's traffic, which will further drive its top line going forwardAlso, Sohu Media Portal and Sohu Video are gaining momentum now and are likely to be important growth drivers going ahead. Further, with continued organic growth and the support of Tencent's vast online properties, Sogou's market share in PC and mobile search is expected to expand further over time.However, Sohu is a relatively small player in the online advertising market and continued investment in product development is necessary to expand its market share. The increasing expenses will keep margins under pressure in the near term but strengthen the long-term competitiveness of the company in China. Management is taking initiatives like reducing its workforce to cut down on expenses.Additionally, the ongoing sluggishness in China economy along with stiffening competition from the likes of Baidu, Inc.  , Akamai Technologies  and AOL Inc also remains a concern.For the third quarter of 2015, Sohu expects revenues in the range of $470 million-$550 million.

Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Verisign reported year-over-year growth in both its top and bottom line in the last reported quarter.Going ahead, the renewal of the .com contract and price hikes for the .com and .net domain names remain drivers of VeriSign's top-line growth. VeriSign will be increasing .net fees to $7.46 from $6.79, from Feb 1, 2016, which is expected to be accretive to its long-term revenue growth. In addition, an expected increase in the domain name base will remain a key driver of its growth.Also, we believe that gTLD prospects, international expansion through IDNs and investments in intellectual properties will boost results over the long run. Additionally, VeriSign has significant growth opportunities in its network security products. We are optimistic about VeriSign's Network NIA services business. VeriSign's partnership with Juniper Networks, Inc.  will boost its growth in the fast growing Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) security market.However, the negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization and increasing operating expenses related to marketing remain the primary headwinds in the near term. Moreover, intensifying competition in the NIA segment is a major concern.VeriSign has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Here are some stocks that, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Fiserv, Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of +3.09% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Apple Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of +1.60% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

EMC shareholders will receive $24.05 per share in cash along with tracking stock related to a portion of EMC's economic interest in VMware. Based on EMC's estimated outstanding shares at the close of transaction, stockholders will get 0.111 shares of new tracking stock for each EMC Corp share.Simultaneously, EMC declared its preliminary third-quarter 2015 results. The company has projected revenues to lie between $6.05 and $6.08 billion, while non-GAAP earnings are expected to be 43 cents, excluding a stock-based compensation of 10 cents. The company has stated that unfavorable order timings impacted results in the quarter.In addition, we believe significant competition in storage, cloud computing and Big Data markets, sluggish IT spending and pricing pressure, are also likely to be headwinds for the company in the near term.However, the acquisition, once it closes is likely to be a positive for the company as it will give a new lease of life to EMC. The transaction is expected to close in 2016. EMC's board has approved the transaction. However, approval from regulatory authorities as well as EMC stockholders remains pending. The board has highly recommended the deal to shareholders. In addition, Dell's ability to raise the capital required for funding this buyout also remains a concern.Our proven model does not conclusively show that EMC is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. EMC currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

The company unveiled a new 5-year plan that has met with disappointment by some analysts.In particular, EPS estimates have continued moving downwards since the company revealed a bleak preliminary enrollment outlook for the September session. These downward estimate revisions pushed this year's expected earnings growth into the negative column at -1.5%, based on the Zacks Consensus.DeVry expects new undergraduate student enrollment to decline 24%-26% at its flagship DeVry University and total enrollments to decline 20%-22% for the Sep 2015 session. The number of graduate course takers is expected to reduce between 17% and 18%. Since DeVry University accounts for a major portion of the company's revenues, the latest outlook is an indication that the top line may again take a hit this session.The recent outlook reflects similar enrollment trends that the company has been reporting over the past few quarters. Though DeVry Education Group's medical and international institutions are expected to perform well in the September session, it expects to report a persistent decline in enrollment at its flagship institution, DeVry University during the period.DeVry stock has seen a 35.7% year-to-date decline after posting consistently soft results in fiscal 2015. Higher growth investments in health care schools and declining enrollment levels at DeVry University due to weak demand have been eating into the company's profits in the past three quarters.DeVry expects these headwinds to affect first-quarter 2016 results as well. First-quarter fiscal 2016 revenues are expected to decrease year over year due to unfavorable translation of the Brazilian currency and weak revenues at DeVry University.Moreover, the company's new student-focused initiatives at DeVry University, which were aimed to transform the business and return it to profitability, do not seem to be paying off yet.Until the estimates stop going down, investors may want to avoid DV shares.

Last quarter, it posted a positive earnings surprise of 1.05%. However, over the past four quarters, the company posted an average negative earnings surprise of 0.88%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.In the last reported quarter, while IBM surpassed expectations for earnings, its revenues lagged estimates. In fact, revenues declined on a year-over-year basis as well.We believe that revenues are likely to be affected in the near term as the company is currently transitioning to higher-growth markets that are not yielding enough to offset declines in traditional segments.Also, intensifying competition in the industry is a major headwind. Further, sluggish IT spending particularly on on-premise and data center hardware along with foreign exchange volatility remain added concerns.Nevertheless, IBM's growth initiatives, including its Big Data & business analytics, cloud computing, mobile and social business are expected to drive growth. Also, the company is expected to benefit from its ongoing innovation and its array of interesting patents.In addition, IBM's policy of making strategic acquisitions (over 150 companies since 2000) will lead to incremental revenues, strengthening its technology leadership and resulting in a more favorable mix of business. The acquisitions have also increased its scale of operations globally. Some of IBM's recent acquisitions include Merge Healthcare, StrongLoop, Meteorix LLC and Cleversafe Inc.Our proven model does not conclusively show that IBM is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. IBM has an Earnings ESP of -1.50%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at $3.28, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $3.33.

The company reported moderate results in the preceding quarter. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.This global risk and information provider is one of the three largest credit reporting agencies in the U.S., followed by Experian and Equifax Inc. After making the fifth-largest debut of the year and raising $764.5 million, the company started trading publicly on Jun 25, 2015.This was TransUnion's second attempt to go public, as the previous one was scrapped due to adverse market environment in 2012. Thereafter, the company was taken over by private equity firm Advent International and Goldman Sachs' private equity unit.Founded in 1968, the credit reporting bureau has expanded its operations to include 33 countries across Africa, Latin America, Asia and North America. TransUnion provides consumer credit reports and risk scores as well as informational management and data analytics services. Additionally, the company offers credit reports and identity theft protection services through which consumers can view their credit profiles and manage personal information.TransUnion's business model contains 3 segments: data, analytics and technology. Its customers are spread across various sectors, including financial services, insurance and healthcare industries. The company deals with 9 of the 10 largest U.S. banks, top 5 credit card issuers, biggest 25 auto lenders and thousands of healthcare providers, as well as federal, state and local government agencies. As a result, the company boasts a stable and consistent revenue stream, having expanded its top line to $1.3 billion from $767 million in just 3 years, beginning 2012.TransUnion's first-quarter 2015 revenues grew 16.4% year over year to $353.1 million. Moreover, the company's revenues for second-quarter 2015 grew 15.6% year over year to $378.5 million. We believe that its top line will continue to experience strong growth in the third-quarter too.Per research firm IDC, global spending on business analytics services is projected to grow at a compounded average growth rate of about 15% till 2018. Given this expected proliferation of the data and analytics market, and its huge customer base, the company seems well-positioned to ride the growth trajectory in the coming quarter as well.However, TransUnion lacks strong cash flow management, which led to a build-up in its debt. The company plans to utilize the money raised from the IPO to reduce its debt burden. This ought to relieve its debt servicing burden to some extent, and possibly boost its bottom line.After reporting moderate results in second-quarter 2015, TransUnion expects revenues for full-year 2015 within roughly $1.455 billion, up 11.5% year over year. Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (''EBITDA'') is expected to be $510 million, 12% higher than the value recorded at the end of full-year 2014. However, TransUnion anticipates unfavorable foreign currency translations to weigh on its revenues and earnings in the quarter under review.Our proven model does not conclusively state that TransUnion is likely to beat earnings in the upcoming quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for an earnings beat. That is not the case here as we will see below. TransUnion has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% for the quarter, as the Most Accurate estimate stands in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate at 28 cents. TransUnion's Zacks Rank #3, when combined with 0.00% ESP, makes surprise predictions difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 or #5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revision momentum.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Alliance Data Systems Corporation  , with an Earnings ESP of +1.36% and a Zacks Rank #3.FTI Consulting, Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +1.92% and a Zacks Rank #2.Fiserv Inc  , with an Earnings ESP of +3.09% and a Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.SanDisk posted better-than-expected second-quarter 2015 results with both the top and bottom lines surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Retails channels and enterprise products were positive in the quarter. However, year-over-year comparisons on both counts were unfavorable, primarily due to competitive pricing pressure and unfavorable product mix.Recently, SanDisk and tech giant Hewlett-Packard agreed to collaborate to offer new storage solutions for computers and other devices. The partnership is aimed at catering to the growing demand for personal storage.It is worth mentioning that last week, according to Bloomberg, SanDisk was looking to sell itself. The company hired a bank to evaluate its strategic options. Reportedly, Micron Technology  and Western Digital Corp.  had expressed their interest in acquiring the memory chipmaker.Going forward, the strategic acquisitions of Fusion-ioInc and SMART Storage Systems are expected to expand SanDisk's offerings in the Enterprise SSD segment.However, lackluster PC sales, competition from peers and currency fluctuations will remain headwinds for the company.Our proven model does not conclusively show that SanDisk will beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 63 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 68 cents. This equates to a difference of -7.35%.

Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.The bottom line might be affected by increased spending by management in order to replace the revenue loss from the Costco U.S. contract that will terminate in Mar 2016. Increased marketing aimed at attracting and retaining card members will also drain operating earnings.Other factors affecting  third-quarter earnings will likely be a stronger U.S. dollar and the negative impact of rising interest rates on charge card profitability. The company also commented earlier that billings growth in the third quarter might be sequentially lower and could thus restrict top-line growth.Potentially higher provisions as a result of loan growth, will also pose as a headwind to earnings.Nevertheless, results should benefit from the spend-centric business model, strategic initiatives in the digital payments' space and new card-issuing alliances of AmEX. The company's intelligent capital management will add to its bottom line.Our proven model does not conclusively show that AmEx is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or at least 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But this is not the case here as elaborated below. : The Most Accurate estimate of AmEX is pegged at $1.31 per share, which is in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

Revenues also declined year over year. The company's major revenue generating segments were adversely affected mainly by unfavorable foreign exchange impact.Nonetheless, we believe that the breadth of CA's products and increased efficiency will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. The company's increased cloud exposure, modest cash position and share repurchase should aid results in the second quarter.On the other hand, increasing competition from Oracle, International Business Machines and Hewlett-Packard  and exposure to Europe may hurt result in the to-be-reported quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that CA will beat earnings estimates this quarter.

Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 4.55%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Equifax reported better-than-expected second-quarter 2015 results, which improved year over year as well. The year-over-year upside was supported by revenue growth across all its business segments, except International.Recently, Equifax made a non-binding offer to acquire Veda Group Limited, the leading Australian credit information provider, to broaden its global operations. If successful, this would be Equifax's biggest acquisition surpassing the $1 billion CSC Credit Services buyout in 2012. We believe that the recent move will give Equifax a substantial foothold in the country.Management's efforts such as strategic initiatives for product innovation, expansion of data assets through acquisitions and continuous share gains in North America raise optimism.Also, the company's strong correlation with the consumer and financial markets as well as its exposure in the U.S. and Europe are likely to propel growth, going ahead.

Also, the quarter's revenues increased on a year-over-year basis. Lower number of client additions, unfavorable market conditions and lower-than-expected revenues from its operating segments adversely impacted the quarter's results.However, we are still of the opinion that DST Systems' business volume and massive scale of operation in Financial Services will attract new customers. Moreover, we expect steady contributions from acquisitions to support revenue growth. Continued share buybacks and dividend payments are the other encouraging factors.On the other hand, decreasing organic revenue growth, tough competition from IBM Corp.  and Fiserv Inc., and a high debt burden remain concerns.Our proven model does not conclusively show that DST will beat earnings this quarter.

Additionally, licensing agreements - the result of successful monetization of Rambus' patents - remains a recurring revenue source and should boost third-quarter results.However, the company's investments in the CryptoManager platform and certain memory and interface technologies may impact margins in the to-be-reported quarter.

Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.In the last reported quarter, while IBM surpassed expectations for earnings, its revenues lagged estimates. In fact, revenues declined on a year-over-year basis as well.We believe that revenues are likely to be affected in the near term as the company is currently transitioning to higher-growth markets that are not yielding enough to offset declines in traditional segments.Also, intensifying competition in the industry is a major headwind. Further, sluggish IT spending particularly on on-premise and data center hardware along with foreign exchange volatility remain added concerns.Nevertheless, IBM's growth initiatives, including its Big Data & business analytics, cloud computing, mobile and social business are expected to drive growth. Also, the company is expected to benefit from its ongoing innovation and its array of interesting patents.In addition, IBM's policy of making strategic acquisitions (over 150 companies since 2000) will lead to incremental revenues, strengthening its technology leadership and resulting in a more favorable mix of business. The acquisitions have also increased its scale of operations globally. Some of IBM's recent acquisitions include Merge Healthcare, StrongLoop, Meteorix LLC and Cleversafe Inc.Our proven model does not conclusively show that IBM is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

In the year-to-date time frame, the company has returned about 28.7% in contrast to a decline of 2.2% in the S&P 500 index over the same period.Fiserv's key growth drivers include a healthy product portfolio, significant acquisition synergies and steady flow of new customers.

To make the most of it, Fiserv continues to expand its offerings while also making them more user-friendly and flexible. This allows the company to cross-sell a number of its products to existing customers itself.Recently, the company expanded its offerings to Virginia-based 1st Advantage Federal Credit Union.

The company has been gaining significantly on the back of ongoing growth initiatives, product innovation, shareholder-friendly moves and impressive quarterly results. Notably, the company returned more than 31% in the past one year.Some of the optimism surrounding the stock may be attributed to Equifax's strong correlation to consumer and financial markets as well as its U.S. and European exposure, which is seeing a gradual uptick. Moreover, strategic initiatives including product innovation, expansion of data assets through acquisitions and continuous share gains in North America are encouraging.Apart from this, Equifax has been enhancing the product portfolio and increasing market share through partnerships.The regular dividends and share repurchases also keep investors interested in the stock. During the first two quarters, the company paid $69 million as dividend and repurchased $182.2 million stocks.Equifax reported better-than-expected second-quarter 2015 results which improved year over year as well. The company's adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.15 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.10 and increased 19.5% from the year-ago quarter mainly backed by 10.5% rise in revenues and margin expansions.Notably, Equifax surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the last four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.87%. Backed by the strong results, the company raised the full-year outlook and issued encouraging third-quarter guidance.Furthermore, Equifax has made strategic acquisitions to supplement its core business.

Earlier on Sep 18, 2015, the company had proposed to acquire all the outstanding shares of Veda Group for AUD$2.70, which at the time translated to a total deal value of about AUD$2.3 billion or USD$1.6 billion.The new offer represents a premium of about 41.6% over its Sep 17 closing price of AUD$1.995. This is substantially higher from the previous bid which represented a 35% premium over the Sep 17 closing price.The revised bid represents a $75 million increase from the earlier offer. Both companies have moved forward after Veda Group's board allowed Equifax to engage in due diligence and negotiate a mutually acceptable definitive agreement.If successfully executed, this would be Equifax's biggest acquisition surpassing the $1 billion CSC Credit Services buyout in 2012.Veda Group, the leading Sydney-based data analytics provider, has principal operations in Australia and New Zealand.

The company entered the Australian market last year with the buyout of U.K.-based debt management software company TDX Group, which has a regional office in Sydney.Notably, financial checking in Australia has become stricter of late as the government is adopting a comprehensive credit reporting regime to counter money laundering and terrorist financing. So we believe that the recent move will give Equifax a substantial foothold in the country.The recent bid comes at an opportune moment as the Australian dollar has weakened about 20% compared with last year. Additionally, on Sep 17, Veda Group shares were trading 20% lower than the 52-week high of AUD$2.50 hit on Sep 19, 2014.Customers look for solutions that streamline data collection capabilities.

The suit filed by Wal-Mart last year accused Visa of levying irrational charges for transactions made by credit or debit cards.According to Wal-Mart, Visa has been unlawfully raising the card transaction charges and fees in association with banks. As a result, Wal-Mart pointed out that \"swipe\" fees soared as high as over $350 billion between 2004 and Nov 2012.Another retailer Amazon.com Inc. also holds a $5.7 billion settlement case against Visa on the same grounds. Friction between the retailers and cared issuers is a prominent issue in recent times. Retailers have been continuously complaining against the billions of dollars in \"interchange\" or swipe fees for card transactions. Such huge fees translate into almost 2% of the value of a transaction and thus weigh heavily on the retailers' pockets.Visa faces several state and federal lawsuits on interchange rate violation as well as on those involving currency conversion practices and pricing structure. These have compelled the company to offer significant discounts and other incentives to the U.S. merchants to steer clear of cardholders of a particular network.The above-mentioned settlement charges will add to Visa's expenses and thereby affect its margins. Most importantly, lawsuits and related settlement charges not only hurt the company's financials, but also hamper its goodwill, thereby weighing on investor sentiment.Visa carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Yet the earnings of this company will see pressure over the coming quarters from foreign exchange volatility, incentives and rebates and higher expenses.Currency fluctuation along with higher volume and support incentives passed on to customers and intermediaries might thwart the expected revenue growth. This is also validated by management's estimation of incentives, as a percentage of gross revenues, of about 17.5-18.5% for fiscal 2015, up from 17% in fiscal 2014.Moreover, Visa faces foreign exchange headwinds. Recently, management raised the foreign exchange headwind to 2.5 points (up from 2 points). Going forward, the company's growth is expected to remain sluggish in comparison to prior years. This is also reflected in its top-line growth guidance of low double digits, excluding a 2.5% reduction due to the negative impact of foreign currency, and bottom-line growth in the mid-teens range in fiscal 2015, lower than 19% growth recorded in fiscal 2014 and 22% in fiscal 2013. Top-line growth also slowed down to 7.5% in the first half of fiscal 2015 and 8.7% in fiscal 2014 from 13% in fiscal 2013.Visa also faces several state and federal lawsuits on interchange rates' violation, currency conversion practices and pricing structure.During the last reported quarter, though the company outpaced estimates, much of the upside in the earnings per share was driven by transitory benefits including FX volatility and lower client incentives.Visa carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

If you believe, as we do, that NFLX is as innovative and has the growth potential that AAPL had a decade ago, then you realize that the institutions have a ways to go before this stock becomes over loved.Technically, NFLX shares have left the Nasdaq 100 and its peers in the dust as NFLX has returned 114% year-to-date compared to the Nasdaq 100\u2019s 2% loss. The recent 30% pullback is a gift for investors who have been looking for a deal on NFLX stock.And from our view, anything under $100 presents a prime buying opportunity for NFLX, as this leader won\u2019t relinquish its position for some time.Nvidia (NVDA) is a semiconductor company best known for its video technology, but NVDA serves other areas of the information technology market as well.NVDA stock is up around 9% in the past year, besting the Nasdaq 100, which is only up a little more than 1%. NVDA\u2019s performance and sentiment profile place it in the \u201c1 percent\u201d category, as NVDA stock is clearly NVDA shares have navigated this historic move in the markets by successfully testing its 200-day moving average in a dazzling show of technical strength. Another sign of NVDA stock\u2019s strength is the fact that it remains above its 50-day trendline, which cannot be said for 90% of the Nasdaq 100.Sentiment towards NVDA remains pessimistic as only 28% of the analyst community has the stock ranked a \u201cbuy,\u201d and the short sellers have been increasing their bearish bets against the stock. Currently, the stock\u2019s short interest ratio is approaching 8, making it one of the more heavily shorted names in the Nasdaq 100.The clear Wall of Worry and technical strength indicates that NVDA is likely to lead the Powershares QQQ ETF () higher into the end of the year and perform like a true \u201c1 percent\u201d stock.Fiserv (FISV) provides electronic processing and various financial services to the market. Currently, FISV stock is trading 16% higher year-to-date and 28% higher on a 12-month basis, putting the FISV stock in the top performers within the Nasdaq 100.FISV\u2019s technical trends are among the strongest within their index, as its 50-day moving average is trending higher and its 200-day remains in place as support in the case of another market pullback, which we expect.Like NVDA, sentiment towards FISV reveals that the stock is climbing the \u201cWall of Worry.\u201d Analyst recommendations show that only 30% of the analysts rank it a \u201cbuy,\u201d with the remaining 70% of the analyst with an opinion camping out in the \u201chold\u201d camp.Its only a matter of time (and higher prices) before the analysts holding out begin upgrading FISV, driving prices even higher.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" has renewed its agreement with Launch Federal Credit Union to provide official check services.Per the agreement, the money transfer, bill payment and check processing company will process the official checks of more than 62,000 Launch Federal Credit Union members.MoneyGram has a number of tie-ups with different corporations for its check processing services.

Also, the company's initiatives to share profits with its investors like the recent 8% dividend hike are positives.Moreover, we believe that Fidelity is well positioned to benefit from increasing investment in mobile banking and innovative products such as PayNet. Mobile banking is developing into an essential extension of online banking as smartphone and tablet usage continue to accelerate globally.However, increasing consolidation in the banking sector, challenging environment for the Payments Solutions business and uncertain regulatory environment are the primary headwinds, in our view.

When hedge fund managers appear to be thinking alike, we find it is a good idea to take a closer look.Before we proceed, it is important to point out that 13F filings do not tell the whole story, because these funds are only required to disclose their  positions with the SEC, but are not required to disclose their  positions. A fund making a bearish bet against a stock by shorting calls, for example, might also be long some amount of stock as they trade around their overall bearish position. This long component could show up in a 13F filing and everyone might assume the fund is bullish, but this tells only part of the story  .Having given that caveat, we believe that looking at  of 13F filings can be revealing, especially when comparing one holding period to another. Below, let's take a look at the change in FISV positions, for this latest batch of 13F filers:\n  \nIn terms of shares owned, we count 4 of the above funds having increased existing FISV positions from 03/31/2015 to 06/30/2015, with 7 having decreased their positions and 2 new positions.Looking beyond these particular funds in this one batch of most recent filers, we tallied up the FISV share count in the aggregate among  of the funds which held FISV at the 06/30/2015 reporting period (out of the 1,632 we looked at in total). We then compared that number to the sum total of FISV shares those same funds held back at the 03/31/2015 period, to see how the aggregate share count held by hedge funds has moved for FISV. We found that between these two periods, funds reduced their holdings by 114,555 shares in the aggregate, from 55,189,427 down to 55,074,872 for a share count decline of approximately -0.21%.

Also, the quarter's revenues increased on a year-over-year basis. Lower number of client additions, unfavorable market conditions and lower-than-expected revenues from its operating segments adversely impacted the quarter's results.However, we are still of the opinion that DST Systems' business volume and massive scale of operation in Financial Services will attract new customers. Moreover, we expect steady contributions from acquisitions to support revenue growth. Continued share buybacks and dividend payments are the other encouraging factors.On the other hand, decreasing organic revenue growth, tough competition from International Business Machines Corporation  and Fiserv Inc.  , and a high debt burden remain concerns.Currently, DST Systems carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Investors can also consider another technology stock, VASCO Data Security International Inc.  that sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The closing price represents a robust one-year return of 39.8% and a year-to-date return of 37.9%.Average volume of shares traded over the 10 days (308K) is more than the average volume traded over the last three months, which is roughly 224K. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has a market cap of $4.77 billion and expected long term growth rate of 11%.Some of the current optimism surrounding the shares can be attributed to its recently announced decision to acquire Wealth Management Systems Inc. (WMSI), which provides rollover and advisor solutions to the retirement services industry. This acquisition is expected to enhance the company's ability to help asset managers and broker-dealers to keep hold of assets in the retirement space and win new businesses in the emerging retirement market.DST Systems' Financial Services segment deals with a number of offerings, such as shareowner recordkeeping, broker sub-accounting, recordkeeping system for the U.S. and retirement plan market etc. The company's leadership and scale in this segment should help it win new business. We believe that the product diversity serves as a cushion for DST in case of demand volatility, resulting in a steady revenue stream.We are also encouraged by Customer Communications' revenue growth. The segment provides an electronic delivery program for proxy materials, which helps companies reduce costs associated with traditional print-and-mail proxy campaigns. Customer Communications operating revenues in the first quarter increased 0.2% year over year, mainly driven by new volumes from already converted clients. We believe that in accordance with the current trend of new business wins, this segment will continue to generate additional business, going forward.Furthermore, DST shares also gained momentum onbetter-than-expected earnings reported in its first-quarter fiscal 2015. DST posted non-GAAP earnings of $1.40 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.26. On a year-over-year basis, earnings per share improved 25% aided by higher revenues and higher client additions.Total revenue in the first-quarter was $702.3 million, up 2.7% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin was also up 96 basis points on a year-over-year basis to 15.4%.Moreover, we expect steady contributions from the acquisitions to support revenue growth. Continued share buybacks and dividend payments are the other encouraging factors.On the other hand, decreasing organic revenue growth, tough competition from International Business Machines Corporation  and Fiserv Inc.  , and a high debt burden remain concerns.DST witnessed one positive estimate revision (out of two estimates for fiscal 2016)in the past 60 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate also moved north (by 1 cent) to $6.76 per share over the same time frame.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Both earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate driven by growth across all segments. We believe that Moody's remains a solid franchise in rating debt instruments based on its diversified credit research business model and international growth opportunities.Sustained growth should come from a stronger issuance environment, increasing disintermediation in Europe, strong potential in the analytics business and improving pricing trends. However, adverse foreign currency translations, regulatory concerns, increasing operating expenses and stiff competition will remain overhangs.Moody's, along with Standard & Poor's, holds a dominant position in the duopolistic credit rating industry. It has also gained significant market share in the analytics business based on its strong product portfolio. The company has a diversified customer base, which includes a range of corporate and government issuers of securities as well as institutional investors, depositors, creditors, investment banks, commercial banks and other financial intermediaries.Approximately 51% of Moody's revenues are recurring in nature, which lends stability and predictability to the revenue stream. Going forward, increasing bond and bank loan issuance along with higher monitoring revenues related to new ratings customers will remain the key drivers in the corporate finance line, the largest revenue contributor at Moody's Investors Service. We believe Moody's is well positioned to achieve strong growth based on the above factors over the long term.However, Moody's faces stiff competition in most of the markets in which it operates. In the credit rating sector, the company faces competition from Fitch, S&P Ratings Services, Morningstar and many other regional providers. In the analytics segment, it faces competition from Dun & Bradstreet, Bloomberg, IBM, Fiserv  and many others.In the risk management software market, the company competes with large software developers including SAS, Oracle  , IBM Corp.  and Mysis. We believe stiff competition will continue to put pressure on pricing that may hurt profitability in the long run.Moody's currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Also, it delivered positive surprises in two of the last four quarters with an average surprise of 1.47% Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Fiserv has expanded its foothold in the financial and payment solutions business supported by its broad customer base and various contract wins from the likes of Citizens Bank, U.S. Bank and Swift.Last year, the company extended its partnership with a leading integrated risk and finance solutions provider, Primatics Financial. The alliance was extended to provide financial institutions with advanced stress testing solutions in support of macroeconomic and regulatory stress testing. This apart, Fiserv extended its WireXchange service to Western Union Co.  to enhance the latter's offerings.

We also believe that intensifying competition from peers remain a major headwind.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Fiserv will beat earnings estimates this quarter.

Any serious student of financial history would recognize and acknowledge that economically speaking, things are good much more often than they are bad. In the general sense, common stocks have risen far more often than they have fallen. That is not to say that bad times never come, because they most assuredly do. However, even during bad times optimism has served investors better than pessimism. The rational optimist recognizes that bad times are only temporary, and better times are sure to follow.Consequently, the rational optimist sees the future opportunity that bad times provide and behaves accordingly by investing aggressively. In contrast, the more emotionally-driven pessimist sees only risk, which all too often provokes them to flee their investments and suffer unnecessary losses as a result. A paper loss is most often temporary, and only becomes real if you take it. This is especially true when the underlying fundamentals of the business support a higher valuation. When this is true, I contend there are only two rational choices. Hold onto your intrinsically more valuable assets recognizing that they will recover or if you have the wherewithal, aggressively add to your holdings and exploit other people's folly.Although my educational background is in economics and finance, I also completed a minor in psychology. How people behave and think has always been a fascination to me. However, I was more interested in finance, especially investing, which is why I made it my career. Nevertheless, my interest in psychology led me to interesting observations about how people think and behave. Many times in my life I have encountered people that possess mountains of wonderful blessings to be thankful for, but who also have a thimble full of problems or life issues. Invariably, or at least all too often, they will turn their backs on their mountains of blessings and obsess on the fewer problems they have.Moreover, in my personal experience there is a rather disturbing differentiation between pessimists and optimists that I have personally observed and often encountered. Optimists tend to be happier and usually kinder when dealing with others. In contrast, pessimists tend to be gloomy and often meaner when dealing with others. If you don't believe me, try presenting an optimistic article, as I often have, and see the responses you get.As a case in point on July 25, 2010, shortly after the Great Recession had ended, I posted an article titled \"S&P 500: The Optimists Argument\" and I opened it with the following:It's important to consider that those words were written in July 2010, more than a year after the Great Recession had ended. Later in this article I will provide a link to the above article and include a few comments from readers that it generated. I believe you will find they support my above statement about the perils of writing a positive article.Additional attributes of successful investors that go hand-in-hand with optimism are embracing a long-term view and tempering optimism with realism. Although successful investors have a strong faith in our economic future, they are also smart enough to make realistic assessments about important fundamental metrics such as current valuation.Optimism and faith in our future are important and profitable attributes to have, but blind faith can lead to denial, and as such, can be financially dangerous. Similar to fear and greed, denial is an emotional response. In contrast, rational optimism is supported by analysis based on an intelligent assessment of the facts. Even more importantly, rational optimists conduct continuous monitoring and evaluation of their past behaviors and decisions in order to learn as much as they can from the past.All of my life, my closest friends and family have called me the perpetual optimist. In many cases it was meant as a criticism, but in others as a compliment. Personally, I have always considered it a compliment. In truth, I have always felt that my optimistic viewpoint about life and as it pertains to this article, about the economic strength of our country, was a blessing. However, as it specifically relates to investing, my optimistic viewpoint should also lead to profitable transactions. Fortunately for me, that has proven to be the case over the long run. All of my transactions have not been profitable, but on balance, my optimism, my long-term approach and my focus on valuation have served me quite well.To be crystal clear, the primary thesis behind this series of articles is that optimism is an important attribute for successful investing. A secondary thesis behind this series of articles is that successful investing implies taking a long-term view when investing in common stocks. By long term, I am referring to investing in and owning a business for a minimum of a normal business cycle of 3-5 years, but preferably longer. As Ben Graham so eloquently put it, \"in the short run the market is a voting machine, but in the long run it's a weighing machine.\"In conjunction with my primary and secondary thesis referenced above, is the importance of monitoring and evaluating past decisions, because only then can one determine whether or not optimism is justified. As I was contemplating this, it occurred to me that I have been publishing articles on financial blogs such as Seeking Alpha since June 11, 2009. Therefore, that timeframe of almost exactly 6 years qualifies under my definition of long-term stated above. My, how time flies when you're having fun!Consequently, this provided a venue that would allow me to monitor and evaluate the validity of my optimism and long-term view. Thanks to the convenience and calculating power provided by F.A.S.T. Graphs I could offer my loyal readers a rather comprehensive perspective of how my work and positive attitude has panned out. Therefore, what follows is a wide ranging look back at my first year's worth of offerings where I presented fairly valued research candidates for readers to consider. In this Part 1, I will cover my recommendations through the end of 2009. In Part 2, I will complete the analysis with a review of recommendations made through June of 2010.A couple of caveats about this exercise are in order. What I am presenting here is a factual performance calculation based on the closing price of each company one day prior to the article's publication. However, since F.A.S.T. Graphs only reports monthly closing prices on the historical graphs, my calculations will be close but not perfectly accurate. In other words, my starting calculation will be presented on the last trading day of the month prior to or directly after the date the article was published. This gets me within two weeks of when the article was originally presented. However, these calculations are precise enough for the reader to receive a general perspective of the outcome of my recommended research candidates.Importantly, I only present articles where I covered a single company in my first year of writing. However, I also include a few examples where I wrote about the S&P 500 index as a proxy for the market. These articles are especially interesting because they highlight the pushback I received from strong reactions of readers that held a more pessimistic view of the market and our economy. On these S&P 500 index articles specifically, I will include a few comments that answer the question posed in the title of this article. In short, what has a pessimistic view of our market and economy cost them? The answer is vividly revealed by the S&P 500 articles and performance calculations below.At this point it's important for me to interject that this is not an exercise meant to brag about how smart I have been. As I previously stated, not all of my research candidate recommendations were profitable. I have included the good, the bad and the ugly. On the other hand, I believe this exercise supports the importance of optimism as it pertains to investing in common stocks. On balance, and as you will soon see, my optimistic recommendations worked out pretty well.To be fair, I will also add that I did not own all of these recommended research candidates, but I did own most of them. Furthermore, these calculations do not include specific times where I sold. In other words, this is not a precise presentation of portfolio performance; instead, it is simply reviewing the record produced by the individual research candidates based on the publication date of articles. Readers of these articles were free to either ignore, buy and/or sell any of these offerings based on their own needs or views.On the other hand, I do feel that readers of my work deserve to see what my research recommendations could have produced had they acted upon them.  But most importantly, I believe this exercise offers important lessons about the importance of only investing when fair valuation is manifest. The importance of valuation, over all other reasons, is why I offer this rather extensive review and look back at my work.As the reader reviews the following, I ask that they keep in mind that each of these articles was published in the years just after the Great Recession. This is important because it was clearly a time of rampant pessimism on many people's part.On each research candidate published in an article I will present two identical graphs. The first graph will be without the calculations applied because they cover up portions of the graph. I'm doing this because I want the reader to be able to clearly see valuation represented by the earnings and price relationship, as well as all the metrics produced in the FAST FACTS boxes to the right.The first article I ever published was on Rockwell Collins (  ), a high-quality semi-cyclical dividend growth stock in the aerospace and defense industry. Even though earnings had weakened during the recession, I felt the valuation represented a compelling opportunity. Clearly this offering has worked out over the long run. However, short-term volatility between when I originally wrote the article and today should be recognized. Additionally, current high valuation has contributed to the results and should not go unnoticed.Stryker (  ) was a company I had waited years to find at attractive valuation. The results were clearly worth waiting for.On June 18, 2009, I presented an optimistic view of the future potential returns on the S&P 500 based on attractive valuation, coupled with strong forecasts for earnings growth. Many people were not of the mind to accept a positive recommendation on the S&P 500, as evidenced by the pushback I received. I have included a few examples of negative comments following the graphs.When I wrote about Fiserv (  ) on June 19, 2009 the article was oriented towards growth investors. Although this represents one of my best long-term performers, the extremely high current valuation was a major contributor to those results. I don't believe in taking credit for the market's current irrational pricing of this research candidate.When I wrote about L-3 Communications (  ) on June 25, 2009, I expected strong earnings growth for the next few years, which did happen. However, since 2012 earnings have been rather flat. Nevertheless, significant undervaluation overcame poor operating performance.When I wrote about Danaher (  ) on July 8, 2009, it was offered as a growth stock opportunity available at fair value. Although this research candidate has performed quite well, the continuous high valuation that the market has been applying is a concern.When I wrote about Coach (COH) on July 16, 2009, it was offered as a high growth opportunity. The company performed extremely well for the next several years, but I eventually sold based on excessive valuation. Nevertheless, this example clearly illustrates the importance of the earnings and price relationship long term.On July 22, 2009, I presented my first recommendation on the blue-chip dividend growth stock Procter & Gamble (PG). It was offered as an opportunity to invest in a Dividend Champion/Aristocrat at a very attractive valuation that was rare to find.When I wrote about GameStop (GME) on July 29, 2009, it was offered as an above-average growing company available at a low valuation. I got a lot of pushback on this particular example. Nevertheless, it's interesting to see that the company has subsequently morphed into an above-average yielding dividend growth stock.When I wrote about Cognizant (CTSH) on August 7, 2009, it was offered as a very attractive growth stock. This has been one of my best performers, but best of all, its performance was generated based on expected operating results.As the title of the article written on August 14, 2009 on Kohl's (KSS) indicates, it was offered as a moderately priced research candidate. Since that time the company has morphed into a dividend growth stock.When I originally wrote about Teva (TEVA) on August 20, 2009, I was expecting strong earnings growth, which I got for the next two to three years. However, since 2012, earnings have been lackluster. However, the company did raise their payout ratio, which generated a decent level of income. Nevertheless, this has been one of my more disappointing offerings.When I wrote about Amphenol (APH) on August 27, 2009, it was offered as an attractively-valued growth stock. Although this has been one of my better total return performers, I can't take credit for the excessive valuation that the stock has been awarded by the market.When I wrote about  (SCHW) on September 4, 2009, I expected better operating results going forward. Even though this recommendation has performed reasonably well, I consider it one of my mistakes.When I wrote about Aflac (AFL) on September 11, 2009, it was offered as an extremely attractive blue-chip dividend growth stock. Even though the market continues to undervalue Aflac, thanks to the power of low valuation, long-term results have been acceptable. I am still waiting for the market to recognize the value in this one.When I wrote about Staples (SPLS) on September 18, 2009, I expected better things from the company. This is one that I was long in, but my original optimism soon turned to realism and I accepted my losses and moved on.When I wrote about Research in Motion, now known as BlackBerry (BBRY), on September 27, 2009, it was offered as a growth stock opportunity in the burgeoning Smartphone market. Although this has clearly been a mistake, I continue to hold the stock. I will admit that this is a case where I let optimism become stubbornness. However, as you will see later, I also invested in Google for the same reasons. Not shown in this article is that I also hold a large position in Apple. Growth stock investing is riskier, and BlackBerry serves as a strong reminder to that reality.When I wrote about Walgreens (WBA) on September 30, 2009, I was concerned about moderate overvaluation, and I was right short term. However, long term this has proven to be an excellent performer, but I do consider it significantly overvalued.When I saw AAA rated Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) available at a P/E ratio below 15, I jumped at the opportunity. This is a classic example of how attractive valuation can provide a strong total return, even with a low growth dividend paying stalwart.On October 8, 2009, I presented Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) as an attractively valued growth stock with a bright future. This example has worked out as planned and took some of the sting out of the BlackBerry mistake.On October 15, 2009, I presented eBay (EBAY) as an attractively-valued growth stock. Although this research candidate has performed extremely well, I am not pleased with its current high valuation.On October 20, 2009, Nike (NKE) was presented as an attractively-valued blue-chip dividend growth stock. Although performance has been exceptional, I remain concerned with its current high valuation, which I wrote about in a recent article.On October 29, 2009, I presented The Manitowoc Company (MTW) as an opportunity to invest in a cyclical with recovery potential. Long term this research candidate has done well. However, it does not possess the consistent characteristics that I typically look for.On October 29, 2009, I revisited the S&P 500 suggesting that future returns could be extraordinary based on estimated earnings growth and attractive valuation. As the comments following the graphs illustrate, people do not like positive offerings. I believe this represents another example of what a pessimistic attitude can cost.On November 8, 2009, I wrote about United Technologies (UTX) as an attractive dividend growth stock in the aerospace and defense sector. Long term it has performed well and I continue to hold this position.On November 12, 2009, I wrote about ITT Educational Services (ESI) as an attractively-valued aggressive growth stock. Fortunately I cut my losses based on aggressive government intervention with this whole industry. Nevertheless, we see another classic example of the earnings and price relationship. In the long run, where earnings go, stock price is sure to follow.On December 11, 2009, I revisited Stryker Corporation. Consistent earnings and dividend growth provided attractive long-term returns; however, current valuation is high.As a bonus addendum to this article I offer the following F.A.S.T. Graphs on the S&P 500. Although I remain optimistic about our country, our economy, and its continued long-term prosperity, I am also realistic about current valuations. I believe the following earnings and price correlated graph clearly illustrates that the valuation of the S&P 500 has become significantly higher than it was during the years immediately following the Great Recession. In other words, the opportunities I saw when I published the articles on the S&P 500 presented above, are not as attractive today as they were then.To get a free more detailed perspective on the current value of the S&P 500, follow this direct link to a video on my site  and watch and listen to me analyze the S&P 500 out loud via the FAST Graphs fundamentals analyzer software tool.Since most of my recent work has been oriented towards investors in retirement I would like to conclude Part 1 with some comments about optimism as a person gets older. Speaking from my own experience and perspective, maintaining an optimistic attitude about my portfolio, and life in general for that matter, is now more difficult than it was when I was younger. I do not believe that I am unique in that respect. However, I also believe that remaining optimistic is even more important for investors in or near retirement than it even is for younger investors.With the above said, I offer the following caveats relating to the rather meager opportunities to find attractively-valued dividend growth stocks in today's more fully valued market. It is an undeniable fact that most best-of-breed dividend paying stalwarts have become fully valued. Not all of them, but unfortunately many of them. Consequently, even though I support maintaining an optimistic posture, I also support applying common sense and being realistic. Being disciplined with valuation in the market environment we have today is more important than it has been in several years. Good value is there to be found, but at the same time, it's now harder to find. Proceed courageously, but be prudent and cautious as you do.In Part 2, I will continue with visiting the recommendations I offered in 2010 through June in order to cover my complete first year authoring articles.See also  on seekingalpha.comThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" , a financial services technology provider, is slated to report first-quarter 2015 results on May 5. Last quarter, the company reported a positive surprise of 0.86%. Also, it delivered positive surprises in two of the last four quarters with an average surprise of 3.30%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Fiserv has expanded its foothold in the financial and payment solutions business supported by its broad customer base and various contract wins from the likes of Citizens Bank, U.S. Bank and Swift.In Dec 2014, the company extended its partnership with a leading integrated risk and finance solutions provider, Primatics Financial. The alliance was extended to provide financial institutions with advanced stress testing solutions in support of macroeconomic and regulatory stress testing. This apart, Fiserv has extended its WireXchange service to Western Union Co.  to enhance the latter's offerings. Such initiatives are likely to benefit the company going forward.However, tightening regulations in the banking and financial services industry is expected to remain a concern in 2015. We also believe that intensifying competition from peers remain a major headwind, going forward.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Fiserv will beat earnings estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Ranks #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Fiserv currently has a negative Earnings ESP because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 85 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 86 cents. This equates to a difference of -1.16%. Fiserv currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company's negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some other companies which you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Skullcandy, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +7.69% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Treehouse Foods, Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of +1.72% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["On virtually every financial website on the planet, there is a never-ending daily stream of stock tips and recommendations. Consequently, the investing public is literally flooded with information and advice regarding what stock to buy or not to buy today. Some of what is offered is supported by factual information and logic, but unfortunately, much of what is offered is merely based on the opinion of the author. This presents quite a challenge to the prudent prospective investor seeking sound advice or guidance. The recommendations are presented, and it is left to the individual to act on the advice or not based on the content as written.In addition to a barrage of information on what stocks to buy, there is also a proliferation of advice alleging to tell the investor what they ought to do. There are pundits who strongly recommend virtually every type of investing philosophy or strategy available. Some are adamant about investing in passive investments, such as index mutual funds or ETFs. Others recommend constructing portfolios based on a careful selection of individual stocks. These are just a few of the many \"ought to's\" that are often vigorously offered as the one and only choice.Additionally, there are many pundits attempting to tell the investor that they should be investing in growth stocks, value stocks, dividend growth stocks, large caps, small or mid-caps... and the list goes on. This never-ending litany of information often creates confusion and anxiety as a result of information overload. Therefore, instead of answers, many investors are left with many unanswered questions, such as whom to believe, what to believe, or where's the best place to put their money.To make matters worse, there is very little or virtually no accountability as to how the recommendations or tips have worked out over the long or short run. To be fair, this last fact is somewhat understandable. As a rather prolific author myself, I understand the challenges that come with the public dissemination of advice and guidance. This is not the same as specifically managing your own portfolio or the actual specific portfolio of someone else.Financial writers are instead generally speaking to a broad and diverse audience. In my own personal work, I have often presented research candidates that were specifically oriented to different investor types. Some of my past work has presented aggressive growth stocks; some has been oriented towards blue-chip dividend-paying stocks and everything in between. To be clear, as it is with most financial writers, each new piece of work is often independent of other pieces of work that were offered previously. In other words, there is rarely any synergy between articles written today versus ones that will be written in the future or that were written in the past.Additionally, in my own personal case, I never offer specific or absolute buy or sell recommendations. Instead, I prefer to present what I believe are interesting research candidates that might serve a certain type of investor's needs, goals or objectives. However, since I do not know each specific individual's situation that might be reading my work, I always recommend that each reader conduct their own comprehensive research and due diligence.Nevertheless, this doesn't mean that there should be no accountability of an author's work over time, whether it is mine or any other author's. This last statement was the inspiration for this series of articles.In Part 1 of this two-part series  , I presented what I consider to be a comprehensive report on the performance of individual research candidates presented in articles I wrote during my first six months as a financial author. In this, Part 2, I will complete a review of my first complete year (twelve consecutive months) of presenting research candidates on individual stock selections.Furthermore, I believe that successful investing implies taking a long-term view when investing in common stocks. By long term, I am referring to investing in and owning a business for a minimum of a normal business cycle of 3-5 years, but preferably longer. Therefore, this series of articles is only reviewing the past performance of my work based on long-term results that spanned at least a normal business cycle. To repeat what I said in Part 1, as Ben Graham so eloquently put it, \"in the short run the market is a voting machine, but in the long run it's a weighing machine.\"Once again, and to be fair to all the many other financial authors out there, I will admit to having an advantage regarding tracking the performance of my work, thanks to the  fundamentals analyzer software tool. This powerful fundamental research tool allows subscribers to permanently place buy or sell dots on individual stocks in portfolios they have created.On my recently launched website,  , I created a performance tracker on steroids, so to speak, of every individual company research recommendation I have written about in the past with buy and sell dots included. Therefore, subscribers can not only examine the results generated by my work by utilizing the performance calculating function of the research tool, they are also presented with the perspective of why and how it was created. I believe this is not only a more comprehensive way to report the past performance of my work, but I respectfully submit I believe it is more honest as well. I take this position because I understand that mere numbers do not always tell the complete story.Furthermore, as I stated in Part 1: To be fair, I will also add that I did not own all of these recommended research candidates, but I did own most of them. Furthermore, these calculations do not include specific times where I sold. In other words, this is not a precise presentation of portfolio performance; instead, it is simply reviewing the record produced by the individual research candidates based on the publication date of articles. Readers of these articles were free to choose to ignore, buy and/or sell any of these offerings based on their own needs or views.As it specifically relates to this series of articles, it's also important for me to interject that this is not an exercise meant to brag about how smart I have been. As I previously stated, not all of my research candidate recommendations were profitable. I have included the good, the bad and the ugly.Before I go on and present the record of the articles I wrote my first year as an author, I believe a few comments regarding performance reporting in general are in order. There are those that believe that performance reporting is a straightforward process, whereas in truth it is not. Calculating the numbers from point A to point B for a stock, mutual fund, ETF, individual money manager or any other asset class does not necessarily tell the whole story. There are many other considerations that should be taken into account when evaluating the performance of any investment.Perhaps the most important consideration is the amount of risk taken to achieve a certain performance. There are times when taking on great risk produces great results, and of course, there are times when taking on great risk produces abysmal results. Therefore, when examining past performance, the prudent investor also evaluates the amount of risk it took to achieve it.And since we all know that \"past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results\", it logically follows that knowing the amount of risk it took to generate a level of past performance is critical. In other words, some investments are suitable for certain investors and others are not, regardless of past performance. Consequently, making an investment decision solely based on past performance can be both misleading and dangerous.Then, there are also considerations that should be given to the makeup of past performance results. How much of it came from capital appreciation versus how much from dividend income is but one example. To the investor who is depending on the income their portfolio produces to live off of, the income component is significantly more important than capital appreciation. For example, a powerful growth stock may have generated significant historical total returns, but no dividends. Consequently, that growth stock might not be suitable for the retired investor needing income.Of course, I cannot write on the subject of performance measurement without mentioning valuation considerations. There can be times when a given stock produced poor historical total returns simply because the measuring period started at a time of excessive valuation. Therefore, the headwinds of high valuation might have caused poor historical performance, even when the company generated strong operating performance at the same time.The opposite could also be true. Great historical performance could have been a function of extreme undervaluation at the start of the measured time frame. This could occur even if a given company produced mediocre operating performance. The tailwinds of undervaluation could have easily produced aberrantly high historical results. And it should also be understood that a historical performance result of every valuation metric in between could also be the source of good or bad historical performance. Just knowing the raw numbers is not enough to base an intelligent decision upon.Then, there is the subject of benchmarking. There are many that believe that every portfolio's performance should be measured against a specific benchmark, such as the S&P 500. These people like to argue that if your portfolio didn't beat an index, it failed you. I completely disagree. My problem with benchmarking against an index is that the index may not be a suitable choice for certain investors, especially retired investors in need of income.There are many high-quality blue-chip dividend growth stocks that have outperformed the S&P 500 index on both capital appreciation and dividend income. On the other hand, there are many high-quality blue-chip dividend growth stocks that have underperformed the S&P 500 index based on capital appreciation, but produced significantly more dividend income. In other words, there are different components of total return or past performance that could make an investment suitable for some investors, but not for others.As a point of interest, I do believe that every portfolio should be measured against a benchmark. However, I do not believe that the benchmark needs to be an index. Instead, I believe the best benchmarks that certain investors should measure their portfolios against are their own unique goals, objectives and risk tolerances.To some investors, this might be a certain level of income that is growing; to other investors with different goals and objectives, it might mean a total rate of return objective that is commensurate with the amount of risk they're willing to take. I do believe that a portfolio should be managed toward specific goals, but I do not believe those goals are necessarily related to an arbitrarily selected product or index.I am only covering a few aspects of the complexity of performance reporting; there are many others too numerous to cover in a single article. However, I hope that what I presented at least enlightens the reader to the reality that performance reporting is not the simple or straightforward process that many would like to lead us to believe. There are many nuances and considerations that must be made when evaluating the historical performance results of any investment.What follows is a wide-ranging look-back at the second six months of my first year's worth of offerings, where I presented fairly valued research candidates for readers to consider. In this, Part 2, I will cover my recommendations through July 2010. In addition to individual companies I covered, I will also cover an example where I wrote about the S&P 500 index as a proxy for the market. Just as I did in Part 1, I will include a few comments on the S&P 500 article that represent the pushback I received because my article was positive about the market.On January 14, 2010, I wrote a strong recommendation on Hudson City Bancorp. Although this represents another mistake, the long-term losses have been modest. Even though I am not especially proud of this recommendation, I did learn a lot from the experience.This was a follow-up to a previous article I wrote on Fiserv in 2009. The valuation has remained attractive, and the long-term performance has been exceptional. However, the current extreme overvaluation contributed greatly. I would be happy if the stock were still trading at a fair value P/E ratio of 15.Hewlett-Packard represented another mistake. However, I was long this stock and aggressively added to it in 2011 (not shown on the graph) because I felt that the market had overreacted to temporary earnings weakness. I continue to hold Hewlett-Packard, and have a modest profit on the total position.Jack Henry was offered as a high-growth dividend growth stock with a modest yield. Its performance has been exceptional, but the valuation is currently higher than I am comfortable with.On February 3, 2010, I saw an opportunity to invest in the blue-chip Dividend Champion/Aristocrat PepsiCo. The opportunity to find a blue-chip dividend growth stock at such an attractive valuation was a rarity that I was happy to see.To get a free more detailed perspective on the advantage of investing in a blue-chip like PepsiCo at sound valuation, follow this direct link to a video on my site  , and watch and listen to me analyze PepsiCo out loud via the F.A.S.T. Graphs fundamentals analyzer software tool.As indicated by the green dots on the graph, I published several articles on Apple, and each produced attractive returns, thanks to growth and valuation. I am long Apple and continue to recommend it even today.Sysco was offered as an opportunity to invest in a blue-chip dividend growth stock that historically commanded a premium valuation. As time unfolded, the company has moved back towards its historical premium valuation, and its dividend has increased each year. Earnings, however, have been a disappointment.The following performance on Sysco associated with the above graph illustrates one of the nuances of performance calculations discussed above. Although the capital appreciation for Sysco modestly underperformed the S&P 500, this blue-chip dividend growth stock produced significantly more dividend income than the index did. For the retired investor in need of dividend income, Sysco's performance was better than that of the index. This is especially true when you consider that the S&P 500 index froze its dividend in 2007 and cut the dividend by 20% in 2008. Sysco's shareholders saw their dividend income increase over the same time frame.Although Kohl's did not produce the earnings growth I anticipated, the initiation of a dividend in 2011 contributed to positive results. Today, the company appears attractive with an above-market current dividend yield and attractive valuation.Best Buy was a disappointment, even though the earnings continued to grow over the next year and a half after I wrote the article. This is a classic example representing the importance of continuous monitoring and due diligence. The company was sold in 2012.In March 2005, I presented an article that covered the two primary managed care companies, Aetna and United Healthcare. Healthcare reforms created significant undervaluation opportunities for both companies. At the time, these were pure growth stocks, and today, they are dividend growth stocks. However, I consider them both overvalued at this time.McDonald's was offered as a dividend growth stock with a strong historical record of earnings and dividend growth. Based on past growth, the company was fairly valued at the time. However, earnings growth since the article was published has been disappointing. Nevertheless, as we will soon see, McDonald's performance based on dividend income was attractive as compared to that of the S&P 500.The following performance report is produced over approximately the same time frame since the article was published. Although McDonald's underperformed the S&P 500 based on capital appreciation due to weaker-than-expected earnings growth, its total cumulative dividend income significantly exceeded that of the S&P 500.On March 12, 2010, I offered Buffalo Wild Wings as a high-growth research candidate. The company has delivered on both earnings growth and price performance. However, I believe it is currently overvalued.On March 16, I presented Oracle as an above-average growth stock with a modest dividend yield. This was just after the company had acquired Sun Microsystems.Deckers Outdoor Corp. represented another offering for the growth stock investor. Interestingly, its earnings and price performance for the years immediately following publication were exceptional, as indicated in the first graph below.Additionally, the next earnings and price-correlated graph calculating performance on Deckers to-date illustrates the risk associated with investing in high-growth stocks. Price volatility has been extreme as a result of an earnings hiccup in fiscal year 2012.On March 25, 2010, I was attracted to GameStop based on its extremely low valuation. This company has been much maligned by Wall Street. However, it has continued to produce solid earnings, and has since morphed into an attractively valued dividend growth stock.I  an article on Nike, where I asked if we could trust its current stock price. The article received significant pushback from the company's fans. In the article I stated that Nike was one of my favorite companies, and it still is. The only thing I don't like about Nike is its current high valuation. This article, published on April 8, 2010, illustrates that I truly like Nike when its valuation is sound.Ross Stores was offered as a quintessential example of a consistent earnings and dividend producer. Its performance has been exceptional, although I consider the company overvalued currently.On April 28, I presented Almost Family Inc. as an attractively valued growth stock in the healthcare sector. This represents another example of the risks associated with investing in pure growth stocks.Medtronic was a blue-chip dividend growth stock that I waited for years to find at attractive valuation. As indicated by the additional green dots on the graph, I continued to write about this company as it remained undervalued over the next few years. Since that time, its performance and dividend growth has been very attractive.On May 10, 2010, I published a second article on Cognizant as a high-quality growth stock. This represents an example where growth stock investing can be attractive.Intel was offered as an undervalued tech stock that was morphing from a quasi-cyclical growth company to a dividend growth stock. I felt the company was undervalued at the time I published the article.Abbott Labs was presented as a high-quality blue-chip dividend growth stock on sale. Subsequent to the article being published, the company split into two separate entities. Consequently, the first Abbott graph calculates performance from the time the article was published to the spin-off date indicated by the red dot on the graph.This second graph calculates performance of Abbott after AbbVie (ABBV) was spun off. In order to get a complete comparison of how the Abbott Labs research recommendation performed, you have to include both calculations. Note, the apparent big price drop is not an actual fall in price. Instead, it simply represents the resetting from the combined company to the single company.To complete a full analysis of the Abbott recommendation, you have to also include the performance of AbbVie post spin-off.The Mattel research recommendation worked out quite well for several years following the publication of the article. However, this example represents the importance of continuous monitoring and due diligence.Kimberly-Clark was offered as an undervalued blue-chip dividend growth stock in July 2010. Although its performance has been excellent, I do consider the company moderately overvalued currently.Automatic Data Processing has a long history of commanding a premium valuation. Consequently, I was attracted to the company on July 13, 2010, when valuation was historically low.After my growth stock recommendation, Google, had fallen modestly from my first article in 2009, I considered it even more attractively valued. Over the long term, both Google recommendations have performed well.Finally, on July 25, I published another optimistic article on the S&P 500. Once again, I received significant pushback, as evidenced by the comments included after the following graph.This series of articles was presented as a review and accountability of my first year's worth of publishing. Importantly, this provides an appropriate long-term period in order to assess results. However, my intention was not to boast about how well my work has panned out. More importantly, I felt this review contains important lessons on valuation and performance reporting.Although some of these selections have produced extraordinary results, it's vitally important to recognize that much of it has come from current overvaluation. This represents what I mean when I say that measuring performance without simultaneously measuring valuation is a job half done. Just looking at numbers is not enough. In my opinion, it's more important to understand how and why those numbers were generated.I hope this series of articles provided the reader deeper insights into understanding and evaluating performance measurements.

The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by strong performance by the International Solutions segment.Integrated Financial Solutions revenues jumped 2.5% year over year to $969 million driven by growth across all regions.Revenues from Global Financial Solutions increased 8.3% year over year to $587 million driven by strong growth in consulting, professional and digital delivery solutions.Corporate and Other revenues remained almost flat on a year-over-year basis.Operating income grew 24.8% year over year to $269.4 million.Fidelity's balance sheet remained highly leveraged at the end of the reported quarter.As of Mar 31, 2014, cash and cash equivalents were $489 million and debt outstanding totaled $5.2 billion.Net cash provided by operations was $231 million and adjusted cash flow from operations was $315 million. Capital expenditures were $101 million resulting in free cash flow of $214 million in the first quarter of 2015.Fidelity repurchased 2.2 million common shares for $150 million in the first quarter 2015. As of Mar 31, 2015, approximately $1.4 billion remained under the existing share repurchase authorization. In addition, the company paid shareholder dividends of $73 million.For 2015, Fidelity expects organic revenues to grow in the range of 1% to 3%. The company expects 2014 earnings in the range of $3.27 to $3.37, an increase of 6-9% over 2014.Fidelity's commanding position in the financial services market, increasing international exposure, recurring revenue model, diversified product portfolio, cost synergies from acquisitions and a loyal customer base are significant positives.Fidelity has been forming strategic partnerships with firms like Fifth Third Bank and American Blue Ribbon Holdings, which are expected to drive growth, going forward. Also, the company's initiatives to share profits with its investors like the recent 8% dividend hike are a positive.Moreover, we believe that Fidelity is well positioned to benefit from increasing investment in mobile banking and innovative products such as PayNet. Mobile banking is developing into an essential extension of online banking as smartphone and tablet usage continue to accelerate globally.However, increasing consolidation in the banking sector, challenging environment for the Payments Solutions business and uncertain regulatory environment are the primary headwinds, in our view. Also, intensifying competition from the likes of Fiserv  , Global Payments Inc.  and Alliance Data Systems Corp.  remains a concern.Currently, Fidelity has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

On a year-over-year basis, earnings per share improved 25% aided by higher revenues and higher client additions.Total revenue in the first-quarter was $702.3 million, up 2.7% from the year-ago quarter. Excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements, consolidated operating revenues decreased 1.9% year over year to $495.7 million and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $508 million.Financial Services operating revenues (excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements) decreased 3.2% year over year to $250.5 million, primarily due to the sale of Global Solutions in the fourth quarter. Moreover, unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations impacted segmental revenuesHealthcare Services operating revenues were approximately flat on a year over year basis and came in at $92 million. Lower pharmacy claims were offset by the expansion of existing clients. Notably, an increase in Medicare and Medicaid members, expansion of existing and new clients coupled with higher business process outsourcing were positives in the quarter.Customer Communications (previously Output Solutions) operating revenues increased a modest 0.2% year over year to $152.6 million. Contribution from North America remained strong due to client wins.Apart from this, Investments and Other Segment operating revenues decreased 65% year over year to $0.7 million. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to lower occupancy revenues.Cost and expenses were up 1.7% from the year-ago quarter to $593.8 million, primarily due to increased investments for new business expansion.

Long-term debt (including current portion) was $512.5 million compared with $612.1 million in the previous quarter.During the first quarter, DST Systems repurchased 0.8 million shares worth $75 million and paid a dividend of 30 cents per share.DST reported mixed first quarter results. Also, the quarter's revenues decreased on a year over year basis. Lower number of client additions, unfavorable market conditions and lower-than-expected revenues from its operating segments impacted the quarter's results.However, we are still of the opinion that DST Systems' business volume and massive scale of operation in Financial Services will attract new customers. Moreover, we expect steady contributions from the acquisitions to support revenue growth. Continued share buybacks and dividend payments are the other encouraging factorsOn the other hand, decreasing organic revenue growth, tough competition from International Business Machines Corporation  and Fiserv Inc.  , and a high debt burden remain concerns.Currently, DST Systems carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors can also consider another technology stock, Avago Technologies Limited  that sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

We believe that the company has a solid franchise in rating debt instruments backed by its diversified credit research business model and international growth opportunities which are significant growth drivers.Moody's, along with Standard & Poor's, holds a dominant position in the duopolistic credit rating industry. It has also gained significant market share in the analytics business based on its strong product portfolio. The company has a diversified customer base, which includes a range of corporate and government issuers of securities as well as institutional investors, depositors, creditors, investment banks, commercial banks and other financial intermediaries.Approximately 51% of Moody's' revenues are recurring in nature, which lends stability and predictability to the revenue stream. Going forward, increasing bond and bank loan issuance along with higher monitoring revenues related to new ratings customers will remain the key drivers in the corporate finance line, the largest revenue contributor of Moody's Investors Service. We believe that Moody's is well positioned to achieve strong long-term growth based on the above factors.However, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company faces stiff competition in most of its served markets. In the credit rating sector, the company faces competition from Fitch, S&P Ratings Services, Morningstar and many other regional providers. In the analytics segment, it competes with Dun & Bradstreet  , Bloomberg, International Business Machines Corporation  and Fiserv  to name a few. In the risk management software market, the company lists large software developers including SAS, Oracle, IBM and Mysis as its competitors.

While the top line indicates a 23% year-over-year increase, the bottom line suggests an 18% increase over 2014. For the first quarter of 2015, Alliance Data expects revenues of about $1.54 billion (up 25% year over year) and core EPS of approximately $3.40 (up 22% year over year).Alliance Data's inorganic story seems impressive given its strategic acquisitions. Its latest acquisition of Conversant, Inc. will enhance growth in the digital marketing segment and widen omni-channel distribution capabilities. Riding on its financial strength and flexibility, we expect Alliance Data to undertake such strategic acquisitions that would help it to boost its growth profile.Moreover, Alliance Data has always remained focused on enhancing its shareholders' value. Though the company has never paid dividends and intends to pay one either, it rewards shareholders through share buybacks. Share repurchases lower the share count and give a boost to the bottom line.Alliance Data has been continually strengthening its balance sheet with improving cash and leverage ratios. This in turn helps it to deploy funds in strategic initiatives as and when required.However, Alliance Data has been witnessing a rise in expenses over the past few years. The increase is largely owing to higher cost of operations and increased general and administrative expense. As a result, operating margin continues to contract.In addition, AIR MILES reward miles issued is directly proportional to AIR MILES reward miles available to be redeemed in the future. This in turn might affect revenues. The company expects AIR MILES reward miles issuance to grow as sponsors accelerate their promotional activity with new AIR MILES Cash initiatives.Alliance Data presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Photo:  via Flickr.The days of writing a check to pay your gas and electric bill are quickly coming to a close. Some two-thirds of all bills were paid electronically in 2012, a 20% increase from five years earlier, and, according to financial services technology provider  , 27 million households now pay at least one bill from their phone.It's not surprising then that  smells an opportunity and is  to launch a new bill payment service inside its Gmail email platform that builds on the Google Wallet pairing it did in 2013, allowing users to send money to friends and family via email.Re/Code reports that the new service has been dubbed Pony Express and will roll out in the fourth quarter this year. Re/Code said it had seen a document on the service, but that a Google spokeswoman declined to comment. According to  , all a Gmail user would have to do is turn over to third-party vendors for authentication their personal information, including name, address, Social Security number, and possibly even full credit card numbers.After a user was verified, they'd be able to receive in their inboxes electronic statements from billers and then have the option to pay them right from within the email system.As Re/code points out, Pony Express wouldn't be the first service to try to create a central hub for collecting, organizing, and paying bills --  bought Check last year for $360 million to allow it to build on its Mint personal finance service -- but with more than 425 million active Gmail users and 500 million active accounts, Google has a readily available base of customers to quickly dominate the niche.That is if it can get over the hurdle of having people turn over sensitive information to make the process work.While security breaches at companies like  and  have shaken consumer confidence in the ability of corporations to protect their personal data, and the theft of documents from  that ultimately led to its co-chairman resigning shows the vulnerability of corporate email systems, Google hasn't won accolades either for instilling trust in its ability to maintain privacy.There have been plenty of shadowy instances in Google's recent past that may call into question its sincerity in protecting your privacy. Photo:  via FlickrWhile it may not have as bad a reputation as  in violating boundaries of trust bestowed on it by users, Google has engaged in a series of missteps that calls into question how closely it hews to its own privacy protection policies. Over the years Google has:And then there was the brouhaha over Google's scanning your emails to allegedly search for spam, though it says Gmail users should have no \"reasonable expectation\" of privacy in the confidentiality of their emails.The value in collecting and compiling so much user-specific information -- which the Pony Express bill pay service as reported would expand exponentially -- is that Google can sell the data to advertisers across its various platforms, such as AdSense ads based on your search history that appear as you visit sites or watch YouTube videos.Its success, however, could turn on whether younger generations of Internet users feel comfortable giving up sensitive information to third parties.While conventional wisdom suggests so-called millennials -- those born between 1980 and 2000 -- have a more cavalier attitude about privacy on the Internet, a 2010 Pew Research Center survey found 44% of young adults limit the amount of personal information available about them online and 71% of 18-29-year-olds on social networks changed their profile privacy settings to limit what could be seen online.Mobile shopping has made users far more willing to connect their personal information to businesses, making bill paying via email the next advance. Photo:  via FlickrStill, two-thirds of millennials already use their smartphones to pay bills and the growth of mobile payments -- whether it's an individual app like the one  uses, or the more connected Apple Pay network from  --  seems to make an email payment service a logical extension. With the average age of a Gmail user being 31 years old, this would seemingly be a natural fit for Google.It already laid the groundwork with the ability to send and receive money via email by connecting its Google Wallet service to Gmail, which was a component of a larger strategy to make Google Wallet-based services beyond POS payments even more ubiquitous.Although it would seem the explosion in privacy and data breaches would make people more leery of giving up personal information to a serial abuser such as Google, so ubiquitous are its services that many may not even give it a second thought. And that could make the Pony Express a privacy disaster waiting to happen.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed. And if you act right away, it could make you wildly rich. Experts are calling it the single largest business opportunity in the history of capitalism...  is calling it \"transformative\"... But you'll probably just call it \"how I made my millions.\" Don't be too late to the party --  when the Web goes dark.The article  originally appeared on Fool.com.Copyright \u00a9 1995 - 2015 The Motley Fool, LLC.

Earnings per share (EPS) came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.For full year 2014, the company reported adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $3.10 per share, an increase of 9.9% on a year over year basis.Revenues increased 7.4% year over year (5% organic growth) to $1,689.1 million, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,704 million. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by strong performance from the International Solutions segment.For full year 2014, the company reported revenue growth of 5.8% year over year to $6,413.8 million.International Solutions revenues rose about 13% year over year (11% organic growth) to $397.7 million backed by strength in implementation and consulting services.Revenues from Financial Solutions increased 7% year over year to $645.4 million (4% organic growth), driven by strong growth in consulting, professional services, risk and compliance solutions.Payment Solutions revenues grew 5% on a year-over-year basis (3% organic) to $647.2 million, driven by growth in network solutions along with an increase in card production and payment processing volumes.Operating income increased to $351.1 million from $220.7 million in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin increased 110 basis points (bps) to 33.9%. Adjusted EBITDA stood at $525.6 million, up from $484.0 million in the year-ago period. EBITDA margin increased 30 bps on a year-over-year basis to 31.1%.Fidelity's balance sheet remained highly leveraged at the end of the reported quarter. As of Dec 31, 2014, cash and cash equivalents totaled $492.8 million, while debt outstanding totaled $5.1 billion.Fidelity generated $1.2 billion in cash from operations in fiscal 2014 versus approximately $1.1 billion in the prior year. Free cash flow for fiscal 2014 rose to $864.3 million from $826.2 million in fiscal 2013.The company repurchased 8.7 million shares for $476 million in fiscal 2014 and paid approximately $275 million in dividends.For fiscal 2015, Fidelity expects revenues to grow in the range of 5% to 7%. The company expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.37 to $3.49, reflecting growth of 9% to 13% from 2014 levels.Free cash flow is expected to be nearly the same as adjusted net earnings for the year.Fidelity's commanding position in the financial services market, increasing international exposure, recurring revenue model, diversified product portfolio, cost synergies from acquisitions and a loyal customer base are significant positives.Fidelity has been forming strategic partnerships with firms like Fifth Third Bank and American Blue Ribbon Holdings, which are expected to drive growth going forward. Also, the company's initiatives to share profits with its investors like the recent 8% increase in dividend are a positive.Moreover, we believe that Fidelity is well positioned to benefit from increasing investment in mobile banking and innovative products such as PayNet. Mobile banking is developing into an essential extension of online banking as smartphone and tablet usage continue to accelerate globally.However, increasing consolidation in the banking sector, challenging environment for the Payments Solutions business and uncertain regulatory environment are the primary headwinds, in our view. Also, intensifying competition from the likes of Fiserv (  ), Global Payments Inc. (  ) and Alliance Data Systems Corp. (  ) remains a concern.Currently, Fidelity has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

(  ). The modernized service will provide more choices to financial institutions looking for foreign currency exchange solutions.The new technology will have features such as direct credit and auto convert and will be provided to financial institutions by the company's Business Solutions segment. These new features will enable the financial institutions to provide their customers - both commercial and retail - the facility of sending funds across the border at favorable rates and with greater reliability and flexibility.The new feature of direct credit of funds will enable financial institutions to use the global clearing network of Western Union. The funds meant to be transferred will be directed through in-country clearing networks within the beneficiary foreign countries. Since these local payment channels are more cost effective for banks and their customers, the overall cost of transferring funds for financial institutions and their customers will go down.The second feature of the service is auto convert. This will enable financial institutions to convert and deliver funds in local currency in case cross-border wires are denominated in the U.S. dollar.The funds denominated in U.S. dollar meant for remittance will be converted in local currency at the front end of the transaction which will also generate foreign exchange revenue for financial institutions. From the point of view of the recipients, it will clear the uncertainty on the amount of funds to be received if they are converted at unpredictable and unfavorable rates upon delivery.Through this service, financial institutions will be equipped with effective global payment tools, thereby being capable of providing a broader array of services to customers and gaining a channel for non-interest revenue generation.Western Union holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The third quarter saw operating earnings per share (EPS) of 44 cents, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents and up 13% on a year-over-year basis.Western Union's better-than-expected EPS were driven by revenue growth across all its segments, along with tight expense management.Western Union is a stalwart among its peers such as Moneygram International Inc. (  ) and Xoom Corp. (  ). Its status is backed by a strong brand name, vast reach in the U.S., superior customer service, fast penetration within high-growth international markets and presence at nearly 500,000 locations in 200 countries, with over 100,000 ATMs.Going forward, we expect Western Union to maintain this strong earnings trend given the bright prospects of its key Consumer-to-Consumer business which accounts for a chunk of its total revenue. The segment is poised to benefit from an increase in global immigration trends and is witnessing a rebound in its retail-oriented business which will contribute strongly to revenues in the upcoming quarters.We also favorably view the progress made by the company in its new-age services through electronic channels such as online banking, westernunion.com, ATMs and Mobile money transfer. Electronic Channel revenues, which include westernunion.com, digital and account-based money transfer through banks, surged 21% in the third quarter.The company is also planning to make investments in areas such as cost initiatives, digital and mobile innovation, compliance and cybersecurity to drive growth and productivity in the future.However, the company has been facing compliance-related issues for quite some time. As such, the company is witnessing an increase in compliance expenses which is expected to hurt revenues by approximately 3.5% to 4% in 2014, and lower earnings in turn.Moreover, Western Union's business is dependent on the global economy.

The company's non-GAAP earnings of $1.73 per share not only surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.53, but also increased 29.1% from $1.34 earned in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year increase was mainly aided by higher revenues and higher client additions.Total revenue was $706.5 million, up 5.9% from the year-ago quarter. Excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements, consolidated operating revenues increased 3.3% year over year to $516.7 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $500 million.Financial Services operating revenues (excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements) increased 2.4% year over year to $264.3 million. The upside was primarily driven by revenue growth at ALPS, Retirement Solutions and Brokerage Solutions which gained from new client conversions and favorable market conditions.Healthcare Services operating revenues increased 12.4% year over year to $101.8 million. The improvement was mainly due to higher pharmacy claims and increase in Medicare and Medicaid members, expansion of existing clients and new pharmacy discount card services.Customer Communications (previously Output Solutions) operating revenues increased a modest 0.8% year over year to $163.3 million. Operating revenues from North America improved 0.9% mainly on the back of increased volumes from new clients which was partially offset by soft volume from existing clients. Operating revenues from the U.K. went up 0.6% year over year.Apart from this, Investments and Other Segment operating revenues decreased 6.5% year over year.Non-GAAP operating income increased 5.5% year over year to $93.5 million, while, as a percentage of operating revenues, it improved 40 basis points (bps) to 18.1%. DST Systems reported non-GAAP net income of $66.4 million or $1.73 per share compared with $57.0 million or $1.34 in the year-ago quarter.DST Systems' balance sheet appears highly leveraged. The company exited 2014 with $151.7 million in cash and equivalents compared with $62.5 million in the previous quarter. Long-term debt (including current portion) was $552.9 million compared with $683.0 million reported at the end of 2013.During the fourth quarter, DST Systems repurchased 1.2 million shares for $107.9 million and paid dividends of 30 cents per share. Further, the company repurchased 525,000 shares for $50 million and completed the existing share repurchase program in Jan 2015.On Jan 28, DST Systems' board of directors approved a new $250 million share repurchase program. Apart from this, the board announced a quarterly cash dividend of 30 cents per share payable on Mar 15 to shareholders on record as of Feb 27.DST reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results. Also, results increased on a year-over-year basis. Higher client additions, favorable market conditions and growth at ALPS, Retirement Solutions and DST Brokerage Solutions drove revenues.Segment performances were also modest with synergies from acquired units. However, persistent decline at the company's mutual fund registered shareowner account processing and lower software license remain the concerns.Nonetheless, we are of the opinion that DST Systems' business volume and massive scale of operation in Financial Services will attract customers. Moreover, steady contributions from the acquisitions should support revenue growth, in our view. Continued share buybacks and dividend payments are the other encouraging factors.On the other hand, tough competition from International Business Machines Corporation (  ) and Fiserv Inc.

About 8.2 million shares exchanged hands in the last session.Western Union's strong third-quarter financial performance was a continuation of superior results and attractive revenue and earnings growth. The company posted an earnings surprise in each of the past four quarters, with an average earnings beat being 9.27%.During the third quarter, the company's operating income of 44 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents and improved 13% year over year.Western Union results infused confidence among investors, since earnings growth for the company was not skewed toward some particular segments but was broad based with all the segments witnessing increased revenues.The company's top line also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.5% and increased 5% year over year.Investors were also impressed by the positive results from Europe and in the Middle East despite a weak global economy and continuing geopolitical tensions.The company's constant thrust toward cost containment, digital and mobile innovation, compliance and cyber security assures investors' about its future growth and productivity.Optimism over the stock was also driven by the fact that Western Union upped its full-year earnings per share outlook to approximately $1.50, which is the high end of its previous range of $1.45 to $1.50.Driven by optimism surrounding the stock, over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2014 earnings per share climbed 2.7% to $1.51.

Excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements, consolidated operating revenues increased 6.3% year over year to $510.5 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $491 million.Financial Services operating revenues (excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements) increased 7.3% year over year to $254.4 million, primarily driven by revenue growth at ALPS and Brokerage Solutions. Moreover, revenues from ALPS and DST Brokerage Solutions were positively aided by new client conversions and favorable market conditions.Healthcare Services operating revenues increased 18.3% year over year to $95.5 million. The improvement was mainly due to higher pharmacy claims and increase in Medicare and Medicaid members, expansion of existing clients and new pharmacy discount card services.Customer Communications (previously Output Solutions) operating revenues declined a modest 1.3% year over year to $156.7 million. Contribution from North America remained weak due to client loss.Apart from this, Investments and Other Segment operating revenues increased 8.3% year over year to $3.9 million. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to higher occupancy revenues and lower depreciation expense.Cost and expenses were up 6% from the year-ago quarter to $563.3 million, primarily due to increased investments for new business expansion. This resulted in the contraction of operating margin (down 11 bps on a year-over-year basis to 16.9%).

Long-term debt (including current portion) was $612.1 million compared with $671.7 million reported in the previous quarter.During the third quarter, DST Systems repurchased 1 million shares worth $92.1 million and paid dividends of 30 cents per share.DST reported better-than-expected third quarter results. Also, the quarter's results increased on a year-over-year basis. Higher number of client additions, favorable market conditions and growth at ALPS and DST Brokerage Solutions drove revenues.Segment performances were also modest with synergies from acquired units. Higher conversions into DST's sub-accounting platform were encouraging but growth in registered accounts continued to lag.However, we are still of the opinion that DST Systems' business volume and massive scale of operation in Financial Services will attract new customers. Moreover, we expect steady contributions from the acquisitions to support revenue growth. Continued share buybacks and dividend payments are the other encouraging factorsOn the other hand, decreasing organic revenue growth, tough competition from International Business Machines Corporation (  ) and Fiserv Inc.

Revenues of $1.18 billion, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24 billion.Fiserv's diversified product portfolio and continued technology upgrades are expected to boost its top-line growth. Higher synergies (both top-line and cost) from the Open Solutions acquisition and continuous contract wins by the DNA platform are expected to drive growth over the next couple of years.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Fiserv will beat earnings estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Ranks #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 84 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Fiserv currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Though Zacks Ranks #1, 2 or 3 increase the predictive power of ESP, the company's ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some other companies, which you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Facebook Inc.

Free cash flow is expected to be nearly same as adjusted net earnings for the year.We believe that Fidelity's commanding position in the financial services market, increasing international exposure, recurring revenue model, diversified product portfolio, cost synergies from acquisitions and a loyal customer base are significant positives.Moreover, strong demand for its solutions is expected to boost top-line growth in the near term. The company continues to win contracts from banks and financial institutions internationally, which will further drive its market share.Fidelity's licensing agreement with Visa (  ) and MasterCard (  ) to offer EMV enabled debit cards to its NYCE partners is a key growth catalyst. We believe that increasing EMV adoption in the U.S. will drive Fidelity's top-line growth in 2014.However, increasing consolidation in the banking sector, challenging environment for the Payments Solutions business and uncertain regulatory environment are the primary headwinds, in our view.

The company's second-quarter 2014 earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, though it topped the year-ago quarter figure by about 17%.A rising trend has been witnessed with respect to total operating expenses, which rose 36.9% year over year in first-half 2014. Subsequently, operating margin shrunk to 15.0% in first-half 2014 from 18.6% in the year-ago period, 18.1% in 2013 and 19.1% in 2012.Growth outlook for operating margins in 2014 also appears stressful and indefensible given additional expenses related to the NetSpend acquisition as well as loss of revenues from discontinued operations in Japan. This is also reflected in management's growth projection of operating earnings per share in the band of 10-12% in 2014, which is noticeably lower than 18% growth recorded in 2013.Nevertheless, Total System is well positioned to tap the rapidly growing digital payments and prepaid cards market, along with forming strategic merchant acquiring alliances. The total acquisitions, primarily including NetSpend, have been contributing about 31.6% to top line in first-half 2014, up from 16.7% in 2013 and 1.8% in 2012.Additionally, strong double-digit growth in cardholder transactions and revenues as well as improved operating cash flow, which rebounded by surging 52.3% year over year to $239.4 million in first-half 2014 after declining in 2013, supported share buybacks during second-quarter 2014, after about a year of lull.Overall, a balanced risk-reward profilein the near term has led to estimates hitting a plateau for 2014 and 2015. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2014 and 2015 remained intact at $1.77 and $2.07 per share, respectively, in the last 30 days.However, the Most Accurate estimate for Total System's 2015 earnings currently stand at $2.15 a share, resulting in an  of +3.9%. On a year-over-year basis, earnings are expected to increase 10.5% in 2014 and 16.9% in 2015.Stocks that look promising in the financial sector include Visa Inc. (  ), Fiserv Inc. (  ) and Equifax Inc. (  ). All of these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

The acquisition will enable it to expand its footprint in the high-growth Asia-Pacific region.The transaction was valued at $268 million. The purchase was funded by a combination of cash on hand and borrowings on the company's revolving credit facility.Ezidebit specializes in recurring payment verticals in New Zealand and Australia. It processes over $3.5 billion of transactions annually in Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong.Comparable to Global Payments' OpenEdge division, Ezidebit uses a network of integrated software vendors and direct channels for marketing its offerings. The deal will give Global Payments access to this established network.The integration of Global Payments' technology and integrated payment capabilities with Ezidebit's technology-based, direct distribution solutions augur well for expanding the former's global footprint by exploiting new markets.The acquisition is in tune with the company's strategy of deepening distribution channels across vertical market segments and strengthening its breadth of integrated payment processing solutions via acquisitions.Global Payments previously acquired Accelerated Payment Technologies in 2012 and Payment Processing, Inc. (PayPros) in January this year, looking to leverage their wide network of technology-based enterprise software partners.For the remainder of fiscal 2015, Global Payments expects the acquisition to add roughly $25 million to revenues and be marginally accretive to the company's cash operating margins. Global Payments' revenue forecast for the fiscal year 2015 lies in the range of $2.69 billion to $2.76 billion. However, the deal is expected to be dilutive to fiscal 2015 GAAP earnings per share.Global Payments currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other notable stocks in the financial transaction services industry that warrant a look include Fiserv, Inc. (  ), MasterCard Incorporated (  ) and Visa Inc.

The special feature of this card is that it combines truck stop and convenience store acceptance capabilities.The main beneficiaries of this product will include fleets with a mix of heavy and medium duty trucks that require more fueling options, which normal truck stop cards cannot provide. The benefits from this card are Over-The-Road pricing on diesel fuel, access to over 70,000 sites, consistent level III data capture and tight card controls. An added benefit is the WEX Fleet One rebate that these fleets will be able to access at more than 1700 truck stops throughout the nation. Thus, the card is one of its kind owing to features like local convenience store acceptance, established fuel discounts, Over-The-Road friendly driver features and broad 18 wheel friendly acceptance.All the aforementioned features ensure increased savings for the fleets using All Roads. Thus, in a way, the All Roads fuel card is a one-stop solution for fleets with a mix of vehicle sizes.WEX has been consistently focused on enhancing its payment solutions business. Last month, the company extended its fuel-price risk management program through the first quarter of 2016. While reporting second-quarter 2014 results, management stated that total fuel transactions have reflected a 6% year-over-year increase while total revenue increased 13%. Additionally, the company guided its 2014 revenues in the range of $813-$823 million, higher than $717.5 million reported in 2013. We believe that the above-mentioned endeavors will enable the company to increase its fuel transactions, thereby helping it achieve the targeted revenue range.Currently, WEX carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The repurchase initiative strengthens Equifax's commitment to increase value of its shareholders. Per company records, Equifax has returned $2.4 billion through share buybacks and dividends over the last 10-year period.Also, the company has a solid cash flow generating ability that enables these initiatives. Equifax reported cash flow from operations of $217.8 million in the first six months of fiscal 2014 (ended Jun 30, 2014), compared with $202.8 million in the year-ago period.Additionally, the company has reported decent growth rates in the last few years. Total revenue grew 11% in 2013, 10.2% in 2012, 5.4% in 2011 and 8.4% in 2010. Revenue growth in 2013 was driven by good management execution and strong performance across all of its business segments. Moreover, modest economic growth in addition to continued general consumer credit activity, product innovations, initiatives to foster enterprise growth and efficient business executions have led Equifax to project long-term average organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%.It is also worth noting that Equifax reported modest second-quarter results in July. While the bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the top line came in line with the same. Nonetheless, the company's revenues increased on a year-over-year basis aided by strong growth across most of its business segments. The company also provided a modest third-quarter and fiscal 2014 guidance.Management's efforts such as strategic initiatives for product innovation, expansion of data assets through acquisitions and continuous share gains in North America were the encouraging points in the quarter.Given the company's strong correlation to consumer and financial markets as well as its U.S. and European exposure, we expect a gradual improvement in results.

Solid performances across all the segments helped it to outperform the Zacks Consensus Estimate and grow earnings year over year as well.The company's inorganic growth looks impressive with continued strategic acquisitions over the past couple of years. In its consistent efforts to acquire a leading position in the digital agency market, Alliance Data has taken over firms like Advecor, HMI, merged these with Epsilon- provider of integrated direct marketing solutions, combining database marketing technology and analytics with a wide array of direct marketing services.

Its cash position improved about 135% in a span of three years. Cash from operations in the first six months of 2014 also witnessed a 10.7% year-over-year increase.

This year-over-year revenue growth was primarily on account of strong performance from the International Solutions segment.We believe that Fidelity's commanding position in the financial services market, increasing international exposure, recurring revenue model, diversified product portfolio, cost synergies from acquisitions and a loyal customer base are major positives.Moreover, the company continues to win contracts from banks and other financial institutions worldwide, which will further drive its market share. Additionally, we believe that increasing Europay, Mastercard and Visa (EMV) adoption in the United States will drive Fidelity's top line in 2014. In this regard, partnerships with Visa (  ) and Mastercard (  ) are major tailwinds.However, increasing consolidation within the banking sector, challenging environment for the Payments Solutions business and uncertain regulatory environment are the major headwinds.

Western Union has picked up Mi Pueblo since it is the fastest growing independent supermarket in Northern California. Moreover, through this tie up, Western Union can avail of Mi Pueblo's already present wide range of immigrant clients who are Hispanics, Filipinos, Chinese and Indians regularly using money transfer services to send funds back home.On the other hand, Mi Pubelo, which boasts superior customer service, will also be able to add another business to its already wide product and service portfolio for clients.Western Union's services such as Money Transfer, money order and bill payment options will be available across Mi Pueblo's Bay Area, Monterey Peninsula and Central Valley locations with immediate effect.With an industry-leading network, Western Union has over 500,000 agent locations and 100,000 ATMs that offer its money transfer services.

Fidelity expects to complete the transaction in the fourth quarter of 2014. The acquisition will be neutral to adjusted earnings for fiscal 2014.Clear2Pay is a global provider of payment technologies and services. The company has a strong clientele in Western Europe, Asia-Pacific and the Americas. The Clear2Pay acquisition will expand Fidelity's payments portfolio, thereby driving banking customer base over the long run.Per research conducted by CEB TowerGroup, the global payments market is forecasted to grow to an estimated $1.6 trillion as revenues by 2020. This involves tremendous growth in payment volumes and types. However, payment infrastructure remains largely inflexible and incompatible to handle this huge surge in volumes.As the banking and financial services industry becomes more customer-oriented, Clear2 Pay's technology will help in acquiring, processing and clearing payments in a streamlined and secured way. Clear2Pay's technology fast processes huge volumes at a much lower cost compared with legacy payment systems, which will ultimately expand profitability.Acquisitions have been the key growth catalyst for Fidelity for some time. Over the last four years (2010-2013), it has acquired seven companies for $484.0 million. The acquisitions of Capco, Metavante, mFoundry and Reliance Financial has significantly expanded Fidelity's product portfolio.We believe that the company will continue pursuing small acquisitions that strategically fit its overall business mix and are easy to integrate. Moreover, Fidelity's commanding position in the financial services market, increasing international exposure and recurring revenue model are the positives.Moreover, the company continues to win contracts from banks and other financial institutions worldwide, which will further drive its market share. Additionally, we believe that increasing Europay, MasterCard and Visa (EMV) adoption in the United States will drive Fidelity's top line in 2014. In this regard, partnerships with Visa (  ) and MasterCard (  ) are the major tailwinds.However, increasing consolidation within the banking sector, challenging environment for the Payments Solutions business and uncertain regulatory environment are the major headwinds. Also, intense competition from the likes of Fiserv (  ) is a concernCurrently, Fidelity has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Earnings per share (excluding merger and integration costs, severance costs, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, tax impact of adjustments and gains related to the StoneRiver transaction) increased 7.6% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues (excluding output solutions postage reimbursements and Open Solutions' deferred revenue adjustment) increased 3.2% year over year to $1.18 billion. Revenues, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24 billion. Internal revenue growth was 3% in the quarter.This year-over-year increase was on account of robust growth registered by Fiserv's recurring revenue businesses such as card services and bill payments along with good performance from output solutions.Source-wise, Product revenues increased 10.4% year over year to $202.0 million. Processing and services revenues increased 3.5% year over year to $1.05 billion.Segment wise, Payments and Industry Products revenue increased 5.2% from the year-ago quarter to $591.0 million. Financial Institution Services revenue, on the other hand, increased 1% on a year-over-year basis to $596.0 million in the reported quarter.Fiserv signed 72 new clients, which took the total number of clients for Mobiliti solution up to 1,900 at the end of the first quarter. Client demand for Popmoney solution continues to remain strong as Fiserv signed 75 new institutions in the quarter. During the quarter, Fiserv signed 88 electronic bill payment clients and 26 debit processing clients.Fiserv continues to proceed rapidly with the Open Solutions integration. Open Solutions' primary product DNA has gained significant momentum as Fiserv won six new contracts in the reported quarter. Since the completion of the acquisition in Jan 2013, Fiserv has won 44 new contracts on the DNA platform.During the quarter, the company launched Agiliti, a cloud-based retail bank technology solution. This solution, in turn, will enable new users as well as existing institutions to keep their technology costs to a minimum; rapidly bring products to market and enhance their digital experience, thereby providing better services to their respective customers. Agiliti is scheduled to go live in mid-2015.Total expenses (cost of processing & services, cost of products and selling, general and administrative expense) as a percentage of revenues decreased 70 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 80.4%.Operating margin (excluding mergers, severance costs and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets) expanded 20 bps on a year-over-year basis to 30.6% in the quarter. The growth was primarily due to favorable revenue mix, scale leverage, higher operational effectiveness savings (including synergies from the Open Solutions acquisition) and higher termination fees.Net income was $205.0 million or 81 cents per share versus $202.0 million or 75 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.As of Jun 30, 2014, Fiserv had cash and cash equivalents of $329.0 million, up from $307.0 million at the end of the previous quarter. Long-term debt was $4.56 billion compared with $3.85 billion in the previous quarter. Fiserv repurchased 3.0 million shares for $168.0 million in the second quarter.For fiscal 2014, adjusted revenues are expected to increase in the range of 4% to 5%. Adjusted internal revenues are expected to increase in the range of 4% to 4.5%.Earnings per share are likely to be in the range of $3.31 to $3.37, representing yearly growth of 11% to 13%. The mid-point of this guidance range is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.35. The company expects adjusted operating margin to expand at least 50 bps for full year 2014.Management expects the adjusted effective tax rate for the second half of the year to be higher than the first half. Moreover, the full year tax rate, excluding the tax impact from StoneRiver capital transactions, is expected to be under 35%.Fiserv has expanded its foothold in the financial and payment solutions business supported by its broad customer base and various contract wins from the likes of U.S. Bank, TD bank and Bank of Ozarks.The recent contracts with four of the leading credit unions in the world including Abri, MIDFLORIDA, Southeast Federal Credit union and Wauna are also a major positive.The company's recent partnership with Visa (  ) will allow Fiserv to offer debit EMV solutions for the Accel debit network. We believe that EMV-based card solutions have significant growth opportunities in the U.S. and this partnership will boost Fiserv's EMV offering, going forward.Fiserv's diversified product portfolio and continued technology upgrades are expected to boost its top-line growth. Higher synergies (both top-line and cost) from the Open Solutions acquisition and continuous contract wins by the DNA platform are expected to drive growth over the next couple of years.The company continues to add clients for its bill payment, mobility and Popmoney solutions. Higher recurring revenues, operational efficiencies and strong internal growth are expected to result in solid earnings and free cash flow growth.However, the back-end loaded guidance is expected to remain a concern in 2014. We also believe intensifying competition from the likes of Global Payments (  ) and MasterCard Inc.

The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by strong performance from the International Solutions segment.International Solutions revenues grew 14.2% year over year (12% organic growth) to $346.8 million, driven by growth across all regions.Revenues from Financial Solutions increased 7.2% year over year to $629 million (6% organic growth), driven by strong growth in consulting, professional and digital delivery solutions.Payment Solutions revenues remained almost flat on a year-over-year basis to $623.6 million, driven by growth in network solutions, bill payment services, image and output solutions, offset by lower termination fees.Gross margin contracted 100 basis points (bps) to 35% due to unfavorable business mix.Selling, general & administrative expense (SG&A), as a percentage of revenues, decreased 20 bps from the year-ago quarter.Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin declined 60 bps on a year-over-year basis to 29.2% in the quarter.

As of Jun 30, 2014, cash and cash equivalents were $793.7 million compared with $737.7 million in the previous quarter.

The company expects 2014 earnings in the range of $3.05 to $3.16, an increase of 8% to 12% over 2013. This is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.59.EBITDA is projected to grow in the 4.5% to 6.5% range for the full year. Free cash flow is expected to approximate adjusted net earnings for the year.We believe that Fidelity's commanding position in the financial services market, increasing international exposure, recurring revenue model, diversified product portfolio, cost synergies from acquisitions and a loyal customer base are significant positives.Moreover, strong demand for its solutions is expected to boost top-line growth in the near term. The company continues to win contracts from banks and financial institutions internationally, which will further drive its market share.Fidelity's licensing agreement with Visa (  ) and MasterCard (  ) to offer EMV enabled debit cards to its NYCE partners is a key growth catalyst.

Today we look at two noteworthy recent insider buys.At American Eagle Outfitters (  ), a filing with the SEC revealed that on Monday, Exec Chairman & Interim CEO Jay L. Schottenstein purchased 148,942 shares of AEO, at a cost of $14.13 each, for a total investment of $2.11M. So far Schottenstein is in the green, up about 5.0% on their buy based on today's trading high of $14.84. American Eagle Outfitters is trading up about 4.2% on the day Tuesday. Before this latest buy, Schottenstein made one other purchase in the past year, buying $6.42M shares for a cost of $12.84 a piece.And on Friday, Chief Operating Officer Mark A. Ernst purchased $655,000 worth of Fiserv (  ), purchasing 10,000 shares at a cost of $65.50 a piece. This buy marks the first one filed by Ernst in the past year. Fiserv is trading up about 0.1% on the day Tuesday. Bargain hunters have the opportunity to snag FISV at a price even lower than Ernst did, with shares trading as low as $64.87 at last check today -- that's 1.0% below Ernst's purchase price.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n Jul 7, 2014, we issued an updated research report on  (  ).Equifax is a leading information services provider to consumers and businesses. The company's offerings are of great importance to its customers as they use the credit information and related analytical services and data to process applications for new credit cards, automobile loans, home and equity loans and other consumer loans. This helps customers understand, manage and protect their clients' information and take better-informed financial decisions. We believe that a solid product portfolio and a clear understanding of the sector will keep Equifax ahead of its peers.Equifax also serves a wide range of industries, such as financial, mortgage, consumer, commercial, telecommunications, retail, human resources and automotive. This diversified client base is extremely beneficial as weakness in any sector can be balanced with strength in the others.Additionally, the company has made strategic acquisitions to supplement its core business. During 2013, Equifax acquired several small companies in addition to TrustedID, a direct-to-consumer identity protection business. Moreover, in Jan 2014, Equifax acquired TDX Group, a U.K.-based debt-management firm, for $327.0 million. We believe that the acquisition will enable Equifax to provide a broad insight into consumer performance, financial status, capabilities of customers and market opportunities. Moreover, it will further solidify Equifax's presence in the U.K., which in turn will boost its revenues.Apart from acquisitions, Equifax has remained enthusiastic about forming joint ventures that could expand its business internationally. Joint ventures keep operating costs down and need no integration time while diversifying the revenue source. To tap the immense growth opportunity in the Brazilian credit data market, Equifax merged credit reporting operations of its Brazilian subsidiary with Boa Vista Servicos S.A., the second-largest consumer credit bureau in Brazil. We believe that the company's investments in the joint ventures will yield desired results and help it to register solid growth over the long term.However, Equifax has a highly leveraged balance sheet. The company had a net debt position of $1.53 billion at the end of first-quarter 2014 (ended Mar 31, 2014), which increased from $1.21 billion at the end of 2013. Thus, the company is in constant need of generating adequate operating cash flows to service its debt.Going forward, competition from  (  ),  (  ), Moody's Corp. and uncertainty in the mortgage sector are the headwinds.Currently, Equifax has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the technology sector is  (  ), which has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

The company's diversified and restructured portfolio, strong network alliances, strategic acquisitions and technical competence augur long-term growth.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock delivered positive earnings surprises in 2 all the last 4 quarters. Moreover, the company's first-quarter 2014 earnings topped the year-ago quarter figure by about 3%, though it missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by about 5%.Nevertheless, the ongoing market recovery is reinstating the confidence of consumers, which in turn is leading to an improvement in client activity. This is reflected in strong double-digit growth within accounts on file in the past several quarters. Growth of new clients and retention of the existing ones, across sectors, are reaping positive results for the company.Moreover, Total System's strategy of diversifying through significant acquisitions have been commendable. While NetSpend has enabled entry into the prepaid card market, the previous acquisitions of FNMS, TermNet and Vanguard Payment Systems have bolstered the company's merchant acquiring portfolio. The acquisitions of ProPay and a 75% stake in CPay are further brightening Total System's growth prospects within the small, medium and micro-merchants' market.Overall, total acquisitions contributed 2.9% to top-line growth in 2011, 1.8% in 2012 and a significant 16.7% in 2013. Management expects further strengthening of the financials in 2014 and beyond, perking up growth as well. Improved cash flows also indicate timely reduction of debt, paving the way for higher shareholder return.Even amid efforts to consolidate its business and enhance operating leverage, Total System's margins are likely to be impacted by increased price competition (particularly within the merchant acquiring segment), regulatory challenges, exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange volatility and a tepid earnings guidance in the near future.Overall, a balanced risk-reward propositionin the near term has led to estimates hitting a plateau for 2014 and 2015. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2014 and 2015 remained intact at $1.74 and $2.02 per share, respectively, in the last 30 days. On a year-over-year basis, earnings are expected to increase 8.8% in 2014 and 15.6% in 2015.Other stocks that look promising in the financial sector include  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).

The company generated near about $15.0 million in revenues in 2013. The acquisition is expected to have a minimal impact on Moody's earnings in the second, third as well as the fourth quarters of 2014 and full-year 2015. However, the deal is expected to be accretive to EPS in 2016.WebEquity's leadership in software-as-a-service offering for community banks combined with Moody's international reach and expertise will help the latter to expand globally and enhance its risk management portfolio for banks, insurance companies and corporations.Acquisitions have given Moody's increased scale and cross-selling opportunities across products and vertical markets. Since 2000, Moody's has acquired a number of companies including KMV (2002), Economy.com (2005), Wall Street Analytics (2006), Fermat International (2008), CSI (2010), Copal Partners (2011), Barrie & Hibbert (2011) and Amba Investment Services (2013).We believe that the company will continue to pursue acquisitions, which is a good strategic fit. This will also diversify its revenue base over the long term.On the flip side, increased focus on acquisitions could negatively impact its balance sheet in the form of a high level of goodwill and intangible assets, which totaled $886.8 million, or 20.2% of its total assets at the end of 2013. Furthermore, acquisitions add to integration risks, which may dilute earnings.Moody's faces stiff competition in most of the markets in which it operates.

The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by strong performance from the International Solutions segment.International Solutions revenues jumped 7.8% year over year (13.0% organic growth) to $314.4 million, driven by growth across all regions.Revenues from Financial Solutions increased 2.0% year over year to $586.8 million (2.0% organic growth), driven by strong growth in consulting revenues and digital delivery solutions.Payment Solutions revenues increased 2.7% on a year-over-year basis to $628.5 million, driven by growth in image and output solutions and card solutions.Gross margin contracted 100 basis points (bps) to 34.9% due to unfavorable business mix.Selling, general & administrative expense (SG&A) as a percentage of revenues decreased 100 bps from the year-ago quarter.Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin was almost flat on a year-over-year basis to 31.8% in the quarter. Segment-wise, International Solutions EBITDA margin decreased 150 bps, Payment Solutions contracted 10 bps and Financial Solutions fell 90 bps on a year-over-year basis.Operating margin remained almost flat on a year-over-year basis to 22.7%. Higher margin financial solutions operating margin declined 80 bps. Payment and International Solutions operating margins contracted 150 bps and 130 bps, respectively.Net income improved to $197.4 million compared with $182.3 million due to lower interest expense.

However, this is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.35.EBITDA is projected to grow at the 4.5% to 6.5% range for the full year. Free cash flow is expected to approximate adjusted net earnings for the year.We believe that Fidelity's commanding position in the financial services market, increasing international exposure, recurring revenue model, diversified product portfolio, cost synergies from acquisitions and a loyal customer base are significant positives.Moreover, strong demand for its solutions is expected to boost top-line growth in the near term. The company continues to win contracts from banks and financial institutions internationally, which will further drive its market share.Additionally, the company's recent partnership with  to fight cybercrime is a significant positive, as it will expand its presence in the fast growing cyber security market.Fidelity's licensing agreement with  to offer EMV enabled debit cards to its NYCE Payments Network partners is also a key growth catalyst.

Excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements, consolidated operating revenues increased 5.0% year over year to $509.6 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $492.0 million.Financial Services operating revenues (excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements) increased 6.8% year over year to $254.6 million, primarily driven by revenue growth at ALPS and DST BlueDoor Solutions. Moreover, revenues from ALPS and DST BlueDoor Solutions were positively aided by new client conversions and better customer relationships. Notably, revenues from DST Brokerage Solutions also increased attributable to growth from existing clients.Healthcare Services operating revenues grew 13.3% year over year to $92.9 million. The improvement was mainly due to higher pharmacy claims and increase in Medicare and Medicaid members, expansion of existing clients and new pharmacy discount card services.Customer Communications (previously Output Solutions) operating revenues declined a modest 1.5% year over year to $158.3 million. Contribution from North America remained weak due to client loss.Apart from this, Investments and Other Segment operating revenues decreased 2.6% year over year to $3.8 million.Cost and expenses were up 4.5% from the year-ago quarter to $576.1 million, primarily due to increased investments for new business expansion.

Moreover, the quarter's results increased on a year-over-year basis. Higher number of client additions, better customer relationships and growth at ALPS and DST Brokerage Solutions drove revenues.Segment performances were also modest with synergies from acquired units. Higher conversions into DST's sub-accounting platform were encouraging but growth in registered accounts continued to lag.However, we are still of the opinion that DST Systems' business volume and massive scale of operation in Financial Services will attract new customers. Moreover, we expect steady contributions from the recent acquisitions to support revenue growth. Continued share buybacks and dividend payments are the other encouraging factorsOn the other hand, decreasing organic revenue growth, tough competition from International Business Machines Corporation (  ) and Fiserv Inc. (  ), and a high debt burden remain concerns.Currently, DST Systems carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(Symbol: FISV) has taken over the #289 spot from Range Resources Corp (Symbol: RRC), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true \"apples-to-apples\" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Fiserv, Inc. (Symbol: FISV), the market cap is now $14.52 billion, versus Range Resources Corp (Symbol: RRC) at $14.46 billion.Below is a chart of Fiserv, Inc. versus Range Resources Corp plotting their respective size rank within the S&P 500 over time (FISV plotted in blue; RRC plotted in green):    Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of FISV vs. RRC:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and \"tosses out\" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller \"up-and-comers\" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at  find value to putting together these rankings daily.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, FISV and RRC collectively make up 1.02% of the Vanguard Mid-Cap ETF (  ) which is higher by about 1.1% on the day Wednesday.At the closing bell, FISV is up about 0.5%, while RRC is down about 0.4% on the day Wednesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n Apr 9, 2014, Zacks  upgraded  (  ) to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

However, competition from  (  ),  (  ) and Moody's Corp. is a concern.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Equifax is likely to beat earnings this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 to surpass earnings estimates. However, that is not the case here due to the following factors: The expected surprise prediction for Equifax is 0.00% since both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 91 cents per share. Equifax's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here is another company, which you may want to consider as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: (  ), with Earnings ESP of +20.00% and a Zacks Rank #2.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) reported fourth-quarter 2013 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of 91 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings were up 19.7% from the year-ago quarter.Equifax reported revenues of $578.5 million from continuing operations which increased 8% year over year but lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $581 million. Revenues on adjusted basis (excluding the impact of the collection of certain reserved billion for 2012) came in at $571.3, up 7% year over year. The year-over-year revenue increase resulted from revenue growth in most of its business segments.Segment-wise, total U.S. Consumer Information Solutions (USCIS) adjusted revenues (excluding the impact of the collection of certain reserved billion for 2012) increased 12% on a year-over-year basis to $248.3 million. Among sub-segments, strong growth was recorded in the Consumer Financial Marketing Services segment (up 20%) and Online Consumer Information Solutions (up 12%), which more than offset the 1.0% revenue decline in the Mortgage Solutions Services.International revenues (including Europe, Canada and Latin America) grew 6% year over year to $131.5 million, primarily due to 15% growth in the Europe segment, followed by 5.0% growth in the Latin America segment which more than offset the 5% decline in revenues from Canada Consumer segment.Revenues from the Workforce Solutions segment flat on a year-over-year basis at $112.2 million, primarily due to a 7% decline in revenues from Verification Services which offset a 12% increase in revenues from Employer Services.North American Personal Solutions contributed $52.5 million to revenues, reflecting a 9% year-over-year improvement. North American Commercial Solutions generated $26.8 million of revenues, down 3% from the year-ago quarter.Adjusted operating margin (excluding collection of certain reserved billings and a resource realignment charge in 2013, and transaction-related expenses associated with the CSC Credit Services acquisition and the pension settlement in 2012) was 27.3% compared to 25.5% reported in the year-ago quarter. Margin performance was better in the Workforce Solutions segment and North America Personal Solutions which more than offset the margin contractions in USCIS, International and North America Commercial Solutions.Net income from continuing operations came in at $113.3 million or 91 cents per share compared to $92.6 million or 76 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.Equifax exited the quarter with $235.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $131.9 million in the previous quarter. Total long-term debt (including current portion) stood at $1.44 billion. Management increased its dividend payment from 22 cents to 25 cents to be paid on Mar 14, 2014.Considering the recent domestic and international business activities, current foreign exchange rates and the expected slowdown in mortgage activities in the first half of 2014 management expects fiscal 2014 revenues in the range of $2.425 to $2.475 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.46 billion. The company expects its fiscal 2014 earnings per share to range between $3.75 and $3.89. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $3.89.The company also provided revenue and earnings forecast for the first quarter of 2014. Revenues are expected to range between $575 million and $588 million, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $595 million. Earnings are forecasted between 84 cents and 88 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 88 cents.Equifax reported mixed fourth-quarter results. While Equifax's bottom line matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate, its top line fell short of the same. Nonetheless, the company's revenues increased on a year-over-year basis aided by strong growth across most its business segments.Management's efforts such as strategic initiatives for product innovation, expansion of data assets through acquisitions and continuous share gains in North America were encouraging.Given the company's strong correlation to consumer and financial markets as well as its U.S. and European exposure, we see a gradual improvement in results. Moreover, improving mortgage environment could be a positive for the stock. However, stiff competition from  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and uncertainty in the mortgage sector are concerns.Currently, Equifax has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" reported fourth-quarter earnings of 79 cents per share, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents.

Processing and services revenues increased 10.5% year over year to $1.04 billion.Payments and Industry Products revenues (all internal) increased 6.2% from the year-ago quarter to $596.0 million.

Client demand for Popmoney solution continues to remain strong as Fiserv signed 98 new institutions in the quarter. During the quarter, Fiserv signed 96 electronic bill payment clients and 44 debit processing clients.Fiserv continues to proceed rapidly with Open Solutions integration (acquired Jan 14, 2013).

Internal revenues increased 2.0% from the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year growth was primarily due to robust revenue contribution from the Open Solutions acquisition.Total expenses (cost of processing & services, cost of products and selling, general and administrative expense) as a percentage of revenues increased 150 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 81.5%.Operating margin (excluding mergers, severance costs and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets) contracted 30 bps on a year-over-year basis to 30.5% in the quarter.Financial Institution Services operating margin increased 200 bps from the year-ago quarter. Scale efficiencies and operational effectiveness savings, including synergies from the Open Solutions acquisitions, primarily led to this adjusted operating margin growth.Payments and Industry Products operating margin declined 50 bps from the year-ago quarter to 30.9%. The year-over-year decline was due to the unfavorable product mix, lower license revenues and higher variable compensation.The Corporate and Other segment witnessed an operating loss of $30.0 million, which deteriorated from the $18.0 million loss incurred in the year-ago quarter.Fiserv exceeded its operational effectiveness goal of $60.0 million, which includes the Open Solutions cost synergy target, by 35% in 2013. The company achieved $81.0 million of savings. Exiting the third year of this 5-year program, the company has generated $188.0 million of annual savings, which is approximately 50% more than the scheduled target.As of Dec 31, 2013, Fiserv had cash and cash equivalents of $400.0 million, up from $321.0 million at the end of the previous quarter. Long-term debt was $3.76 billion compared with $3.93 billion in the previous quarter.

Adjusted internal revenues are expected to increase in the range of 4.0% to 4.5%Earnings per share are likely to be in the range of $3.28 to $3.37, representing yearly growth of 10.0% to 13.0%. However, the mid-point of this guidance range is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.35.The company expects to post stronger results in the second half of 2014, primarily due to mix of sales and timing of client implementations.Fiserv forecasts free cash flow per share to be up at least 10% to more than $3.65 per share. The company expects operating margin to expand at least 50 bps for the full year. For 2014, Fiserv's operational effectiveness goal remains at $60.0 million.Fiserv has expanded its foothold in the financial and payment solutions business supported by its broad customer base and various contract wins from the likes of  , TD bank and American Electric Power and Humana.Fiserv's diversified product portfolio and continued technology upgrades are expected to boost its top-line growth. Higher synergies (both top-line and cost) from the Open Solutions acquisition and continuous contract wins by the DNA platform are expected to drive growth over the next couple of years.The company continues to add clients for its bill payment, mobility and Popmoney solutions. Higher recurring revenues, operational efficiencies and strong internal growth are expected to result in solid earnings and free cash flow growth.However, the back-end loaded guidance is expected to remain a concern in 2014.

The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by strong performances by the Financial Solutions and International Solutions segments.Revenues from Financial Solutions increased 4.3% year over year to $603.5 million (4.0% organic growth), driven by strong growth in consulting revenues and digital delivery solutions.International Solutions revenues jumped 11.3% year over year (13.0% organic growth) to $357.1 million. The strong growth was driven by double-digit growth in Latin America and continued growth in Europe and Asia.Payment Solutions revenues increased 2.8% on a year-over-year basis to $618.3 million.

However, this is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.35.We believe Fidelity's commanding position in the financial services market, increasing international exposure, recurring revenue model, diversified product portfolio, cost synergies from acquisitions and a loyal customer base will drive growth over the long term.Moreover, strong demand for its solutions such as Cardless Cash Access solution and Active Analytics suite is expected to boost top-line growth in the near term. The company continues to win contracts from banks and financial institutions in the overseas market, which will further drive its market share, going forward.However, increasing consolidation in the banking sector, challenging environment for the Payments Solutions business and uncertain regulatory environment are the primary headwinds, in our view.

Reported revenues were below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $128.9 million. The decrease was due to weakness in the Carrier and Mobile market segments, partially offset by strength in the Storage segment.The  generated 71.0% of fourth-quarter revenues, up from 66.0% in the third quarter. Its products include controllers based on Fiber Channel, Serial Attached SCSI and Serial ATA that enable the development of external and server-attached storage systems.The segment increased 6.5% sequentially due to new customer ramp ups and strength in SAS and Flash product lines. The company expects the Flash controllers, Adaptec 12-gig SAS/RAID adapters to see strong interest from large data center customers. Management stated that the majority of these 12-gigdesign wins will start to ramp up with Intel's Brantley launch in the second half of 2014, helping the company to continue its market share dominance.The  generated 16.0% of sales, down from 20.0% in the prior quarter. Segment revenues were down $8 million sequentially due to weakness in the Sonet product line and weak PON OLT shipments. However, Optical Transport Network (OTN) continued to witness strength in the last quarter due to LTE build outs in China.The  accounted for 13.0% of sales, down from 14.0% in the prior quarter. Segment revenues were down $2.7 million sequentially due to lower-than-expected demand for 3G base station.Reported gross margin for the quarter was 70.5%, down 60 basis points (bps) sequentially and 120 bps from the year-ago quarter, driven by lower revenues and an unfavorable product mix.PMC-Sierra reported GAAP operating expenses of $95.3 million, up 9.6% from $87.0 million incurred in the year-ago quarter. As a percentage of sales, both research & development expenses and selling, general & administrative costs increased from the year-ago quarter. The net result was a GAAP operating loss of $6.4 million which compared unfavorably with an operating profit of $6.0 million in the year-ago quarter.On a GAAP basis, PMC-Sierra recorded a net loss of $17.0 million or a loss of 8 cents per share compared with a profit of $14.1 million or 7 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.On a non-GAAP basis, PMC-Sierra generated adjusted net profit of $8.14 million compared with $12.8 million in the last quarter. Pro-forma earnings per share came in at 4 cents compared with 6 cents in the last quarter.PMC-Sierra exited the fourth quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of approximately $110.9 million versus $100.7 million in the prior quarter.

Both the top- and bottom-line results missed our expectations.Though the carrier and mobile segments performed poorly in the quarter, we are encouraged by the improvement in the storage segment, introduction of several major products and new design wins.However, the company provided weak first-quarter guidance, indicating a challenging macro environment. Therefore, lack of visibility and macro uncertainty may keep the share price range bound in the near term.Over the long term, PMC-Sierra is well positioned for growth and market share gains in server/storage, wireless infrastructure and optical communications. We expect LTE build out in China, cloud and data center build outs, and storage demand to increase substantially, each of which will act as a solid catalyst for the company through 2014.Currently, PMC-Sierra has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

It is time to promote positive news about the financial transactions services industry. Forthcoming earnings reports, or at least better revenue guidance about a faster transaction flow across summer and fall, could inspire quite a few well-deserved nods of accomplishment.The Financial Transactions Services sector in the Zacks Industry Rank list gained 109 positions last week. This large category of 18 companies now holds a rank of #38 out of 265 industries. Positive earnings revisions outpaced negative revisions by 11 to 6. Financial Transaction Services quarterly reports as an industry group also averaged positive Earnings per Share (EPS) surprises of +16%.There are a number of broad factors affecting this turnaround: the end of a bad winter, more job security, increased consumer spending online, fewer defaults, increased scope and ability in service lines -- and the simple fact people are just buying more this year compared to last. Combined, this means good news for an industry which can leverage a direct link to topline growth in the U.S. and global economy.Pay attention to overall sector performance. Any swift industry current affects not only individual businesses but the industry as a whole. The wider and faster goes the transactions river, the more beneficial it is to any successful investment strategy. This industry seems to have the right discretionary consumer focus, a sweet spot inside any transactions-driven revenue stream.Rising flows of stock market-driven economic expansion in wealthy countries can give investors a first-class ferry ride to soaring profits. Just beware the logjams of a stock market correction, which might tamp down retail spending across the board and lead the card transactions river to find a lower level.Two companies stood out this week. They can swiftly turn card transactions trends to revenue. Upgrades to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, or to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, typically foreshadow a positive performance for the related stocks, as a response to even further positive earnings estimate revisions.GPN was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) last week from a #3 (Neutral). It reported earnings on April 3, 2014.Global Payments Inc. is a leading provider of electronic transaction processing services for consumers, merchants, Independent Sales Organizations, financial institutions, government agencies and multi-national corporations located throughout the U.S., Canada, Latin America and Europe.Global Payments offers a comprehensive line of processing solutions for credit and debit cards, business-to-business purchasing cards, gift cards, electronic check conversion and check guarantee, verification and recovery, as well as terminal management. The company also provides consumer money transfer services from the U.S. and Europe to destinations in Latin America, Morocco and the Philippines.FISV was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) last week from a #3 (Neutral). This company reports quarterly earnings on April 29, 2014.Fiserv's strong foothold in the financial and payment solutions business is supported by its broad customer base, a diversified product portfolio and continuous IT upgrades. After a dismal quarterly report in February, this trifecta can be expected to boost the company's coming guidance in April.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) posted fourth-quarter 2013 non-GAAP earnings of $1.34 per share beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.28. On a year-over-year basis, earnings per share improved 12.6%.Revenues in the fourth quarter were $667.3 million, up 2.7% from the year-ago quarter. Excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements, consolidated operating revenues increased 1.3% year over year to $500.1 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $496.0 million.Financial Services operating revenues (excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements) increased 2.8% year over year to $258.0 million, primarily driven by revenue growth at ALPS. Moreover, revenues from DST Brokerage Solutions and BlueDoor partially offset the lower revenues from license and professional service at DST Global Solutions.Healthcare Services operating revenues grew 15.1% year over year to $90.6 million. The improvement was mainly due to higher pharmacy claims and increase in Medicare and Medicaid members, network fees and new pharmacy discount card services.Customer Communications (previously Output Solutions) operating revenues declined a modest 2.6% year over year to $162.0 million. Contribution from North America and the U.K. remained weak due to client loss.Apart from this, Investments and Other Segment operating revenues decreased 2.8% year over year to $13.9 million due to lower rental income.Cost and expenses were up 0.4% from the year-ago quarter to $411.5 million. Moreover, as a percentage of revenues, costs and expenses were down 191 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis. This resulted in an expansion in operating margin of the same magnitude.DST reported net income (non-GAAP) of $57.0 million or $1.34 per share compared to $55.00 million or $1.19 per share reported in the year-ago quarter.DST Systems' balance sheet appears highly leveraged. The company exited the quarter with $62.5 million in cash and equivalents, down from $129.9 million reported in the previous quarter, and debt (including current portion) of $683 million, down from $833.4 billion reported in the previous quarter.During the fourth quarter, DST Systems repurchased shares worth $70.8 million and paid dividends of 30 cents per share. Management also authorized a $250 million share buyback plan.DST's fourth quarter was decent with both the top- and bottom lines increasing on a year-over-year basis. Segment performances were modest with synergies from acquired units. Higher conversions into DST's sub-accounting platform were encouraging but growth in registered accounts continued to lag.However, we are still of the opinion that DST Systems' business volume and massive scale of operation in Financial Services will attract new customers.

The acquisition of TDX Group will enable Equifax to provide the broadest possible insight into consumer performance, financial status, capabilities of customers and market opportunities. Moreover, it will further solidify Equifax' presence in the UK, which in turn will boost its revenues, going forward.Today customers look for solutions that streamline their collection capabilities. We believe the addition of TDX's services will help Equifax to provide better data, technology and advisory solutions and position it as a leader in important markets.Equifax had cash balance of $131.9 billion at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2013 compared with $104.9 billion in the previous quarter. The company generated $374.4 million cash from operating activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2013. Therefore, considering its cash balance Equifax will have no problem buying the company.Apart from this, Equifax has been entering into partnerships to expand its product portfolio, which will boost its market share.

However, growth was partially offset by 8.3% rise in core operating expenses, although operating income rose 5.5%. Consequently, operating cash flow surged about 230% over the prior-year period to $411.7 million.Overall, Global Payments is focusing on strengthening its roots globally through strategic alliances, technology upgrades and a dynamic business mix. Although high debt levels raise balance sheet risks, increased cash position and improving operating cash flow bode well for future business prospects of the company.The raised earnings outlook for fiscal 2014, which estimates 10-12% growth over fiscal 2013 along with consistent return of excess capital further boosts investors' confidence in the stock.Further, valuation looks reasonable for Global Payments.

Volumes were down 8.3% sequentially but grew 12.0% from the year-ago quarter. However, the blended average selling price (ASP) grew 2.6% sequentially and 8.2% year over year. The increase was driven by mix changes and amortization of previously deferred revenues.Garmin's Auto/Mobile, Outdoor, Aviation, Fitness and Marine segments generated 50%, 16%, 13%, 13% and 8% of its quarterly revenues, respectively.Seasonality typically makes for significant variations in quarterly revenues, with the most significant increase in the December quarter, followed by the most significant decline in the March quarter.The  segment was down 6.4% sequentially and 16.1% from the year-ago quarter. The personal navigation device (PND) market weakness continued in the last quarter. Garmin expects PND volumes to decline 20% globally in 2014.Garmin remains the number one supplier in the U.S. (with a market share of more than 70%) and one of the major suppliers in Europe (around 30% market share). The primary focus areas are currently automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) for in-dash applications and emerging markets.The  segment revenues were down 5.2% sequentially but up 14.6% year over year. The year-over-year increase was due to notable strength in the OEM segment. The aviation market recovery appears to be gathering momentum with three straight quarters of double-digit year-over-year growth.New products, opportunities in the retrofit segment, opportunities in the military and government markets, and share gains in the helicopter market remain positives for 2014.The  segment revenues were down 5.2 % sequentially and 4.0% year over year due to tough year-ago comparisons. Garmin expects to see success in this segment because of the many new products that are gradually expanding its markets and enabling it to enter new categories. During the quarter, management introduced VIRB and VIRB Elite products in the camera market and believes further expansion into new categories and new products will likely remain an important driver of segment growth.The  segment decreased 3.8% sequentially but increased 25.0% year over year.Management believes that the continued move toward higher-margin products, especially in the running category, will help segment margins in the near term. GPS-enabled running and cycling products are gaining worldwide popularity, which is good news for Garmin, the market leader. Management also has several new products in the pipeline that are expected to drive growth in the second half of the year.The  segment decreased 24.0% sequentially but grew 23.5% from the year-ago quarter to 8% of total revenue. The year-over-year growth was driven by new products, some pent-up demand and positive seasonality. Management expects new products to drive sales this year.Garmin is trying to build a solid product portfolio (including through acquisitions) and the strengthening of strategic relationships with marine OEMs.The gross margin for the quarter was 54.8%, down 30 basis points (bps) sequentially but up 140 bps year over year. Lower volumes led to the sequential decrease. The year-over-year increase was due to a favourable segment mix.

The operating margin shrank 80 bps sequentially and 20 bps year over year to 23.6% in the last quarter.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the year is $2.41, which is at the lower end of the historical range.Garmin's results indicate that the company is successfully diversifying its business away from the shrinking PND market. This has been possible because of focused research and development efforts that have resulted in a steady flow of innovative higher-margin products. The company is also increasingly collaborating with OEMs for product designing, which is leading to greater volume, predictability and more stable pricing.In the last quarter, the traditional PND business shrank to less than 50% of its total business, although Garmin remains the market leader in the category. On the other hand, Garmin is seeing good growth in its target markets, all of which carry higher margins.Though management expects the PND market to continue to impact top and bottom line results, the forward guidance provided was encouraging, indicating strong growth to continue in the upcoming quarter.Garmin shares carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Performance & security solutions revenues jumped 19.4% year over year, while Service & support systems achieved the strongest revenue growth in the quarter, up 41.3% year over year.We are positive on strong support from International and emerging markets. Moreover, strong demand for cloud infrastructure solutions, security, mobile products and online video will drive top-line growth going forward. However, the company's significant European exposure is a possible headwind going forward.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Akamai Technologies will beat earnings this quarter.

Alliance Data holds 37% stake in Companhia Brasileira De Servicos De Marketing (Dotz), the operator of Brazil's Dotz loyalty program.Prior to these launches, Dotz had 8.2 million customers enrolled under the program. We expect a substantial increase in enrollment to the Dotz program as it will now reach an additional population of 8 million in Santa Catarina and the city of Curitiba.In its second quarter , Alliance Data announced that it intends to enter four additional Brazilian markets in the second half of 2013. With the foray into these two markets, Dotz is perfectly on track to achieve its aim of exceeding $100 million in revenues in 2013, with 10 million collectors by the end of the year.Brazil, as the fifth-largest populated country with more than 190 million citizens, offers ample opportunities for Alliance Data to weave success out of a popular coalition loyalty program, and thus ramp up its Dotz program in the years to come.With respect to earnings performance, Alliance Data delivered positive surprise in three of last four quarters with an average beat of neatly 3%.

Shares of Xoom Corporation shored up 3.1% to $34.70 on Oct 15, 2013.The new text update service provides SMS text messages to the money recipients involved in a money transfer transaction, making money transfers more convenient and reliable. The texts would be sent stating whether the money is ready for pickup, delivery or even if it is on its way to their bank account. Thus the new feature allows recipients to track the money transfers from start to finish which in turn would help Xoom Corporation to retain customer confidence.In the course of money transfer transactions, customers at the receiving end are often anxious as to whether their money has been dispatched or whether it is available at that point of time. In this regard, if they were to get notified by the money transferring entity, it becomes convenient for the recipients to know when to pickup the money and decide their necessary actions accordingly. To cater to this need of the customers in the Philippines, Xoom Corporation has introduced the new text update service.Xoom Corporation consistently focuses on enhancing its customer service. Earlier in January this year, Xoom Corporation had launched a money transfer tracking center - StatusTrak. This tracking center was designed to help money senders to track their money transfers. Towards this, they were notified from time to time through emails and SMS text messages. Customers could also seek help through the 24x7 online and phone support. With the launch of the new text update service Xoom Corporation now intends to satisfy the money recipients through its convenient and enhanced services.According to business reports, Filipinos use SMS text messages extensively to communicate back home, generating the largest SMS text volume in the world (more than 10% of global SMS texts). Owing to this large scale use of SMS text messages, Xoom Corporation recognizes that introducing a text update service would be extremely beneficial to the people of Philippines. We believe with the increasing number of money transfer transactions in Philippines, this new customer service enhancement would not only help Xoom Corporation to retain existing customers but also to procure more clients thereby improving market share.Xoom Corporation currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

With furloughs of 350,000 federal workers, each week of the government shutdown is estimated to impair annualized economic growth of an already-volatile economy by 0.12 percentage points.Amid such precarious conditions, most companies in the Business Services industry would aim to reduce their spending, until at least a clear picture of the economy unfurls. The primary growth drivers in this highly fragmented industry involve a healthy economy with a decent job growth, higher disposable income and new business arrangements. An ideal mix of services, effective marketing strategies and ability to retain and attract new customers serve the perfect recipe for profitability for most of these companies.The current market conditions remain unfavorable for the industry as budgetary constraints curtail discretionary spending, reducing marketing expenses and deferring new business initiatives. Concurrently, most companies in the industry would prefer to hold their budgetary strings and wait until the storm is over.Given this scenario, it might be a good idea to zero-in on a handful Business Services stocks that are poised to beat earnings estimates this quarter. An earnings surprise should help these stocks outperform in the near term, and possibly outperform their peers.Amid a diverse range of companies in the Business Services arena, picking the right stock for your portfolio could appear to be a colossal task. An easy way to narrow down the list is to look at stocks that have a solid Zacks Rank and a favorable Zacks  .Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining which stocks have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement. The Earnings ESP shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Consensus.The combination of a positive to neutral Zacks Rank-- Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold)-- and a positive Earnings ESP, is usually a harbinger of earnings beat and serves a perfect success formula on a platter in this challenging macroeconomic environment. For investors seeking to benefit by applying this strategy to their portfolios, we have mentioned three Business Services stocks below which match these criteria, and thus may be the potential winners this earnings season: (  ): Headquartered in Milwaukee, Wis., ManpowerGroup provides workforce solutions and services through a network of approximately 3,500 offices in 80 countries across various industry sectors, and small and medium-sized enterprises. The company specializes in temporary and permanent recruitment, career management, outsourcing and HR consulting services.The company is anticipating strong quarterly earnings, which is expected to be up 36.87% year over year with Zacks Consensus Estimate being pegged at $1.08. Analysts have been moving their quarterly and full year estimates higher of late, further suggesting a solid earnings momentum in the imminent quarters.ManpowerGroup currently carries Zacks Rank #1 along with an Earnings ESP of +2.78%. The company is expected to report its third quarter 2013 results before the opening bell on Oct 21. (  ): N.Y.-based McGraw Hill offers credit ratings, benchmarks, and analytics to capital and commodity markets across the globe that empowers clients with essential intelligence to mitigate risk and identify opportunities to grow. The company houses some of the most iconic brands in finance and business that include Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, S&P Capital IQ, S&P Dow Jones Indices, Platts, J.D. Power, and McGraw Hill Construction.The company has a long-term earnings expectation of 17.2%. Analysts have been moving their full year estimates higher for the stock, further implying a healthy earnings momentum in the imminent quarters.McGraw Hill currently has Zacks Rank #2 along with an Earnings ESP +3.90%. The company is expected to report its third-quarter 2013 results before the market opens on Oct 22. (  ): Headquartered in Brookfield, Wis., Fiserv offers global technology services to the financial services industry. The company provides integrated technology and services for more than 16,000 clients worldwide, including banks, credit unions and thrifts, billers, mortgage lenders and leasing companies, brokerage and investment firms and other business clients.The company is anticipating strong third quarter earnings, which is expected to increase 19.2% year over year with Zacks Consensus Estimate being pegged at $1.51. Analysts have revised their quarterly and full year estimates upward, which further signify a solid earnings momentum for the company.Fiserv currently has Zacks Rank #1 along with an Earning ESP of +1.99%. The company is expected to report its third-quarter 2013 results after the closing bell on Oct 29.The ramifications of a potential crisis due to a debt-ceiling impasse may severely affect the economy unless a balanced fiscal policy is eked out. As the U.S. stocks look for a survival strategy, a sneak peek to the space for some possible outperformers backed by a solid Zacks Rank and a positive Zacks Earnings ESP could be a great idea for investors looking to profit this earnings season.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) is set to report third-quarter 2013 results on Oct 22. Last quarter, the company posted in-line earnings. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Altera delivered mixed second-quarter 2013 results with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missing the same. Overall, year-over-year performances were weak while sequential performances provided some hope. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to weakness in mainstream and matured products, almost all the end-markets (barring auto, industrial & military) and the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions.However, Altera provided encouraging guidance, citing some turnaround in the end markets. Moreover, the company's association with  (  ) is likely to be a competitive differentiator and boost its long-term growth fundamentals. Additionally, the company's solid book-to-bill ratio and backlog position are encouraging.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Altera will beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 34 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Altera's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: .

However, the terms and value of the deal have yet to be revealed.Based out of Istanbul, Turkey, Provus is a 12-year old company that offers issuer, merchant acquiring, prepaid and ATM payment processing solutions, to financial institutions, telecommunication service providers and retailers. Subject to regulatory approvals, the deal is expected to culminate by the end of 2013.Furthermore, the deal blends well with MasterCard's long-term strategy of building secular growth through innovative organic initiatives. Over the past couple of years, the company has been strengthening its foothold in the prepaid cards space and mobile commerce (m-commerce). These initiatives have been taken to adapt to the changing market dynamics and navigate through regulatory challenges faced within the credit and debit card businesses.These initiatives have also helped the company better penetrate into the global markets. Expansion in Turkey will now strengthen MasterCard's footprint within Europe as well. Hence, the acquisition of Provus appears to be a well-fit in the company's business basket.Moreover, MasterCard is armed with a strong operating cash flow of $1.61 billion at the end of Jun 2013, which surged about 51% from the year-ago period, along with a risk-free balance sheet, strong expense management and double-digit financial growth. We believe such strong fundamentals progressively support the company's capital deployment efforts.Additionally, MasterCard is consistently taking effective steps to penetrate into the emerging markets. Earlier this week, the company launched the first prepaid travel card in Myanmar, via its alliance with CB Bank in the country. MasterCard also tapped the Italian market by partnering with Eataly, thereby boosting cashless payments.Along with MasterCard, other strong peers such as  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n a bid to help financial institutions leverage real-time banking capabilities and reduce costs considerably,  (  ) recently rolled out a cloud-based real time service for mid-tier Central and Eastern European banks.Banking, as an industry, is evolving every day, consequently the demand for outsourcing some of the non-core services and adopting software as a service (SaaS) offerings is increasing everyday.Fidelity's latest offering is expected to make it easier for mid-tier banks to launch new and competitive products quickly and in a cost effective manner and enable them to serve customers better.FIS has made it clear that the company wants to focus on its core banking and financial institution business. FIS finalized a deal with  (  ) to sell its electronic benefits-transfer business, which is expected to fetch more than $200 million.Last year, the company sold its health-care benefit business to Lightyear Capital LLC for $335 million for the same reason. Therefore, we can expect innovative banking solutions, new products and more involvement from the company in this segment in the coming days.We believe that Fidelity's commanding position in the financial services market, increasing international exposure, recurring revenue model, diversified product portfolio, cost synergies from acquisitions and a loyal customer base will drive growth over the long term.On the other hand, increasing consolidation in the banking sector, a challenging environment for the Payments Solutions business and uncertain regulatory environment are the primary headwinds, in our view. Moreover, competition from  (  ) and  (  ) is a major concern in the near term.Currently, Fidelity has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) is set to report third-quarter 2013 results on Oct 21. Last quarter, the company posted in-line earnings. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Check Point delivered decent second-quarter results with the bottom line matching the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the top line surpassing the same. However, year-over-year comparisons were modest.The year-over-year revenue growth was aided by an increase in Software Updates, Maintenance and Services revenues, partially offset by weak Product and Licenses revenues. However, lower sales of high-end appliances impacted Product revenues.Geographical contributions were good and growing acceptance of Check Point's high-end products was encouraging. Despite expectations of an increase in sales volume during the second half, the company provided cautious third-quarter guidance, reflecting macro uncertainty in the European region and capped spending by customers.We are positive on strong support from the acceptance of data center appliances and believe that continuous enhancements in the data center product lines will adequately support revenue growth in the near term. However, an uncertain economic environment, competitive pressures, currency headwinds and Check Point's significant European exposure are the possible headwinds, going forward.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Check Point will beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 78 cents.

Moreover, as per American Banker, nine out of the top ten banks turn to Equifax for advanced fraud solutions while booking new accounts.Earlier, in order to further strengthen its position in the identity protection market, Equifax acquired TrustedID, to join Equifax's Personal Solutions group. TrustedID deals with identity protection solutions and protects privacy and reputation on social media services.Equifax reported revenues of $586.9 million, up 14.3% year over year in the second quarter of 2013. The upside is attributable to top-line growth across the board.Equifax's focus on product innovation, broadening data assets through acquisitions and continued share gains in North America are encouraging. We believe Equifax is well positioned to benefit from its leadership in important markets and strength in international markets.Given the company's strong correlation with the consumer and financial markets as well as its U.S. and European exposure, we see a gradual improvement in results.

The idea is to add value to the business by giving the customers access to convenient and secure money transfer options.By signing up for Xoom, the customers of Red Pocket Mobile will now be able to remit money across countries where Xoom has market penetration. These include significant markets of India, Latin America, the Philippines, Canada, Australia, South Africa and Europe.The alliance is also an attempt by Xoom to enter the rapidly growing space of money transfer through mobile devices. In this regard, the company had also launched the Xoom Money Transfer App in Spanish to tap the vast Latin American and other significant markets. This application is available in the latest Android and iOS mobile devices.Given the intense competition in the money transfer business, Xoom is focusing on innovative methods to make a mark in the digital payments' space. Moreover, the scope of growth also justifies the company's robust network accretion so far in 2013.We believe such alliances will not only boost Xoom's leading  position but will also accelerate its organic growth by boosting its money transfer business. Simultaneously, these efforts will also enhance demand for global remittances and boost the company's brand value.Along with Xoom, strong peers  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["eading consumer, commercial and workforce information solutions provider,  (  ) recently joined forces with iovation, a leading provider of device reputation, to develop a solution to protect against fraud.

The new solution will use the detection, workflow and reporting techniques to effectively meet compliance directives. By deploying the solution, financial institutions will be able to make a single investment to counter money laundering, fraud and global tax evasion issues.FATCA is basically aimed at finding tax evaders, especially the ones with offshore accounts and assets. Moreover foreign financial institutions can also keep a tab of financial accounts held by U.S. taxpayers or other foreign bodies, wherein U.S. taxpayers hold ownership interest. Any failure on part of the financial institutions to report violations of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) control guidelines may lead to heavy penalties. This is where FATCA can help companies.FATCA Manager automates the process of many U.S. indicia and entity classification checks, which in turn help in identifying exceptions and monitoring for changes. We believe this solution would be specifically helpful for different financial institutions and help them to comply with different rules and regulations of the tax authority and the IRS.Fiserv is coming out with effective tax and financial services solutions, which have been widely accepted. The company has in fact signed 98 new clients, which helped it to expand its total number of clients for the Mobility solution to 1,600 at the end of the second quarter.This apart, the company is also witnessing an increase in demand for the Popmoney solution, which continues to remain strong as Fiserv signed 64 new institutions in the quarter. During the quarter, Fiserv signed 71 electronic bill payment clients and 38 debit processing clients.We believe that various contract wins and accretive acquisitions will help Fiserv to fight stiff competition from  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) in the near term.On the other hand, deterioration in the global macroeconomic environment, reduction in spending by banking and financial service clients and consolidation in this space are working against the company.Currently, Fiserv has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" recently signed a contract with Texas-based Randolph-Brooks Federal Credit Union (RBFCU) to implement the DNA account processing system.

The solution won 5 new contracts in the second quarter, making it a total of 10 in the first half of 2013. The DNA banking platform was the primary reason behind Fiserv's acquisition of Open Solutions early this year.DNA was Open Solutions' flagship product and had more than 800 customers at the time of acquisition. The acquisition of the DNA platform is expected to expand Fiserv's customer base, going forward. Most of the DNA contracts are long term in nature, which is significant. These will be a recurring revenue source for Fiserv, going forward.Fiserv expects the synergies from the Open Solutions acquisition to exceed the original revenue and expense target of $75.0 million and $50.0 million, respectively. The acquisition is expected to be significantly accretive to earnings per share, going forward.Accretive acquisitions have been a key growth factor for Fiserv over the years. They have helped Fiserv expand its foothold in the financial and payment solutions business through its diversified product portfolio and continued technology upgrades. The company's advanced products are likely to further enhance its revenue streams.This is evident from the fact that the company signed 98 new clients, which helped it to expand its total number of clients for the Mobiliti solution to 1,600 at the end of the second quarter.Client demand for the Popmoney solution continues to remain strong as Fiserv signed 64 new institutions in the quarter.

Among sub-segments, strong growth was noticed in Mortgage Solutions Services (up 38.0%), followed by the Consumer Financial Marketing Services segment (up 17.0%) and Online Consumer Information Solutions (up 17.0%).International revenues (including Europe, Canada and Latin America) grew 9.0% year over year to $129.8 million, mostly due to 14.0% growth in the Europe segment, 7.0% in the Canada Consumer segment, followed by 5.0% growth in the Latin America segment.Revenues from the Workforce Solutions segment increased 12.0% year over year to $123.2 million. The upside resulted from a 21.0% year-over-year increase in Verification Services revenues, partially offset by flat Employer Services revenues.North American Personal Solutions contributed $51.5 million, reflecting 12.0% year-over-year improvement. North American Commercial Solutions generated $22.7 million, up 12.0% from the year-ago quarter.Gross margin in the second quarter was 66.2%, up 270 basis points from 63.5% reported in the year-ago quarter. Operating margin was 26.9% as against 25.1% a year ago. Margin performance was better in the Workforce solution, North America Personal Solution and North America Commercial Solution segment. This was somewhat offset by weak performances in USCIS and International.The company reported higher operating expenses with selling, general and administrative expenditure increasing 18.9% year over year.On a GAAP basis, net income from continuing operations was $90.5 million or 73 cents per share versus $74.1 million or 60 cents per share in the comparable quarter last year.

However, the results were partially offset by lower mutual fund shareowner processing revenues.During the quarter, total mutual fund shareowner accounts serviced increased 0.7% sequentially to 95.7 million. Registered accounts and sub-accounts serviced by the company during the quarter were 73.3 million and 22.4 million, respectively.Registered accounts dropped marginally while sub-accounts witnessed growth due to the migration of 0.4 million accounts from registered accounts to DST's sub-accounting platform and 0.1 million migration from non-DST platform.Healthcare Services (the new segment was formed by separating DST Healthcare unit from the Financial Services segment) operating revenues grew 8.2% year over year to $82.0 million. The improvement was mainly due to higher pharmacy claims and increase in Medicare and Medicaid members, network fees and new pharmacy discount card services.Customer Communications (previously Output Solutions) operating revenues increased 2.7% year over year. Contribution from North America was strong, which was offset by weak contribution from the U.K. Decreased contribution from U.K. was mainly due to lower images produced and foreign currency exchange rate movements.This apart, Investments and Other Segment operating revenues increased 8.3% year over year to $3.9 million.Total cost and expenses were $584.4 million, roughly flat with $581.9 million in the year ago period. Consolidated operating income was $72.7 million, up 42.8% year over year. Operating margin was 11.1%, up from 8.0% in the year-ago quarter.

Also, the company paid a quarterly dividend of 30 cents a share.DST's second quarter was decent with both the top and bottom lines beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Segment performances were modest with synergies from acquired units. Higher conversions into DST's subaccounting platform were encouraging but growth in registered accounts continued to lag.However, we are still of the opinion that, DST Systems' business volume and massive scale of operation in Financial Services will attract new customers. Moreover, we expect steady contributions from the recent acquisitions to support revenue growth.On the other hand, decreasing organic revenue growth, tough competition from  (  ),  (  ), and  (  ), and a high debt burden remain concerns.

However, it topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $714 million.The year-over-year drop was primarily due to a decline in clearing and transaction fees as a result of poor volumes in the energy and agriculture commodity products along with decreased average rate per contract. Even revenue from market data and information services witnessed deterioration. These were marginally offset by marginal improvement in average daily volumes.CME Group's average daily volume inched up 1% year over year to 12.5 million contracts in the reported quarter, rebounding since the third quarter of 2011. The improvement was driven by interest rate, foreign exchange and equity products. However, total average rate per contract dipped 3% from the year-ago quarter to 78.5 cents.

DNA was Open Solutions' flagship product and had more than 800 customers at the time of acquisition.The acquisition of the DNA platform is expected to expand Fiserv's customer base going forward. Most of the DNA contracts are long term in nature, which is significant. These will add a recurring revenue source to Fiserv's top line, going forward.Fiserv expects to earn revenue synergies of at least $75.0 million and cost synergies of $50.0 million over the next several years from the acquisition of Open Solutions. The acquisition is expected to be significantly accretive to earnings per share going forward.Accretive acquisitions have been a key growth factor for Fiserv over the years. In the first quarter of 2013, processing and services revenues increased 7.6% year over year to $966.0 million, of which $65.0 million was derived from acquisitions.Acquisitions have helped Fiserv expand its foothold in the financial and payment solutions business through its diversified product portfolio and continued technology upgrades. The company's advanced product ranges are likely to further enhance its revenue streams.This is evident from the fact that the company signed 90 new clients, which helped it to expand its total number of clients for the Mobiliti solution to 1,500 at the end of the first quarter.Client demand for the Popmoney solution continues to remain strong as Fiserv signed 89 new institutions in the quarter, bringing the total number of customers to 1,900. During the quarter, Fiserv signed 78 electronic bill payment clients and 36 debit processing clients.We believe that various contract wins and accretive acquisitions will help Fiserv to fight stiff competition from  ,  and  in the near term.However, a volatile macroeconomic environment, banking and financial service consolidation, poor cash flow, tough competition and increasing industry regulations are the primary near-term concerns.Currently, Fiserv has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" reported first quarter 2013 earnings of 62 cents per share, up 8.5% from the year-ago quarter and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.Revenues increased 4.6% year over year to $1.48 billion slightly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.47 billion.

Even the premium cards are under the purview of the scrutiny.Such higher interchange fee that has been varying from 0.2% to 1.6%, across 27 nations of the EU, has been hampering the shoppers' experience in the region. Further, the issue highlights the upswing in non-cash payments, raising anti-trust concerns over faulty business practices with regard to merchant-transactions, overall thwarting healthy eCommerce and cross-border operations.An adverse outcome of the enquiry held by EUC could impel MasterCard to shell out about $740 million or about 10% of its earnings in 2012 as penalty for the proved damages.Nonetheless, this is not the first time that MasterCard has been caught in the act by the European regulators. In 2007, the company was compelled to limit its debit and credit card fee to a maximum of 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively. In the same year, archrival  (  ) was completely barred from charging cross-border fees in Europe based on anti-trust issues.Additionally, Visa Europe is also facing a similar probe as MasterCard. Hence, MasterCard is not the first card giant to be found playing foul by the EUC.Meanwhile, both card companies are about to face problems in the US, as retail merchants turned down the proposed multi-state US merchant lawsuit settlement of $7.25 billion, entered in Jul 2012.The rejection comes at a time when the card companies are at the final leg of receiving approval for the federal court of Brooklyn.Faulty business principles of the card giants ultimately hit consumer purchasing powers, compromising whole market dynamics.

The latter had joined forces with DataCash in the past, which was acquired by MasterCard in Oct 2010. Further, MasterCard works closely with China UnionPay - the sole bank card transaction processing company in the region - as per a MoU signed in 2010.In September last year, MasterCard also introduced first dollar-denominated credit card in China in association with Citibank.

This will help LevelUp expand its mobile payment and loyalty platform, and thus increase its growth rate by acquiring more merchants.Additionally, the strategic association will also co-promote white-labeled apps for businesses with multiple locations. The white-label solutions of LevelUp helps businesses to provide a fully branded mobile payment and loyalty solution including all LevelUp features such as zero payment processing fees, world-class analytics, powerful campaigns and technical support.On the other hand the partnership will enhance Heartland's multi-site authorization and settlement network.

Currently, Heartland is capable of processing 3000 transactions per second.Heartland expects the liaison to facilitate merchants by enabling them to meet the payment demands of consumers thereby increasing their bottom lines. Consumers will also benefit from the deal, as it will provide them a cost effective and time saving payment option. They will be able to make payments at their favorite merchants by using their iPhone, Android or Windows phones.LevelUp has also integrated its technology into Heartland's E3 end-to-end encryption terminal/POS to protect payment data permanently. As a result, merchants can use E3 for secure mobile transactions. On the other hand consumers will likely benefit from this integration due to the confidentiality of their payment information. Heartland will also use its tokenization technology to replace card data with a token, which will replace information related to payments.Heartland and LevelUp will absorb 25% of the development cost of a white-labeled iPhone and Android app for merchants with 10 or more locations for whom the company will process payments.

Moreover, strong growth in U.S. instant ticket retail sales and U.S. lottery systems customer retail sales fully offset lackluster China instant ticket retail sales and instant ticket retail sales in Italy during the reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter projects earnings of 6 cents per share while that for fiscal 2012 stands at a loss of 36 cents per share. There have been no revisions in the fourth quarter and full year 2012 estimates over the last 60 days.The lack of downward movement in estimates signals that the fourth quarter might not be too different from the past quarters. This is also indicated by that fact that the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and #5 (Sell rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Our model states that a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP (Read:  ) and a Zacks Rank of #1, #2 or #3 to beat earnings estimates.

In the U.S. alone, 39% of consumers said they would pay more bills online in 2013, while 12% were willing to pay more bills by mobile phone.Western Union is intent to grow its mobile payment channel of business (SMS, and mobile web, as well as walk-in, phone and online payment services), since it foresees tremendous growth in this line of money transfer service.In case of an emergency payment, 14% of the consumers are eager to choose payment via mobile. Moreover, 25% express their intention to use less of the traditional mail service to pay bills.The bill payment landscape is witnessing sweeping changes regarding the pattern in which the consumers are willing to make payments.

Let's see how things are shaping up for the company in this quarter.Oracle reported better-than-expected second quarter 2013 results, backed by higher software revenues and cloud revenues. The company's bottom line also jumped on a year-over-year basis, aided by margin expansion.Oracle added a number of new customers in both customer relationship management (CRM) and human capital management (HCM) portfolios. However, the company's hardware segment continued to be dismal and declined on a year-over-year basis.For the third quarter of 2013, Oracle expects non-GAAP earnings in the range of 64 cents to 68 cents per share, which is significantly higher than the year-ago level of 62 cents. Total revenue on a non-GAAP basis is expected to grow in the range of 1.0% to 5.0%. New software license and cloud subscription revenue growth is expected to range from 3.0% to 13.0%. Hardware product revenue is expected to be down 10% to flat for the upcoming quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter stands at 63 cents per share while that for fiscal 2013 is $2.59 per share.There have been no revisions in the third quarter and 2013 estimates over the last 60 days. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the two periods remain pinned at 63 cents and $2.59, respectively.The lack of downward movement in estimates signals that the third quarter might not be too different from the past quarters.

The integration of the services will enable users to make person-to-person payment directly from their mobile bank account.According to a study by McKinsey & Company, over 16 billion person-to-person payments are being made every year and majority of them are through cash and checks. The study also reflected that electronic payment is emerging as a popular platform for transferring money.One of the primary reasons behind the platform's popularity is the rapid adoption of smartphones and tablets. According to a report from Forrester, 51% of tablet banking users and 46% of mobile banking users were in support of person-to-person payments to be enabled from their devices.This huge demand has prompted financial institutions such as Fiserv to adopt technology that offer both banking and payment options from a central hub. In the recently ended fourth quarter, Fiserv signed 134 Mobiliti clients and 113 Popmoney clients, which reflected strong demand for its services.In such a scenario, the integration between the two platforms will facilitate users to manage their mobile banking and payment options from a single platform. We believe that this will further boost Fiserv's user base going forward.Fiserv has been expanding its foothold in the financial and payment solutions business through its diversified product portfolio and continued technology upgrades. The company's advanced product ranges are likely to further enhance its revenue streams. Moreover, the company's various contract wins have enabled Fiserv to expand its presence in the industry.Additionally, Fiserv has a loyal and broad customer base.

WEX aims to reduce approximately 60% of its price-oriented earnings exposure every quarter on a rolling basis.These instruments purchased by WEX are specifically designed to improve the future earnings predictions of a company. The fuel-price risk management program of WEX utilizes these instruments to create a \"costless collar\" to protect it from future exposures. It is based upon the weekly diesel fuel price index of the U.S. Department of Energy and NYMEX unleaded gasoline contracts. The fuel price range considered is $3.43 to $3.49 per gallon.WEX has been continuously extending its fuel price risk management program to cover its fuel price related earnings exposures.

For this purpose MasterCard and Equity Bank have collaborated with Ezetap, one of the leading providers of mobile-based Payments services.Small merchants in Kenya are dominating the African market in terms of adopting cost-effective and flexible payment solutions technologies. But they were unable to offer cashless transactions to their consumers until now. The introduction of MPOS will enable these merchants to provide this convenient shopping experience to customers towards improvement in sales.Third, it also announced that eServGlobal and Oltio, both renowned mobile payment technology providers, have joined the Mobile Money Partnership Program (MMPP) of MasterCard. MMPP, launched in Feb 2012 allows consumers to access essential financial services using their mobile phones.The partnership will help MasterCard to expand and accelerate its programs for financial inclusion in mobile phones usage.Finally, it also announced the launch of a payment service program, Near Field Communication (NFC) in Brazil. To launch this program, MasterCard will use its Mobile PayPass technology and partner with Ita\u00fa, a publicly quoted bank, TIM, Redecard, a payment processor and Gemalto, a digital services company.The partnership and subsequent product launch will provide consumers with a more convenient, fast and secure payment option for shopping. Consumers need to tap their PayPass-enabled smart phones onto the merchant's NFC enabled POS to make instant payments. The amount will be charged to the customer's virtual account stored in his smart phone and processed via the account holder's Ita\u00fa issued statement.In Jan 2013, MasterCard announced its decision to provide other U.S. debit networks with some of the payment technology solutions owned by the company.

The payments can either be made electronically through any debit, credit or prepaid card or through internet using devices such as smartphones, computers, laptops and tablets. MasterPass is the revolutionized form of PayPass Wallet, which was launched by MasterCard in May last year.Accordingly, MasterCard provided a very compact digital wallet. MasterPass will now allow smart and simple checkout services by using the near field communication (NFC) process to scan bar codes and pay through mobile devices, thereby making point of sale transactions much more easy and secure.MasterPass also offers other value-added services like account balance information, alerts on discount offers and loyalty programs. These facilities further add to the consumers' shopping experience. Initially, MasterCard's MasterPass will be made available in the U.S., Canada, U.K. and Australia. Subsequently, the services will be accessible globally.MasterCard's MasterPass has received a warm reception from a number of financial institutions, banks, merchants and technology partners. Concurrently, VeriFone Systems Inc. joined forces with MasterCard to combine MasterPass' latest services with the former's GlobalBay Mobile Point of Sale and GlobalBay Clienteling software applications.These applications will further provide cloud-based payment options to the consumers, so that they can make payments from anywhere through their mobile devices. The alliance bodes well for MasterCard as VeriFone enjoys a customer base, which includes 75% of the top 200 largest retailers in the U.S.Similarly, mFoundry further strengthened its partnership with MasterCard with the pact to connect MasterPass with its 900 bank customers. mFoundry is a well-positioned mobile banking solutions provider in the U.S. MasterCard also became aleading investor in this firm in Dec 2011 to strengthen the combined mCommerce initiative.Further expanding its digital payment services, MasterCard collaborated with Orange and TIM, to boost mCommerce in Spain and Brazil, respectively. The recent ease of sanctions in Myanmar also amplifies MasterCard's growth opportunities in this richly resourced country.Over the past years, such alliances and business investments have made MasterCard a global leader in digital payment services through NFC and secure mobile applications. Moreover, the combined market for payment from NFC-equipped mobile transactions is expected to reach more than $74 billion globally by 2015 and 85% of terminals will accept cashless payments by 2016, according to Juniper Research.Hence, we believe that the collaborated initiative taken by MasterCard and its allies is expected to be a valued advancement in the rapidly growing mCommerce arena.

However, the details of the contract remain undisclosed.Accordingly, Total System will now be the primary payment processing service provider for MLS Direct Network. The company shall take care of the latter's risk management and technical issues, while offering chargeback processing services.Adding MLS Direct network further enhances Total System's position in the US and accentuates its operating and competitive leverage. As a result, the company has been witnessing improvement in its financials over the past few quarters based on its steady fundamental growth initiatives, primarily in the merchant acquiring space.Additionally, the company is making efforts to tap opportunities in the recovering markets through high-grade technology. This is reflected in the improved transaction volumes and higher accounts on file along with lower-than-expected margin decline since the formation of TSYS Merchant Solutions (TMS) and increased client activity. Such growth-driving factors encouraged management to produce an optimistic guidance for 2013.Meanwhile, Total System is exploring international markets via strategic alliances. Last week, the company attained the worthy contract from UK's primary automated teller machine (ATM) network - LINK. Accordingly, Total System will be the Certified Service Bureau for LINK, which comprises more than 35 member institutions.This enables the company to process all of the payment transactions for over 64,000 ATMs connected to LINK across the UK.

However, increasing operating expenses amid intense competition pose some risk on the operating leverage.Estimates have remained stagnant for this electronic payment service provider since it reported the fourth quarter results on January 22. Operating earnings of 32 cents per share were a penny below the Zacks Consensus Estimate and 3.4% higher than the year-ago quarter's earnings of 31 cents per share.Total revenues for the reported quarter were $479.1 million, up 1.5% year over year but lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $484.0 million. Nevertheless, management's top line expectation of 5-7% and low double-digit earnings growth outlook for 2013 validate a slow but steady growth momentum.Following the fourth quarter results, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2013 and 2014 have been maintained at $1.44 per share and $1.64 a share, respectively. With the Zacks Consensus Estimates showing a slight upward pressure on the stock from 2013 to 2014, the company now has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Total System's top and bottom line have improved modestly in the past 2 years. The company's risk-free balance sheet along with modest liquidity provides viable scope for healthy capital deployment.Also, its pipeline of international opportunities and improvement in client activity should help stimulate above-average growth and higher accounts on file. The high profile long-term acquiring services and technology contracts with leading global organizations will continue to boost its business portfolio and top-line growth. An optimistic guidance for 2013 further raises confidence and supports a long-term growth momentum.While we believe that the worst is over for this company, escalated expenses tend to outpace top-line growth, thereby limiting the desired upside in margins. Alongside, a higher backlog of accounts and risks related to intense competition, interest rates and foreign exchange fluctuation create a challenging operating environment for the company.While we continue to monitor the future developments of Total System, other stocks in the financial sector that are performing well include  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).

We believe this alliance will not only increase the payment efficiencies but also maintain the security, thereby allowing consumers the access to an authentic transaction and hardware-based display protection.Further, this marks the first alliance of an electronic payment service provider with a mobile device manufacturer. Last year, Visa had teamed up multinational semiconductor chip maker -  (INTC) to blend its proficiencies in payment processing and account holder authentication with the latter's high-grade innovative technologies.Separately, Visa announced its collaboration with Paris-based Ingenico SA's ROAM - a leading mCommerce provider - to reach out to the merchants and retailers with easy and secure payment initiatives from various mobile devices.Together, Visa and ROAM aim to initiate cost-effective mobile payment services for merchants and retailers. For this, ROAM has also joined Visa Ready Partner Program to roll out its mobile point-of-sale hardware exteriors with Visa's payment solutions. Subsequently, ROAM has offered to develop and provide white label mobile acceptance devices for all EMV payments to Visa merchants.Overall, the alliances elucidate the rapid progression in the NFC and mCommerce spaces.

Excluding check-related business, Payment Solutions revenue increased moderately, driven by continuous increase in electronic transactions and growth in network solutions.Fidelity's fourth quarter was primarily driven by better-than-expected margin expansion, which offset the sluggish revenue growth. Non-GAAP gross profit increased 3.7% year over year to $553.0 million. Gross margin expanded 40 basis points (\"bps\") to 36.9% on the back of favorable business mix.As far as expenses are concerned, selling, general & administrative expense (\"SG&A\") on a non-GAAP basis increased 4.2% year over year to $181.4 million in the reported quarter. Including stock-based compensation of $24.7 million, SG&A expense came in at $206.5 million.Operating income on a non-GAAP basis increased 3.5% from the year-ago quarter to $371.2 million.

Free cash flow increased to $365.0 million from $193.2 million in the previous quarter.For fiscal 2013, Fidelity expects revenues to grow in the range of 4% to 6%. Organic revenue growth is expected in the range of 3% to 5%. Fidelity also expects its earnings per share to be between $2.77 and $2.87.We believe that Fidelity's commanding position in the financial services market, increasing international exposure, recurring revenue model, diversified product portfolio, cost synergies from acquisitions and a loyal customer base will drive growth over the long term.Moreover, we believe that Fidelity's expansion into emerging markets such as Brazil, India and Asia-Pacific will drive organic revenue growth going forward. Additionally, the company's favorable EPS outlook for fiscal 2013 also bodes well with the company's future growth prospects.However, increasing consolidation in the banking sector, challenging environment for the Payments Solutions business and uncertain regulatory environment are the primary headwinds, in our view.

Ciena's loss per share widened on a year-over-year basis.The company also reported margin contractions due to unfavorable product mix and higher-than-expected operating expenses.Ciena expects a tepid first quarter due to reductions in order volume and deployment activity owing to the holiday season. For 2013, management remains optimistic and expects to gain market share, driven by continued spending from telecom carriers that remain focused on upgrading their networks. However, management hinted at subdued gross margins due to start-up costs related to new orders and its deployments.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter stands at a loss of 25 cents per share while that for fiscal 2013 stands at a loss of 29 cents per share.There have been no revisions in the first quarter and 2013 estimates over the last 60 days. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the two periods remain pinned at 25 cents and 29 cents, respectively.The lack of downward movement in estimates signals that the first quarter might not be too different from the past quarters. This is also indicated by that fact that the stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and #5 (Sell rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Our model states that a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of #1, #2 or #3 to beat earnings estimates.

This, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19 billion.Internal revenue growth was flat in the reported quarter due to lower license revenues (down $25.0 million). As a result, revenues from products plunged 16.3% year-over-year but increased 11.4% sequentially to $206.0 million. However, processing and services revenues increased 3.8% year over year and 1.8% quarter over quarter to $950.0 million.The Payments and Industry Products revenues (excluding output solutions postage reimbursements) increased 2.5% year over year and 4.4% sequentially to $572.0 million. Internal revenue growth was 3.0% in the quarter.The high recurring revenues accruing from Fiserv's card services and digital channels fully offset the negative impact from the weaker performance of the investment services and bill payment businesses. Biller solutions continued to suffer from the Durbin effect during the quarter. Transaction volumes in the debit business increased 15.0% year over year, driven by expanding client base.Fiserv extended its electronic payment and presentment relationship with  for another 10-year term. Fiserv signed 113 electronic bill payment clients and 40 debit processing clients in the quarter, which include power generation company  and healthcare provider  . Fiserv also signed 134 Mobiliti clients and 113 Popmoney clients in the quarter.Financial Institution Services segment revenues decreased 3.0% from the year-ago quarter but increased 2.1% sequentially to $524.0 million. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to lower license revenue.The Corporate and Other segment recorded a loss of $12.0 million compared with a loss of $14.0 million in the year-ago quarter and $12.0 million in the previous quarter.Operating margin (excluding mergers, severance costs and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets) increased 80 basis points (\"bps\") on a year-over-year basis in the reported quarter. The growth was primarily driven by higher recurring revenues, which fully offset the negative impact from lower license revenues.

Long-term debt came to $3.23 billion compared with $3.45 billion in the previous quarter.Free cash flow surged 19.0% year over year to $271.0 million. Fiserv repurchased 0.7 million shares in the fourth quarter.For full year 2013, Fiserv expects revenue growth to be more than 10.0% and adjusted internal revenue growth to be 3.0% - 4.5%. EPS is likely to be in the range of $5.88 -$6.07, representing yearly growth of 15%- 18%.Fiserv forecast free cash flow per share to be more than $6.60 per share, an increase of at least 18% over the prior year. The company expects operating margin to expand in a range of 10 to 50 bps.Fiserv forecasts revenues and earnings growth to be sequentially stronger each quarter in 2013 attributable to large recurring revenue client conversions in the second and third quarter and positive synergies from the recent Open Solutions acquisition (closed in January 2013).Fiserv has expanded its foothold in the financial and payment solutions business supported by its broad customer base, diversified product portfolio and continued technology upgrades. The company's advanced product ranges are likely to further enhance its revenue streams. Moreover, the company's various contract wins have enabled Fiserv to expand its presence in the industry.However, volatile macroeconomic environment, banking and financial service consolidation, poor cash flow, tough competition and increasing industry regulations are the primary concerns in the near term.Currently, Fiserv has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) recently helped New Zealand's ANZ to shift from its core banking system to single FIS core platform. The bank migrated approximately 3 million customer records and transferred $48 billion (AU$46 billion) onto FIS platform.The current migration was a part of a long standing agreement between National Bank of New Zealand and ANZ when the latter acquired the former in 2003. More importantly, FIS was preferred by ANZ due to its wide variety of solutions and services in the financial segment.FIS core banking solution platform has been a game changer for banks over the last couple of years. The shift to Fidelity's platform has enhanced their ability to process files within a short span of time, thereby facilitating cost management and further focus on customer service.Enhanced operating efficiency has been the primary reason for Fidelity's ever-growing banking clientele. Currently, increasing consolidation, tightened regulations, lower interest rates and the liquidity crunch have forced banks to look for ways to differentiate their services in a cost effective way. Fidelity's low-cost platform has emerged as a savior for these institutions in recent times.We believe that Fidelity's new customer wins and customer retention success are the keys to the company's future prospects. We believe that Fidelity's commanding position in the financial services market, expanding international operations, recurring revenue model, diversified product portfolio and, accretive acquisitions will drive growth.Moreover, Fidelity is well positioned to benefit from increasing investments in emerging technologies such as mobile banking. Mobile banking is developing as an extension of online banking, as mobile usage continues to accelerate globally.Nevertheless, increasing consolidation in the banking sector, a challenging environment for the Payment Solutions business and an uncertain regulatory environment are the primary headwinds in our view.We maintain our Neutral recommendation on a long-term basis, primarily due to a highly-leveraged balance sheet and intense competition from other major players such as  (  ).Currently, Fidelity has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) posted fourth-quarter 2012 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.19, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.01. The results were 11.2% higher than the prior-year quarter.Total revenue in the fourth quarter was $658.6 million, up 5.6% from $623.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements, consolidated operating revenue increased 6.5% year over year to $487.0 million, which was above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $472.0 million. operating revenues (excluding out-of-the-pocket reimbursements) increased 8.3% year over year, primarily owing to broad-based improvements in the brokerage, global solutions, healthcare and AWD operating units as well as significant contribution from the ALPS acquisition (in Jul 2011). However, the results were partially offset by lower mutual fund shareowner processing revenues and retirement revenues.During the quarter, total mutual fund shareowner accounts serviced decreased 1.5% sequentially to 88.1 million. Registered accounts and sub-accounts serviced by the company during the quarter were 75.7 million and 12.4 million, respectively.The decline was mainly due to conversion of roughly 1.4 million registered accounts to DST's competitor platform and 0.4 million accounts to its own sub-accounting platform. However, the interesting point is that the decline in total mutual fund shareowner accounts moderated from the 8.0% decline recorded in the preceding quarter.DST Systems announced to have won a new subaccounting client with approximately 300,000 subaccounts. Also, the company confirmed conversion of 100,000 subaccounts from a new client announced earlier. (previously Output Solutions) operating revenues increased 2.7% year over year. Contribution from North America was strong, which was offset by weak contribution from UK. During the quarter, there were new client commitments from North America. DST Systems expects full conversion activities related to these new clients to be completed in the second half of 2013, resulting in revenue growth.This apart,  Segment operating revenues increased 28.1% year over year to $4.1 million, primarily as a result of increased rental activities.Total cost and expenses increased 16.3% from the year-earlier period to $659.4 million. Consolidated operating loss was $0.8 million compared with operating income of $56.3 million in the year-ago quarter. Margin deceleration was due to weak performance by Customer Communications segment, partially offset by improvements in Financial Services and Investment and Other segments.Financial Services operating income increased 9.8% from the year-ago period to $56.2 million. However, operating margin came below the year-ago level due to lower mutual fund processing revenues and higher conversion and business expansion costs for the retirement and brokerage business units. Customer Communications operating loss was $58.0 million compared with operating income of $4.9 million in the year-ago quarter.Net income attributable to DST shareholders in the quarter was $37.9 million or 82 cents per share, down from $39.2 million or 88 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Despite a lackluster operating performance, the improvement in net income was attributable to higher non-operating income (sale of assets) and equity earnings. Excluding the one-time items included in operating income and non-operating income, adjusted net income in the quarter came in at $1.19 per share, up from $1.07 in the year-ago quarter.DST Systems' balance sheet appears highly leveraged. The company exited the quarter with $88.0 million in cash and equivalents, down from $103.0 million reported in the previous quarter, and debt of $1.01 billion, down from $1.10 billion reported in the previous quarter. Growing cash balance and declining debt reflects an improving net cash situation.During the fourth quarter, DST Systems bought back 1,250,000 common stock for a value of $73.7 million. Also, the company paid a semi-annual dividend of 40 cents a share.On Jan 30, 2013, DST's board authorized a $250 million share repurchase plan, replacing the previous plan under which 750,000 shares were still remaining.DST Systems also announced that it will start paying dividends quarterly at a rate of 30 cents a share.For the first quarter of 2013, DST expects its existing clients to convert 5.1 million subaccounts to DST's subaccounting platform, an increase of 1.3 million from the previous projection. The company also expects 5.4 million new subaccounts to convert from non-DST subaccounting platforms by the end of the first quarter.DST Systems signed a new mutual fund registered account client in Jan 2013, which is expected to add approximately 100,000 new accounts during the upcoming quarter.For 2013, DST currently estimates total conversions of registered accounts to subaccounts to approximate 5-6 million, of which approximately 30% will convert to DST's subaccounting platform.DST Systems is one of the leading global providers of sophisticated information processing software and products to the financial services industry, primarily mutual funds. The company has supplemented internal growth with strategic acquisitions.The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimates on both the top and bottom lines. However, year-over-year improvement in total revenue was not very encouraging due to modest performances across the segments.We remain encouraged by DST's exposure in the insurance vertical. Currently, the company has tie-ups with more than 20 of the top 25 insurance companies in America, which is expected to drive decent revenue growth.However, we are still of the opinion that, DST Systems' business volume and massive scale of operation in Financial Services will attract new customers. Moreover, we expect steady contributions from the recent acquisitions to support revenue growth.On the other hand, tough competition from  (  ),  (  ),  (  ), and a high debt burden remain concerns.Currently, DST Systems has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["inancial services technology solutions provider  recently announced that it has acquired Connecticut-based Open Solutions Inc for approximately $850.0 million.

Revenue and EBITDA run rate of Open Solutions at the time of the acquisition was approximately $320.0 million and $100.0 million, respectively.Open Solutions Inc is a leading technology provider to banks, thrifts and credit unions with a strong clientele of 3,300, which includes more than 800 account processing clients.

The acquisition is expected to be significantly accretive to earnings per share (EPS) going forward.Fiserv also announced preliminary 2012 results and 2013 guidance. The company expects 2012 adjusted EPS to increase approximately 12.0% over 2011. Adjusted internal revenue growth is expected to be 2.0% in 2012. For 2013, Fiserv expects adjusted internal revenue growth of 3.0% to 4.0% and EPS growth of 15.0% to 18.0% over 2012.Accretive acquisitions have been a key growth factor for Fiserv over the years. Although Fiserv did not acquire any business in 2012, it acquired four in 2011, which contributed revenues of $30.0 million. We believe that Fiserv will continue to pursue accretive acquisitions, which will boost its market share going forward.Moreover, acquisitions such as Open Solutions will help Fiserv to fight competition from  ,  and  in the near term.However, we note that the addition of Open Solutions debt will further increase Fiserv's debt level going forward.

The company's profits are largely tapered due to the company's higher-than-expected advertising and marketing expenditures. Information processing and communications expenses, professional fees, premises and equipment and other expenses also increased in 2012, thereby substantially increasing total non-interest expenses.Moreover, Discover Financial's competitors in the credit card business have substantially larger scales of operation, posing ample risk on the operational front. Companies in the competitive card business have to offer various incentives and rewards in order to attract customers.Discover Financial's rivals have more financial resources than the company due to larger operating scale, which enables them to offer better incentives. Thus, Discover Financial is relatively at a competitive disadvantage, which tends to slow down its growth in the .Nevertheless, counting on the positives, Discover Financial has grown to become one of the largest card issuers in the U.S. and a leading innovator in the credit card industry.

Fewer know, however, that up until a few years ago, a third mastermind made investing decisions at Berkshire Hathaway (  )(  ),  . Now that Simpson has founded his own firm, SQ Advisors LLC, GuruFocus today began to track the investor as its latest Guru.Buffett met Simpson in 1996 when he was CEO of Geico's capital operations and Buffett was completing his purchase of Geico. Impressed with his track record, Buffett kept Simpson on as chief investment officer.At his retirement from Berkshire subsidiary Geico in 2010, Simpson managed more than $4 billion worth of stocks. Throughout his time with Berkshire, Simpson and Buffett's stock picks overlapped sometimes due to similarities in their thinking, but both men clearly had independent processes and disagreed with each other sometimes as well.Several things the two men had in common were that they were both dedicated value investors, both maintained a concentrated portfolio, and both had big positions in three stocks: Wells Fargo (  ), Johnson 7 Johnson (  ) and ConocoPhillips (  ). Read a more detailed comparison of their investing approaches in Geoff Gannon's article, \"  ?\"Before joining GEICO in 1979 as senior vice president and chief investment officer, Simpson was president and CEO of Western Asset Management, a partner at Stein Roe and Farnham, and an economics instructor at Princeton University.Buffett frequently sang the praises of Lou Simpson. Once, in his 2004 investor letter, Buffett called him \"a cinch to be inducted into the investment Hall of Fame\" based on his return performance history. From 1980 to 2004, Simpson produced an average annual gain of 20.3%, compared to 13.5% for the S&P 500. In that time, he had only three negative years, and only four years of less than double-digit returns.Later, in 2006, Buffett intimated that Simpson, \"a top-notch investor with an outstanding long-term record,\" would be the natural replacement for him as CEO of Berkshire, were Simpson not a mere six years younger than him.In a rare interview, Simpson in 2010 told the Chicago Tribune upon his retirement: \"My approach is eclectic. I try to read all company documents carefully. We try to talk to competitors. We try to find people more knowledgeable about the business than we are. We do not rely on Wall Street-generated research. We do our own research. We try to meet with top management.\"Quickly dissatisfied with retirement, Simpson opened his own investment-advisory firm, SQ Advisors LLC, in Naples, Fla., on Dec. 20, 2010, with his wife. He began the firm with $150 million to $200 million in assets under management, primarily the money of his family and friends and charities, he told Bloomberg. At Sept. 30, his total portfolio value totals $1.17 billion.Simpson currently has 15 stocks, with largest holdings of his former employer Berkshire Hathaway (  ), as well as Fiserv (  ), TE Connectivity Ltd. (  ), Lowe's Companies (  ) and Buffett favorite Wells Fargo (  ). In his Berkshire Hathaway days, Wells Fargo was both he and Buffett's second largest holding.In the third quarter, Simpson added to most of his holdings and reduced less than 1% of only Lowe's Companies Inc. and Dell Inc. (  ). He sold out of only one position as well, Oaktree Capital Group LLC (  ).

Book-running managers currently acting for this notes offering are Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Mitsubishi UFJ Securities (USA), Inc. and U.S. Bancorp Investments, Inc.The net proceeds from the offering shall be used to repay a part of the company's term loan facility, which is due to mature in November 2012.The company exited the second quarter of 2012 with cash and cash equivalents of $302 million, decreasing from $311 million at the end of the previous quarter. Long-term debt remained somewhat consistent at $3.2 billion compared with the previous quarter. Year-to-date, net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $385 million with free cash flow of $298 million (net capital expenditures being $102 million).For the full year 2012, management projects an annual adjusted revenue growth of 4%-6% and adjusted internal revenue growth of 3.0% - 4.5%. Adjusted earnings per share are likely to be in the range of $5.08 - $5.20, representing a yearly growth of 11%-14%.The company's primary competitors include big players such as  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).

Fiserv's earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.27 per share.Adjusted revenues (excluding output solutions postage reimbursements) for Fiserv amounted to $1.05 billion, rising 4.7% year over year and nearly 2% sequentially. Revenue growth across the company's debit, account processing and mobile businesses was the primary cause for the annual rise in adjusted revenues for the quarter. This, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.12 billion.The Payments and Industry Products segment reported adjusted revenues of $548 million, up 4.2% year over year and nearly 2% sequentially. The high recurring revenues accruing from the company's card services and digital channels, offsetting the adverse impact from the investment services and Durbin effect on the company's biller business, drove the segment's revenue during the quarter.The Financial Institution Services segment revenues came in at $513 million, up 5.3% and 2.2% sequentially, led by the company's Account Processing and Lending business sales.The Corporate and Other segment recorded a loss of $12 million, up 9.1% year over year and 9.1% sequentially.Adjusted operating margin (excluding mergers, severance costs and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets) in the quarter came to 29.8%, compared with 29.0% in the year earlier quarter and it also increased by 50 basis points from the last quarter. The rise was attributable to the company's improved performance in its Financial Institution Services segment and increased operational efficiencies achieved during the quarter.The Payments and Industry Products' adjusted operating margin was 30.7% compared to 30.8% in the year-ago quarter and 29.8% in the last quarter. Strengthening Fiserv's mobile and online banking services, the coalition of CashEdge and the adverse impact from bill payment deconversions adversely affected the segment's margin.The Financial Institution Services segment's operating margin came in at 32.1%, rising from 29.4% in the previous year quarter but declining from 32.5% in the previous quarter. The company's increased license and termination fee revenue and higher efficiency gains were the primary causes for the rise in the margins in the quarter. The company's operational efficiency also positively impacted the quarter's margins.Corporate and Other segment witnessed an operating loss of $21 million, which remains flat sequentially but increased from $15 million loss incurred in the prior year quarter.As of September 30, 2012, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $307 million, increasing from $302 million at the end of the previous quarter.

Under the existing share repurchase authorization program, Fiserv has about 6 million shares remaining for repurchase.Management reiterated its guidance for 2012. Annual adjusted revenue growth is expected to be 4% - 6% and adjusted internal revenue growth to be 3.0% - 4.5%. The adjusted EPS is likely to be in the range of $5.08 - $5.20, representing a yearly growth of 11% - 14%.The adjusted operating margin is expected to increase annually by 30 basis points to 60 basis points for 2012. Free cash flow growth is anticipated to be within 8% - 12%.Headquartered in Brookfield, Wisconsin, Fiserv engaged in providing financial services technology solutions, including electronic commerce systems and services, such as transaction processing, electronic bill payment and presentment, business process outsourcing, document distribution services, and software and systems solutions.

While the top line remains similar to previous expectations (up 12% to 13% year over year compared to previous expectations of an increase in the low-double-digit percentage range). In dollar terms, the company expects revenues in the range of $2.55 billion to $2.58 billion, which is well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.53 billion. Moody's has also raised its pro forma earnings per share expectations to $2.70-$2.80 from prior estimates of $2.62-$2.72. The Zacks Consensus Estimate pegs Moody's fiscal 2012 earnings per share at $2.75, still above the guidance.Segment wise, global Moody's Investor Service (\"MIS\") is expected to increase in the high-single-digit percentage range (previously expected to increase in mid to high single digit percentage range). Domestic MIS revenue is expected to increase in the mid-teens percent range, up from earlier expectation of an increase in low-double-digit percent range. However, overseas MIS revenue is expected to increase in the low-single-digit range, which is consistent with previous expectations.Revenue from Corporate finance is expected to expand in the mid-teens percent range (previously expected to increase in the high single-to-low double-digit percent range). Though Moody's had projected its revenues from structured finance to be flat on year-over-year basis for 2012, the company now expects revenues from the segment to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range. However, the company expects its revenue from financial institutions to remain flat, consistent with previous expectations.However, Moody's has maintained its guidance on revenue from its analytics division, Moody's Analytics (\"MA\"). Domestic MA revenue is expected to increase in the high-teens to 20% range, while overseas revenue is projected to increase in the mid to high-teens percentage range. Research, data and analytics revenue growth is expected to be in the mid single-digit percentage range, while Enterprise Risk Solutions revenue is expected to be in the low 20% range. Professional services revenue is expected to grow approximately 75% for the full year.The improvement in MA segment revenue expectation is backed by a growing client base and expansion in the regulatory requirements of banks and insurance companies. Moreover, Moody's is expected to benefit from the disintermediation of credit markets. Improvement in the debt market is also expected to be a positive catalyst for the company going forward.The company has plans to repurchase shares amounting to $300 million in fiscal 2012. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $60.0 million to $70.0 million for fiscal 2012. Moody's expects depreciation to be approximately $100.0 million for the full year. Incremental compliance and regulatory expense is expected to be in the range of $10.0 million to $15.0 million for fiscal 2012.Despite the increased guidance, we retain a Neutral recommendation on Moody's due to the sluggish U.S economy, the ongoing European debt crisis and concerns regarding the banking sector. Moreover, integration risks from acquisitions and increasing technology costs (due to Dodd-Frank implementation) are expected to be the headwinds going forward. Moody's faces stiff competition in most of the markets in which it operates. Additionally competition from Fitch, S&P rating services,  (  ) and  (  ) are the other near-term headwinds.Nonetheless, we believe that Moody's remains a solid franchise in rating debt instruments based on its diversified credit research business model and international growth opportunities.Moody's currently has a Zacks #3 Rank, which translates into a short-term Hold rating.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) recently declared that Animas Credit Union has adopted its account processing solution platform, XP2 and other wide range of its digital solution services.

Fidelity expects to receive $220 million in net proceeds after tax from the sale.Fidelity's healthcare solutions business comprised the Consumer Driven Healthcare Solutions and Health and Financial Network Solutions segments, catering to consumers, healthcare providers and payers by providing services in the form of benefits administration, account processing and payment fulfillment.Fidelity's move to sell the business accentuates the fact that the company wants to focus on its core payment solutions and services segment for financial institutions. The leading banking and payments technology solutions provider has a strong clientele of financial institutions globally.We believe that the company's focus on the core segment of the Financial Solutions Group (\"FSG\") is a prudent measure that should offset the sluggish growth in its Payment Solutions Group (\"PSG\"). Incidentally, the divested business was a part of PSG.In the recently concluded quarter, FSG revenue climbed 9.1% year over year to $563.4 million (7.8% organically) on the back of growth in account processing and higher services revenue. However, PSG revenue increased marginally to $630.6 million.The divested business was categorized as discontinued operations and negatively impacted the earnings per share by 2 cents in the last concluded quarter. The company lowered its fiscal 2012 earnings guidance by approximately 7 cents, but it is expected that fiscal 2013 results will not be impacted by the sale of the business.We believe that Fidelity's commanding position in the financial services market, its increasing international exposure, recurring revenue model, diversified product portfolio, cost synergies from acquisitions and loyal customer base will drive growth over the long term. We also believe that Fidelity's expansion into emerging markets such as Brazil and Europe will drive organic revenue growth going forward.However, increasing consolidation in the banking sector, a challenging environment for the Payments Solutions business and an uncertain regulatory environment are the primary headwinds, in our view.We maintain our Neutral recommendation on a long-term basis (for the next 6 to 12 months), primarily due to a highly leveraged balance sheet and intense competition from other major players such as  (  ).Moreover, FIS expects the second half of 2012 to be much more challenging in terms of margin expansion due to planned client deconversion, tough year-over-year comparisons and a lack of visibility around its Visa pricing plans.Currently, Fidelity has a Zacks #4 Rank, which implies a short-term Sell rating (for the next 1-3 months).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n a bid to boost its central issuance business,  (  ) recently announced the addition of instant credit and debit card issuance services.The latest addition will provide a card issuance solution for financial institutions and will enable branch staff of financial institution clients to issue plastic Visa or MasterCard branded debit or credit cards for consumers in a branch location when they open new accounts or if their card gets misplaced.The new addition in Fiserv's portfolio will empower the company to offer optimum solution to clients for meeting their business objectives, which can be either be a central or instant issuance or a combination of both.Fiserv provides a seamless connection between its central issuance bureau and instant issuance solutions deployed at financial institutions.

Fiserv's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.26 per share comprehensively.Adjusted revenues (excluding output solutions postage reimbursements) for Fiserv amounted to $1.03 billion, rising 2.6% year over year but remaining flat sequentially. Revenue growth across the company's debit, account processing and lending businesses was the primary cause for the annual rise in adjusted revenues for the quarter. This, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.1 billion.The Payments and Industry Products segment reported adjusted revenues of $538 million, up 4.1% year over year but down 1.3% sequentially. The Wachovia bill payment de-conversion, software license revenue and Durbin effect on the company's biller business proved detrimental to the company's total revenue stream during the quarter. However, strong sales across card services, output solutions largely mitigated the damaging effect.The Financial Institution Services segment revenues came in at $502 million, up 1% and 0.2% sequentially, led by the company's Account Processing and Lending business sales which were partially offset by weakened license and termination fee revenues.The Corporate and Other segment recorded a loss of $11 million, remaining flat year over year and reducing 8.3% sequentially.Adjusted operating margin (excluding mergers, severance costs and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets) in the quarter came to 29.3% which remained flat year over year but increased by 60 basis points from the last quarter. The quarterly rise was attributable to the company's operational efficiencies achieved during the first half of 2012.The Payments and Industry Products' adjusted operating margin was 29.8% compared to 31.7% in the year-ago quarter and 29.5% in the last quarter. The implementation cost, the coalition of CashEdge and the adverse impact from bill payment deconversions reduced the segment's margin from the prior year quarter.The Financial Institution Services segment's operating margin came in at 32.5%, rising from 30.8% in the previous year quarter and also surging from 30.2% in the previous quarter. Growth across the segments' all businesses was the primary cause for the rise in the margins for the quarter. The company's augmented operational efficiency also positively impacted the quarter's margins.The Corporate and Other segment witnessed an operating loss of $21 million versus $23 million in the prior year quarter and $16 million in the previous quarter. The sequential rise in the operating loss was caused by the company's marketing expenses which include cost related to client conference.As of June 30, 2012, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $302 million, decreasing from $311 million at the end of the previous quarter. In addition, net trade accounts receivable came in for $606 million, deteriorating from $650 million at the end of the previous quarter.

Although the analysts have revised their estimates downward in recent times, we note that Fidelity has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimates by an average of 1.68% over the last 4 quarters. We expect this trend to continue in the current quarter.In the first quarter, Fidelity's top line was $1.45 billion that whisked past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.44 billion, while the bottom line of 51 cents matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The top line was driven by strong organic growth coupled with strong results from the Financial Solutions and International Solutions segments.Fidelity's margins expanded based on higher revenue base and prudent business mix. The company's operational efficiencies drove the bottom line higher on a year-over-year basis.For further details, please read: In the last 30 days, out of the three analysts covering the stock, two analysts revised their estimates downward and only one upward revision was noticed. Thus, the Zacks Consensus for the second quarter 2012 dropped by a penny in the aforementioned period to 58 cents. For the second quarter, the revenue estimate as per Zacks Consensus is $1.48 billion.Analysts covering the stock are cautious on Fidelity due to the weak macro-economic environment and sluggishness in the Payment Solutions Group. However, the divesture of the health care business is looked upon as a positive move that would enable the company to focus in the core Financial Solutions Group. Moreover, an uptrend in the organic growth also bodes well with the company's long-term prospect.We believe that Fidelity's commanding position in the financial services market, increasing international exposure, recurring revenue model, diversified product portfolio, cost synergies from acquisitions and loyal customer base will drive growth over the long term. We also believe that Fidelity's expansion into emerging markets such as Brazil and Europe will drive organic revenue growth going forward.However, increasing consolidation in the banking sector, a challenging environment for the Payments Solutions business and an uncertain regulatory environment are the primary headwinds, in our view.We maintain our Neutral recommendation on a long-term basis (for the next 6 to 12 months), primarily due to a highly leveraged balance sheet and intense competition from other major players such as  (  ).Currently, Fidelity has a Zacks #3 Rank, which implies a short-term Hold rating (for the next 1-3 months).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" reported second quarter 2012 earnings (including stock-based compensation) of 66 cents per share, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9 cents. Earnings surged 23.1% from 54 cents reported in year-ago quarter. The quarterly result was primarily driven by strong margin expansion.Revenues in the second quarter increased 3.1% year over year to $1.46 billion, but fell marginally short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.48 billion. Revenues increased 5.1% on an organic basis, primarily driven by strong performance of the Financial Solutions segment, which fully offset lackluster revenue growth in the Payment Solutions segment and a decline in the International Solutions segment.Financial Solutions revenue climbed 9.1% year over year to $563.4 million (7.8% organically), on the back of growth in account processing and higher services revenue. Payment Solutions revenue increased marginally to $630.6 million. Excluding the check-related business, Payment Solutions revenue was up 2.7% year over year, driven by continues increase in electronic transactions.International Solutions revenue decreased 1.9% year over year to $287.3 million, primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange. Organically, the segment grew 10.0% year over year in the quarter based on strong performance from European processing and consulting businesses, higher card issuance and usage in Brazil and continued expansion in Asia.Fidelity's second quarter was primarily driven better-than-expected margin expansion, which fully offset the sluggish revenue growth. Gross profit increased 10.7% year over year to $535.8 million. Gross margin expanded 250 basis points (bps) to 36.8% on the back of favorable business mix.Selling, general & administrative expense (SG&A) surged 14.2% year over year to $193.4 million in the quarter. However, operating income (including stock-based compensation) jumped 8.7% year over year to $292.7 million, based on strong gross profit base. Operating margin expanded 120 bps to 23.5% in the quarter.Further, interest expense decreased 14.0% year over year to $56.6 million in the second quarter. As a result, net income was up 18.1% year over year to $198.1 million in the quarter.Fidelity's balance sheet continued to remain highly leveraged at the end of second quarter of 2012. As of June 30, 2012, cash and cash equivalents were $533.8 million compared with $481.7 million in the previous quarter. Total debt (including the current potion) at the end of the quarter was $4.86 billion compared with $4.84 billion in the previous quarter.Fidelity generated $258.9 million in adjusted cash from operations versus $203.8 million in the previous quarter. Free cash flow (on an adjusted basis) increased to $178.4 million from $136.4 million in the previous quarter.During the quarter, Fidelity paid $59.0 million in dividends and repurchased 1.5 million shares for $50.0 million. Fidelity has $950.0 million remaining for future share repurchase, and expects to buy approximately 50 million shares every quarter for the remainder of 2012.For fiscal 2012, Fidelity continues to expect organic revenue growth to range between 3% and 5%. EBITDA is expected to grow in the range of 5%-7%, while margins are expected to expand by 40-80 bps.The company expects the second half of 2012 to be much more challenging in terms of margin expansion due to planned client deconversion, tough year-over-year comparisons and lack of visibility around Visa pricing plans.Fidelity revised its earnings forecast for full year 2012. The company now expects earnings in the range of $2.45-$2.55 (down from previous guidance of $2.47-$2.57) for fiscal 2012. This includes a charge of 7 cents related to the divestiture of the Healthcare business during the quarter and 5 cents benefit related to lower-than-anticipated effective tax rate.We believe that Fidelity's commanding position in the financial services market, increasing international exposure, recurring revenue model, diversified product portfolio, cost synergies from acquisitions and a loyal customer base will drive growth over the long term.

The company expects to complete the procedure by the end of the third quarter of 2012.Fidelity noted that the divestiture would help it to focus on its core payment solutions and services segment for financial institutions. The leading banking and payments technology solutions provider has a strong clientele of financial institutions.The Healthcare Benefit Solutions Business, a part of the Payment Solution Group segment, contributed $120 million to the total revenue and 5 cents per share to the adjusted earnings in fiscal 2011.

The shift to Fidelity's platform has enhanced their ability to process files within a short span of time, thereby facilitating cost management and further focus on customer service.Enhanced operating efficiency has been the primary reason for Fidelity's ever-growing banking clientele. Currently, increasing consolidation, tightened regulations, lower interest rates and the liquidity crunch have forced U.S. banks, particularly small banks to look for ways to differentiate their services in a cost effective way.

Judging by the degree of uncertainty the company still experiences with regard to competitive threats and clouded industry conditions, we think it wise not to be too upbeat about its future performance even with contract wins and strong quarterly results delivered of late.Fiserv continues to post approbatory yields in its quarterly financial results. On May 1, 2012, the company reported a 5.3% annual increase in adjusted revenues to reach $1.034 billion in the quarter along with an adjusted operating margin surge from 28.3% in the previous year quarter to 28.7% in the first quarter of 2012. What was more impressive than its recent achievement was the strong guidance averred by management which declared growth expectations in almost all important parameters such as net income, revenues and margins.A major growth driver for Fiserv is its ability to create and retain partnerships. We observed that the company extended ties with Carleton, Inc. for its SmartCales financial tool during the quarter whereas Badan Sertifikasi Manajemen Risiko (BSMR) joined hands with Fiserv again for managing and setting up educational financial risk management workshops in Indonesia in 2012. As we look ahead, the company's ZashPay and Mobile Money platforms are likely to bolster recurring revenues comprehensively in the coming quarters.While catering to technological advancements and partnership deals, the company does not neglect investor interests. Strong buy-back activities seem to be a regular feature for the company every quarter. In its first quarter of 2012, it repurchased 3.7 million shares for $245 million.However, the scenario is not really as bright as it appears as certain bottlenecks still continue to be bothersome for the company. Fiserv needs to focus on battling these downsides better in order to make the entire picture look more favorable.Ongoing threats from big players in the industry such as  (HPY),  (MA) and  (ADS) are quite consistent and prevalent. Moreover, self-sufficient financial corporations and billers who create and develop their own electronic payment and internet banking solutions are quite detrimental to the market share of Fiserv.One aspect which may be troublesome to investors for the time being is the company's poor cash flow in the first quarter of 2012. Ordinarily, it does not look to be a huge downside but is noteworthy for Fiserv as cash flow generation has been a major strength for the company perennially over the past quarters. However, in the recent quarter results, the company's cash flow from operation depreciated around 17% due to working capital changes and stock purchase activities implemented.Apart from these, the company remains vulnerable to fluctuations arising from fiscal adversities, weakened loan demands, unidentified revenue sources, etc. It is imperative that Fiserv makes an earnest effort in order to overcome these bottlenecks as nothing apart from individual performance strengths can cope with the problems.Hence, owing to the precarious zone the company continues to prevail in, we find it wise to maintain a sideline stance for the time being.

This would not only eliminate communication gaps between Valero's head-office and its retail stores but the advanced system shall also be installed in the most risk-free and simple manner at the units.Fiserv reported financial results for its first quarter of 2012 on May 1, 2012.

Revenue growth across both the major segments was the primary cause for the annual rise in adjusted revenues for the quarter. This, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.1 billion.The Payments and Industry Products segment reported adjusted revenues of $545 million, up 6.0% year over year but down 2.3% sequentially. The Wachovia bill payment de-conversion and Durbin effect were detrimental to revenue improvement during the quarter but strong sales across card services, output solutions and digital channels largely counteracted the damaging effect.The Financial Institution Services segment revenues came in at $501 million, up 4.4% but down 7.2% sequentially, attributable to strength accruing from termination fees, Account Processing and Lending business sales which were partially offset by weakened item processing revenues as expected by management.The Corporate and Other segment recorded a loss of $12 million, remaining flat year over year and reducing 14.3% sequentially.Adjusted operating margin (excluding mergers, severance costs and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets) in the quarter came to 28.7% versus 28.3% in the previous year quarter and 30.0% in the last quarter. The yearly rise was attributable to operational efficiencies achieved during the quarter.The Payments and Industry Products' adjusted operating margin was 29.5% compared to 30.3% in the year-ago quarter and 31.2% in the last quarter.

Furthermore, Fiserv did not cower under the pressure of existing threats accruing from contract renewal uncertainties and softness from financial services but posted a decent 4% - 6% adjusted revenue growth expectation for 2012.Fiserv is a big name with widely international operations which make it vulnerable to both macro-economic fluctuations and endemic hindrances. However, it is commendable that the company never fails to achieve its long-term targets, which are continually upgraded from time to time. Currently, free cash flow of $2.5 billion is projected to generate over the next three years along with cost savings of $250 million over the next four years. Such tenacity along with ossified determination makes this company even more attractive to invest in, particularly for the long run.Even though the scenario looks quite pristine and incorruptible, there are a few downsides which remain irrefragable. In an industry where aspects like loan demand declines, unrecognized revenue sources etc. are prevalent to make survival precarious; Fiserv does not appear to stand in a formidable position with few of its existing bottlenecks adding to the onus of the company.The CashEdge acquisition, which can arguably be called the company's most momentous acquisition till date, continues to remain onerous to Fiserv. We believe it to be ideal for the long run yielding revenues of up to $160 million in 2014; however, in recent times it paints a disappointing picture on the parent company's financial position.Fiserv faces major competitors in its industry which include names such as  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).

Conversely, operating margin improved to 41.5% from 35.1% in the year-ago quarter. Even adjusted operating margin escalated to 47.4% from 39.1% in the year-ago quarter, based on low commission expenses.As of March 31, 2012, MoneyGram had cash and cash equivalents of $2.55 billion (down from $2.57 billion at 2011-end), net receivables of $1.21 billion (down from $1.22 billion) and available-for-sale investments of $93.1 million (down from $102.8 million).The company ended the reported quarter with $814.3 million of outstanding debt (marginally down from $814.6 million at 2011-end), while assets in excess of payment service obligations of $223.6 million (up from $211.7 million). Free cash flow rose to $28.2 million from $25.4 million in the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by strong revenue growth and lower interest expense.For 2012, management reiterated its expectation of total revenue growth of 7-9%, while adjusted EBITDA growth is forecasted in the band of 9-11%. This is consistent with the company's long-term goals.During the reported quarter, MoneyGram expanded its agreement with Grupo Elektra and added 1,800 locations in Mexico, completed a 3-year expansion of services with over 10,000 locations across the Bank of China network and added over 1,000 locations in the Indian Subcontinent with Thomas Cook, India Post, and UAE Exchange. The company also strengthened its ties with  (  ) and fortified its footprint in Venezuela.Moreover, the company also broadened its network by adding about 1,000 locations in the Russia and CIS through National Bank of Uzbekistan and Sberbank Ukraine. Further, MoneyGram strengthened its position in Bulgaria as it began the roll-out of 1,000 PO Bulgaria locations, while also renewed and expanded its relationship with Speedway SuperAmerica, a convenience store chain with approximately 1,375 locations, to now include the company's self-service MoneyGram Xpress money transfer product.Earlier this week, MoneyGram's peer  (  ) reported first quarter earnings of 40 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Earnings increased 14% on a year-over-year basis, mainly on the back of strong margin improvement in the Global Business Payments unit and lower share count.MoneyGram carries a Zacks #3 Rank, which translates into a Hold recommendation over the short term. Additionally, over the medium-to-long term, we maintain a Neutral rating. ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) recently announced that the company plans to combine the Popmoney and ZashPay person-to-person (P2P) payment networks. The company intends to market the combined service as Popmoney.As of a result of this combination, the network will connect 1,400 financial institutions thereby reaching 35 million consumers through their existing online and mobile banking relationships.In 2010, Fiserv introduced ZashPay, a person-to-person payments service that enables the secure, electronic movement of money to and from U.S.-based bank accounts, typically within one to three business days.In September 2011, Fiserv acquired CashEdge which provides consumer and business payments solutions such as account-to-account transfer, account opening and funding, data aggregation, small business invoicing and payments and person-to-person payments. The payment solution from CashEdge - Popmoney is a person-to-person payments solution.Popmoney enables consumers to make billion person-to-person payments electronically via their existing bank accounts.Last month, Fiserv reported an adjusted income from continuing operations (excluding one-time items) of $181 million or $1.27 per share in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to a net income of $166 million or $1.16 per share in the third quarter of 2011 and a net income of $159 million or $1.06 per share in the year-ago quarter. Earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Adjusted revenues (excluding output solutions postage reimbursements) came to $1.08 billion, up 5.6% year over year and 8% sequentially. Strong segment and license sales along with continued faith of customers are primary drivers for the revenue increase. This, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.135 billion.Fiserv is quite optimistic about its performance in 2012. Management currently projects an annual adjusted revenue growth rate of 4% - 6% with adjusted EPS expectations of $5.04 - $5.20, representing a yearly growth of 10% - 14%.We have a Neutral recommendation on Fiserv.

The offer is expected to close by March 19, 2012. Fidelity expects to use the net proceeds to pay off some of its secured debt in the near term.Only qualified institutional buyers are allowed to buy these senior notes as per regulations set by Rule 144 A under the Securities Act of 1933. Foreigners can also purchase these notes, by following the rules set in Regulation S under the same act.The Senior Notes have a \"BB+\" issue rating (up from BB-) with \"3\" recovery rating (up from 5) as per credit rating agency Standard & Poor's latest release. The '3' recovery rating states that in case of default, creditors will be able to recover 50% to 70% of their investment.Fidelity's growth in recent years has been primarily driven by acquisitions, which were many a times funded by raising long-term debt. This high level of indebtedness has been a major concern for Fidelity over the last couple of years. However, we believe that the recent S&P rating upgrade reflects a lower debt level in 2011.At the end of December 31, 2011, total debt was $4.81 billion compared with $5.19 billion reported at the end of 2010. The company's net cash position (cash less debt) also improved from $4.85 billion to $4.39 billion at the end of fiscal 2011.Most significantly, debt-capital ratio improved from 44.8% in fiscal 2010 to 42.5% in fiscal 2011. Debt-to-EBITDA also improved 2.8 times at the end of fiscal 2011 compared with 3.2 times at the end of 2010. From 2012-2015, Fidelity expects debt-to-EBITDA to remain within the 2.0 times to 2.5 times range, much lower than the current level.We believe that the company may use the net proceeds to pay off its credit revolver outstanding ($175.0 million) and part of its secured debt in the near term. Currently, Fidelity has a term loan outstanding of $2.09 billion, which is scheduled to mature in 2014. Further, the company expects to refinance term loan B ($1.25 billion and due 2016) to reduce interest expense. Fidelity paid interest expense of $264.8 million, up 47.4% year over year in fiscal 2011.We believe that Fidelity's commanding position in the financial services market, increasing international exposure, recurring revenue model, diversified product portfolio; cost synergies from acquisitions, a loyal customer base and improving free cash flow will drive growth over the long term. We also believe that Fidelity's expansion into the emerging markets of Brazil, India and China will drive organic revenue growth going forward.However, we believe that Fidelity's balance sheet will remain highly leveraged for the next couple of years as the company continues to undertake debt refinancing activities and extend maturities through issuance of new bonds. This coupled with increasing consolidation in the banking sector, challenging environment for the Payments Solutions business, increasing competition from  and uncertain regulatory environment remain the primary headwinds, in our view.We, therefore maintain our Neutral recommendation on a long-term basis (for the next 6 to 12 months).

Revenue increased 4.9% on an organic basis, driven by strong results from Financial Solutions and International Solutions.Adjusted EBITDA increased 5.7% year over year to $470.0 million, driven by strong revenue growth in the quarter. However, EBITDA margin declined 30 basis points to 31.5% in the reported quarter.Operating income enhanced 4.7% year over year to $366.5 million, riding on strong revenue growth and better-than-expected gross margin.

EBITDA increased 7.2% year over year to $257.1 million while margin expanded 180 bps to 40.0%. revenue increased 18.9% year over year (14.9% organically) to $318.8 million. The strong results were driven by higher volumes from Brazil card processing operation and the addition of Capco's international operations.EBITDA increased 14.1% year over year to $92.8 million. However, EBITDA margin decreased 120 bps to 29.1% in the quarter, reflecting a higher proportion of low-margin professional services, including Capco.As of December 31, 2011, cash and cash equivalents were $415.5 million compared with $386.8 million, as of September 30, 2011. Fidelity's balance sheet remains highly levered. Total debt (including the current potion) at the end of the quarter was $4.81 billion compared with $4.87 billion in the previous quarter.Capital expenditure in the fourth quarter totaled $78.5 million versus $82.1 million in the previous quarter. Fidelity generated $308.3 million in adjusted cash from operations versus $275.5 million in the previous quarter. Free cash flow (on an adjusted basis) increased to $221.6 million from $193.4 million in the previous quarter.We believe that Fidelity's commanding position in the financial services market, increasing international exposure, recurring revenue model, diversified product portfolio, cost synergies from acquisitions and a loyal customer base will drive growth over the long term. We also believe that Fidelity's expansion into emerging markets such as Brazil, India and China will drive organic revenue growth going forward.However, increasing consolidation in the banking sector, challenging environment for the Payments Solutions business and uncertain regulatory environment are the primary headwinds, in our view.We maintain our Neutral recommendation on a long-term basis (for the next 6 to 12 months), primarily due to a highly leveraged balance sheet and intense competition from other major players such as  .

Fidelity reported a sedate third quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.In the third quarter of 2011, Fidelity earned 62 cents per share, an increase of 19.2% from the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by a 10.8% year-over-year growth in revenues to $1.43 billion. Revenues rose 4.1% organically on the back of strong results from Financial Solutions and International Solutions.Although Fidelity did not provide any quarterly guidance, the company expects full year earnings in the range of $2.24 to $2.30 per share. This implies that the company has to earn 62 cents to 68 cents per share to meet its current quarter guidance. Fidelity expects revenues to grow 10.0% year over year for fiscal 2011. For further details please see  .The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter is currently pegged at 65 cents, up 1.6% from 64 cents in the year-ago quarter. This is based on an estimated year-over-year revenue growth of 6.7% to $1.49 billion.In the last 30 days, only one out the 14 analysts covering the stock lowered the estimate for the fourth quarter. However, the revision did not trigger any movement in estimates, which stood at 65 cents over the last 30 days.We note that Fidelity has posted an average earnings surprise of 3.39% in the trailing four quarters, implying that it has outdone the Zacks Consensus Estimate by the same magnitude for the last four quarters. We don't expect a major change in the earnings trend for the current quarter.We believe that Fidelity remains a dominant name in the financial services market, primarily due to its expanding client base, particularly in the banking sector. Enhanced operating efficiency has been the primary reason for Fidelity's ever-growing banking clientele. Currently, increasing consolidation, tightened regulations, lower interest rates and the liquidity crunch have forced U.S. banks, particularly the small ones to look for ways to differentiate their services in a cost effective way. Fidelity's low-cost platform has emerged as a savior for these institutions in recent times.However, the recently announced merger of London-based banking software maker  and Swiss financial services provider  is expected to provide significant competition to Fidelity in the banking sector going forward. The proposed merger will create the world's largest risk-management software provider with a clientele of approximately 1000 banks.We also believe that sluggish growth in the payment solutions business and a difficult macroeconomic environment in Europe will continue to hurt Fidelity's profitability going forward. Moreover, the ongoing legal battle between Fidelity and its closest rival  will remain an overhang in the near term.We, therefore, maintain our Neutral recommendation over the long term (6-8 months). We note that Fidelity has outperformed the broader S&P 500 market by 15.9% over the last three months. However, the near-term concerns compel us to maintain our cautious approach.

Adversities arising from the Durbin Amendment and Wachovia bill payment de-conversion deteriorated gains from this segment largely.The Financial Institution Services segment revenues came in at $540 million, rising 6.7% annually and 10.9% sequentially, primarily attributable to strong account processing ameliorations and high margin sales.The Corporate and Other segment recorded a loss of $14 million, declining 55.6% since the previous year quarter.In 2011, adjusted revenues were $4.07 billion, growing 3.6% annually. Payments and Industry Product adjusted revenues for the full year rose 5.4% to $2.12 billion annually, whereas Financial Institution Services adjusted revenues increased 2.7% annually to reach $2.0 billion at the end of 2011.Adjusted operating margin (excluding mergers, severance costs and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets) in the quarter came to 30.0% versus 29.7% in the previous year quarter and 29.0% in the last quarter.The Payments and Industry Products adjusted operating margin was 31.2%, falling from 31.5% in the last year quarter but increasing marginally from 30.8% sequentially. This was mainly because of continued investments made in Mobiliti, person to person (P2P) and internet banking. The CashEdge acquisition also negatively impacted margins in this segment in the December quarter.The Financial Institution Services segment operating margin came in at 33.1% on the back of increased high margin sales, rising from 31.7% in the previous year quarter and 29.4% in the third quarter of 2011In full year 2011, large investment and Corporate segment costs along with the onus of employee increment growth detrimentally affected adjusted operating margin as it fell to 29.2% from 29.4% in 2010.Segment-wise, Payments and Industry Products recorded an adjusted operating margin of 31% in 2011 versus 31.2% in 2010, whereas Financial Institution Services had a better operating margin of 30.6% in 2011 versus 30.3% in 2010.Effective tax rate amounted to 37% for the December quarter, in line with management's previously provided forecasts.

Then it focuses in on the Zacks #1 Ranks and Zacks #2 Ranks, which are Strong Buys and Buys, respectively. But then it selects the outperforming stocks with the smallest percentage price change over the last 4 weeks.Why would I do something like that?Here's why.You've probably heard the old adage that roughly half of a stock's price movement can be attributed to the group that it's in. And it's true. In fact, oftentimes, even a mediocre stock in a top group will outperform a top stock in a poor group for this very reason.Now, take a look at any top group. You'll see plenty of fantastic stocks with some impressive price gains in there. But not every stock in every group moves in lockstep at the exact same time. Some will move more than others at any given time.So by focusing on the stocks with the smallest percentage price change that have fundamentals that are just as good as those making the biggest price change, you might find yourself getting into the stocks ready to make the biggest potential catch-up move.Here's how to set up that screen:Sign up now for your free trial today and start picking better stocks immediately.

Though there aren't many major changes in the list, there are some telling points that most investors can study and learn how to invest like Mr. Buffett.These are stocks he's added to or added in the last quarter:BDX: Becton Dickinson, up 155,000 shares (total owned: 1.889 million shares).FISV: Fiserve, Inc. This is a new position of 4.4 million shares.IRM: Iron Mountain Increased position by 206,000 shares. Has been buying this over the last several quarters with a starting position of 3.3722 million shares.JNJ: Johnson & Johnson Added significantly to this position to 41.13 million shares, up from 27 million in the last quarter. At one point, owned 62 million shares.NLC: Nalco Holding Added 150,000 shares to 9.15 million.These are the stocks sold:COP: Conoco Phillips: down 5 million shares to 29.1 million shares. He's been a consistent seller of this stock for several quarters, starting with 62.485 million.KFT: Kraft Foods. Sold about 1.5 million shares, putting position at 105.21 million.MTB: M & T Bank Sold 200,000 shares. Position is now 5.363 million which was 6.71 million shares two quarters ago.PG: Procter & Gamble Sold position to 70.071 million. Was as high as 96.3 million three quarters ago.(For a complete list of all holdings, as of June 30, see: As you can see, there are only two significant increases in holdings: JNJ and FISV. Johnson & Johnson is a company deeply entrenched in the medical world. This makes sense as the population ages and has more health concerns. An investor can make money from more expenditures for medical devices, surgeries, and even band-aids. The one new name is Fiserve, Inc., a service company to the banking industry, specializing in transaction processing, bill pay, etc. The fact that the master has been selling PG and COP over the last several quarters suggests he is less sanguine about each company's growth and profit potential.What does all this mean for investors? First, notice that most of the names are very recognizable, names like Coca-Cola, Wal-Mart, Johnson & Johnson, and General Electric. Very large companies that are drivers in the American economy. Nothing magical about finding these stocks. They're everywhere. Investors just have to look around next time they're shopping at the grocery store or mall, and they'll see these names. Buffett has made a fortune by simply buying well established, profitable companies. You can too.Second, most of the stocks have been held a long time. As Mr. Buffett is fond of saying, \"My favorite holding period is forever.\" He's not a trader. While he adds to some positions over time, he also sells some of his positions. Most likely he's less enamored with the growth potential of a stock and because of his large positions is slowly getting out of one that is in disfavor. But he doesn't try to get in and out of a \"hot\" stock, hoping to trade for profits. Rather, he looks at a business as a long term investment, one that will take time to grow to its full potential. He's owned stocks like Coca-Cola, and Washington Post for decades. He's not selling those. The lesson for investors: do your homework well, then be patient.....for years.Of course, just picking a company from the list, even JNJ, isn't an assurance of success. Investors need to do their own homework, then decide what price makes sense.

The shift to Fidelity's platform will enhance the bank's ability to process files within a short span of time, thereby facilitating cost management and further focus on customer service.Enhanced operating efficiency has been the primary reason for Fidelity's ever-growing banking clientele. Currently, increasing consolidation, tightened regulations, lower interest rates and the liquidity crunch has forced U.S. banks, particularly small banks to look for ways to differentiate their services in a cost effective way. Fidelity's low-cost platform has emerged as a savior for these institutions in recent times.Over the last few months, a number of banks from different parts of the country have chosen Fidelity's solutions. Recently, Fidelity's banking and payments technology solutions were chosen by more than 80 financial institutions. Banking institutions such as First National Bank of Omaha, People's United Bank and Marquette Bank also opted for Fidelity solutions. We believe that a steady flow of new banking customers will boost Fidelity's top-line growth going forward.The expanding client base will boost revenues in the Financial Solutions division, which will offset a sluggish growth in the Payment solutions group and any negative impact from the European operations going forward. In the recently ended third quarter of 2011, Financial Solutions revenues rose 7.8% year over year (0.6% organically), as opposed to a 0.5% increase in Payment Solutions revenues. For further details please see  .We believe that the increasing client base will also boost Fidelity's competitive edge against major rivals such as  in the financial and payment solutions segments. Moreover, increasing international exposure, particularly in the emerging economies of Latin America and the Asia-Pacific, diversified product portfolio, cost synergies from acquisitions and a loyal customer base will drive growth over the long term.We maintain our Neutral recommendation on a long-term basis (for the next 6 to 12 months).

The acquisition madeFiserv a direct competitor of Fidelity.We believe that the lawsuits reflect increasing rivalry between Fidelity andFiserv . Over the last 12 months, Fidelity andMetavante have developed a strong track record of serving regional banks, community banks and credit unions. On the other hand,Fiserv continued to expand its consumer payment footprint by signing 114 electronic bill payment clients and 48 debit clients during the third quarter, which reflects its strong product portfolio, in our view.However, we believe that enhanced operating efficiency has been the primary reason for Fidelity's ever-growing banking clientele.

His stake in J&J is worth about $2.4 billion at current prices.The move can be seen as a classic Buffett \"value\" play: J&J shares, at about $58, are well off their 52-week high of $66.20 and are down nearly -10% for the year. The company has annual revenue of more than $60 billion and consistently earns returns on shareholder equity of between 25% and 30%. It has posted an increase in  for at least the past 10 years, and 2010 profit forecasts imply a +188.3% increase in net earnings since 2000. (Earnings have surprised to the upside for the past five years, according to Bloomberg.)The J&J stake wasn't the only health-care bet made by the 79-year-old Buffett, whom Forbes lists as the second-richest man in the United States, with an estimated net worth of $40 billion, second only to Microsoft founder and close friend Bill Gates. Buffett also added to his stake in drug maker  and to his position in medical-device maker  .The Berkshire portfolio showed one other addition: Buffett added a 4.4 million-share stake in  , which provides IT services to banks, an area Buffett is familiar with and likes -- three of his largest holdings are financial institutions:  ,  and of course, the $8.2 billion stake in  .Fiserv offers predictable and \"non-cyclical\" earnings that are shielded from economic downturn. The company operates at a robust 23.5%  . That's not as rich as the 39.2% operating margin at  , another Berkshire holding, though one that Buffett has started to pare in the light of potential liability for the company's ratings during the subprime ordeal. (Buffett stood pat on Moody's in the second-quarter, with a $685 million block of shares.)The addition brought the total number of companies in the regulatory filing to 37. Berkshire also owns shares in several foreign companies, though it is not required to disclose those stakes.Other portfolio moves:Berkshire picked up a few shares of  , which provides secure document disposal and storage services to companies. Buffett bought 205,200 shares, bringing the total value of the stake to about $176 million at today's prices. Expanding this position is part of a broader move to increase Berkshire's ownership of trash companies: Buffett has amassed a 10.8 million share hoard of  , a move that has been mirrored by Buffett's close friend Bill Gates, who owns 55.4 million shares of the company through his private hedge fund, Cascade Management, as well as another 1.3 million shares through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which also owns 15.7 million shares of  . Though Buffett didn't add to Republic in the second quarter, I fully expect him to continue adding shares of this company.Buffett shed shares of  , which he bought during the run-up in oil prices and has said it was a poorly timed investment. The oil business is a curious area for Buffett, who tends to like businesses that require little additional capital, which is the lifeblood of growth and success for oil companies. He left his stake in  untouched, though at $25 million it is relatively minor -- the Conoco stake is worth nearly $1.6 billion.[Read:  ]Buffett also continued to pare his stake in  . Buffett had a rare public disagreement with Kraft CEO Irene Rosenfeld over her decision to buy Cadbury. Buffett -- one of the largest holders of Kraft stock -- thought Rosenfeld was looking for a show horse deal and paid too much. (Buffett prefers work horse deals). Kraft, which announced its takeover bid for Cadbury in early September 2009, has more than doubled the S&P since, rising +11.3% to the  's +5.3%. Berkshire, however, has gained +18.1%. Investors should mirror Buffett's J&J buy -- few companies are able to match its diverse and innovative product lines, and even fewer can generate the earnings of the health-care giant. Plus its shares are cheap. Buffett's wisdom has always been in spotting undervalued gems, and he couldn't give investors a clearer buy signal.--Andy ObermuellerAndy spent a decade as a financial journalist writing for some of the largest newspapers in the nation.

During this three-day bullish binge, the Dow has added roughly 4%, while the CBOE Market Volatility Index (VIX) has plunged some 11.4%. The blue-chip barometer is currently perched above potential support near 10,500, with resistance looming overhead near 10,600 (site of the Dow's June 21 high). Incidentally, the VIX is trading at a two-month low, below its 200-day moving average. The S&P 500 Index (SPX), meanwhile, is perched above its 200-day moving average for the first time since June 21, as the broad-market index looks to leave the dregs of July in the rear-view mirror. While the SPX has potential support at its 200-day moving average and the 1,100 level, the index must still overcome its June high near 1,130. Heading into the open, Wall Street has a bullish bias ahead of a handful of key economic reports. Futures on the DJIA and the SPX are trading 34 points and 2.6 points above fair value, respectively.

The company has been inclined towards making profitable acquisitions over time, which include CheckFree Corporation, AdviceAmerica, iTech Corporation among many othe rs.The company's recent Carefree acquisition has been a crucial turning point as Fiserv now focuses chiefly on high profit sectors such as online banking solutions and electronic transaction services. It has hence slowly started to steer away from its low margin products including check processing and lending solution services.This move appears to be apt and wise considering the current macro environment where the fiscal contagion continues to pervade throughout the economy.Recently acquired CashEdge Inc. by Fiserv in September 2011 with the intent of diversifying and refining its digital payments and channel strategies, surely is a profitable venture.However, CashEdge seems to be dependent on untraceable P2P solutions which can adversely affect current operations of Fiserv and it would take time to stabilize in order to effectively ameliorate gains for the company.Even though heavy technology investments are being implemented to improve demands, the company's acquisition trend seems to be muted for now and we believe that it is advisable to remain on the sidelines before being too perspicacious and predict what the future has in store for the company.In the recently announced third quarter 2011 results, FISV reported a ne  increase of 1.8% while its net earnings per share came to $1.16, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.14. Operating margins declined slightly to 29.0% from 29.4% in the previous year quarter.Moreover, FISV continues to face stiff competition from big players in the industry including  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).The current Zacks Consensus Estimates for the fiscal years 2011 and 2012 are $4.58 and $5.11, respectively. In the short-run, we have a Zacks #2 Rank for the stock, which translates into a short-term rating of Buy. However, due to the current economic slowdown, rising competition and clouded expectations from recent acquisitions, we retain our long-term rating of Neutral for the company. ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ot a day goes by when we're not bombarded by advertisements to save money on auto insurance. Geico, Allstate, Progressive, 21st Century... I'm not sure how they can all be the cheapest, but that's entirely another story.The point is, these messages don't really hit home with me. I'm fond of the Geico cavemen, but they don't compel me to switch insurance carriers.First, there's always the concern about whether the price comparisons are truly apples-to-apples when it comes to specific features and benefits. Even if one of these companies could save me a few dollars initially, what's to stop them from jacking up those premiums a few months down the line?Plus, I get multi-line discounts for having auto, homeowners and other policies with the same agency -- and switching might jeopardize those favorable rates I'm paying for other products. Finally, dealing with a new insurance agent can be a wild card, who knows how responsive they will be with claims and other customer service issues?And then there's the hassle of paperwork.Don't tell State Farm, but they could raise my premiums and I probably still wouldn't switch. The point is: Customers on the books tend to stay on the books. This can translate into big rewards for shareholders.Very few companies escaped last year's downturn unscathed. But for a handful, it was business as usual.Take  , for example, which handles billing and other services for cable and satellite TV providers like  and  . The company gets paid to mail out monthly statements to roughly half the households in the United States, and it processes about $3 billion in transactions every month.Setting up the firm's complex billing infrastructure can cost millions and take months to complete. Once a customer like  has made that type of commitment, it is usually very reluctant to take its business elsewhere. Most sign long-term multi-year contracts. As a result, CSG Systems has money coming in the door rain or shine.Despite a sharp plunge in consumer and business spending, the company posted a healthy +13% increase in revenue last year. Those improvements help explain why CSG Systems swam when the rest of the market sank like a rock. The shares delivered +19% in 2008, while the S&P 500 nosedived -38%.The stock is a prime example of how a sticky customer base can keep a company's stockholders happy in any environment.We all know that neighborhood gas stations have basically zero pricing power. It takes almost no effort to pull in next door to save a few cents a gallon, so pricing is cut-throat and margins are razor thin.At the other end, there are well-placed firms like CSG Systems that can milk their customers. Clients aren't going to throw away millions in upfront installation expenses and then spend time and money retraining its employees on a new system just to save a few bucks.As a result, the business tends to be highly stable.Banks and asset management companies often benefit in much of the same way. It's not that we couldn't find a cheaper checking account or better performing mutual fund somewhere else, but the headache of signing papers, transferring assets, filling out new direct deposit forms, etc. is enough to dissuade most of us from jumping ship.Simply put, these \"switching costs\" usually outweigh any benefit associated with moving to a competitor. . The company provides the software that process millions of ATM withdrawals, checking deposits and other transactions for banks and credit unions. It's not a glamorous business, but can you imagine the possible disruption of handing this critical behind-the-scenes task to a rival that might not be as reliable.Fiserv rarely loses customers -- the company boasts a near-perfect retention rate of 99%. That's a big reason why its shares have delivered an eye-popping gain in excess of +4,000% during the past two decades.There's no easy way to screen for a sticky customer base. Superior pricing power often shows up in lofty margins and robust returns on equity relative to industry peers.
