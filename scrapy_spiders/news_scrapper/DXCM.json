Initially, panic and uncertainty tied to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic sent the broad-based  down 34% in less than five weeks. But in the subsequent 11 weeks, we've witnessed roughly 80% of this initial drop clawed back by equities, with Wall Street appearing to enter a new bull market.Although swoons in the stock market are inevitable, history has  that opportunistic long-term investors who buy during these periods of weakness tend to make money. It's never really a question of whether you should invest when a new bull market emerges, but where you should park your capital.Assuming a new bull market has been established, the following four industries look set to thrive (and dominate) for a long time to come.Image source: Getty Images.One of the bigger beneficiaries of the COVID-19 pandemic is cybersecurity. To be perfectly clear, cybersecurity was already growing at a healthy pace well before the coronavirus shut down nonessential businesses across much of the country. But with more employees being forced to work remotely than ever before, the need to secure cloud-based data is taking on added importance. Essentially, COVID-19 took an existing trend and gave it a shot of adrenaline.Hands down, my favorite company in this space is  , which I pegged on April 9, 2020, as  (i.e., deliver 1,000%-plus returns) by 2030.Aside from the fact that enterprise cloud demand continues to pick up, Palo Alto benefits from the fact that it's \u00a0as opposed to hardware. Subscriptions generate much better margins than hardware, and cash flow is far more predictable as Palo Alto is unlikely to see customer churn for what's effectively a basic-need service for any business.Over the past year, Palo Alto's subscription and support revenue has grown to account for 68% of total sales, up from approximately 62% in the prior-year quarter.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images.Building off of cybersecurity, the hottest thing since sliced bread in the new bull market is going to be anything having to do with cloud computing. This could mean the infrastructure players that are responsible for aiding businesses in creating their cloud, platform-as-a-service providers that allow enterprises to build, manage, and deploy applications, and software-as-a-service companies, which operate and sell ready-to-use apps for businesses and consumers.Interestingly, some of the  are the United States' largest publicly traded companies:   with Amazon Web Services (AWS),  with Azure, and  with Google Cloud.I don't see how investors can't get excited about Amazon in the new bull market. Even putting aside its e-commerce dominance, AWS continues to grow at about twice the pace of its retail/ad operations, and it produces considerably better margins. With Amazon's cloud services now accounting for 13.5% of total sales in Q1 2020 and a majority of its operating income, it's no wonder Wall Street  by 2023.Image source: Getty Images.The new bull market will also feature . By personalized medicine, I'm referring to the idea of tailoring treatment for each individual rather than offering generalized medical solutions. Most personalized medicine leans on the increased use of technology, the cloud, and innovative new devices.For example, another 10-bagger stock I singled out in April is  , a provider of personalized health solutions. Using mountains of collected data and artificial intelligence, Livongo sends tips to members with diabetes in order to help them make meaningful behavioral changes that result in them living longer and healthier lives. It also doesn't hurt that Livongo's solutions can potentially work hand in hand with other wireless diabetes devices (e.g., insulin pumps), meaning patients don't have to leave the comfort of their homes to convey sensitive data to their physicians.Maybe the best thing about Livongo Health and the personalized medicine push is that . Livongo's Diabetes member count doubled from the prior-year quarter to more than 328,000, and it's already generated two consecutive quarters of profitability despite significant reinvestment into its solutions.If Livongo is already turning the corner to profitability with less than 1% of U.S. diabetes market share, just imagine its potential when it expands to treat other chronic illnesses, like hypertension.Image source: Getty Images.Finally, look for the  (IoT) to finally realize its full potential in the new bull market. By IoT, I'm talking about wireless devices being able to connect and communicate with one another and data centers. Examples might include a smart thermostat that learns your heating and cooling preferences to conserve energy usage in your home, or an automobile that automatically reorders a defective or soon-to-be-defective component.It's not uncommon for Wall Street and investors to overestimate the impact of new technology and be left disappointed. This is sort of what happened with IoT stocks in the latter half of the 2010s. But with an increased reliance on work-from-home, the cloud, and even personalized medicine, the value of IoT is rising like never before.To build off of the previous industry (personalized medicine),   is the perfect example of IoT in action. Dexcom, which happens to have a deal in place with Livongo Health, is a  for diabetics. DexCom's devices can provide patients with real-time blood-glucose levels, communicate with insulin pumps to administer or hold off on the administration of insulin, and aid in producing reports that can be sent to a primary care provider.IoT has applications in virtually every industry, and the new bull market should showcase that fact.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Insulet stock remains a huge winner over the intermediate and long terms. Over the past five years, it's gained 567%, versus the broader market's 60% return.Here's how the quarter worked out for Insulet and its investors.Image source: Insulet.MetricQ1 2020Q1 2019ChangeRevenueOperating incomeNet incomeEarnings per share (EPS)Data source: Insulet.\u00a0Revenue easily beat Insulet's guidance of growth of 17% to 20% year over year. For context, in the , revenue grew 27% year over year.The year-over-year decline on the bottom line was driven by an increase in interest expense.Here's what CEO Shacey Petrovic had to say in the press release:Insulet entered 2020 with positive momentum, making progress toward our strategic objectives and achieving strong revenue growth ahead of expectations. The efficiency and redundancy we have built in our supply chain and manufacturing operations enabled us to meet customer demand without interruption during this challenging time. We believe that our proven, durable annuity business model will continue to generate double-digit revenue growth in 2020. We remain confident we have the right strategic framework to effectively advance our mission, drive sustainable long-term growth throughout our global business, and to continue to create shareholder value.On the , CFO McMillan quantified what Petrovic termed the company's \"annuity business model,\" or what others might consider a razor-and-blade model: \"Historically, new Omnipod starts within any given quarter contributed approximately 10% of revenue.\" In other words, the vast majority of quarterly revenue has come from existing Omnipod users purchasing new pods.The Omnipod has no upfront cost, as it's a pay-as-you-go product, which means sales should hold up better in a recessionary environment relative to products that have considerable upfront costs.Insulet's Q1 results were quite robust despite headwinds presented by the pandemic.\u00a0Unlike many companies, it didn't lower or pull its full-year 2020 guidance. Management reaffirmed its previously issued 2020 outlook of revenue growth of 14% to 18% over 2019. However, it did say that it now expects revenue to come in at the low end of this outlook. The company doesn't issue earnings guidance.\u00a0Due to the pandemic, Insulet's U.S. launch of its Omnipod Horizon automated insulin delivery system, which uses a\u00a0\u00a0 continuous glucose monitor (CGM) to dose insulin, has been pushed back. Management now expects this launch to occur in the first half of 2021, rather than in late 2020, Petrovic said on the .

In the middle, 3 would be a Hold.  So anything below 3 leans toward Buy as the average analyst sentiment.  The average rating of 1.45 for DXCM leans strongly towards the bullish end of the spectrum, yet the DXCM price target paints a different picture.  Clearly, there is something more to the story here that is worth investigating for investors looking at DexCom Inc.  Of course, the average price target is just that \u2014 a mathematical average, and is only one metric.  There are analysts with higher targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $420.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as low as $190.00.  The standard deviation is $49.147.\n\n\nBut the whole reason to look at the average in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes \u2014 much like with guessing the number of jelly beans in a jar, where the average guess tends to be very close.  And so with DXCM trading so far above that average target price of $358.39/share, the -14.21% downside to that average target does seem to be a paradox against the bullish analyst ratings.  Might analysts be behind the curve with their targets and upward adjustments are forthcoming?  Or, is it time for some of these analysts to turn bearish and downgrade on valuation?  One thing is for sure: this apparent paradox makes for a good \"signal\" to investors in DXCM to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding whether analysts have it right with their sentiment, or have it right with their price target for DexCom Inc.

DexCom replaces Allergan, . Domino's slides in for fashion stock\u00a0 , since, according to index manager S&P Dow Jones Indices, Domino's Pizza \"is more representative of the small-cap market space.\"\u00a0The S&P 500 is  benchmark stock index, and supposedly confers a S&P 500 \"phenomenon\" or \"effect\" on the stocks that it comprises: Once a stock becomes a component of the famous index, its price tends to temporarily rise higher due to the added renown. The stock also gets a lift from being a juicier target for the many index funds that put money in those 500 stocks.Is this significant, even for long-term, buy-and-hold, fundamental investors? And is it enough of a reason to buy new additions like DexCom and Domino's?Image source: Getty Images.In two words: probably not.There have been many studies on the subject over the years. While it's hard to get a general consensus, more than a few seem to reach broadly the same conclusion as the Federal Reserve Bank of New York did in an exhaustive report in 2011:\"[O]ur results indicate that -- after accounting for the firms' extraordinary preinclusion performance -- index inclusion has no permanent effect on value and comovement.\"This stands to reason. Remember, the ; as such, its key requirement is that a stock's\u00a0market capitalization be at least $8.2 billion. It's nearly impossible for a company to swell to that size without having long, deep and (more or less) sustained success in its endeavors. By the time companies like that hit the index, they are already well-known, at least to some degree. Most of us are at least familiar with Domino's, probably the one nationwide brand we identify when we hear the words \"pizza delivery.\" DexCom is less famous, but that's because it's in a niche that generally isn't on the public's radar; in its industry, it has plenty of recognition, and not a little renown.So at the end of the day, graduation to the S&P 500 is more a confirmation of size and success than a sudden blast of recognition. A feather in a cap, as it were. Yes, there might be a bit of a bump when the announcement is initially made; ditto with some rise in index-fund buying (though even the latter isn't a given, because new S&P 500 stocks typically graduate from other, albeit less prestigious, indexes).For the most part, though, we can assume that what made the stock famous or admired or acknowledged has already been baked into the price for the most part. As such, we shouldn't expect a S&P spike.Let's do a quick and cheap piece of research on our own, shall we? Fintech company  won a place on the S&P 500 near the beginning of this year. Let's match its performance from the date of its S&P debut with the movements of four famous and/or admired large-cap stocks that aren't on the hallowed S&P 500 index: data by First of all, notice how Paycom Software didn't see all that much of an initial bump. It tracked right along with  and others. Second, it subsequently sank to the level of worst performer, although not by much. It's well in negative territory compared to the slight dip of , and far underwater when matched against the rising trajectories of  and . There's no S&P spike here.The moral of this story is that, while S&P 500 inclusion can grab the attention of a casual investor, it's probably not reason enough to put money into a stock. Rather, we should consider whether a recognized large-cap stock is right for our investment needs in the first place. If so -- if a Domino's or a DexCom sounds like a business with growth in its future -- we should dig in with some research.One nice thing about the higher visibility on the S&P 500 is that a stock on it will attract plenty of analysis and financial media coverage. The Motley Fool keeps an eye on both  and  (those links are to our dedicated pages on the two stocks). I'm obviously biased; nevertheless, the opinions of our numerous contributors over the years on the pair is a fine place to start.From there, if a stock is still appealing and ripe for investment consideration, take a look at what bank analysts and other pundits are saying about the stock. Read its SEC filings and pore over the numbers; get a sense of its strategy and whether it could realistically grow the company's business. Look at the valuations to determine how it's priced relative to its potential growth.None of this is as simple as just plonking money on a stock once it's announced as a new S&P 500 component. But it provides us with a much better sense of whether it's an investment suited for our needs -- and, most likely, makes us more successful investors in the end.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Not many large-cap  can make that claim right now.\u00a0\u00a0Is DexCom's stock still a strong buy? That's a hard question to answer. DexCom's stock has repeatedly defied conventional wisdom when it comes to classic valuation metrics. As proof, the company's shares have consistently been valued at over 15 times forward-looking sales.DexCom's incredible run, however, may be close to hitting a high-water mark after this latest surge. The stock, after all, is now valued at an astronomical 17.3 times 2021 projected sales. That's an exceedingly rich valuation, even for an ultra high-growth company like DexCom.

Unfortunately, the incidence of the disease (both type 1 and type 2) has been rising around the world. Indeed, many healthcare experts consider diabetes an epidemic in the United States and many other countries.Two top names in the diabetes space are medical-device makers Insulet and DexCom. Insulet makes the leading tubeless insulin pump, the Omnipod, and DexCom produces a\u00a0continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system, the G6.\u00a0In fact, these two companies are partners. In the second half of this year,\u00a0Insulet plans to launch its Horizon automated insulin delivery system, which uses a\u00a0DexCom CGM. Moreover, the Horizon system's insulin pump will be controlled by a smartphone.\u00a0On Tuesday, DexCom reported its , which crushed Wall Street's expectations. Sales rose 44% year over year to $405.1 million, sailing by the\u00a0$357.6 million analyst consensus estimate. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) landed at $0.44, compared to the year-ago period's loss of $0.05 per share. This result demolished the consensus estimate of $0.14.Insulet is scheduled to report first-quarter results on Thursday, May 7, after market close.Image source: Getty Images.Safehold is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that specializes in commercial property (but no retail) ground leases in the 25 largest markets in the U.S.\u00a0It buys\u00a0the land underlying commercial real estate projects, which it leases back to the owners of the structures on the land. The company uses the rental income to grow the business and pay shareholders a modest dividend, currently yielding 1.2%.Safehold was founded in 2016 and\u00a0held its\u00a0\u00a0in 2017, so it's relatively small for a REIT and doesn't have much of a track record.\u00a0That said, it seems worth watching.Like most companies, Safehold expects to have some near-term pain due to the pandemic. By the end of the first quarter, deals were largely on hold across the commercial real estate market. However, management also believes the company should bounce back quickly once the dust settles a bit. Here's what CEO Jay Sugarman had to say during the April 23 first-quarter :We continue to be engaged in conversations with customers on a number of fronts, and would expect our better price, more efficient\u00a0capital to be in demand once there's more clarity about the future. We expect deals put on hold may very well come back, and that\u00a0existing customers will find the opportunities to deploy capital and seek our help in capitalizing those opportunities. ...As for the existing portfolio, all of our ground leases paid [their rent] in April.\u00a0In the first quarter, Safehold's revenue soared 84% year over year to $40.2 million. Net income jumped 56% to $17.4 million, which translated to earnings per share coming in flat with the year-ago period at $0.36.

Now I will turn it over to Kevin.  -- Thank you, Sean, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Let me start by expressing my gratitude for the many healthcare workers and first responders that are supporting all of us at this time. We certainly stand with you in this effort and our thoughts are with you and those who have been impacted by COVID-19. As a quick summary, the first quarter was another very strong quarter for DexCom, continuing the growth momentum that we've delivered for much of the past two years.First-quarter revenue grew to $405 million, representing 44% growth over the first quarter of 2019 or greater than $120 million of absolute dollar growth. This performance was driven by strength in new patient additions in both the U.S. and international businesses, even as we saw some impact to new patient opportunities related to COVID-19 beginning in mid-March. We will address first-quarter performance in a moment.But first and foremost, we wanted to discuss the impact of COVID-19 and DexCom's response. The past few months have brought and likely will continue to bring unprecedented challenges to global health and economic systems as a result of the virus. While this has been an incredibly difficult humanitarian crisis, we have also seen many encouraging examples of collaboration around the world from public and private entities. We have seen people working to bring care to those in need, protect the health of the vulnerable and support the well-being of workers and families.From the outset, we recognize that DexCom has an important role to play. Our customers rely on our CGM technology to safely manage blood glucose and deliver insulin. In many cases, these are people with diabetes who have relied on DexCom CGM since diagnosis, meaning they haven't known a world without the peace of mind of real-time continuous glucose monitoring. People of diabetes are also at heightened risk for complications with COVID-19, highlighting the importance of good glycemic control during these challenging times.We set out with three core priorities: keep our employees safe, continue to serve our patients and work to help our communities. To meet this challenge and support these core priorities, we set in motion several initiatives. We quickly moved the majority of our global employees to home-base work arrangements. This transition enhances safety of all of our employees, including our teams who remain on-site and benefit from a less dense work environment.Our IT and emergency response teams have done an excellent job to enable this shift and provide necessary resources for our teams to continue to function effectively and care for our patients. I could share numerous examples of DexCom teams going above and beyond to ensure that our customers receive product and the support that they need. But I'll share one that stands out to me. In order to ensure that our products were supplied in a timely manner, we had members of our IT teams, who were willing to sleep on-site to meet the needs of our employees and our patients.As this story demonstrates, our employees care deeply for our patients, and we continue to work on new ways to enhance customer support in these unique times. This includes our announcement yesterday of a program to provide financial assistance to our existing patients who have lost or may lose access to insurance coverage for their DexCom supplies as a result of COVID-19. This program, which we plan to launch in the next several weeks, will provide up to two 90-day supply shipments for only $45 each and provide relief to our patients in what is clearly a very challenging time. As it pertains to our customers, both the patient and the clinician, we are working on ways to ensure we have the appropriate infrastructure to support their evolving needs.Our extensive virtual resources for patient and clinician training and customer support are proving to be especially important as the world embraces the increasing use of telemedicine platforms. As a reminder, more than 70% of our historical new patient additions have self-trained using the resources that we provide, demonstrating the value of these resources and the easier use of our CGM systems. Even prior to the global spread of the virus, our procurement and operations teams work to access and mitigate any potential risk to the supply chain for existing products. Because of their effort, we have seen very little disruption with our manufacturing sites as both San Diego and Mesa remain fully operational.Our manufacturing teams have worked seamlessly to make sure that our customers get the CGM systems they rely on. We've implemented additional safety measures to reduce the number of people on-site at any given time. We have implemented shift separations and added additional sanitation and safety measures on top of our existing procedures, including thermal scanning. With the supply chain and manufacturing operations currently in good shape, we continue to be in a strong inventory position to meet the current demand for both existing patients and new patients.We have seen some customer interest in stocking up on the product, but have worked to keep customers supplied in line with the provisions of their insurance providers. This also applies to our DME suppliers and wholesalers. We did not see a material positive impact from customer stocking on our first-quarter sales performance. We have also looked at ways that DexCom could play its part in providing solutions that benefit our communities during the COVID outbreak.When avenues already played out as hospital systems came under increasing pressure and had limited personal protective equipment, we began to feel the number of requests for our G6 sensors. In the ICU, hospital personnel often need to monitor patients with fingersticks as much as every half hour. In response to the request, we worked with the FDA to temporarily allow for the use of G6 in the hospital setting, and we quickly set out to supply product to key regions battling the COVID crisis. Because of our real-time connectivity, our CGM systems allow healthcare providers to remotely monitor a patient's glucose levels in real time, reducing the need for fingersticks.As a result, there are fewer physical interactions between healthcare providers and patients, which limits viral exposure for hospital staff and preserves personal protective equipment. We are already seeing promising evidence of these benefits from the initial sites. Recently, the FDA removed the three-hour delay requirement for CGM data into our CLARITY software, allowing for faster data integration. As we roll this out in the coming weeks, our remote monitoring solutions will be further enhanced in both the hospital setting and for telehealth consultations for people with diabetes.We expect to continue supporting hospitals in areas of the country most impacted by the COVID-19 emergency, although our top priority remains serving our existing patients without interruption. The drastic, but necessary steps to mitigate the spread of the virus have also created some areas of unpredictability for us as we continue in our second quarter and the remainder of 2020. As I briefly noted above, we have seen some impact to new patient opportunities since the broader social distancing measures were put in place in mid-March. We are hopeful that this impact may be mitigated as clinicians enhance their telemedicine capabilities, and our team is certainly working hard to ensure patient access for those who needed DexCom CGM.Quentin will provide more detail around how we have contemplated this uncertainty relative to our 2020 guidance. Another area of unpredictability right now is around the timing of large clinical trials like we need to run for G7. We remain confident in our ability to deliver G7, but acknowledge that the timing of the pivotal trial will be delayed due to the pausing of new trials at most clinical sites. We currently expect a minimum delay of approximately six months for the pivotal trial.This is obviously a challenging time across the globe, but I'm very proud of the way the DexCom teams have responded. I will now turn the call over to Quentin for a review of our financials. -- Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release as well as on our IR website. For the first quarter of 2020, we reported worldwide revenue of $405.1 million compared to $280.5 million for the first quarter of 2019, representing growth of 44% on a reported basis and 45% on a constant currency basis.The growth performance reflects the strength of our new patient additions throughout 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 as we continue to see growing awareness of the value of DexCom CGM for both type 1 and type 2 patients. The U.S. business grew 39% in the first quarter of 2020 over the first quarter of 2019 with strong growth from each channel, durable medical equipment, pharmacy and Medicare. Pharmacy continues to be the fastest-growing channel for us, and realize the strongest sequential uptick in utilization to date as a result of the significant access improvements that our team has driven over the past year.Our international business also put up a great first quarter, growing 63% on a constant currency basis relative to the same quarter in 2019. The $112.8 million in revenues for our international business represents an increase of more than $25 million from our previous quarterly high watermark. Strength was across the board, including both direct and distributor markets. Our first-quarter gross profit was $258.7 million or 63.9% of revenue compared to 60.2% in the first quarter of 2019.The 370 basis point improvement to year-over-year gross margin reflects the focused work of our teams to take cost out of our product design and manufacturing processes. As Kevin mentioned, our procurement team has done a great job of keeping our supply chain functioning, well with little impact to our ability to produce product as well as our product cost thus far. We will continue to monitor this closely as the situation evolves globally. Operating expenses were $215.4 million for Q1 2020 compared to $176.4 million in Q1 2019.This reflects an increase of 22% year-over-year and a nearly 1,000 basis point reduction as a percentage of revenue from the first quarter of 2019. We continue to prioritize key areas of investment, including our efforts to scale G6 manufacturing, progressing toward our goal of doubling capacity again in the first half of this year. We are also continuing our preparation for the scale-up of our G7 manufacturing lines and looking to support our sales growth with increasing direct-to-consumer advertising as greater clarity evolves from the current global situation. Our non-GAAP results exclude some incremental costs that we experienced toward the end of the quarter in both cost of goods sold and operating expenses as a result of COVID-19.As Kevin noted, the safety of our employees remains our No. 1 priority. However, as an essential provider of medical devices, there are certain functions that must be performed on-site despite shelter-in-place orders to ensure continuity of supply. As a result, we are incurring incremental costs to assist our employees and ensure their safety to the greatest extent possible and expect to continue to do so in the near-term as we support our people through this crisis.We expect to continue to incur costs related to our COVID-19 response until macro business conditions return to normal. Operating income was $43.3 million or 10.7% of revenue in the first quarter of 2020 compared to a loss of $7.6 million or negative 2.7% of revenue in the same quarter of 2019. This reflects a year-over-year improvements of nearly 1,300 basis points in operating margin for the quarter. Similarly, adjusted EBITDA margin improved by nearly 1,000 basis points to 19.2% of revenue or $77.8 million for the first quarter of 2020 compared to 9.3% of revenue or $26.1 million for the first quarter of 2019.As our operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margin performance indicate, we are doing a good job managing our expenses and gaining leverage from our strong top line results. Net income for the first quarter was $41.4 million or $0.44 per share. Our balance sheet remains very strong with more than $1.5 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of the first quarter, leaving us in a strong net cash position. The capital structure that we have put in place, along with our improved profitability profile that demonstrates the cash earnings potential of this business, provides us the flexibility to not only navigate the current environment, but also be opportunistic when needed.Our convertible notes are not due until 2022 and 2023, respectively, and are convertible in either cash or stock at our discretion. We have worked hard and are fortunate to be in this position, recognizing that there are many companies that are less fortunate and struggling to support their employees. Therefore, although we are potentially entitled to stimulus funds as a healthcare provider, we have chosen not to accept these funds and hope that they could be allocated to other American businesses and employees who are in greater need. Turning to 2020 guidance.Given the unpredictable current economic and global health environment, we have chosen to temporarily suspend 2020 guidance until we have greater visibility on the outlook. To be clear, this decision does not necessarily imply upside or downside to our prior guidance. Our first-quarter performance was above our expectations. And apart from the uncertainty created by COVID-19, we would be in a position to raise our guidance today.Ultimately, we believe the underlying demand for CGM has not changed despite the situation with COVID-19. In these early days, we have seen the benefits in the shift to telemedicine because DexCom's real-time CGM is connected, it has become one of the primary methods for physicians to monitor their patients and get newly diagnosed patients up and running. Further to this, as Kevin noted, the FDA has recently removed the three-hour delay requirement for our CLARITY system, which will further differentiate DexCom CGM in its remote monitoring capability. In addition, as noted earlier, we've seen the FDA move quickly to enable the use of DexCom CGM in the hospital setting, further increasing demand for our product.On the other hand, as we've seen office visits decline across healthcare, new patient starts could be impacted in Q2 and into the back half of the year depending on how COVID-19 situation plays out. We will also monitor the macroeconomic environment to gauge employment levels and the ultimate impact of our financial assistance program. Further, while our global supply chain has remained stable, it is less predictable in the current environment and could experience interruption. Predicting all of these future variables has been difficult, and we found it prudent to temporarily suspend our guidance until visibility improves.We will continue to monitor the situation closely and keep you updated as things evolve, and we can provide greater clarity. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve for a strategic update. -- Thanks, Quentin. Given our strong financial position and the growing opportunity ahead of us, we continue to press forward with the strategic initiatives that we outlined at the start of the year. As the COVID-19 pandemic has played out, we looked how DexCom could play a role in delivering an impactful solution. Kevin already walked you through the incredible work being done in the hospital setting.Recent data published in the Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology shows the clear need for glucose control in the hospital and cements the reason we are so committed to assisting in this crisis. The study found that the COVID-19 mortality rate for people with diabetes or hyperglycemia, even in nondiabetics, during their stay was more than four times greater than patients without diabetes or hyperglycemia. Even more alarming, for those who had no evidence of diabetes prior to hospitalization who developed hyperglycemia during their stay, 42% died in the hospital. These are sobering statistics and have served as a constant reminder to our team as we work around the clock to assist frontline workers.As we look forward, our commercial team has begun leveraging our extensive data platforms, which should prove especially valuable for patients and clinicians in an environment where telemedicine business are quickly becoming the norm. As an example, an article published last week in Diabetes Technology & Therapeutics showed great results for two newly diagnosed type 1 patients, one a 20-year-old male and another a 12-month-old female, who were given a G6 and treated with telemedicine during the COVID-19 stay at home orders. Using the G6 and our software tools, clinicians at the Barbara Davis Center in Colorado were able to significantly improve the glucose levels of these patients through virtual care. Stepping back, the fundamentals of our business remain sound, and there were several encouraging developments during the first quarter.As our sales growth indicates, the momentum behind our no fingerstick G6 technology continued in the first quarter. And as we have said multiple times before, we continue to believe that there are significantly more people on intensive insulin therapy who stand to benefit from a transition to our real-time CGM. At the end of the first quarter, we have now transitioned a majority of our Medicare base over to G6. As the only Class II iCGM on the market and the lowest cost CGM for the Medicare channel, we look forward to bringing G6 to people both with type 1 and intensively managed type 2 diabetes, who are eligible for Medicare.We are also pleased that UnitedHealthcare recently began coverage for their intensive insulin type 2 patient population. Combined with Medicare, this demonstrates the increasing traction that we are gaining in the type 2 intensive market. In January, we introduced additional data demonstrating the value of DexCom CGM in the type 2 nonintensive market. This includes our direct work with UnitedHealthcare, digital health programs like Welldoc, Onduo and Livongo; and integrated health systems like Intermountain, where our preliminary pilot showed significant savings with the full-time use of DexCom G6 relative to standard of care, self-monitored blood glucose.We are excited to be expanding access to DexCom CGM throughout all of these channels and look forward to sharing additional results as we progress in our type 2 efforts. The opportunity for growth is also extensive when we look outside the U.S., where use of CGM remains far less than that of fingersticks. In February, we obtained regulatory approvals for G6 in Australia, South Korea and Japan and are progressing toward extending the G6 launch to each of these markets later this year. In support of our continued growth, and in particular, the service of our international markets, we recently finalized a decision to develop a third manufacturing site in Malaysia.This will be another significant investment for DexCom and demonstrates our belief in the long-term opportunity ahead of us. We continue to advance the regulatory pathway for use of CGM in pregnancy, attaining CE Mark for wear on the back of the arm, and we removed the pregnancy warning for G6 for use in type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes. Following this approval, we launched G6 in the U.K. for pregnant women with diabetes and are currently working to broaden the clinical evidence to support the use of DexCom CGM for the management of gestational diabetes.Finally, our efforts as a forerunner in interoperability and our support of patient choice and their method of insulin delivery has us well positioned to benefit from multiple commercial systems over the next couple of years, whether through automated insulin delivery or connected smart pens. As you can see, there are many exciting things that the DexCom teams are driving forward, even as we navigate the unprecedented time that we are now experiencing. With that, I'll turn it back to Kevin. -- Thanks, Steve. This has certainly been a challenging season for all of us. I know that there are many that I have met and people on this call that have been personally impacted by COVID-19. And as I mentioned earlier, our thoughts are certainly with you.I've been grateful to see the unified response of so many companies to work toward innovative solutions, including some of the companies that we traditionally compete with. I am also proud of the response of the DexCom team, who have worked selflessly to bring continuity to our business and assurance to our customer base in a time of heightened anxiety. We are pressing forward in 2020 with resilience in the current environment and continue to hope for the opportunity that lies ahead for DexCom. I would now like to open the call up for Q&A.Sean? -- Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, we ask our audience to limit themselves to only one question at this time and then reenter the queue if necessary. Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.Thank you. [Operator instructions] And our first question comes from Robbie Marcus from JP Morgan. Your line is open. -- Thanks and congrats on a great quarter. I have a lot of questions I could ask you about the first-quarter performance. But unfortunately, I'm going to address the elephant in the room with COVID-19. You pulled guidance, but you do have a month of performance here, what's happened in April.I was wondering if you could just walk us through? I don't know if it's Quentin, if you want to take it or how you split it up. But maybe walk us through how we should think about the expectations for 2Q? And how to think about the impact to prescribing in a recovery? How remote telehealth can help or hurt prescriptions of new patients? And how to think about the impact down the P&L as new sales might be disrupted, offset by some of the new venues that you've been able to secure here with testing? -- Robbie, this is Kevin. I'll start. If I gave you a whole much April color, then I'd be giving you guidance, and that's what we just said that we weren't going to do. That being said, we remain very bullish on our business, as you can see by the first-quarter results.And we have learned very much that the impact of the connectivity of our device with telemedicine is becoming very, very well-known by within the physician community. We hosted a webinar last week and had 900 participants sign up. We don't get 900 people to anything here. That was a huge win for us as we talk and learn more about that.So we think particularly with our system where it goes directly to a phone and a directly at CLARITY and physicians can pull CLARITY up wherever they are working, that is a big win for patients. We know that diabetes, and I'll talk about this a little more later, but it's not going to go away. And these patients need to be cared for. We think we solve a very serious problem by getting data to patients and their caregivers in a very timely basis.You heard us also talk about getting CLARITY more toward a real-time platform that could literally give patient the opportunity to call their doctor and say, \"Hey, what's going on with me?\" And caregivers aren't on share follow all the time. A more real-time CLARITY is going to give that caregiver a good answer. So we see a situation where we have a very good answer. We're bullish on the business going forward.Things are just a little different now. I don't know, Quentin, if you want to add a little more to that? -- Yes. No, I think you described it well. I think, Robbie, the thing is coming out of the quarter or over the course of the first quarter, the strength in the core business, the underlying business was incredibly strong. And I think from our perspective, we're as bullish as we've ever been on where we're at in this opportunity, the runway that exists in front of us.And probably even more so now when you think about the long term, just with the hospital opportunity opening probably sooner than what we anticipated. The whole play in telehealth, telemedicine, we know we have a device that works better there than anything else in the marketplace. And folks seem to be understanding that. To Kevin's point, the 900 folks that joined the webinar, it was a webinar specifically directed toward telehealth, telemedicine.So there's a real interest out there. So I think long term, we feel incredibly bullish about where we're at. In April, yes, the new patient starts were down a bit. We noted that coming out of Q1.We have seen it start to rebound a bit in April. I think it continues to build over time. But we need to see that play out and have some certainty there before we can get back to where we feel comfortable providing guidance. There's just too many things that are uncertain at this point in time that we need that greater clarity on.But I would just reiterate, the underlying strength, the fact that folks are recognizing the value of this product and what it means in the marketplace. From a long-term perspective, we're as bullish as we've ever been.And the next question comes from Danielle Antalffy from Leerink. Your line is open. -- Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a really strong quarter.And I guess just a follow-up. And I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about? So I appreciate the commentary point and thank you on new patient adds in April and without coming down, seeing a uptick a little bit. Can you talk a little bit about how new patient adds, patient training, things like that could look post COVID, if we are in a world where telehealth is a more prominent part of patient management, specifically for diabetes? I would think that, that ultimately would favor CGM, but just curious about how you think, if that could change your long-term expectations around penetration in these markets? And maybe a little bit of color of post COVID, what things might look like based on what you're seeing today? And that's my question. -- Danielle, I think we'll tag team this one, too, and I'll start. First of all, as we talked about in our call, 70% of our patients train themselves with the material that we provide. And we've also had remote coaching services through DexCom care to help these patients as well. We've anticipated a day like this with respect to training for a long, long time, which is why we moved away from the model we previously had to whereby we could make this easier and get patients on the system.So we don't see that changing much at all. As far as new patient opportunities and new patients coming in, whereas in the past many times that was a result of an office visit. Now it's coming in possibly through a telemedicine conference with a healthcare provider. They could also be coming in through our direct-to-consumer marketing.Our online efforts are all the things that we have and then we have to turn around and figure out a way to get the proper paperwork from the healthcare provider. One of the other things that's key to remember in Quentin's remarks, he talked about how our move to the pharmacy is accelerating. As we go to the pharmacy, the paperwork requirements for healthcare providers come down significantly, so again making the whole process easier. And that's been our goal from the beginning, to get this process easy enough to whereby we can get the penetration that we thought we could get.And I've said for years that 80% penetration in intensive insulin users for CGM should be our long-term goal, and it still is. And the easier we make it, the faster penetration will go. And those efforts have not changed and won't change as a result of COVID. As far as post COVID world and what I see is demand, I think, if anything, people are going to be more concerned about controlling their diabetes to make sure they're healthy.So if something like this happens again, that will not become a complicating factor because their diabetes is in control, not running rampant. So again, we see this as an opportunity to almost increase retention and increase usage within our current patient base as much as it is to grab new. And so I don't want to sound too opportunistic about this. But we have an answer to a serious problem here, and we think people will come to it.Steve, Quentin, if you have anything more to add. -- You covered it all. -- OK.And our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird. Your line is open. -- Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe moving over to the hospital setting. Kevin, a nice win by getting the CGM G6 into the hospital setting.Wondering what this means maybe longer term? Any discussions with the FDA on whether data you'll collect in these COVID patients could be used to maybe accelerate a broader approval down the road for hospital use? Do you think you'd still have to go through the lengthy pivotal that seem like it might have pushed hospital approval out two to three years from now or one to two years out anyway. Is there a way to accelerate that with some of this data that you'll be collecting here over the next six months with the COVID pandemic? Thank you. -- No. Thank you. We actually have had discussions with the FDA about this very subject. And it is our hope to gather as much data as we can from these patients as they're in this hospital with various compounds being injected and to take care of their help to see how our sensor performs in this environment, how well connectivity is and what we can learn.Our commitment to the agency is with this opportunity, we'll gather as much data as we can, and we're going to share what we learn and see if we can, in fact, accelerate that path and get this device approved for use as a glucose monitoring technology in the hospital environment rather than what they're doing with fingersticks. And as we gather data, we'll take advantage of this opportunity. I think, Jeff, the learnings we've had so far are standing to us as we're into a different channel, with a different physician group, with different caregivers who haven't seen CGM before, with rules and regulations around hospital IT departments and connecting a phone within their security system. We've had learnings that we would have never anticipated.We will be so much more ready to go to this market when it's time. The commitment we've made here from a dollar perspective is large. We put a lot of time and effort, and the hospital team has literally worked around the clock to get this going. And so we'll gather the data.We'll file what we see or at least share what we see and then determine the course of action after that. If we see highly positive results, it's not unthinkable that they would give us an accelerated time frame or cut back on the work that we have to do or possibly change a label to allow us to get there sooner. We're open to all that, and we will look at every one of those opportunities once we're done. But we're really taking this opportunity very seriously.And our next question comes from Matthew O'Brien from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. -- Afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Can we just talk about G7 for a second. I think most people have expected a bit of a delay here, but it's a 14-day trial.So the six-month delay, I think, is a little bit longer than some had expected. So I guess the question would be, what would have to happen for it to be pushed out that entire six months? Or what could happen to where that delay is not necessarily that long? -- I'll start. Again, I'll let the other guys chime in. It's not just a 14-day study. If we could run a 14-day study and put several hundred people on it for 14 days, that would be relatively simple.These trials are not that simplistic. There's going to be at least four in clinic days where blood is drawn for 12 hours, and we can only handle two to three patients at a time at a clinic per day. So these trials are very well orchestrated and scheduled from a logistics perspective. We do not know when clinics who run these trials are going to open back up and allow patients in, to run these kind of studies, nor do we know when patients are going to run and allow themselves to be subjected to this kind of study.So we're putting that time in there knowing there's going to be a while before things get back to normal in these large clinics. And many large clinics where we do these studies aren't even letting patients come in the door now, let alone patients come in for clinical trials. So we've put this time frame on it. How could it, in fact, accelerate? It could accelerate if we found data on the system that would enable us to statistically reduce the size of the trial.But let us, again, remind you, we're not shooting for just anything. We're shooting for iCGM standards, and that is a high bar. That is not an arbitrary bar set by the FDA. That's a high bar.We've met it with G6, and we executed a perfect study to get that done. We've got to execute perfection again. So we've given ourselves this time frame to make sure all our plans are locked down, that we can get the centers open, that can go and do this, and we'll be methodical and thoughtful about it. If there's some way we can accelerate that, we would.But we gave you this because we typically are prudent in our guidance and what we speak and what we think, and that's what we see right now. That's it.And our next question comes from Travis Steed from Bank of America. -- Congratulations on a strong Q1. Just want to get a little more color on the impact of the patient support program and also the mix headwind and I'd assume would happen as patients move from commercial to Medicaid coverage. So any color there of how to think about the headwind for those two programs? -- Yes, Travis, this is Quentin. I think what you're asking is exactly what we struggle with in terms of defining any certainty around what it's going to be. As we continue to see the fallout from an unemployment perspective in the states and even globally, how that ultimately shows up or translates into our numbers, it's hard for us to predict. You take an existing patient who has been paying in line with their program or their plan, they've been on for some period of time, and all of a sudden they fall into the patient assistance program.You're right, there is going to be a mix impact on the business. And I think that's part of the challenge with we're trying to draw the line on exactly where that's going to be. And until we have greater color on where those rates, unemployment rates ultimately fall out and the impacts ultimately fall out to our patient base, it's hard to predict. So that's what leads to putting us in a position where we ultimately feel best at this point, just to pull guidance.Again, we couldn't be more bullish around what's going on inside the business, but we know there's going to be mix impacts and shifts over the next several months. So right now, the visibility is limited.And our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is open. -- Good afternoon, guys. Just wanted to follow up with some more specific question about the hospital. So when we look at the sensors that are going out there, can you give us some sort of information in terms of the data sharing agreements that you guys have with the hospitals trialing this? So what data are you targeting again? What endpoints are the hospitals and yourselves interested in? And are patients consenting to you or the hospital using the data at least on a de-identified basis, so you can get kind of a larger national registry at least? -- Yes. I would say, Margaret, this is Steve. Don't read too much into it at this early stage. This is something that literally the hospital team work 24/7 to get product into the hospital to reduce the risks to caregivers, right? They weren't able to take fingersticks because they'd have to, really, they have to actually change out their PP every time they would have to go pick a finger and they couldn't do it.So right now, we're capturing data. This is all about being able to remotely monitor these patients to help the caregivers in the hospital provide better care. To the extent we have data down the road that we're obviously retaining, we'll look to see what we do with it. But right now, we've not made any plans to do anything specifically with the data, either with a hospital or on an anonymized basis or otherwise. -- We have a couple that are under IRB, but it's not... -- Most of them are... -- Most of them are getting this thing up and running to take care of people right now. But Steve is right, we're continuing to work on that.Our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. -- Good afternoon. Just want to come back to the first quarter a little bit here. And Kevin, you touched on this briefly in your preamble. We think about the effect of stocking and the effect of inpatient use.I'm assuming inpatient use was pretty minimal in the first quarter. But both these positive offsets potentially was stocking several million or tens of millions, and was the inpatient opportunity here recently several million or bigger than that? Just trying to get some sense of the framework of some of those positive drivers here. Thanks so much. -- I'll let Quentin take that. -- David, this is Quentin. Yes. With respect to the inpatient, that was minimal. I mean it didn't move the needle at all.On the stocking side, you're talking several millions, not tens of millions by any stretch at all. It was on the lower end. I think the point that we were making in our prepared remarks was there are several questions out there around whether or not stocking is driving results in the first quarter. And the point is there are several distributors who would have liked to have had the opportunity to stock up ahead of some of the uncertainty that they saw.But frankly, we weren't in the position or we weren't enabling that to take place. We monitor this very closely. We have provisions in our agreements with those distributors that limit amount of days of inventory on hand that they can carry, and so we monitor that. And so while there was an expressed interest to stock to a greater degree, we did not enable that and therefore it was not a driver of the results.And that was the point we're trying to get across.And our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. -- Good evening our afternoon and thanks for taking the question. I'm curious what you have seen either in the month of April or in previous recessions when it comes to attrition. And do patients start going back to traditional fingersticks? And anything you could say because many of us on this call did not cover the stock back in '08/'09 or '01/'02 would be helpful if it's relevant? Thank you. -- Steve, you are the only one here... -- What I would tell you is, no, I mean, we've obviously had a very strong quarter driven by both existing patient base and new patients back. If you remember back in the '08/'09 time frame, we were still on the seven and the seven-plus, which those technologies just weren't really ready for prime time. It really wasn't. If you remember, it wasn't until we launched the Gen-4 platinum in the, I think it was Q4 of 2012 that you really saw the inflection in this business.We really moved to a must-have versus a nice-to-have in terms of our technology. So I don't know that you could possibly make a comparison to back that. I mean back in those days, it was Terry and I just trying to raise money, every opportunity we could to keep the lights on. So it's just a different.It's not even the comparable business at this point. -- About the only thing I could add to that is we have done everything we can to make it easier for our patients to get CGM even during these tough times. In '08/'09, we had 0 Medicaid coverage. We had no Medicare coverage. We had no pharmacy benefit where the co-pay is typically significantly lower than it is through DME, and pricing has been somewhat lower.So I think we've done everything we can to position our business to be more successful during a time like this and to help our patients continue on the therapy. But again, now you have what may be a recession tied to a healthcare event, we may see exactly the opposite. The patients absolutely have to have this to remain healthier, believe that they do. Again, part of the unknowns that we're trying to work through and trying to manage.And our next question comes from Kyle Rose of Canaccord. Your line is open. -- Great. Thank you very much for taking the questions. So I appreciate the additional commentary with respect to the G7 clinical trial. But maybe help us understand what you can do over the course of the next six months from a manufacturing perspective to help accelerate maybe the launch timing? Because if I remember correctly, you're going to get approval before year-end, but the launch wasn't really going to take place until you had capacity, and that was a 2021 event.Maybe help us understand what happens behind the scenes while the trial might not be going and how that might help the eventual commercial pace when it does launch? -- Let's be clear, we never said we'd have approval by year-end, and we said we expected a 2021 launch with a limited launch by the end of 2020, was our goal without meaningful financial impact in 2020, if we had a limited launch. There are things we can do to accelerate those studies possibly. On the manufacturing side, we have similar circumstances to what Quentin described earlier about the core business. We have suppliers that we're not in control of who are rapidly putting equipment together and building things for us.We have orders for this equipment all over the world, waiting for it to come in, to get those lines up and running. We will remain committed to the fact we will not do a full-scale launch of this product until we're ready to go completely. And on top of that, while we wait and sometimes we forget, we have a fantastic product with what we have in G6, and so we will continue to refine and make that better. I don't know, Quentin, if you have any other things we can do on manufacturing? -- No, I think the teams are doing a great job of pushing forward as well as we can, as fast as we can on on G7 and just the automation capability from a production perspective. Clearly, having folks out of the office creates some challenging disruptions in the pace at which you move. But I think overall, we're navigating it quite well. At the same time, our supply chain is one where it's global in nature.We rely on folks from all over the world to help us produce our product. And we've done a great job of managing G6 to date. G7, we've managed through it as well, but there have been situations where you have a temporary impact here and there, and you got to quickly navigate through it to make sure everything stays on track and on time. And to date, we've done that well.But that's some of the uncertainty that starts to get introduced in the environment that we find ourselves navigating through. So to date, we're handling it well, but there's a lot of balls in the air, and we're doing the best that we possibly can. And if we can pull it forward to Kevin's point, we certainly will look at those sorts of things.And our next question comes from Mathew Blackman from Stifel. Your line is open. -- Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. You did mention accelerating pharmacy channel mix. So I'm curious, if you had any feedback from payers, I'm talking particularly about holdout payers that may now be more willing to accommodate pharmacy access for DexCom? And similarly, has there been any impact in the last six weeks or so on the insurance verification process? Is that moving along smoothly? Is it so much to the pace you've seen in the past, faster or slower? Any help there would be appreciated.Thanks. -- Quentin, do you want to go ahead? -- Yes. So I think from a pharmacy perspective, the comments that we made were clear that we've seen the uptick in that pharmacy channel progress at a very rapid pace. And it's one channel that we always thought just has tremendous potential for us, and we've proved that out over the course of the first quarter. As a matter of fact, we talk about new patients being a driver of growth.For the first time, we saw record new patients in the first quarter despite the fact that we saw it slow down in the very back end of the quarter. And I attribute a good part of that to the pharmacy channel. We haven't seen payers or at least I couldn't speak to any particular payers here in the last several weeks who have opened up more incremental pharmacy access, but we have seen payers who are willing to think differently around the requirements that they might have on patients ordering product, such as clinical site visits or coming in to see the clinician. They're allowing that through telehealth now, telemedicine.We see more and more payers who are moving in that direction each and every week. So we are seeing a changing dynamic from a payer perspective. Haven't seen it so much in terms of opening incremental pharmacy access in the last several weeks, but there is an appetite for change here.And our next question comes from Raj Denhoy from Jefferies. Your line is open. -- Hi. Good afternoon. I wonder if I could maybe ask about international a little bit, so the $41 million increase, 60-plus percent was notably strong. And so I'm curious if there was particular markets in which you saw that growth? And as a related question, as we think about Germany, the U.K.being some of the more impacted markets with COVID, what are your thoughts around how those will trend over the next several quarters? -- Yes. Raj, great question. International was clearly a bright spot in the quarter. And really, it was across the entire international region whether it was Europe, Asia, both regions performed incredibly well.Canada was a driver of the overall growth. With the e-commerce platform we put in place there, we couldn't be more happy with the results that we see. I think one of the interesting data points coming out of the quarter, while Germany is a large market for us, continues to have great success. The U.K.also growing quite aggressively, very significantly outpaced most other major markets, which was nice to see. So a lot of runway continue to exist in all of these markets, but really strength across the board, even through Asia and Australia. So there's not one country to really pull out and attribute all the success to. It was performance across the entire slate that led to the overall outcome that we communicated.Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. -- Good afternoon. I hope everyone is healthy. I hate to blow my one question on a yes or no question. But Quentin, I think I just heard you say that you generated record new patients in 1Q.Is that correct? -- Yes. -- So meaning you generated more new patients in 1Q '20 than in any other quarter? -- Yes. Correct. The first quarter of 2020 was a record number of new patients to the company versus any other quarter in history. That's right.And the next question comes from Ryan Blicker from Cowen. Your line is open. -- Thanks for taking my questions. Two reimbursement ones. So subsequent to your NH coverage, is there any quantification you could provide on where commercial payer coverage for intensively managed type 2 patients is in the U.S. today? And then, could you also give us an update on the reimbursement environment in Japan and South Korea as you plan to launch later this year? -- The reimbursement with intensive type 2 is, obviously, most of them are Medicare patients, and we have that covered. After that, it has really been payer by payer. We announced UnitedHealthcare type 2 coverage today. We also have had another large payer expand their type 2 intensive use policy that just hit us today, that will be another win for us.I think a lot of the payers as we go to the pharmacy, have actually included type 2s as we've gone there as well. But it's a gradual thing. It's not going to happen overnight. We keep having wins in our payer team is doing a good job staying on top of that, and we're kind of getting the message out that an insulin user is an insulin user, and they all need access to this.So our type 2 intensive use patient base is growing significantly and becoming a much larger part of our business. -- Yes. I don't have a great update for you, new update for you anyway on Korea. But with respect to Japan, we did get our G6 approval. So that's an approval for consumer use as to a professional use clinician product.We don't currently have reimbursement. So when we launch that product in the consumer channel before the end of this year, it will be a cash pay product. What we've elected not to do is follow a competitor and accept really some part reimbursement based on kind of fingerstick level pricing. We're just not going to go there with that.We're going to do our work, provide the Japanese government with the appropriate data, outcomes data and establish real reimbursement for real-time CGM. So that won't be this year, but we'll give you an update when we have more.And our next question comes from Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim. Your line is open. -- Thanks. Can you quantify at all the impact on new patient starts in April? Just looking for a rough sense for how significant the disruption has been. And then Quentin, I just want to make sure I heard you right that you're already seeing those numbers begin to rebound. That seems a little fast.I'm wondering whether you have any sense for why that is or physicians getting better at telemedicine? It seems like most areas are still pretty locked down. Thanks. -- Yes. We're not going to comment specifically on where it's at. I think there's been a lot of research, a lot of surveys that have been done that we've seen that would indicate new patient starts might be 40% or 50% of what they previously were. We haven't seen it to that extent, but they certainly have been impacted.And to the point I made earlier, we have seen it start to come back a bit. I think folks are just getting comfortable understanding that there's other means of being able to interact with their physician, learn about the product and obviously, get the product on to them. And that's the telehealth, telemedicine capability that continues to develop. I'll point you back to the webinar that we had just two weeks ago.Over 900 physicians dialed into that webinar to learn of the value and ways to introduce CGM through telehealth. I think that speaks to the interest level that's out there. So I think it will continue to build over time. How quickly it goes, it's hard to say, and that's part of why the uncertainty exists and gives us pause on the guidance that's out there and leaving it there.But overall, I think down the road, telehealth, telemedicine is going to play a much bigger part than what we've seen historically.And our next question comes from Steven Lichtman from Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is open. -- Hi, guys. You talked about the strong cash position you're in, which is particularly important during this time. You also mentioned being opportunistic with the cash. Can you provide any color on where that cash can be put to use for growth initiatives beyond the manufacturing expansion? Any other broader thoughts on potential use of cash that you can provide? Thanks. -- You know what? Quentin, you take first stab, then we kind of look at each other. Go ahead. -- Well, I think certainly, the new market opportunities that we've been after for a while now with Dolan and team leading that effort, we've been very clear around hospital. Is there a way to accelerate that? There certainly seems to be an interest level beyond hours now sitting on the other side, whether it's the hospital or the FDA, we want to make sure we're opportunistic and think about that in a way that can accelerate it. I think that there's, potentially in that space, even more than just the device itself, but how do you improve efficiency in the hospital setting. So even from an IT capability perspective, thinking about those sorts of things, you think about gestational diabetes, pregnancy, the whole type 2 non-intensive space, I think that that market remains significant.And I think we're seeing each and every day that there's a validated opportunity in that space, and we want to go fast. So we're keeping our eyes open out there in those spaces around the opportunities that exist. And if there's opportunities to kind of really put the foot on the gas pedal, we're going to look at those sorts of things. So that's what we mean by being opportunistic. -- Yes. I'd just add one more thing as far as cash because I'm the one driving Quentin and his team on this. We talk about doubling manufacturing capacity before the first half of the year is over. We're pushing that, but that's a lot of capital equipment as we go to a lot of G6 automated lines and getting those up and running and get more lines up at our contract manufacturers.We then have a significant capital investment in the G7 equipment that will be coming, and we talked about investing in a third manufacturing site in Malaysia. So there's going to be a lot of capital equipment that we purchased. The other place that we will definitely be using cash as we invest in our business is just on our infrastructure in our systems. If we've learned anything through this, we need to make some more investments on that side, too.Our team has been fantastic with the tools they have when you get in some more tools. So we have a lot of capital use for that money for organic growth as well.And our next question comes from Ravi Misra from Berenberg Capital. Your line is open. -- I hope everyone over there and their families are OK. Just a question about the financial assistance program. You're providing about six months' worth of supply to patients. Can you just help us understand kind of would that be something that would be shipped out immediately if someone signs up? And also, how do we think about it if the economy continues to kind of show these unemployment numbers? How willing is the company to kind of extend these programs for beyond that six-month period? Is there anything that would be gating you to do that? Thank you. -- Well, we'll start with our six-month period. And as we got to that conclusion, as we've modeled that out, we're certainly comfortable with that. We're very comfortable with, again, helping our patient base out. These are the people who have built our company and made it what it is.And as I said in my prepared remarks, the more I traveled before this pandemic, the more I learned, there are a lot of people who have no idea how to manage their diabetes without a CGM. So we will continue to try and get product to patients. We'll evaluate the economic consequences of what we do as we roll this out over time. Three years ago, if we had to do this, it would have been even much more difficult because we had very little Medicaid.And we didn't even have Medicare up and running. Now with Medicare approval and Medicaid, there are some states where these patients have better employed can go to Medicaid programs. But it's very inconsistent and sporadic, even though we have, I want to say, 60% of Medicaid programs cover us, some only covers for kids and some make it very difficult. So we will continue to push for more Medicaid coverage during this time to try and mitigate that, and we'll see how it goes, and we'll keep track.But it's important that we make sure these people can stay on the system, and we think this is a really good opportunity for us. So we will continue to do that.And our last question comes from Chris Cooley from Stephens. Your line is open. -- Thank you. Congrats on the record new patient starts. Just at this point, from my perspective, maybe Quentin, could you help us out a little bit with as we look at the operating expenses trending forward, you alluded to better managing the supply chain, we'd assume you'd keep higher levels of safety stock, have higher costs in the shorter run and appropriately so on the labor side. Just maybe help us when we look at the first quarter, was that reflected in the 1Q results? Or just any way you can maybe help us better understand how we should think about maybe the margin structure as we start to go through the year ex the capacity build-out? And maybe similarly from the DTC effort, what you're looking for there that to kick that up just from change in the COVID-19 situation? -- Yes. I think if you go back to the guidance that we set coming into the year, we spoke about some of the different levers that were in there. And certainly, some of the things that we're going to weigh on the organization being specific to G7 trials, development of the automation lines, ramping G6 as quickly as we can and doubling it, and DTC being a significant investment. I think while we've walked away from guidance on the full year, those sorts of drivers are still going to be in the spend profile and they're going to be more heavily weighted in the back half of the year.So while you're seeing a 1,300 basis point improvement in operating margin in Q1, it's not likely that you're going to see that same sort of improvement in the back half of the year because there's going to be all these incremental investments that we know that we need to make, and that will set the company up for growth far into the future, and we're going to commit ourselves to invest in those ways. So I think you're going to continue to see some good leverage in the first half of the year. I think in the back half of the year, you're going to see the P&L start to look a little bit differently as we make some of these key investments into what I think all of us understand to be critical growth drivers of the future. So I'll leave it at that.The P&L profile will shift a little bit. But overall, we still remain committed to the longer-term goals that we put out there at Analyst Day, just a year and a half ago or so.And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to the speakers for final remarks. -- This is Kevin. I'll finish up today. We want to thank all of you for participating on our call. Assuredly under circumstance is far different from what you'd envision during our 2019 Q4 and year-end call last February.As I watch the news, night in and out, I've seen the toll that this virus is taken on communities all over the world and recognize that when this pandemic ends, our world, human interaction and the administration of healthcare will be forever changed. DexCom is very fortunate to be in a strong position during this pandemic, and I personally feel a sense of obligation to operate from that strength to serve the needs of others in this time of heightened anxiety. With stay-at-home orders and school closures, we realize our employees' day-to-day lives have been appended causing significant stress. We've attempted to reduce that stress by offering increased pay to essential on-site workers and promoting increased safety measures to best protect all DexCom employees.We recognize that diabetes doesn't take a break even for pandemics, economic slowdowns or high unemployment. Now more than ever, we have a responsibility to patients that have supported DexCom over the years and made us the company that we are today. We're therefore working quickly on the rollout of our patient assistance program to provide access to DexCom CGM for the many individuals who have lost their jobs as a result of COVID-19. In addition, we realized helping a patient staying can control their blood glucose, also assist family members and clinicians providing immediate relief to our healthcare system.Our core belief remains unchanged. If we do our best to take care of our patients, the business will always move in the right direction. Every intensive insulin-using patient should have access to real-time CGM. We'll work tirelessly to make that happen.COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact on the diabetes community. This awful virus is also attacking the pancreas of people without diabetes. As a result, brave frontline responders are having to repeatedly gown up with full PPE to administer fingersticks to test patient's blood glucose levels. We worked hard with the FDA to provide these heroes with better tools to treat patients and reduce healthcare workers' overall risk infection.How our employees have rallied to this cause has been nothing short of amazing. In short order, we've created new training materials, stood up a specialized technical support group, procured and configured thousands of cellphones for use in this environment at a cost in excess of $1 million, and developed a separate commercial structure to launch G6 in this market at significantly reduced prices. We are making a significant investment here. Our commitment to connectivity, enable multiple platforms to consume our data and cloud-based tools for healthcare providers has become even more important than we envision when we blaze this trail many, many years ago.As the work from the team at the Barbara Davis Center in Colorado indicates, the unique features of our CGM and connected software solutions are playing an important role in driving care from newly diagnosed people with diabetes during this crisis. We are hopeful that the expanded use of telemedicine during the crisis can ultimately provide avenues for greater access to healthcare over the long-term with DexCom CGM providing an essential tool in the process.\u00a0In addition, our efforts to assist hospitals worldwide is a big investment, as I said earlier. We intend to take all of the data that we can gather, generated during this time, to accelerate the development and launch of a hospital-based system that better meets the needs of healthcare providers in our current ambulatory product. It's often during difficult times that the two character of an individual or company is revealed.Our hope is that our efforts during this time will provide comfort to the many stakeholders that we serve and that our character of DexCom will stand out brightly. On behalf of our employees, I'm proud to lead these efforts. Thanks.

Here's why investors can't get enough of these stocks.Image source: Getty Images.Abbott Laboratories is a broadly diversified healthcare company that has been in the news a lot recently. It recently launched three diagnostic tests for COVID-19, including a\u00a0molecular test that can tell whether you have COVID-19 in . The company is ramping up production of these tests, and \u00a0announced that it's \u00a0in its parking lots as part of the innovative system.Abbott's rapid innovation in response to COVID-19 is wonderful -- but it's only a tiny part of its overall business. The company is a big player in numerous healthcare markets, including pharmaceuticals,\u00a0diagnostics,\u00a0nutritional offerings, and products to help with cardiovascular issues.Abbott's recently announced first-quarter results looked good. Revenue jumped 2.5% to $7.7 billion, and adjusted net income rose 3% to $0.65 per share. The nutrition division was the star of the show, posting growth of 7.3%, likely in response to people stocking up in response to shelter-in-place orders. While these figures were below , they exceeded Wall Street's estimates on both fronts.Management decided to withdraw its original guidance for the full year, which makes sense, but the company's broadly diversified portfolio should help it easily handle the crisis. The company should also be able to continue its 47-year streak of boosting its , which will be music to  ears.Diabetes is a massive health problem. More than 34 million Americans have diabetes, and another 88 million Americans are at risk of developing it. The numbers only skyrocket from there when you zoom out to include the rest of the world.Treating diabetes requires blood glucose monitoring, which has historically required a blood sample obtained from a finger prick. More than a decade ago, Dexcom launched a wearable sensor that continuously monitors glucose levels, which is helpful because readings can fluctuate wildly throughout the day.\u00a0Dexcom's system has been a massive success. Revenue has grown by more than 3,680% over the last decade to reach $1.47 billion last year.\u00a0This amazing growth propelled Dexcom's stock to new heights all along the way, which made the company one of the best-performing healthcare stocks you could have owned .\u00a0Dexcom expects to grow its top line by at least 17% in 2020, and it has  that should prove popular with the diabetes community. Wall Street clearly believes in this company's potential, which is why\u00a0shares are (once again) trading at a fresh all-time high.\u00a0The odds are good that you've never heard of MarketAxess. The company specializes in electronic fixed-income trading at the institutional level, so it's not one most consumers come into contact with.Believe it or not, electronic fixed-income trading -- buying and selling fixed-income securities such as Treasuries or bonds over the Internet -- has\u00a0 not been widely adopted. On an average day, more than $67 billion worth of fixed-income securities trade hands.\u00a0Last year, electronic fixed-income platforms only processed about $8 billion worth of trades per day. The remainder take place via one-on-one phone calls or by email, both of which are slow, illiquid, and inefficient. With a penetration rate of less than 12%, there's lots of market share left for MarketAxess to grab. MarketAxess is already producing jaw-dropping financial results at its current market share; it cranked out a stunning 47% operating margin in the fourth quarter of 2019. The company's balance sheet is in tip-top shape, too, boasting $500 million in cash and investments and no long-term debt. MarketAxess is so obscenely profitable that it can easily afford to make the occasional acquisition, buy back stock, and pay a growing dividend all at the same time. Trading activity tends to pick up when markets go haywire, so it wasn't surprising to see that MarketAxess reported a 50% year-over-year increase in credit trading volume in March.\u00a0That sets the stage for this company to have a  prosperous 2020. Combine the current environment with the company's\u00a0, and it's no surprise to see traders bidding up shares of this amazing  to new heights.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

What's more, the social distancing measures being used to control the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have badly damaged the global economy and global supply chains and have put a number of industries, such as airlines, brick-and-mortar retailers, and sit-down restaurants, in a serious financial bind.\u00a0The good news is that this pandemic will eventually end. Several pharmaceutical companies are trialing a variety of novel therapeutics that could shorten the clinical course of the disease and perhaps lessen its severity in acute cases, leading to fewer fatalities. Moreover, numerous vaccine candidates are under development, some of which could be available for widespread use as soon as mid-2021.Image source: Getty Images.So from an investing perspective, this coronavirus-induced correction should ultimately play out like nearly all other bear markets throughout history. Specifically, bear markets have rarely persisted for periods longer than two years, and most fade away in about 14 months. What this means is that investors willing to buy high-quality equities and hold them for at least five years should come out of this chaotic period in outstanding shape, financially speaking.Which investing vehicles are the best buys right now? Here's a breakdown of 30 of the most attractively priced exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and individual stocks in the market today.One of the easiest and best ways to invest is by buying ETFs that sport low expense ratios. By doing so, you can gain broad exposure to specific economic sectors, without the hassle of buying dozens of individual stocks. While there are literally hundreds of ETFs to choose from, the\u00a0 , the  , and the\u00a0  are three of the most highly regarded among passive fund enthusiasts -- and for good reason.Image source: Getty Images.The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF sports an expense ratio of 0.47%, which is reasonable for a top-performing fund. This fund enables investors to take advantage of the red-hot growth in the biotech industry, without the stomach-churning volatility that comes with owning individual biotech stocks. Before this downturn, the\u00a0iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF was up by more than 300% over the past 10 years. That's well above the returns on capital generated by the major U.S. stock indices during the same period.\u00a0The Vanguard Consumer Staples Index Fund\u00a0comes with both an ultra-low expense ratio of 0.10% and a noteworthy dividend yield of 2.76%. This fund is composed of numerous defensively oriented blue-chip equities that track the MSCI US Investable Market Index. While the\u00a0Vanguard Consumer Staples Index Fund underperformed the broader markets during the prior decade, it has also lost significantly less of its value during the current sell-off. Thus, this fund is a great way to collect a healthy dividend and conserve capital in an uncertain market environment.The Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund is a true gem in the ETF universe. This  ETF sports an expense ratio of just 0.10% and an annualized yield of 1.4%, and it generated market-crushing returns for investors over the past 10-year period. What's more, the Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund has so far held up better than every major stock index in 2020.\u00a0\u00a0Blue chips are companies with sound balance sheets, proven economic moats, and healthy free cash flows. They frequently make the esteemed list of Dividend Aristocrats, a select group of companies that have increased their dividends for a minimum of . As a result, these top-shelf equities and highly coveted passive income generators tend to weather economic downturns fairly well. Here are 12 blue chips worth buying right now.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images. is a medical device and molecular diagnostic company. The company has raised its dividend for 48 straight years, easily making it a Dividend Aristocrat. Although Abbott's shares are  from the perspective of a forward-looking price-to-earnings ratio, the company could benefit enormously from its recently approved COVID-19 molecular diagnostic tests. At a minimum, Abbott should remain an outstanding passive income vehicle, and it should continue to be generally immune to this marketwide downturn because of its top-notch portfolio of essential healthcare products.\u00a0 is one of the largest and most visible tech companies in the world today. Even so, the company's shares have been hit hard this year by the COVID-19 pandemic. That's not surprising in the least, given that Apple has already  that it will miss Wall Street's financial targets in 2020. This sizable downturn, though, should prove to be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to pick up some shares of the tech giant on the cheap. Apple currently offers a modest yield of 1.26%, and Wall Street has the company's average 12-month price target at $310.90 per share. That amounts to a healthy 28.7% upside potential.\u00a0 has turned into a juggernaut following its acquisition of Celgene. The company is currently trading at under 3 times forward-looking sales, it offers an above-average dividend yield of 3.26%, and it sports  such as Opdivo, Revlimid, and Eliquis. Although nothing is guaranteed in the stock market, Bristol stands a great chance of generating market-beating returns for investors over the next five to 10 years.\u00a0 is an oil and gas megagiant. Nonetheless, the company's shares have gotten pounded into the dirt this year in response to the ongoing oil war between Russia and OPEC, which has caused crude oil prices to plummet into the low $20s. On the bright side, Chevron has been \u00a0to protect its highly coveted dividend. Now, Chevron may have to rethink its dividend policy if crude oil prices don't rebound fairly soon. The company's yield, after all, currently stands at a jaw-dropping 6.78%. The bigger picture, though, is that Chevron should eventually rebound and should continue to pay a respectable dividend over the long haul.\u00a0 \u00a0 is a titan of the financial-services sector. The bank's shares, however, have lost almost 40% of their value since the start of 2020 over concerns about falling , along with the potential for a prolonged recession sparked by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While JPMorgan's stock may continue to slump in the coming weeks as the public health crisis deepens, investors should gladly catch this falling knife. JPMorgan has almost $900 billion in cash, it offers a dividend yield of 4.11%, and it's an American institution in many ways. There is no plausible scenario where this top bank stock doesn't recover within the next five years.\u00a0 is a diversified healthcare behemoth. And the company's Dividend Aristocrat status is well earned thanks to its track record of raising its dividend for nearly 58 straight years. Moreover, J&J is one of only two publicly traded companies with a Standard & Poor's AAA credit rating. J&J's dividend yield isn't exactly anything to write home about, at 2.85%. But the company has a long history of beating the broader markets in terms of total returns on capital , when including its dividend. J&J, in turn, arguably deserves a spot in any type of portfolio.\u00a0\u00a0 is the\u00a0quintessential American fast-food restaurant. While the company's top-line has been struggling of late because of the influx of numerous competitors and a shift in American eating habits in general, McDonald's was still forecast to see a nice bump in revenue next year before this pandemic took hold. The company's  in delivery services and new technologies such as self-serve kiosks was expected to be a big boon to its business in 2021 and beyond. Still, McDonald's is a Dividend Aristocrat, it offers a respectable yield of 3.1% at current levels, and it has a decent cash reserve. McDonald's stock is therefore one of the safest passive income plays in this turbulent market right now.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0started off the year on a sour note but has since found its footing as investors flocked to its top-notch dividend yield of 4.62%, strong balance sheet, and above-average near-term outlook. The big draw with this pharma titan is its portfolio of high-growth  that includes products such as\u00a0Vyndaqel, Ibrance, and Xeljanz, combined with the upcoming spinoff of its legacy products business slated for later this year. The bottom line is that Pfizer's days as being one of the worst components of the Dow Jones appear to be drawing to a close.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 had a historically bad first quarter because of the  of the coronavirus on restaurant traffic, major sporting events, and large public entertainment events in general. Even now, though,\u00a0Coca-Cola's stock is anything but cheap, for a variety of reasons. In short, Coca-Cola has been a tremendous cash cow for several generations, and its dividend is a big draw for income investors. At present, Coca-Cola's shares yield a juicy 3.73%, which is well above average for a consumer-staples play. So even though the company's first- and second-quarter earnings are probably going to be downright terrible, this is one blue-chip stock that every investor should want to scoop up on this pullback.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 has been a rare  in this dour market. Investors have piled in to Clorox this year, presumably in anticipation of a spike in demand for disinfectants such as Clorox bleach. In 2020, the company's shares have gained a healthy 15.6% because of its tie-in to the coronavirus. The bad news is that Clorox's shares are now trading at close to 28 times earnings, making it one of the most expensive blue-chip stocks on this list. That said, its dividend yield still stands at an attractive 2.36%, and it should remain a red-hot equity as long as the coronavirus maintains a virtual monopoly on the news cycle.\u00a0 is a downright steal at these levels. After a dreadful , the company's shares are now bumping up against their five-year low and sport a modest dividend yield of 1.81%. Now, the harsh truth is that Disney's theme parks are going to be costly to maintain during the lockdown, and there will be a sharp decline in box office revenue for a good chunk of 2020. That can't be helped in a global pandemic. But Disney is a proven long-term winner because of its outstanding studio entertainment properties such as the  and \u00a0franchises, among many, many others. Bottom line: Disney's stock is almost certainly going to continue to head lower in the weeks ahead, but long-term investors should take definitely advantage of this weakness. This blue-chip stock, after all, will probably post a stunning reversal once this pandemic peters out.\u00a0 is a telecom giant. The company's shares have fallen by around 11% this year, but that's not too bad considering how poorly the broader markets have performed so far in 2020. Investors seem to be sticking with Verizon in the wake of this downturn because of the company's outstanding dividend yield of 4.45%, leadership in the area of 5G technology, and partnership with Disney revolving around the Disney+ streaming service. Verizon does have one of the weaker balance sheets on this list, and it is facing an increasing amount of competition. But the big picture is that Verizon's shares are simply too cheap at 11.7 times earnings, especially for a company that offers a reliable, above-average dividend.\u00a0Megacap companies, or companies with market caps of at least $200 billion, are rarely coveted for their growth prospects. Instead, these towering figures of industry are usually viewed as top-notch passive income vehicles, or capital preservation plays. These two e-commerce titans absolutely demolish this stereotype.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images. has been a big winner since its IPO in 2014. The Chinese e-commerce, cloud computing, digital media, and mobile payment megagiant, however, will probably only continue to surge higher in the months and years ahead. The core reason is that Alibaba has invested heavily in new technologies to remain at the cutting edge of its most lucrative markets. Equally as important, China's cloud computing market is expected to see  over the next decade. Alibaba is thus well positioned to deliver market-beating returns for the foreseeable future, despite its monstrous market cap of $510 billion.\u00a0\u00a0has transformed scores of its early shareholders into multimillionaires. Amazon Prime, with its free shipping and online entertainment component, has now attracted over , and the company has built out a first-class data management business known as Amazon Web Services. Amazon, in effect, has weaved its way into the heart of American life. So even though the company's market cap stands at a jaw-dropping $949 billion, its stock should still produce healthy gains over the next decade, thanks to its loyal customer base and highly profitable Web services segment.\u00a0Like their megacap counterparts, large-cap equities, defined as companies with market caps of $10 billion or more, tend to attract conservative-minded investors or those seeking a safe dividend. However, these three large-cap stocks are unique in that they are best viewed as top-notch growth stocks.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images. is a rare-disease drugmaker with multiple products on the market. So far this year, BioMarin's shares have essentially traded sideways, down 0.4%. The company has been able to swim against the current during this pandemic because many of its patients simply cannot forgo treatment without dire consequences. In addition, BioMarin is closing in on two major regulatory decisions for its next set of product candidates. The main attraction here is that BioMarin's top line could realistically double within five years, and it operates within one of the few segments of the economy that should be basically immune to the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0 is a medical-device company that specializes in diabetes. The company's shares have gained a stately 19% in 2020, thanks to the breakout success of its\u00a0G6 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. Although DexCom's shares are some of the most expensive within the healthcare sector right now, the company's rich valuation shouldn't scare you away. There are close to half a million adults living with diabetes worldwide, and this number is expected to rise markedly over the next decade. DexCom's CGM franchise is poised to play a critical role in the fight against this raging pandemic, which should translate into some truly eye-catching revenue figures.\u00a0\u00a0 is the undisputed king of Latin American e-commerce. Even so, the company's shares were  last month by the COVID-19 panic. COVID-19 has only recently started to have a major impact in Latin America, and the good news is that it shouldn't have any long-term consequences on MercadoLibre's e-commerce business. Now, the company's near-term sales might take a sizable hit as Latin America enforces shelter-in-place mandates. But this barrier to economic activity won't last forever. Thus, bargain hunters may want to pounce on this beaten-down e-commerce play soon.\u00a0Investors often overlook mid-cap stocks, or companies with market caps ranging from $2 billion to $10 billion. But they shouldn't. Mid-cap stocks often offer a compelling mix of healthy growth and safety. In fact, mid-cap equities have consistently been some of the best growth vehicles in the entire market for the better part of the past decade. With this theme in mind, here are three mid-cap healthcare stocks that should be outstanding bargains at current levels.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images. is a mid-cap biopharma focused on the development of drugs for non-viral liver diseases. The company's shares have lost over half their value this year because of a regulatory delay for its non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) drug candidate, Ocaliva. Specifically, Ocaliva's\u00a0advisory committee meeting was moved from  of this year as a result of COVID-19. Intercept's shares, in turn, might be one of the best bargains in the entire market right now. While Ocaliva isn't a surefire slam dunk to become the first drug ever approved for NASH, the fact is that it would easily rack up sales in the $2 billion to $3 billion range if it does cross this key regulatory hurdle. The big deal is that Intercept's market cap is currently hovering right around a mere $2 billion at the time of writing. As such, there's a real shot that Intercept's shares could double, or even triple, in value by this time next year.\u00a0\u00a0 is a rare-disease and gene therapy company with a virtual monopoly on treatments for the muscle-wasting disorder known as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The company's stock has traded in lockstep with the broader markets this year presumably because of its formerly rich valuation. What's important to understand is that Sarepta's shares are quite possibly trading at less than 0.5 times 2026 sales. There are a lot of moving parts that could drastically change this outlook, but the bottom line is that Sarepta's stock is dirt cheap at these levels. Despite multiple would-be competitors in DMD, after all, Sarepta is still the only game in town for the most part.\u00a0is another high-growth diabetes play, thanks to its outsize portion of the insulin pump market. The company's shares have been on fire over the  because of the rapid growth of its market share in the insulin pump space. And in 2020, Tandem's share have even been able to eke out a modest gain of about 3%, which arguably reflects the strong demand for its\u00a0insulin pumps for individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Wall Street's current consensus price target implies that Tandem's shares could rise by another 44.9% over the next 12 months. With the diabetes market growing by leaps and bounds, this rosy outlook doesn't seem to be unreasonable in the least.\u00a0Small-cap growth stocks are typically the first group of equities to lose favor in a crisis. These stocks are generally riskier than mid- and large-cap equities. As the market derisks, though, some small-cap stocks become outstanding bargains by default. The following three names fit that description to a T.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images. is an orphan-drug maker that sells Firdpase, an FDA-approved drug for treating Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). Firdapse is competing with another recently approved LEMS medication, but this drug has yet to take a meaningful share of the market. In fact, there are several  to think that this rival LEMS drug never will morph into a serious competitive threat. Nonetheless, the market has treated Catalyst's shares as if Firdapse's sales are set to collapse. Underscoring this point, Catalyst's stock is trading at an absurd 1.87 times 2021 projected sales. While this small-cap biopharma does have an elevated risk profile, the market is arguably taking it way too far with this rock-bottom valuation. Catalyst, in fact, should eventually shake off this key overhang to go on to become a top growth stock within the next 12 to 18 months.\u00a0 \u00a0 is a pre-revenue vaccine company. The biotech's shares have gained almost 300% this year because of a successful top-line readout for its experimental flu vaccine, dubbed NanoFlu, combined with its entrance into the race to develop a vaccine for COVID-19. Novavax is gearing up to submit NanoFlu's regulatory application to the FDA for review, meaning it might be available for next year's flu season. Estimates vary wildly, but the current consensus has NanoFlu generating around $740 million in peak sales. That's quite a potential haul for a company with a market cap of $801 million. So if NanoFlu does indeed gain the FDA's blessing, Novavax's stock should . The main risk factor associated with this biotech stock is that the FDA may request additional clinical data before approval, which certainly isn't out of the realm of possibility.\u00a0\u00a0 is a\u00a0vacation ownership and exchange company. The company's shares have lost over 63% of their value this year, thanks to the impact of COVID-19 on the leisure travel industry. Wyndham, for its part, recently pulled its financial guidance and suspended share buybacks because of the uncertain outlook for the industry as a result of this deadly respiratory ailment. The bad news is that Wyndham's stock probably hasn't hit rock bottom quite yet. In fact, it's unlikely that demand for leisurely travel lodging will rebound in 2020. But if you're willing to hold this stock for a full five years, it should pay off handsomely after these enormous declines. Wyndham's underlying business model is still a big hit, after all. We just need to get back to the point where tourism -- especially international tourism -- is a thing again.\u00a0Home-run stocks are equities that are seemingly grossly mispriced relative to their long-term value proposition. These types of high-risk, high-reward stocks should never make up an outsize portion of a portfolio, but they are sometimes worth owning in small doses. The following home-run stocks offer investors an attractive risk-to-reward profile, especially after their rough start to 2020.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images. is a medical and recreational cannabis company that operates out of\u00a0Smiths Falls, Ontario. Canopy is worth checking out because it's reasonably well capitalized and a leader in terms of cannabis production, product diversity, and annual sales, and it underwent a recent managerial turnover that should lead to a more cost-conscious approach to value creation. Now, this legal marijuana company definitely won't be a big winner for shareholders anytime soon because of the various headwinds facing the industry as a whole. But Canopy's stock might produce stellar gains for investors willing to hold for at least 10 years. Eventually the  will come into its own as a highly lucrative commercial space, a fact that bodes well for leaders in the industry like Canopy.\u00a0 is among the world's best known airlines. Unfortunately, the company's shares have gotten blasted this year by the  in air travel stemming from the COVID-19 crisis. In fact, Delta's shares are down by an eye-popping 64% from their 52-week highs right now. The bad news is that Delta's stock is surely in for more pain in the weeks ahead. That's an unavoidable outcome, with demand for commercial air travel hitting all-time lows. Like some of the other names on this list, however, Delta's shares should sharply rebound post-pandemic.\u00a0 is a leader in the race to make space tourism a viable industry. Virgin Galactic's shares have slid by almost 15% this year in response to the possibility of a recession and, hence, lower demand for space tourism. But this sell-off might be a perfect opportunity to buy shares.

The  has given back most of its gains during the Donald Trump presidency, and scores of blue-chip equities are now trading at multiyear lows as a result. Despite this historic marketwide drop in stock prices, however, most equities still aren't worth buying right now. The unfortunate truth is that the pandemic is probably several weeks away from hitting a peak in the United States, making it virtually impossible to open up the broader economy. So with little to no economic activity on the near-term horizon, stock prices are bound to print lower lows as this public health crisis deepens during the month of April.But there are a few bright spots in this dour market. Companies that produce products essential to daily life, such as medical devices and pharmaceuticals, should eventually separate themselves from the pack. Keeping with this theme, the diabetes medical device specialist\u00a0  and the pharmaceutical titan   are both trading at once-in-a-lifetime prices right now. Here's why investors may want to add these two top  to their portfolios soon.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images.DexCom is a medical device specialist focused on battling another global pandemic: diabetes. There are an estimated 463 million adults living with diabetes at the moment. What's more, the adult diabetic population is forecast to grow at an alarming rate during the current decade, thanks to the global rise in obesity and sedentary lifestyles.DexCom, for its part, is pitching in to help in the fight against diabetes with its game-changing\u00a0G6 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. By allowing patients to carefully monitor their glucose levels, this device should ultimately have a significant impact on the prevalence of diabetes-related complications such as nerve degeneration, cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, and blindness.And so far, the G6 CGM is a smashing commercial success. Driving this point home, DexCom's annual revenue rose by an astonishing 43% year over year in 2019 to a whopping $1.47 billion, due in no small part to the enormous demand for the G6 CGM system. Moreover, the company expects this upward trend to continue in 2020, with annual sales forecast to increase to $1.72 billion to $1.74 billion for the full year.\u00a0With such a strong near-term outlook, it's no surprise that DexCom's shares have bucked the broader  in 2020 by gaining 20.2% so far this year. Still, the medical device giant's shares remain well off their 52-week highs.Now, DexCom is facing some  in the CGM market, and its shares are trading in the area of 12 times next year's projected sales right now. These two issues are important risk factors that investors shouldn't simply brush aside. That said, DexCom is a proven innovator, its target market is massive and growing, and the company has a long way to go before its G6 CGM system hits a commercial peak. As such, it might be a smart idea to buy this medical device stock while its shares are still down by a healthy 13% from their 52-week high.Big pharma titan Pfizer has had a dismal year. The company's shares have shed over 20% of their value and are now trading close to their five-year low as a result. Apart from the coronavirus-induced sell-off, Pfizer's shares have also suffered from a lack of confidence among investors and Wall Street analysts alike.The main reason is Pfizer's plan to spin off its generic-drug business Upjohn and pair it with  to form a new entity called Viatris. As this move will slash the company's annual revenues by a significant amount, investors appear to be concerned about the sustainability of Pfizer's top-notch dividend (current yield of 4.79%), along with its prospects as a growth-oriented branded drug company.\u00a0All of these concerns, however, are likely way overblown. First off, current Pfizer shareholders will own a piece of Viatris. That's important because the  of Pfizer and Viatris should at least equal -- and quite possibly exceed -- the company's present annualized payout.Secondly, Pfizer has laid out a strong case explaining why its five core growth products, consisting of\u00a0Vyndaqel, Ibrance, Xeljanz, Eliquis, and Prevnar, should deliver no less than 6% top-line growth per year for the next five years. What's more, Pfizer also sports one of the deepest and most robust clinical pipelines in the industry. So this initial 6% top-line growth target will likely turn out to be a conservative estimate.\u00a0Bottom line: Pfizer's stock has gotten slammed for no good reason in 2020. So once this viral pandemic fades into the background, this top value and income play should come roaring back.\u00a0When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

I think medical device stocks will continue to beat the overall market throughout this decade.But which stocks are the best picks? If you have $5,000 to invest (or even less), here are three great medical device stocks to buy right now.\u00a0\u00a0Image source: Getty Images.  stock has rebounded stronger than most stocks have in recent days. It definitely helped that the company  to launch the fastest\u00a0molecular point-of-care test for diagnosing novel coronavirus disease COVID-19. I fully expect this new test, which will run on the already-popular ID NOW testing platform, will be an enormous winner for Abbott.But as difficult as the challenges are right now, the COVID-19 crisis will only be temporary. Abbott's primary growth drivers lie in addressing health issues that won't go away.Wall Street analysts project that Abbott will increase its earnings by more than 10% on average annually over the next five years. One key to achieving that growth is the company's successful continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system Freestyle Libre. Abbott hopes to soon win FDA clearance for a new version of the device that should pave the way for an even greater market opportunity.In addition to its strong growth prospects, Abbott reigns as one of the more attractive  around. The company has increased its dividend for 48 consecutive years and has paid a dividend for a remarkable 384 consecutive quarters. That's 96 years of steady dividends. Abbott's dividend currently yields around 1.8%.'s  shares have also made a solid comeback. Although the company doesn't have any products that can be used in the fight against COVID-19, it does have one important thing in common with Abbott Labs.Like Abbott, DexCom markets a super-successful CGM device. DexCom's G6 has become one of the most popular tools for individuals with diabetes to monitor and manage their condition. The G6 is the first FDA-approved integrated CGM that's interoperable with other medical devices such as insulin pumps.DexCom has an even more promising product on the way. CEO Kevin Sayer  in February that the G7 CGM, which will be less expensive and smaller than the G6, should be \"the biggest product launch in DexCom's history.\" The company expects to launch the new device in 2021.Analysts think that DexCom will grow its earnings by an average of nearly 55% annually over the next five years. That kind of growth doesn't seem farfetched considering the likely market opportunity for the company's G7 device.\u00a0  stock took a bigger beating during the coronavirus market sell-off than either Abbott or DexCom. That's not surprising considering that ShockWave is smaller and not yet profitable. But like the larger medical device makers, ShockWave's share price has bounced back in a major way even though it's still down year to date.The company took an old idea and applied it in an innovative new way. Lithotripsy has been used for decades as a way to break up calcium in kidney stones using sound waves. ShockWave uses intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) to crack calcium in arteries.This IVL approach reduces some of the major risks associated with current therapies for treating atherosclerosis. For example, balloons and surgery can cause perforations to blood vessels and tissue damage. IVL's sound waves expand blood vessels under low pressure, lowering the risk of perforation and minimizing the chances of harming soft tissue.ShockWave estimates that its market opportunity tops $6 billion annually. The company should generate around $75 million in revenue this year. It's not surprising that Wall Street analysts project tremendous growth for ShockWave over the next few years.\u00a0When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The   -- which is an  that holds positions in 56 medical-device companies -- is trading\u00a0 slightly today.Novocure,\u00a0Insulet, and\u00a0Dexcom have been walloped over the past month. Even including today's bumps, all three of these stocks are still down more than 30% from their February highs.\u00a0The good news for investors is that all three of the companies are still firmly in high-growth mode.Novocure, which makes a medical device that's primarily used to treat\u00a0, reported sales growth of 42% in 2019 to $351 million. That strong growth helped to shrink the company's net loss by almost 90% to just $7 million for the full year. With several clinical trials underway that could\u00a0, Novocure could remain in expansion mode for years to come.Insulet, which markets a  that's used to treat diabetes, also had a banner 2019. Sales grew 31% to $738 million, and the company produced net income of $11.6 million. Management is targeting $1 billion in revenue by 2021 and a \"mid-teens operating margin.\" If these numbers are achievable, then Insulet's profitability is poised to  expand over the next few years.Dexcom, which makes a  that's used by people with diabetes, grew its top line 43% in 2019 to $1.48 billion. Dexcom also recently crossed into the black, posting $100 million in profit for the full year. Management expects growth to slow in 2020 but is still targeting top-line growth between 17% and 20%. That's quite impressive, given this company's size.Valuing high-growth companies is tricky when times are good but nearly impossible when volatility is high. That makes it likely that all three of these businesses are going to continue to experience huge share-price swings based on the latest\u00a0COVID-19 news of the day.Longer term, all three of these\u00a0industry disruptors continue to look poised for more market-beating growth.\u00a0When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Here are the highlights from DexCom's Q1 update.Image source: DexCom.DexCom announced first-quarter revenue of $405.1 million, an impressive 44% year-over-year jump. This result trounced the average analysts' Q1 revenue estimate of $357.6 million.The company generated net income in the first quarter of $19.9 million, or $0.21 per share, based on generally accepted accounting principles (). This was a huge improvement from the prior-year period when DexCom posted a net loss of $26.9 million, or $0.30 per share.Wall Street focuses more on adjusted non-GAAP earnings. DexCom didn't disappoint on that score, either, reporting Q1 adjusted earnings of $41.4 million, or $0.44 per share. This represented a stark contrast from the company's adjusted net loss of $4.6 million, or $0.05 per share, recorded in the same quarter of 2019. It also blew away the consensus analysts' adjusted earnings estimate of $0.14 per share.DexCom CEO Kevin Sayer aptly summed up his company's strong Q1 performance by stating the continued momentum was \"driven by growing awareness and customer satisfaction with our G6 CGM technology.\" The company attributed its revenue growth primarily to volume growth in sales of the G6 system.There really weren't any negatives to be found in DexCom's Q1 results. Operating expenses climbed nearly 22% year over year to $222.9 million. However, that increase paled in comparison to the company's revenue growth.DexCom did spend $3.2 million in incremental costs related to the COVID-19 outbreak. These were mainly related to additional spending on payroll, consulting, information technology infrastructure, and facilities. But the company was able to shrug off these extra costs with soaring demand for its G6 CGM continuing in spite of the pandemic.\u00a0The one significant impact that COVID-19 is having on DexCom is that the uncertainties related to the pandemic resulted in the company temporarily suspending its 2020 guidance. DexCom anticipates that it could experience some impact from patients staying at home and clinicians shifting to virtual care models. However, it also stated that it \"has seen benefits in the shift to telemedicine\" including increased appreciation for its virtual diabetes care offerings and monitoring of patients in hospitals.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Regeneron has defied stock market gravity thanks to three pieces of good news.First, the biotech announced on Feb. 4 that it's working with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to develop a treatment for the novel coronavirus. Regeneron already developed an antiviral drug for treating Ebola and has worked with HHS on developing a treatment for MERS, which is also a member of the coronavirus family.Second, Regeneron\u00a0 two days later. Its eye-disease drug Eylea generated 11% year-over-year sales growth. Sales for cancer immunotherapy Libtayo more than quintupled compared to the prior-year period.Third, Regeneron announced positive results on Feb. 8 from a late-stage clinical study evaluating Eylea in treating\u00a0moderately severe to severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR). Although this was the least of the catalysts boosting Regeneron's shares, the results could set the stage for the company to pick up another approved indication in the future for its blockbuster drug.  stock is up around 5% over the last four weeks, a much better performance than the major market indexes. Like Regeneron, Gilead benefited from news about its antiviral program targeting COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.There's a good reason to view Gilead as the leader in the coronavirus race. A World Health Organization (WHO) official  that Gilead's antiviral drug remdesivir is the \"one drug right now that we think may have efficacy.\" Gilead has already started two late-stage clinical studies evaluating remdesivir in treating COVID-19.\u00a0But its coronavirus program hasn't been the only news for Gilead in recent days. The company announced on March 2, that it \u00a0  for $4.9 billion. Forty Seven's lead candidate is experimental blood cancer drug magrolimab.The purchase of Forty Seven fits perfectly with Gilead's strategy of making bolt-on acquisitions of small-to-medium-sized biotechs. And with Gilead Sciences CEO Daniel O'Day's background in oncology development, Gilead's scooping up of a cancer-focused small biotech like Forty Seven makes sense.It's not just big  that are beating the market.

The company is teaming up with   to integrate the G6 CGM with Insulet's insulin pumps. DexCom and Insulet also agreed to integrate the not-yet-released G7 CGM system with Insulet's insulin pumps.Regeneron, Gilead, and DexCom should be able to continue their momentum and keep outperforming the overall market. For Regeneron and Gilead, the primary catalyst is likely to be progress with their respective COVID-19 programs. For DexCom, it's all about the company's G6 CGM sales.Over the long run, I like the prospects for Gilead and DexCom the most. Gilead could soon win approval for filgotinib, an immunology drug with huge sales potential. DexCom's rollout of the G7 CGM should keep the company at the forefront in diabetes management.

It seems likely that the company will continue , when it announced that its revenue more than doubled from the prior-year period to $94.7 million, with especially strong growth in international markets.Tandem's strategy has been to focus heavily on introducing innovative new products based on its core t:slim platform. The company has launched six new insulin pump versions over the last six years. Tandem's slogan for t:slim X2 -- \"the pump that gets updated, not outdated\" -- highlights one of its competitive advantages. In addition, t:slim X2 is smaller than other leading insulin pumps and already integrates with DexCom's CGM systems.\u00a0 that focus on diabetes should be a winning strategy for the future based on demographic trends alone. There are around 463 million people across the world with diabetes -- and that number is growing. Only around 6% of individuals with diabetes don't develop complications. This creates a massive opportunity for medical devices that help effectively manage diabetes.\u00a0All three of the diabetes stocks mentioned have catalysts on the way that should enable them to succeed in 2020 and beyond. DexCom is launching the G6 CGM in more international markets and plans to conduct the biggest product launch in its history on a full scale in 2021 with its new G7 CGM system. Insulet recently announced plans to integrate with DexCom's G6 and G7, as well as '\u00a0popular Freestyle Libre CGM. Tandem just launched its latest version of the t:slim X2 insulin pump, which is the first system to deliver automatic correction boluses of insulin and adjust insulin levels to keep blood sugar levels within thresholds.\u00a0There's no guarantee that you'll get rich investing in DexCom, Insulet, and Tandem.

Management issued first quarter and full year revenue guidance:Going into earnings, Wall Street had been modeling for year over year revenue growth of 27.4% in the first quarter and 20.8% for 2020. So, Insulet's outlook for both periods came in lighter than analysts expected. This was surely a big factor in the stock's decline on Wednesday.\u00a0Insulet has a great track record of beating its quarterly revenue guidance and increasing its annual guidance several times each year.

Over the past 12 months alone, the stock is up nearly 24%.\u00a0Can this momentum continue?There is one key division that may offer clues to Medtronic's long-term growth.Image Source: Getty Images.Medtronic is broken down into four key divisions, as seen in the table below.\u00a0Cardiac and Vascular GroupHeart failure, coronary heart disease, surgical toolsMinimally Invasive Therapies GroupSurgical tools; therapies for lungs, stomach, kidneysRestorative Therapies GroupTherapies for spine, neurological disorders, and painDiabetes GroupInsulin pumps, blood sugar monitors (continuous glucose monitoring), therapy management softwareSource: Medtronic.Of the four, the diabetes division shows the most promise for Medtronic investors. Diabetes affects roughly 30.3 million people, or 9.4% of the population, in the United States; worldwide, about 425 million adults live with the condition. Diabetes impairs the body's ability to process sugar, and patients must continually monitor their blood sugar levels and manage them with a hormone called insulin.\u00a0At Medtronic, the diabetes division includes key products such as MiniMed insulin pumps and accessories, Guardian continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), and therapy management software. Worldwide, sales of insulin pumps and CGM across all manufacturers are expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 12%,\u00a0and as the table shows, divisional revenue at Medtronic is up 24.1% since 2017 -- the highest increase of the four divisions.\u00a0The company's most recent earnings report, for the third quarter of fiscal 2020, showed that Medtronic's strength is in the  -- worldwide sales accounted for approximately half of the total, resulting in 16% growth year over year and offsetting some U.S. revenue challenges from increased competition. The CGM market showed strong results in both integrated and stand-alone products. CGM products that are integrated with Medtronic's MiniMed insulin pump led sales, with a particular boost from new patient acquisitions in international markets. The stand-alone CGM market continues to show progress as well, with 50% growth in the third quarter; here, Medtronic competes with market leader  as well as emerging rival\u00a0.DexCom has an advantage over its competitors in the U.S. market, with growth coming from CGM orders by Medicare plans, durable medical equipment (DME) suppliers, and pharmacy orders. DexCom continues to expand in these areas, but there's still room to grow for rivals like Medtronic, too. New products with additional capabilities and accuracy may help Medtronic regain market share, and its position as UnitedHealthcare's preferred insulin pump provider should help it expand in the integrated CGM market both domestically and internationally.Medtronic's MiniMed pumps have been a major sales driver in the past, and the international markets provide growth opportunities that should offset a U.S. revenue decline brought on by increased competition. Medtronic already sells its insulin pumps in Western Europe and many emerging markets, and a key catalyst will come this week, when the company is set to present data on its new insulin pump at the International Conference on Advanced Technologies and Treatments for Diabetes. This data should advance the creation of a timeline for milestones and eventual approval of the new 780G insulin pump by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\u00a0The 780G already has a European Commission mark of approval (CE mark) and has achieved conformity for products sold in the European Economic Area (EEA), and investors should gear up for more data in June, which will discuss results from a feasibility study for in-home use of the 780G to automate insulin delivery in patients with diabetes.\u00a0Positive results from this study would allow the device to progress toward FDA approval, which\u00a0would create an additional growth driver for Medtronic and improve its competitiveness in the market for insulin pumps.Medtronic also has a plan in place to retain many of its current users -- the Next Tech Pathway program allows purchasers of the former 670G product to upgrade their device for free when the 780G arrives. This will be a key factor in improving U.S. sales and should allow Medtronic to stay at the forefront of the competition.\u00a0\u00a0Medtronic boasts roughly 60% of  share in the insulin pump market, where it squares off against competitors such as \u00a0and . Its partnership with \u00a0is key here, and Medtronic can also expect growth from its continuing outcomes-based agreements with select healthcare providers such as Aetna; these value-based plans pay providers based on patient outcomes and quality of services performed, and Medtronic's participation could improve brand awareness and recognition among consumers and strengthen U.S. market share.\u00a0A recent\u00a0\u00a0because of safety concerns may have short-term effects, but it's unlikely to change the long-term growth trajectory. The diabetes division makes up just 8% of Medtronic's revenue, and the potential financial consequences of litigation and replacement will be offset in the short term by revenue from the company's diversified portfolio of other products. When considering longer-term prospects, the growth of the insulin pump market in international markets along with integrated and stand-alone CGM sales will contribute to further revenue streams, offsetting declines in other divisions (including the minimally invasive therapies division). In addition, the release of new products such as the 780G pump will improve Medtronic's strength in the U.S. market, where it's currently struggling because of competitive challenges.\u00a0Medtronic's diabetes division offers a window into the company's long-term prospects. Currently, the division makes up less than 10% of the company's revenue, meaning there's significant opportunity for growth here -- especially with a CAGR of 12% for both insulin pumps and CGM. Given its solid partnerships and agreements with healthcare providers and the opportunities presented in international markets, Medtronic has an opportunity to remain the market leader in insulin pumps over the long term. As the company dominates in the diabetes segment, shareholders and  should see results on both the company's top and bottom lines.\u00a0\u00a0When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.{% render_component 'sa-returns-as-of' type='rg'%} It's Wednesday, February 19th. Welcome to . I'm your host Nick Sciple, and for , we're going back to the healthcare well and we're going to be talking about diabetes stocks. I've got Brian Feroldi here with me today. Brian, how are you doing? Hey, Nick, how are you? I'm doing great. You know we're talking about healthcare today. You said you went to a doctor's appointment this morning. How are you feeling? Oh, I'm feeling good, but the funny thing is, I just go to a local small family physician. It was my annual physical. And of course, I walk in the door, and what do I have immediately handed to me? A paper and a pencil to refill out my name, my address, my phone number -- even though I've been going to the same doctor for about a decade now. So [it] just shows you how much room there is for innovation in the healthcare space. Oh, absolutely. And I think that's something we're going to be talking about today. When it comes to innovation and healthcare, that's diabetes, specifically the CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitoring) market and the insulin -- that's exactly what we're going to talk about today when it comes to innovation in healthcare in the diabetes space. I know a lot of folks are probably familiar with diabetes on a surface level. But just to start off, before we dive into these companies, Brian, can you give us a high-level overview of what diabetes is and how it affects patients? Sure. So diabetes is when the body loses its ability to make enough insulin to satisfy its needs. And insulin is a hormone that's secreted by the pancreas into the blood. And insulin greatly assists with the absorption of glucose, which is also going to sugar into the liver, fat and most importantly, the other muscular cells. So without enough insulin in the body, sugar can't be absorbed properly by the muscles. And all of that excess sugar that's in the bloodstream just continues to build up and up and up and up, and that can lead to a huge range of health problems, both in the short-term -- such as if you have really high blood glucose levels your vision can become blurry, you can have excessive thirst or hunger, you can get tired very easily. And more importantly, over the long term, if you consistently have high blood sugar levels, you can lose a significant amount of waste and you triple your chances of having a heart disease or a stroke.So broadly speaking, there are two main types of diabetes. The first is called Type 1, and that's an autoimmune disease where your body attacks and kills the insulin-producing cells that are in the pancreas. And when that happens, the person completely loses the ability to produce any insulin at all, and in that scenario, a patient with Type 1 has to take artificial insulin to survive. And just to throw some numbers around there, there's about roughly 1.5 million Americans that have Type 1 diabetes.Type 2 diabetes is when the pancreas doesn't make enough insulin to satisfy its needs or the body becomes resistant to the insulin that it does make naturally -- and that is usually as a result of obesity. And Type 2 diabetes is far more prevalent than Type 1. In America, there's about 28 million Americans that have Type 2 diabetes. And there's another 84 million Americans that are at risk of developing diabetes -- that's called prediabetes.So diabetes is a major health problem. Yeah, absolutely. When you talk about these patients, about 95% of those are the Type 2 diabetics, that it's primarily tracked back to diet, dietary choices, and that sort of thing. Type 1 diabetics, it's autoimmune, this is congenital. There's really not that much we can do about that. But to your point, diabetes, when it is not well-treated, can lead to some of the most expensive healthcare events that a patient can have. It's one of the leading causes of kidney failure, one of leading causes of amputation. For most diabetes patients, whether or not they have one of these huge complications, it's still a large number of patients that are affected.I pulled a stat. We're going to talk about  later today. Dexcom CEO at the  Healthcare Conference cited that only 6% of people with diabetes actually don't suffer from complications. So most patients suffer these issues. Now, traditionally how diabetes was monitored was through the traditional finger pricks. Each day, you would prick your finger and check your blood sugar level, make sure it's in the appropriate range. However, the technology we're going to talk about today has really changed the standard of care for how, at least for Type 1 patients are handling their diabetes today. Can you talk a little bit about that? Yeah. So to your point. So for decades, the way that a person with diabetes would monitor their blood sugar levels was with a finger stick. So, they would prick their finger and take a drop of blood, apply it to a strip that went on a glucose monitor and a point in time reading would then be produced. That sounds good and useful, but the truth is that blood sugar levels change rapidly throughout the day based on a whole range of factors. So eating food, exercising, your mood -- all those things can actually greatly increase or reduce, greatly impact your blood sugar levels. So finger sticks, where the compliance would be to say, \"Prick your finger four times per day.\" Well, even that much information -- which not everybody with diabetes would even do -- was still nowhere near enough to accurately figure out what was happening with a person's glucose levels 24 hours a day.So about a decade ago, the first continuous glucose monitors came to market. And these were devices that are attached directly to the skin. They're small, say, about half the size of a box of Tic Tacs, and they are worn. They put a little sensor underneath the skin and they continuously upload a blood sugar reading to a wireless handheld device 24 hours a day. So many of them give readings, say, every five minutes. And with that much data, suddenly a patient could get a much better idea of how their blood sugar levels are changing throughout the day and they could make therapeutic decisions based on that to keep their blood sugar in a much healthier range than they could have before. Absolutely. When healthcare providers are treating folks with diabetes, one of the No. 1 things they want to target is how long can we keep our patients in the targeted range of glucose levels. And when you look at a finger prick, even if you do that four times a day, that is a limited insight into how your glucose is fluctuating throughout the day. So what these CGM's allow patients and providers to do is get a more accurate picture of how often they're staying within that target range. And that tends to lead toward better outcomes for patients, which is very important, obviously, from a patient's point of view, not having to prick your finger every day, getting a better perspective of your health condition is valuable. But it's also valuable for these insurance payers, because we talked about earlier how significant the expense of diabetes treatment is. And that's only really increased over the past decade. But if we can get a better picture of how glucose levels change throughout the day, can keep patients in that target range over a longer period, that should be better for patients and they'll have better outcomes from a healthcare point of view, and better for insurance payers in that the risk of these high-expense complications like amputations, kidney failure, that sort of thing, really reduces. So, both from the patient's perspective and from the payer perspective, this therapy really has a lot of appeal. Yeah, completely. And one point that we need to make sure our listeners are aware of is, when you have diabetes, as we said, your blood sugar can constantly move up and down based on what you're doing. The traditional way to bring your blood sugar down is, if you have Type 2 diabetes, with diet and exercise changes or by taking drugs. If you have Type 1, the only way to bring your blood sugar level down is to take artificial insulin. Now, that's good if you have high blood sugar and you're taking insulin to bring it down, but figuring out the proper dose is critical. If you take too much insulin, then your blood sugar can drop well below a healthy level and you can pass out and go into a coma immediately. So it's really tricky for people to -- it's a balancing act between too much insulin and not enough insulin that people have to walk on the tightrope. And what CGM devices allow people to do is to see that they're going to be heading in a trouble zone before it actually happens, and they can take action to prevent those extremes from happening. And CGM devices are more expensive than traditional blood glucose monitoring, but if you can just keep a patient out of a hospital one time in, say, a decade, then the therapy pays for itself. Yeah, absolutely. I think we list out these benefits of CGM, and there is significant growth in the space, but we need to note that penetration is still relatively low. Among the Type 1 population, we're still looking at 35% to 40% penetration. You'd expect penetration to be lower among Type 2 -- these are folks who are [on] less intensive insulin therapy -- but that's still really looking at 15% penetration. So really a lot of growth opportunity in this space.And that's what is going to transition us to talking about the first stock we're going to talk about today is Dexcom, which is one of the earliest pioneers in CGM. And if you look at the stock, it has just been an incredible performer over the past 10 years, five years, one year, anyway you look at it. Over the past 10 years, the stock is up 2,500%. It's a triple over the last five years, it's a double over the past year. Brian, when you look at this company, what's been driving this growth? Yes. So Dexcom has kind of been the leader in the CGM space for more than a decade. There are other competitors that they've gone up against, most notably would be , which used to completely own and dominate the diabetes-device space. But Dexcom has always been one step ahead of them with a very critical component of CGM, which is accuracy. Having the most accurate results is critical to being able to make therapeutic changes when necessary, and Dexcom has solely focused on continuous glucose monitoring space, and that has helped to keep them one step ahead of the competition. And as you alluded to before, this company has been a monster winner for investors because they consistently attract new users to their device. And Dexcom actually has a business model that I personally love, which is the razor and blade. So Dexcom not only sells the handhold controller, which is used to actually receive the data, but the sensors that they wear on their body must be changed every 10 days. So this is a razor-and-blade model. So as this company adds new users every year, its revenue has just soared. Yeah. If you look at their most recent quarter, they called out 650,000 active regularly reordering Dexcom users. So these are patients who are using their CGM. Every 10 days they need a new Dexcom sensor to replace their existing one. The huge launch for growth over the past couple of years has been Dexcom's G6 product they released in 2018. That was their first product that came to market that didn't require calibration, which has been huge for the CGM space. So prior to the Dexcom G6 and also the  FreeStyle Libre that came out just a little bit before Dexcom G6 product. Even CGM wearers, at least twice a day would have to prick their finger and calibrate the sensor to make sure it was accurately reading. However, in the past couple of years, we've seen this influx of no-calibration sensors, which has really grown the market that much more, it makes the appeal from a patient point of view that much better. You don't have to prick your fingers at all, which has led to some massive growth for the business. Yeah. That is something that held up adoption for a couple of years, where as you said, even though patients were willing to upgrade, were willing to wear the sensor 24 hours a day. They did still have to manually prick their finger and manually enter results into their CGM to actually calibrate it, so that it was as accurate as possible. Dexcom has continually advanced its sensor with each new generation. And as you said, the growth has been explosive in the last few years with the launch of the device that does not require any finger pricks. And you can easily see how that would be extremely compelling for anybody with diabetes to go with a device because you completely give up finger sticks with the most up-to-date sensors. Yeah. Another thing we need to note about Dexcom's positioning in the market. You know, I called out Abbott FreeStyle Libre, the other no-cal CGM product on the market today. Abbott's strategy is more going toward the low-price segment of the market. They have the lowest cost. However, Dexcom's strategy is a little bit different. You mentioned earlier, they are focused on accuracy. They're particularly focused on accuracy in the hypoglycemia area -- that's those issues we mentioned where your glucose can plummet, and it's really scary for patients because they make you pass out or go into a coma.Another area they focused on, is focused more toward pediatric -- younger patients. They are the only device on the market today that offers the alerts. My cousin, as a matter of fact, is a Dexcom wearer, my uncle has these alerts on his phone. So if over the night the child falls out of their glucose range, an alert will go off on the child's phone or in the parent's phone to alert them to that low-in-range status to get them some food or what have you to keep them out of that low glucose range. So for a parent, it's particularly valuable having those alerts, could lead you to why you would adopt Dexcom over the other product. They also believe that Dexcom's product is approved for people [age] 2 and up, but if you look at Abbott Libre product, it's only approved for older patients.So Dexcom has been positioning themselves in this premium segment of the market, targeting really easy-to-use products with alerts and that sort of thing, and targeting younger folks, which has really been a good opportunity for them. Yeah. To your point, Abbott launched its Libre product a few years ago. This is a lower priced product that isn't as accurate as Dexcom, but because they price themselves at such a low and affordable range, they have taken significant market share and their device has been a huge success. So, it is nice to see that patients do have options when it comes to see CGM, and it's also nice to see that price that Abbott came to market with was such a low-price device that it makes the technology that much more affordable. Absolutely, and even with this price competition, when you look at Dexcom results, there's been plenty of room for growth for all these players in this space. So if you look at 2019, Dexcom revenue up 43% for the year. Roughly doubled their revenue over the past couple of years when both of these products came to market. If you look at, even over a longer term, look at their five-year revenue CAGR [compound annual growth rate], over 40%. So just massive growth in this area, as new patients have been moving into adopting CGM.Another big development was Medicare coverage added in the past couple of years, which has really opened up the population. So even as there has been continued competition on price, which Dexcom expects to continue, as the size of the patient population has grown that has increased opportunities for them.Yeah. And that was a big concern for investors a few years ago when the Libre was initially approved. When the day that that happened, Dexcom's stock got absolutely walloped. I think it fell 30% or 40%, because investors were so fearful that the lower-price device would just eat their market share. But we've seen exactly the opposite -- we've actually seen both of these companies do extremely well, just because the market for these types of devices has been so huge. And as you alluded to at the top of the show, the penetration rates are still not where they could ultimately go. So this market is so big and diabetes is so prevalent that there is space for more than one winner, and that's exactly what we've seen. Yeah, to your [point], Brian, I mean, that's when I actually went and bought Dexcom after that 30% selldown. I had some close family and friends, as I mentioned, that are users of the product. I asked them whether they were going to switch over. And because of those issues, when it comes to accuracy of the sensor, as well as those alerts and things, if you have younger patients who use the sensor, we actually haven't seen as many people switch over. Now, for new adopters who are price conscious, that's been a concern. But again, we've just seen massive growth.The other thing is in 2019, Dexcom swung over into GAAP [generally accepted accounting principles] profitability for the first time. Expect to continue that going forward. As you look toward further growth, you mentioned this G7 product coming out. As we evaluate the opportunity for continued growth in the CGM space, how should we be thinking about that, as investors?Yeah. So one of the biggest opportunities for these companies -- for both of these companies moving forward -- it's just continued adoption. I mean, as the technology continues to improve and more patients learn about the benefits of going to CGM, especially in international markets where the adoption rates are still infinitesimally small when compared to developed markets like the U.S. and Europe, there's still lots of room for these companies to grow. But with Dexcom, in particular, one thing that they're doing to kind of make sure that they have a growing market share is they are actually been very active on the partnership front.So what we've talked about so far has been the CGM side, the Continuous Glucose Monitoring side, but that's just getting the diagnostics. From there, you still have to take an action once your blood sugar is too high or too low. And if your blood sugar is too high, one of the common ways that people that are insulin-dependent to control their blood sugar is with the use of an insulin pump, and that is something that Dexcom has been very active with partnering with some of the leading insulin pump providers -- to have an integrated system that not only lets patients monitor their blood sugars, but also allows them to take action to make sure they're in a healthy range. Yeah, I think one thing Dexcom calls out repeatedly is that they are the only product on the market -- at least as of the most recent quarter -- that has iCGM (integrated Continuous Glucose Monitoring) designation, which really allows them some flexibility as they integrate with other platforms, which has really been a godsend for them. You mentioned these partnerships, the big ones on the pump side, are  and . First off, Tandem Diabetes, when we drive into that one, what should we know about it? That's another one that's just been a monster performer. Yeah, so Tandem Diabetes is an insulin pump company. And so, an insulin pump, again, has traditionally been a pager-sized device that's worn on the patient's body 24 hours a day. It has a tube that attaches to an infusion set, and through that tube, the insulin pump consistently pushes small doses of insulin into the body throughout the day. And then when a patient eats and requires a larger dose of insulin, they can give themselves a bigger bolus of insulin over time. And pumps have done a great job at mimicking the pancreas to keep the blood sugar in healthy ranges.However, historically, patients have had to do all the work and all the calculations themselves. So they have to be there with therapy decisions whenever they're about to eat. And that's a big burden for patients who are wearing these devices. It's much better than the other option, which is just to continuously take shots throughout the day, but they're still being onerous on these companies to do so.So what Tandem has done is they've made a very consumer-friendly device that has a touchscreen on it. It's been smaller than other pumps that are historically available. And they've really gone with consumer-friendly messaging to just make the device as easy to use as possible. And that messaging and the device have really become hugely popular with patients. This company has produced eye-popping growth in the number of units that it shipped for a couple of years. I mean, just in the most recent quarter, their number of pumps shipped and their revenue grew over 100%, and that's on top of growing at 100% for a few years in a row. So this company has been extremely impressive with the execution.It's still not profitable, it's rapidly approaching profitability as the volume continues to grow. But Tandem has been another monster winner for investors over the last couple of years. Yeah, I just pulled up the chart. Over the past three years, 35-bagger for this stock. I mean -- and it was one of those things, too, Brian, before it had this big run-up -- the stock was really languishing. I mean, it was almost in penny-stock territory. What really launched this turnaround for the company to send the stock to the moon? Yeah, I will tell you that I personally wrote this company off as dead a few years ago. I mean, they were just sucking wind, they were running out of cash, they had completely exhausted all of their financial resources. And I actually have friends still in the diabetes space, which I used to work in, and they were asking me about this stock under $1, and everything that I looked at just screamed, \"Stay away.\" But they have mounted a comeback like I have never seen in my life. They did a capital raise, which shored up their balance sheet. And their execution to get their pump out has been phenomenal. I mean, this company has produced growth rates like I have not seen in the device space for a long time. In reality, Wall Street was pricing them as if they needed a miracle turnaround, and believe it or not, that's exactly what the company produced. To your point, Tandem has just massively exploded since they've come out with some of these integrated products that have allowed them to talk to the Dexcom sensor and to administer insulin without intervention from the patient. Another one of those pump competitors for Tandem is Insulet. That's a company that you worked at for a number of years, Brian. What should we know about Insulet? Yeah. So Insulet is also in the insulin pump space. And their innovation in the market was to make the insulin pumps tubeless. So rather than have a pager-like device with a tube attached to it that goes into an infusion set, Insulet actually miniaturized all of the pumping mechanisms and put them into a device that's the size of about a box of Tic Tacs that sticks directly onto the skin. And there's no buttons on it -- it's completely waterproof and it's worn on the body 24 hours a day. And the device actually receives instructions from a wireless remote control.So this device has been highly attractive to patients that are interested in pump therapy but don't want a lot of the lifestyle negatives that come from wearing a traditional pump. And if you look at their growth, about three-quarters of the patients that are going to Insulet's Omnipod system, the majority of them would not have actually gone with pump therapy at all if it wasn't for the tubeless nature of the device. So they've done a great job at expanding the market. But at its core, the Insulet's Omnipod system works very similar to the other insulin pumps that came before it. So it constantly administers a small dose of insulin 24 hours a day. And then when a patient is going to eat and they need a large dose of insulin, they just pull up their wireless controller and then tell it how much to deliver.But both Insulet and Tandem have partnered with Dexcom to make what's called a closed-loop system. So that would be a true device that you put on your body and then there's really no thinking involved. The device itself would constantly measure your blood sugar and administer insulin doses based on your readings. That has been the holy grail of diabetes treatment for decades basically. And getting this device to market has proven to be hugely challenging. But we're finally at the point where we're actually getting really close to the first closed-loop systems being involved.So Insulet, its closed-loop system is going to be called the Omnipod Horizon. That's going to, as we said, deliver insulin into the patient's body whenever high glucose levels are detected. It works directly with the Dexcom system. And this device is estimated to be launched later this year. And actually today, before we started recording, Dexcom and Insulet announced that they were expanding their partnership so that Dexcom's next-generation system, its G7 system, would work directly with Omnipod's next-generation system to provide the first closed-loop insulin pump combination device that would actually work with somebody's smartphone.So innovation is alive and well in diabetes, and these devices are doing great things to make living with diabetes as easy as possible. Yeah, to your point, Brian, I mean, the software has just been huge for them because they had this system, this tubeless system in place for a long time, which added convenience to patients, but now they can match with their competitors, are matching on the convenience side when it comes to the closed-loop system. So really a big development for Insulet. When you look at these partnerships with Dexcom, what advantage does that give them? When you look at Medtronic, Abbott Labs, these are big medical-device companies that are going to partner with their own pumps and that sort of thing. When you look at this kind of agnostic player, does that give any advantages to Dexcom as the CGM player, that has these shots on goal with lots of other pump manufacturers? Yeah, I think so. I think that that's going to -- the partnerships with the pump companies is something that separates Dexcom from Abbott, and it should keep it in that premium leadership position. To your point before, I do think that there is going to be pressure on Dexcom moving forward to lower the cost of their device and reduce it because adoption is growing just so rapidly. And now that the Libre is out there and obviously a market success, you could see insurers starting to put the screws to Dexcom to lower their prices.But Dexcom's next-generation system is supposed to be a lower-cost system. So I do think that there's going to be enough cost savings in the device to not only lower prices for patients and providers, but also for Dexcom to maintain strong margins. But there's no doubt that its partnerships that it has in place with both Insulet and Tandem should help to differentiate it in the CGM space. Yeah, Dexcom's management has actually called this out -- that they expect revenue per patient to decline moving into 2020 as they move deeper into international markets, as you mentioned, as they push deeper into Medicare. Obviously, Medicare has a lot of leverage to squeeze companies on prices. That's something they're calling out. However, just massive growth when it comes to patient adoption. I think that they doubled production this year. They're expecting to double production going into 2020.I believe, I looked up, Abbott Labs is looking to triple to five times production of their FreeStyle Libre system. So just across the board, massive growth. One area we didn't mention when it came to CGM, but I think we should touch on at least briefly. When you look at these pump providers and just the traditional target market for CGMs is these insulin intensive Type 1 diabetics, that we mentioned earlier. As you look at this Type 2 diabetes market, that's starting to grow their presence in CGM and other kinds of more advanced diabetes therapies. How do you assess the opportunity there for these businesses, both on the pump side and the CGM side for growth in Type 2 diabetes? Well, historically speaking, most people with Type 2 diabetes, only a fraction of them actually require insulin. And of those [who] require insulin, only a fraction of those actually require intensive insulin management -- which is when you're taking, say, two, three, or four shots per day. So that limits the numbers that you see in the market. So, like, right now, if we're talking about, say, 30 million Americans with Type 2 diabetes, only about, say, 2 million or 3 million of them are on intensive insulin therapy.However, the [...] there is so huge that even if you account for a small fraction of them to be eventually eligible to receive a pump or a continuous glucose monitor, the numbers are so big that there's still a huge room for both Dexcom and Insulet to grow substantially in the space. So I do think that, as insurers learn more about the benefits and as the technology continues to improve, they will gradually make it easier and easier for patients with Type 2 to adopt pump therapy and CGM therapy. So I do think that that is going to drive all of these companies' growth in the 2020s. Yeah, I think if you look at the TAM [total addressable market] for these businesses we've mentioned, that as penetration in existing Type 1 patients has increased over time, we're at 35% to 40% penetration today. It is a clear trajectory of that trending toward the standard of care, particularly as we see the emergence of these closed-loop systems, no calibration CGM systems that really make it that much more convenient for patients, as well as all the things we mentioned as far as bringing down the cost of treating these folks over time.The other thing we have to think about, as well, on the Type 2 side is just the number of people with diabetes is growing significantly over time. So when you look at a company like Dexcom or these pump players, not only are we seeing growth as these products become standard of care for existing patients, but the number of patients is growing meaningfully year over year. So when you look at this opportunity going forward, Brian, I mean, Dexcom is at 18 times revenue, so really richly valued. But when you look at these opportunities, it grows over time, how excited would you be to buy the stock today at that valuation? Well, there's no doubt that investors are paying a premium to get into the stock today, but it does show you that Wall Street really values and is excited about what this company is doing. Valuation has always been a concern with Dexcom the entire way up. So I would say that if Dexcom or Insulet or Tandem excite you as an investor, I mean, all three of these companies are trading at 16- to 20-times sales. So Wall Street is pricing in enormous growth.And all of them, I think, have deserved their premium valuation. So if I was interested in any of these stocks or if our listeners were interested, I would say these are great stocks to buy in thirds, so you don't go all-in at once, given the huge valuation. You buy a tiny little bit, you wait and see how it goes, and then you add from there. Yeah, I totally agree with that. I tell you, when I first bought Dexcom a couple of years back, I thought it was a little pricey then. Again, that was right after this big new competition came on from the FreeStyle Libre that really scared a lot of folks out of the stock. However, I mean this growth has been massive. If you look back at this company, it's very rare you can see a company that's posted pretty much a decade worth a plus-40% revenue growth with really no signs of slowing up in any significant way.Prices are coming down, that's a concern, but as the patient population grows in a really significant [way], there's big opportunities for these companies. I don't know that I would be -- to your point -- taking a full possession at 18 times sales, but this is a company I would really consider buying in thirds. It is my belief that over time, CGM and pump therapy for the average diabetes patient is going to become standard of care. Yeah, I think that that's correct. The real challenge that these companies are going to have to face is they're going to also have to maintain their profitability. And as they continue to grow and become standard of care and there's likely to be a big pressure on them to continually reduce price. So far, these companies have had no problem dealing with that issue. The big question moving forward to me is, will they be able to continue to do so?I still have questions about that personally, so again, I wouldn't go whole hog in any of these stocks. But again, the addressable market here is so massive, and it's still growing, that there's reason for investors to be excited about all of these companies. Yeah, I think, regardless of whether you're comfortable investing in these companies today, this is an area of the healthcare industry to really pay attention to. The American Diabetes Association calls out that 1 in 7 healthcare dollars spent in the U.S. are related to diabetes or diabetes complications. So these are going to be real important businesses going forward. I don't think diabetes, as a condition, is going away.So before we go away, I want to ask our listeners one small favor.

In the U.S., researchers estimate that nearly 55 million Americans will have either type 1 or type 2 diabetes by 2030. In the U.S., costs related to diabetes, both healthcare and societal, will reach $622 billion, which is a 53% increase from 2015.That's why buying shares of a company that helps patients with diabetes can make for a sound, long-term investment. One company that has stood out in this area is\u00a0. But with the stock having achieved significant gains and up more than 400% in just the past two years, investors may be wondering whether it's still a good buy or whether it has peaked. Let's take a look.DexCom released its fourth-quarter and full-year results for 2019 on Feb. 13, and it\u00a0. Sales in Q4 were up 37% year over year. And for the full year, its top line increased by 43% from 2018, reaching $1.5 billion in revenue. It was the second straight year where sales grew by at least 40%. But the company expects revenue for 2020 to grow at a slower rate, between 17% and 20%. It also expects its gross margin to remain at around 64%, which is in line with 2019. Image Source: DexComThis year was also the first full year that the company recorded a positive net income, with profits totaling $101 million. In 2018, DexCom incurred a loss of $127 million, and it had a $50 million loss the year before that.One of the reasons the company is likely to keep growing is that it continues to enhance and improve its products. The company's continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system is driving its growth as DexCom credits the growing awareness of its real-time CGM as one of the reasons for its strong performance in Q4.\u00a0Its latest product, the DexCom G6 CGM, provides patients with real-time glucose readings and does not use finger sticks, which the previous G5 product required for calibration. Medicare does cover the G6, but DexCom notes in its earnings release that it only began shipping the product to Medicare patients in Q4. It is available at  locations, and continuing to raise awareness and rolling out the product to more patients is a key initiative for DexCom in 2020.Another initiative the company is focusing on is a new G7 product, with DexCom looking to offer patients a slimmer, less expensive product. The company does not expect a full commercial launch of the G7 until 2021. With better, more discreet ways to monitor glucose levels that are less invasive than before, DexCom's products become attractive options for people with diabetes who are looking for more innovative solutions. And with the number of people with diabetes growing, the market for the company's products will only get larger.' competing product, the FreeStyle Libre, generated worldwide sales of $534 million in the company's recent fourth-quarter results, which was a 58.5% improvement from the prior-year quarter.\u00a0, another competitor, offers both integrated and stand-alone CGM products. In its third-quarter earnings released on Feb. 18, the company noted that sales for its CGM products grew in the \"mid-teens.\" However, the company's total diabetes sales of $610 million were flat from the prior-year quarter.\u00a0 is another diabetes company that had revenue of $94.7 million in its , which is more than double the sales the company recorded in the prior-year quarter. Tandem's flagship product is the t:slim X2 insulin pump and one of its features is the ability to integrate with the DexCom G6.While there are many CGM products available on the market, and many are cheaper than DexCom's, the company's impressive sales numbers suggest that's not a concern, at least not yet.\u00a0In 2019, shares of DexCom soared 82%, eclipsing the 's returns of 30%. The stock's been a high performer, and it's trading at its 52-week high. But that's what can happen when a company is doing very well, and it shouldn't be a deterrent from buying shares.But a concern for value-oriented investors is that the stock trades at some hefty multiples. With a forward price-to-earnings ratio of over 94, investors are paying a steep price for future earnings. And with sales of $1.5 billion in its most recent fiscal year, investors are also paying about 16 times sales as well. DexCom isn't a cheap stock, and given how bullish the markets are today, a slowdown could hurt its price. With the company expecting its growth to slow in 2020, paying more than 90 times earnings or 16 times sales is a bit excessive. While the company's growth opportunities are encouraging, the shares' valuation would have to come down to more reasonable levels (around 25 to 30 times forward earnings) for the  to be a good buy.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

If I had to guess, it would probably be a stock that hardly anyone has heard of right now. After all, the unknown tiny stocks have the most room to run.But identifying the most important stock to own over the next decade is a different story. By my definition, the most important stock will be one that's most likely to have a profound impact on the greatest number of people.\u00a0There are several worthy candidates to get the nod as the most important stock for the 2020s. If I had to choose just one stock right now, though, it would be...  .Image source: Getty Images.We can look around today to see which trends are likely to matter the most over the next decade. Perhaps the most critical trend is the growing senior population across the world.\u00a0The U.S. Census Bureau projects that 2030 will be a turning point for the country with every member of the baby boomer generation over age 65. Nearly 25% of residents of the European Union will be at least 65 years old 10 years from now. Over 25% of Chinese citizens will be at least 60 years old by 2030. The percentages in other heavily populated Asian countries are even higher.There lots of implications from these demographic trends. Hundreds of millions of people will have more time on their hands, for one thing. More importantly, though, the demand for healthcare products and services will almost certainly increase significantly.Another key trend that should shape the next decade is the expanded role of artificial intelligence (AI). There has been a dramatic surge in the use of AI in recent years. Just ask your smartphone. But I expect the 2020s will usher in an era where AI is even more pervasive, from smarter apps to self-driving cars. This shift to increased use of AI will likely add fuel to the fire of another unstoppable technology trend -- the migration of apps and data to the cloud.\u00a0Speaking of trends that are already under way and should pick up momentum, how often do you use cash these days? If you're like most people, the answer is \"at little as possible.\" The  (i.e., the transition to digital payment methods) should intensify over the next decade.Of course, there are other important trends that will impact many people in the 2020s. However, few will rival the significance that aging demographics, the increased prevalence of AI, and the war on cash will have.Quite a few companies will play a role in at least one of these critical trends shaping the next decade. But a handful will be involved in all of them. I'd argue that Alphabet is the one company that covers the major trends from A to Z and that will make the biggest difference overall.Let's start with aging demographics. Alphabet's apps, particularly Google Search and YouTube, are likely to be used much more frequently as older individuals have more leisure time. The more significant impact for the company, though, could be in healthcare.Alphabet's Verily Life Sciences subsidiary is working with \u00a0on the development of its cutting-edge G7 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. Verily is collaborating with several major drugmakers, including \u00a0and , on Project Baseline -- an effort to map a baseline of human health. This project could change how new drugs are developed and improve the quality of care provided to patients.Another Alphabet subsidiary, Calico, has an even more ambitious goal: extending the human lifespan. There's no guarantee that Calico will unveil earthshaking developments over the next 10 years, but it might.But I'd say that it is a certainty that Alphabet will be at the forefront of AI development in this decade. It already ranks as a leader in AI and has the resources to stay on top. Alphabet's Waymo unit expects to expand its fleet of self-driving cabs beyond the initial testbed in Phoenix, Arizona. It's partnered with Jaguar to develop the first fully self-driving car. And Waymo's self-driving big-rig trucks could move out of the testing phase in the not-too-distant future.Image source: Getty Images.Alphabet is also addressing two major trends at the same time by applying AI to healthcare. The company's DeepMind AI lab achieved a big breakthrough last year by using AI to predict a potentially fatal kidney disease 48 hours before it became critical. Alphabet's AI can even .On top of all of this, Alphabet is also a major player in the war on cash with its Google Pay digital payment platform. Google Pay is available on more than 2.5 billion active Android devices worldwide. Alphabet even  for Google Pay users in 2020.I don't expect Alphabet will be the best-performing stock of the decade. It's too big already. The good news, though, is that Alphabet's role in the key trends for the next 10 years should also lead to big stock gains.Despite its $1 trillion market cap, Alphabet is still a . Its core businesses should power plenty of growth on their own. But I think that the company's healthcare, AI, and digital payment efforts will pay off in a major way, too.

And   is hot.The diabetes-focused medical-device stock . DexCom got off to a good start in 2020, as well, with a double-digit gain by early February. Investors looking for another catalyst received one when the company announced its fiscal 2019 fourth-quarter and full-year results after the market closed on Thursday.DexCom's shares jumped around 5% in after-hours trading following the release of its latest results. Here are three reasons why the company's Q4 update delighted investors.Image source: DexCom.DexCom reported revenue in the fourth quarter of\u00a0$462.8 million. This reflected year-over-year growth of 37%. It also easily topped the average analyst estimate of $442.4 million.There's no question why the company's sales continue to rise. DexCom's G6 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system is attracting more and more patients as they become aware of the benefits of real-time CGM.The company's U.S. revenue jumped 34% year over year to $375.9 million, making up 81% of DexCom's total revenue in the fourth quarter. However, DexCom grew sales even faster in international markets, with revenue soaring 52% year over year to $86.9 million.DexCom announced fourth-quarter net income of $92.7 million, or $1 per diluted share, based on generally accepted accounting principles (). That's a huge improvement from the company's GAAP net loss of $179.7 million, or $2.03 per diluted share, in the prior-year period.The company's adjusted non-GAAP earnings looked even better. DexCom posted non-GAAP net income of $106.5 million, or $1.15 per share. This result reflected a big jump from non-GAAP earnings of $50.2 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, in the same period of 2018. It also trounced the consensus Wall Street earnings estimate of $0.74 per share.To be fair, DexCom's GAAP net loss in the prior-year period included a $217.7 million non-cash charge related to its amended agreement with \u00a0subsidiary Verily. But the non-GAAP earnings figure in Q4 of 2018 excluded this charge. DexCom's adjusted earnings improvement was really as good as it appeared to be.Investors in healthcare stocks (for that matter, investors in any kind of stocks) are more interested in the future than the past. DexCom's future looks quite good based on the company's full-year 2020 guidance.The company maintained its previous full-year 2020 revenue outlook of between $1.725 billion and $1.775 billion. The average analyst's revenue estimate for the year is $1.77 billion, near the upper end of DexCom's range. But Wall Street analysts know that DexCom tends to sandbag with its revenue guidance. For example, the company projected full-year 2019 revenue of between\u00a0$1.175 billion and $1.225 billion but delivered actual 2019 revenue of $1.476 billion.DexCom also provided more detailed guidance for other financial metrics in full-year 2020. The company expects a gross profit margin of around 64% and a non-GAAP operating margin of around 13%. DexCom looks for non-GAAP adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization () margin of close to 23%.DexCom CEO Kevin Sayer stated, \"We have\u00a0taken significant steps to prepare the business for long-term growth and believe we are well-positioned as we enter 2020.\" The company's Q4 performance appears to justify his optimism.Some, and perhaps many,  could face increased volatility in 2020 with the U.S. presidential campaign heating up. DexCom, though, shouldn't be impacted too much by political pressures. The company appears to be in good shape to continue delighting investors well into the future.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Now I will turn it over to Kevin.  -- Thank you, Sean, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. 2019 was another fantastic year for DexCom. I want to take a few minutes to highlight some of our accomplishments before we turn our attention to 2020. This was the second consecutive year that our organic growth exceeded 40%.To put this into perspective, given that we started the year on a revenue base greater than $1 million, this means that we added more than $440 million of absolute growth in the year. New patients continue to be the primary driver behind the growth and includes growing traction in the insulin-dependent type 2 market, where we continue to expand access in addition to our existing coverage in Medicare. We ended the year approaching 650,000 net active patients globally who are benefiting from DexCom CGM technology. And as a reminder, we only count someone as a patient when they are consistently reordering product.We are also achieving this growth with operational and spending discipline as an organization. 2019 was the most profitable year in DexCom's history and represented our first full year of GAAP profitability. We are demonstrating great operating leverage, even as we doubled G6 capacity in 2019 and continued to invest in R&D to drive our future growth. As we grow, we are building and adapting our infrastructure to serve meaningfully more patients.In the U.S., we are making great progress in our effort to transition to the pharmacy channel as we expanded covered lives by more than 50% in 2019. We are now fully under way in the launch of G6 into Medicare and look forward to those patients having access to the no fingerstick G6 technology. We have built an extensive global business services team in Manila in 2019, exiting the year with progress on all of our key customer service metrics. Our business services team will be a great asset for us as we continue to scale the company and strive to offer our customers the best possible experience.We are also transparent with you and our customers about the things we must improve. As many of you heard in late November, we experienced a temporary server outage that impacted the ability of family and friends to monitor glucose levels of loved ones via our SHARE and Follow apps. I told our customers, healthcare providers and shareholders that we needed to do better. We needed a system in place to greatly improve communication with our customers.In the weeks since, we have taken significant steps to do just that. We have launched a system status page on our website ahead of schedule. This provides real-time updates on system functionality, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We are also in the final stages of rolling out an in-app messaging system that will provide quick communication with our customers.As you can see, we are not sitting still, even with the rapid growth that we've experienced since the launch of G6. The reason for this is simple, we believe that there is a huge opportunity still ahead of us for our sensor platform. For our core markets, we remain confident in the underlying shift from fingersticks to CGM as the standard of care. Outside of our core markets, our excitement for the potential of DexCom CGM to address broader global health issues continues to grow.We are beginning to see great early stage data demonstrating the value of CGM for all people with type 2 diabetes, including those not on insulin therapy. Our work with UnitedHealth Group has progressed very well, and we look forward to the expanded use of DexCom CGM in their type 2 populations in 2020. We will look to extend the presence of DexCom CGM for type 2 customers through additional partnerships with programs offered by digital health players like Onduo, Livongo and WellDoc, all integrating CGM data into their respective coaching platforms. And we continue to work directly with providers.As we recently discussed at an investor conference, our initial pilot work for non-insulin-using type 2 customers with Intermountain Healthcare revealed gross cost savings of nearly $5,000 per member per year for those using DexCom CGM relative to those using fingersticks. We look forward to providing additional details like these related to type 2 and other new markets as we progress in 2020. With all of this G6-driven growth in our core markets and ongoing learnings in our new markets, we enter 2020 with an eye toward the biggest product launch in DexCom's history, G7. We have a busy year ahead, but the team has done a great job thus far for us to progress toward our goal of a full-scale launch in 2021.To summarize, 2019 was another great year for DexCom, but we're pressing forward to capitalize and execute in 2020 on these many long-term opportunities. I will now turn the call over to Quentin for a review of our financials. -- Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release, as well as on our IR website. For the fourth quarter of 2019, we reported worldwide revenue of $462.8 million, compared to $338 million for the fourth quarter of 2018, representing growth of 37% on both the reported and constant-currency basis.As a reminder, the fourth quarter of 2018 represented the most difficult comp for the entire year of 2019 for both our worldwide and U.S. business. New patients adopting our technology remained the primary driver of our growth as people continue to gain awareness of the value of DexCom CGM. As Kevin noted, we've been pleased to see that this new patient growth includes steady traction among the type 2 population, where we continue to push for increased market access.Throughout 2019, these increasing patient volumes and strong customer satisfaction with G6 are fueling our momentum. Despite the most difficult quarterly growth comp in 2018, our U.S. business continued to grow very well, with growth of 34% in the fourth quarter of 2019. As our revenue indicates, our volume growth initiatives are more than offsetting the lower revenue per patient that accompanies our transition to the pharmacy channel.Similar to what we saw in the first nine months of the year, this growth came from all of our U.S. channels as expanding CGM awareness is driving strong growth in Medicare, DME and our growing pharmacy business. We saw great performance from our international business in the fourth quarter as well, with 54% constant-currency growth compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. The response to the launch of G6 has exceeded our expectations.We continue to see excellent growth in direct markets like Germany and the U.K., and our distributor markets are also growing very well with strength across the board. Of note, for the first time in our company's history, we launched our e-commerce platform in Canada and were more than pleased with the results as we saw the number of new patients nearly double in the fourth quarter. Our fourth-quarter gross profit was $309.3 million or 66.8% of revenue, compared to 65.9% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018. As anticipated, we saw a significant sequential step-up in our gross margin in the 66.8% for the quarter, representing the highest point since 2017.The year-over-year margin improvement was in line with our expectations noted on the third-quarter call. Our teams continue to focus on designing incremental improvements that reduced product cost and increase automated manufacturing, giving us flexibility in our efforts to improve patient access and prioritize efficient channels without meaningfully compromising gross margin. As we head into 2020 and transition the Medicare customer base to G6 from G5, we will receive the full cost benefit of our new G6 transmitter design, which helps offset certain items such as the cost to scale up G6 and G7 manufacturing lines. Operating expenses were $205.7 million for Q4 2019, compared to $168.4 million in Q4 2018.This reflects an increase of 22% year over year and a 540-basis-point reduction as a percentage of revenue from the fourth quarter in 2018. The expense growth in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by incremental R&D spend related to our G7 efforts as we advance toward our launch plans. For the full year, the 23% growth in operating expenses remained well below our 43% total revenue growth, even as we invested significantly to capitalize on DexCom's long-term growth opportunity. Operating income was $103.6 million or 22.4% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to $54.4 million or 16.1% of revenue in the same quarter of 2018.This reflects a year-over-year improvement of 630 basis points in operating margin for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $141.7 million or 30.6% of revenue for the fourth quarter, compared to $83.6 million or 24.7% of revenue for the fourth quarter of 2018. Given the strength of the fourth quarter, our full-year operating margin of 10.9% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.7% came in well ahead of our revised full-year guidance of 9% and 19.5%, respectively, as provided on the third-quarter call. As these numbers support, we remain confident in our leverage potential and the discipline that we're exhibiting as an organization.But we will also continue to invest opportunistically as we scale manufacturing for both G6 and G7 in 2020 and explore the use of our real-time CGM in new markets. Net income for the fourth quarter was $106.5 million or $1.15 per share. In 2019, we also established for the first time in our company's history, our first full year of GAAP profitability with full-year GAAP net income of $101.1 million. We remain in a strong cash position with greater than $1.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet as we exit the year.Given the growth opportunities that are ahead of us, our priority continues to be capital allocation that supports our organic growth opportunity. Turning to 2020 guidance. As we stated last month, we anticipate full-year revenues of between $1,725,000,000 and $1,775,000,000, representing growth of 17% to 20%. This growth contemplates many of the same factors that we navigated in 2019, including a higher rate of volume growth as access and awareness of DexCom CGM continue to grow, our expanded launch of G6 to populations like Medicare and new DexCom integrated systems that come to market.These tailwinds are offset by the continued realization of a reduction in average annual revenue per patient as we navigate toward channels with lower prices, as well as considerations surrounding the competitive environment. Turning to margins. We continue to track well toward our long-term targets established at our 2018 Investor Day. For 2020, we anticipate the following non-GAAP results: Gross margins improving to approximately 64%.Given that we remain in the early stages of patient adoption of our technology in our core market, as well as validation in our patient base that type 2 patients are realizing the value of our technology, we must begin to plan and invest for growth beyond our San Diego and Mesa manufacturing centers. Included in our gross margin guidance are costs associated with identifying and beginning to set up a third manufacturing site that will reside outside of the United States. This third site will further our efforts to reduce the overall production cost of our products, better support our international expansion strategy and support our long-term gross margin expectations of the mid-60s. We expect operating margins to increase to approximately 13%, which contemplates the continued benefits of our global shared services center in the Philippines, offset by increasing investments in our DTC and G7 efforts.Finally, we expect that adjusted EBITDA margins will expand to approximately 23%. As you can imagine, with our ambition to double G6 capacity in the first half of the year, invest in the scale-up of G7 and expand our manufacturing footprint outside of the United States, 2020 will require capital expenditures in excess of what we saw in 2019. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve for a strategic update. -- Thanks, Quentin. As our 2018 and 2019 results indicated, G6 has been a game changer for people with diabetes, with 2019 revenue more than doubling from the year before G6 was launched. Customer satisfaction with G6 remains very high, and we look forward to the benefits of the capacity expansion that we achieved throughout the course of 2019 and continuing into 2020. We plan to double capacity again in the first half of 2020, enabling us to expand our G6 launch in our existing markets, as well as new geographies and to ramp our efforts in these new markets with direct-to-consumer marketing.We are now more than 1.5 years into the launch of G6, and we still have a long way to go to realize its full potential. As Quentin mentioned, the launch of our e-commerce platform in Canada has been a great success and we look forward to expanding the rollout of this platform to additional markets throughout 2020. We expect to complete the transition of our Medicare base to G6 by mid-2020. Many of these customers have waited a long time for G6, and we are thrilled to be providing it to them.As well as the many more Medicare patients who stand to benefit from access to G6 as soon as possible. We will continue to push for expanded market access and look forward to the introduction of G6 in markets like Japan and South Korea later this year. Our payer and market access teams have done a great job to position us for continued momentum in 2020, including their efforts to open up pharmacy access, both for people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes on insulin. As a reminder, the process of transitioning our DME customer base to pharmacy will not happen overnight, even with the progress we have made for customer lives covered through the pharmacy.But we believe we are well-positioned to make meaningful progress in this transition in 2020, which we have contemplated in our guidance. We're excited to be in the position to drive multiple DexCom integrated insulin delivery systems in 2020. We're very excited about the work that we are doing with Insulet in the HORIZON integrated system. In December, Insulet began the pivotal trial, and they remain on track for a launch later in the year.Our commercial agreement with Eli Lilly was officially signed in December and represents another step forward in bringing their system to market with G6, which will initially focus on a smart pen offering. In January, Tandem launched their latest integrated pump offering, the Control-IQ system, incorporating the DexCom G6 sensor and our TypeZero algorithm to automate insulin delivery. This is the first integrated system to offer automated correction boluses based off the customer's CGM reading and our AP algorithm. These are the kind of achievements that do not happen overnight simply because we obtain the regulatory designation of an iCGM or an ACE pump or an iController.In fact, our relationship with each of the companies that I just mentioned goes back multiple years. It takes hard work and significant time to integrate CGM with insulin delivery systems, and DexCom remains the leader in the effort to bring innovative technologies to the diabetes community. Even with the ongoing success of G6, much of our attention is turning toward G7. With G7, we are moving the performance of DexCom real-time CGM into a fully disposable product that is only slightly larger than a nickel.And we believe that customers are going to love the result. As Kevin mentioned, we affirmed our G7 time line today for a full rollout in 2021. We are currently focused on the G7 clinical trial, which we expect to be much larger than the size of the trial that we ran for G6, and we are initiating the scale-up of manufacturing for G7 to support the launch time lines that we have mentioned. From the outset, G7 has been designed for scale to support our belief in the market potential for real-time CGM, which we continue to think has opportunity to address far greater numbers of customers and disease states than we currently serve.From product development and the expansion of DexCom CGM into our existing markets, to new geographies, to the ongoing development of new market opportunities, our strategy is focused as we head into 2020. And with that, I will pass it back to Kevin. -- Thank you, Steve. Last year, I spoke on this call and talked about 2018 as a year of milestones. 2019 was a year of continued momentum, but there was a lot of work behind the scenes to ensure that momentum. We're entering 2020 as excited as ever for the opportunity that lies ahead, and with DexCom very well-positioned.We are in our best inventory position since the launch of G6 and are focused on the right channels for efficient growth and learning each day about how to expand the use of DexCom CGM to additional customers. I would now like to open up the call for Q&A. Sean? -- Thank you, Kevin. [Operator instructions] Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird. Your line is now open. -- Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the year. Can you hear me OK? -- We can hear you. -- Absolutely. -- All right. Hey, great. Kevin, I guess, with my one question, a lot of places I could go, but let me focus maybe on the U.S. commercial business.Would love to hear how you feel about the mix of new patient adds this year with MDI versus maybe competitive share gains. And specifically, would love to hear maybe your thoughts with some of the formulary changes we've seen at the start of this year, how you think that might help sensor volumes this year? Thank you. -- That's a pretty complicated one question so I'll deal with those as best I can. With respect to the new patient adds this year, there was a majority of our new patient adds, a pretty significant majority of our new patient adds, who are multiple daily injection patients, who are using pens and insulin to control their insulin delivery. We still have a number of pump patients as well, but to expand the way we've expanded and to grow as quickly as we've grown, do the math, we have to be getting patients on multiple daily injections. On the competitive front, we're very pleased with our growth in the number of insulin-using patients that we're picking up here.It was just a great year all around on the new patient front. With respect to the formulary and the increased access that we see coming, there's a couple of things we think that will be very good for next year that we see right now. The first is more increased type 2 intensive insulin access for many of our patients. And under many of the plans, plans are starting to open up and follow the Medicare guidelines there.That really opens a lot of doors for us, and that will be good. And then increased pharmacy coverage. While our pharmacy rollout has been a bit choppy as we're trying to learn here how to do that best, that has not been our core business going to the drug store since we started. We'll learn to be better and get better there.But as we can make the product more accessible and easy to get, over and over again, we see the utilization is higher and retention is better. So all those things point to a very strong 2020 for us.Thank you. Our next question comes from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Your line is now open. -- Hi, good afternoon. I'll ask an uncomplicated question. In terms of -- and I'm not sure -- I missed part of the call, but G7 timing, is your expectation that you get it approved here in 2020? -- Our expectation is that we launch it full-scale in 2021. And we've spoken several times about a limited launch in 2020, and that's still one of our primary goals and objectives, but we don't want anybody believing that this rollout is going to happen in 2020. We need to get the trial done, the filing in and reviewed, and our manufacturing scaled up and apply those lessons we learned with G6 to G7. So our big focus and the focus we want everybody to focus on is that launch in 2021.As we get more information, we can share, we'll share it. But that's our time line and that's our commercialization time line for now. We're really not giving any filing or trial time lines today. We can talk more about that as we go on.Thank you. Our next question comes from Travis Steed from Bank of America. Your line is now open. -- Great. Congratulations on a great year. So I had a question for Quentin. You've got goals for operating margins of 15% by 2023, which looks a lot more conservative now than it did before.And if revenues end up coming on better this year, you could potentially achieve that this year. So just trying to think about the long-term profitability of this business, is there anything long term, as you have more business to the pharmacy channel, G7 is at scale, is there anything that would be structurally inhibiting this business from being at a 25% to 30% operating margin? And additionally, is there anything about G7 launching that where gross margins would step back? Or can you manage through that? -- Yeah. It's a good question. When we put out the 15% operating margin guidance. At that point in time, we were just trying to draw a reference out in the future that we were confident we could navigate toward, but it was never an end goal that we had in mind.It was more along the lines of the progress we thought we could make. And if you recall, when we did that that was 1,500 basis points away from where we were at that point in time. So to your point, we've closed the gap quite considerably even faster than what we anticipated. But there's nothing structurally in this business that won't allow us to go beyond the 15%.We're not ready to revise kind of those long-term expectations of where we can go. We couldn't be more bullish and excited about the investment opportunities in these new markets that are in front of us. You think about the hospital, gestational, the non-intensive type 2s, the international expansion, all of these things are incredible opportunities that we're going to make sure we're investing into to make sure that we open them up, but none of that is going to keep us from being able to get to the 15% and then on beyond that in time. So no, there's nothing structurally that concerns us whatsoever.G7, I would just remind you. That product was designed from the very beginning with cost in mind. And the idea was to be able to produce that at a very low-cost profile that will go far below even where G6 we've been able to get it to. So from my perspective, all that does is open up even greater opportunity to compete in lower-priced channels if we need to, to be aggressive in the marketplace to push volumes in a way that we need to.But all of it complements the long-term profitability profile that we're trying to achieve here. So I think, very complementary to what we're trying to do.Thank you. Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JP Morgan. Your line is now open. -- Thanks. And I'll echo congrats on a really nice quarter and year. Quentin, we've looked over the past two years and you've meaningfully exceeded your initial guidance range. We see something similar in 2020.Maybe if you could just help us understand why this is the right place to start off the year? And then I remember last year, you kind of walked us through what volume versus mix versus price would be. If you could do the same and maybe break down U.S. versus international and what's assumed in the guidance range, that would be really helpful. Thank you. -- Sure. So we continue to be very bullish on the opportunity that sits in front of us from a revenue perspective, just in the core markets that we participate in today. I think we're very early in the adoption of the technology, which leaves a lot of runway. But we also know there are very different patient profiles in that adoption cycle and how quickly they come on to the technology or how long it takes to convince them.It's hard to predict, and we're not going to get ahead of ourselves in that respect. I think if you look at our guidance, the way we thought about it is from an absolute dollar perspective, our guidance assumes a $250 million to $300 million increase year over year. And we've been very clear that there are price headwinds that continue to be contemplated in that guidance. As we walk, average revenue per patient down over time is contemplated in the numbers we put out there.That's about $150 million in 2020. So if you add that back to the net increase that we've guided to, that takes the gross revenue increase on an apples-to-apples basis versus prior year, it's about a $400 million to $450 million increase. You compare that to what we just did in 2019 of a $444 million increase and I think you start to get your mind wrapped around the guidance that we've provided. So we feel good about it.We think there's incredible opportunity. It doesn't make sense to get ahead of ourselves at this point in time, and feel like we've got guidance dialed-in appropriately.Thank you. Our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is now open. -- Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe first, I wanted to elaborate a little bit on some of the partnerships and updates that you guys have had over the last several months because there have been a lot, including some of the data at J.P. Morgan and so on.So how should we think about some of those? Are there more in the pipeline beyond that this year, especially since, Kevin, you talked about thinking really, really big. And how should we think about the timing to those partnerships becoming more material commercial activity. Thanks. -- Yeah. I mean, I think you have to look -- this is Steve. I think you need to kind of bifurcate the partnerships into kind of our core intensive insulin business, both U.S. and OUS.We've got Tandem currently launching Control-IQ, Insulet launching HORIZON later this year. Tandem with Basal-IQ in Europe and hopefully, I don't want to speak for Tandem on their time lines, but hopefully, Control-IQ at some point later this year. So those are all meaningful near-term revenue contributors, right? Because these are folks who are going on their -- many of them are probably already our patients or some portion are already DexCom patients as they go on these systems. But there will certainly be incremental new patient additions as a result of those product launches.So those are really exciting. The update with Lilly, we're still some period of time out before we launch the first really product, but we're definitely making some progress there. The partnerships and the data that we talked about really on the non-intensive side of the business at J.P. Morgan, that's still really early stage.I mean, the way we're trying to frame that, Margaret, is that a year ago around J.P. Morgan, we kind of talked about this new market opportunity strategy, particularly in the non-insulin-using type 2 space. We kind of followed that up, the goal is that this year J.P. Morgan was to follow that up with really some early stage, but concrete evidence that there's a real opportunity here, right? Between the work we're doing with United, the cost savings we showed with Intermountain with one of the payer systems we're working with.So I wouldn't look to -- certainly, not 2020 as a meaningful revenue contribution from really that non-insulin-using type 2 business, but we're super excited about it. The data supporting that there's a huge opportunity there. And I think in the out-years, and you start thinking about '21, '22, '23, I think there's going to be a much more significant revenue contribution from businesses outside of kind of our core intensive insulin business.Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Blicker from Cowen. Your line is now open. -- Hi, thanks for taking my questions. You talked about strong and growing contributions from the intensely managed type 2 patient population. Is there anything you can quantify for us on that front, either how big that population is now as a proportion of the installed base or new patient additions? And then just overall, do you expect new patient adds to grow in 2020 versus 2019? Thank you. -- Yeah, this is Kevin. I'll take that. We won't really break out the type 2 patients in the patient base. We don't stratify it between Medicare, peds, those types of things right now.We did give everybody a patient number this year and I think it's a good place for everybody to start. Second part of the -- yeah, why don't you take that one? -- Second question. I think the growth rate probably slows a bit, but the absolute number continues to be comparable, if not up slightly, is the way to think about it.Thank you. Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy from SVB Leerink. Your line is now open.Danielle Joy AntalffyHey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on a really fantastic year.Quentin, I just wanted to ask about seasonality as we look at Q1 specifically and how to think about moving through the year. Is there anything we need to be cognizant of as we go into Q1, which I think is usually a seasonally weak quarter. Any color you can give on the quarterly cadence would be helpful on modeling. Thanks so much. -- Sure, yeah. I think at this point in time, historic seasonality that we've seen in the business that generally would have Q1 represent close to 20% of the full year is probably the right way to think about it. We've seen where the street has modeled currently 2020, I think we feel good about that. So I think you guys have got to dialed in pretty well in terms of how you're thinking about seasonality.I do think, over time, as the business continues to mature, as you get more revenue flowing through the pharmacy channel, as Medicare continues to represent a bigger part of the overall business, that seasonality may begin to change a bit, but probably not in 2020. I think historic trends are a good way to think about it, and roughly 20% is probably the right way to model.Thank you. Our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. -- Thanks. Quentin, just a follow-up on the 2020 guidance. I mean if I look at the implied leverage for 2020 relative to '18 and '19, the implied leverage for '20 is a little lower just looking at revenue dollars versus the Op expense. Is the right way to think about this year kind of the guidance reflects the expenses that are sort of dialed in for the year and that incremental upside, if there is going to be incremental upside to revenue, that is likely to fall down at a higher rate? Thanks so much. -- Yeah. So I think what you'll see is we'll continue to be very disciplined in how we manage the business. David, to your point, in the last 24 months, we've driven about 2,200 basis points of opex leverage in this business. So the team has been very thoughtful, accountable, disciplined in how we steward our resources, but we also see some significant opportunities sitting in front of us to really pour some investment into.For example, in '19, we never really poured the fuel on the fire from a DTC spend perspective in the commercial business. We didn't have the capacity from a manufacturing perspective to really open that channel up and support the demand that we thought it might create. We will open DTC up in a meaningful way in 2020, and that is contemplated in our spend. As that drives revenue, if it drives it beyond kind of how we guided, then I think to your point, we'd be very thoughtful and disciplined around how we let that flow through.And yes, I would think that it would drive incremental margin. But we want to make sure we're not passing on the investment opportunities around things like DTC, what we're learning in the new market efforts, particularly around that non-intensive population and knowing that we can take cost out of caring for these patients. We're going to make sure we set that up for success into the future. So that's where we're investing at.If revenue outperforms, then I think you'll see us perform well on the margin front.Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Rose from Canaccord. Your line is now open.Kyle William RoseGreat. Thank you very much for taking the questions, and congrats on a strong year and quarter.Steve, you talked a little bit about some of the non-intensive type 2 opportunities. But at the Analyst Day, you also you broke out opportunities like hospital use and gestational use. It looks like there will be some gestational data at next week's ATTD, but just wanted to kind of understand how we should think about when those potential opportunities start flowing through the model in 2021 and beyond? -- Yeah. So if you're asking specifically about opportunities outside of non-intensive non-insulin-using type 2s, certainly, there's work being done. There's research being done. You're going to see basically a cascade.As we've kind of done some preliminary work in the clinical side, we've recognized that type 2 non-intensive would be the next logical kind of lowest-hanging fruit for us. So that's where you're going to see us -- what you're going to see us go after first with probably hospital being a close second. In terms of gestational, like you said, it's an exciting market, but a little bit more limited in terms of touch points in the OB/GYN's offices and things like that. So we're working on a strategy there as well.We need to update our labeling, certainly, for hospital and for pregnancy, and there's some initiatives under way there. But you're going to see a cascade of what I would say, incremental increasing contribution over the next several years in all of those categories.Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew O'Brien from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. -- Thank you. It's actually Piper Sandler. But would love to ask a multipart question that I'm sure Kevin will hate. But I just want to follow-up a little bit more on the non-intensive type 2 commentary.First of all, you're not signaling any kind of concern about a slowdown in your traditional intensive managed group? And then secondly, I don't know if it's for Steve or not. But if you kind of frame up the opportunity that you're thinking about there. There's 1.5 million type 1s, 1.7 million MDI patients. Is this non-intensive group around that level? And can you access that group without some level of reimbursement? -- This is Kevin. And I can take both of those. We do not believe at all that our intensive business is going to slow down. And in fact, as we look at our strategy, our first pillar is to continue to serve that patient base and continue to grow there.With CGM penetration still, on a combined basis, in the 35% to 40% range in the U.S. and much less than that in other geographies, there is plenty of room to grow. And as CGM becomes a standard of care here, again, I've said for a number of years, I think 80% market penetration is possible and I will hold to that certainly here in the U.S. So there's plenty of room to grow in the intensive business, particularly as we get more automated integrated systems out on the market.With respect to the type 2 non-intensive business, no, we're not talking 1.5 million to 1.7 million people, we're talking 30 million people in the U.S. and hundreds of million of people around the world. I'll address that a little bit more of my closing comments and things that we've learned, but we believe CGM has a tremendous, tremendous benefit there. And we're going to make sure that we can maximize that in the space.But thanks, it's a good question.Thank you. Our next question comes from Mathew Blackman from Stifel. Your line is now open.Mathew Justin BlackmanGood afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question.Quentin, you called out DTC as an investment priority in 2020. So can you talk about the magnitude of returns you get on DTC investment dollars? And then how quickly do you typically see those returns manifesting in revenues? Thanks. -- Yeah. So you'll see us start to turn DTC spend on really in the back half of the year. Our goal from a capacity perspective is to double where we exited 2019 by the time we get to the mid part of 2020. So we will double capacity once again by the mid part.Once we are there, we feel like we've built enough supply that we can handle any demand that might come from the DTC efforts. It's one of the highest returns on any investment we can make in the company. We monitor it very closely. It's not something that I'm going to disclose in terms of exactly what that rate is, but I will tell you, it's one of the best investments we make.And typically, it's going to take a couple of months to start to see that turn back up into real tangible results in the business, but you could see some benefit in the back part of the year.Thank you. Our next question comes from Raj Denhoy from Jefferies. Your line is now open. -- Hi, good evening. Quentin, I have a question, actually, coming into 2019, you had talked about kind of absorbing 10 points of mix, price mix offset due to the channel mix that you're experiencing. I guess, this year, it sounds like $150 million, it's roughly another 10 points. When do you imagine that settles out? Is there a point at which the price of the sensor is at a point where you're more normalized and perhaps are not absorbing that level of impact every year? -- Yeah. Well, I think what we've demonstrated, Raj, is that our strategy to walk price down over time and have volume more than offset that has played out incredibly well. We started to walk price down, really two years ago. And we walked it down again last year.You're going to feel that impact this year. But we've got a price point or a revenue per patient point in mind that we're trying to get to. And there's probably a couple more years, 2020 being one of those that we'll continue to feel this from. And I think volume will more than offset it, but then we're at a very, very good price point that we feel great when you consider the fact that we'll be bringing G7 into the market at that price point.We feel like we're set up to compete incredibly well. So there's probably a couple of years here that we'll continue to navigate through it and have volume more than offset it, but then we're at a point where we think is quite sustainable into the future with an incredible product being G7.Thank you. Our next question comes from Ravi Misra with Berenberg Capital. Your line is now open.Ravi MisraHi, good afternoon. So just a question on -- just a little bit on the transmitter revenues, pretty strong quarter there on that line item more so than we had expected.Can you just walk us a little bit through what was the reason behind that strength in terms of reorders or new patient starts? Thanks. -- Yeah, I think you continue to see the strength of the new patient numbers show up there. I will point out the fact that if you just look at it from a comp perspective, there was a bit of an easier comp on the transmitter line than there was on the sensor line in the fourth quarter. So if you go back a year ago and look at sensor versus transmitter revenue, there was an easier comp sitting on that transmitter line that drove a little bit of that growth. I would just make sure you contemplate that.And then keep in mind, as we continue to evolve as a company, as we continue to think through our pricing strategy and position ourselves in a way that we can very easily step into the G7 product, which is a very different form factor, where the sensor and the transmitter are one unit versus two distinct units in G6, it ends up in account -- having a bit of an impact on how we account for the revenue in each one of those buckets. So we're going to have to contemplate the revenue buckets that we continue to report into the future. We want to make sure we're giving you something that is the right way to think about the business and model it. But what you're seeing play through that right now is just a little bit of an accounting nuance in how we allocate revenue based upon these new pricing strategies.Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Lichtman from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. -- Thank you. Hi, guys. On international, obviously, it's been very strong, and there's been a lot of breadth there. As you look ahead, just one of the countries, I think, later this year, Steve, you mentioned is Japan.Can you talk a little bit more about when you think you'll have that launched and what the opportunity is on the personnel side in Japan looking ahead? -- Yeah, so the hope is to have a personal-use CGM in G6 approved in the first half of this year. Kind of the big still unknown, if you will, is whether -- and to what extent we get reimbursement for that product. So if it comes in this cycle. That's great.If not, it could come next year or the year after. So I would tell you that growth, like in all of our outside of the U.S. markets, growth is really instigated by reimbursement. So we're taking a little bit of a wait and see approach there.And we're certainly going to launch the product in Japan once we get approval. But as you know, in the cash pay world, it's not always as easy. So I'd say wait for updates on the reimbursement front on Japan is really what you're looking for.Thank you. And our final question comes from Marie Thibault from BTIG. Your line is now open. -- Thanks for taking the question. Nice to see such a great year. I'll wrap it up. I wanted to hear a little bit more about details on your plans for the third manufacturing site OUS.And what cadence or milestones we should be looking for throughout 2020 as it impacts the gross margin line? -- Sure. So we couldn't be more excited about the opportunity that sits in front of us in our core business, but as well, the international business. We're very early in the stages of really taking advantage of that market. We probably have sub 15% of that opportunity.And I think over time, you're going to see us put a lot of focus and effort there and standing up a manufacturing capability that gets much closer to the end user is a very strategic move on our part while also identifying locations where we can ultimately reduce the overall cost of production that will let us compete in the lower price environment. So strategically, it makes a tremendous amount of sense. You'll hear us talk more about it over the course of the year as we settle in on exactly where we select to start to build out that capability. But what we know is that these things take multiple years to stand up.We won't be producing out of that facility for a couple of years here. But we've got to start the work now to ensure that once we get the full capacity in our San Diego and Mesa facilities, we're ready to step right into that international opportunity and ensure that we have no impact on supply. So we're getting ahead of it, ensuring that we don't hold up the business, and we're excited about what it can do for us.And that concludes our question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Kevin Sayer for closing comments. -- Thank you very much, and thanks, everybody, for participating today. Last week, we had all of the leaders of our company around the world here in San Diego for a leadership summit. We wanted to accomplish a couple of things. The first thing we wanted to do is celebrate 2019 like we did today on this call for the amazing year that we had.And the theme is universal around that group. We did have an amazing year, but growth like this is hard. And I want to thank our people for all their hard work. The second thing we wanted to do is lay out our plans to our group, and what we intend to do and what we expect for the future, similar to how we have in our investor conferences, that we will never leave our core markets and we'll continue to care for our intensively managed patients and offer the best alternative there and then move this great technology to other applications with a focus on type 2 diabetes.As I left that summit, oftentimes, we get them -- things reaffirm what you said and what you tell people. Not long after leaving the summit on the intensive management side, we got to note from a provider about one of their patients, a young woman who had an A1c above 13. And she was wondering if she would ever have children because she was afraid what would happen to the child because of her poor diabetes control. After six months on DexCom, her A1c is down to five, and she is expecting her first child.Great outcome, and that's why we're committed to this business. On the type 2 side, in the past two weeks, I've had conversations with a couple of physicians and asked the following question, how often should people with type 2 diabetes be wearing a CGM? Because we hear numerous answers as we go about on the community, and to my surprise, both of them looked at me and said, all the time. They should be wearing this thing all the time. You need to figure out a way to do it.Hence, another facility, hence, we continue to grow and expand, and hence, we continue to invest in our business on the R&D side and on the commercial side. We couldn't be more bullish about our company than we are today, and thanks, everybody, for listening.[Operator signoff] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

The big gain came following the company's  after the market closed on Thursday.DexCom reported Q4 revenue of $462.8 million, up 37% year over year and well above the average analysts' estimate of $442.4 million. It also announced adjusted earnings of $106.5 million, or $1.15 per share. This reflected significant improvement from adjusted earnings of $50.2 million, or $0.56 per share, posted in the prior-year period. It also blew past the consensus Wall Street earnings estimate of $0.74 per share.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images.When a company beats estimates the way DexCom did with its Q4 results, its stock is bound to jump. The key question to ask, though, is:  did the company top estimates?In DexCom's case, the answer is simple. The company's G6 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems continue to enjoy strong customer demand. And that strong demand isn't just in the U.S. DexCom's international sales grew even faster than its U.S. sales did in the fourth quarter.This momentum seems likely to continue. Diabetes remains a serious problem across the world. Real-time CGM offers a way for patients to keep their diabetes under control.DexCom's nice jump today probably won't fade away.

Diabetes is quickly becoming one of the most prevalent diseases in the world. Right now, 425 million people around the world are living with the condition, and estimates suggest that number will grow to 629 million by 2045.One promising diabetes stock is , a well-known manufacturer of insulin pumps. While there are a couple of other noteworthy players in this market, Insulet has impressed investors and analysts alike with its consistent and impressive growth figures.Is it enough to warrant a position in your portfolio, though? Let's look at some of the details and find out.Image source: Getty Images.Insulin pumps help diabetes patients regulate their blood sugar levels by providing consistent doses of insulin throughout the day. Most diabetes patients aren't currently using insulin pumps, but given the convenience factor, it's expected that many patients will begin using them in the years to come.\u00a0Around 350,000 people in the U.S. are using insulin pumps; 320,000 of them have type 1 diabetes, and the remainder have type 2. Considering the severity of type 1 diabetes patients, whose pancreases are incapable of producing insulin, it makes sense that the majority of early adopters of these pumps fall in this category. However, type 2 diabetes patients can also use these pumps.While 350,000 users may not seem like a massive number right now, the number of patients using these devices is expected to explode over the coming years. In 2018, the global insulin pump market was estimated at around $4.1 billion, but by 2025, it's predicted it will grow to $16 billion per year.Among other reasons, there's a pretty big convenience factor that comes with using these pumps. Instead of patients having to inject themselves multiple times per day with insulin, these pumps are low maintenance and do the job for them.Insulet is one of three major competitors in the insulin pump market; the other two companies are\u00a0 and . Insulet is known for its OmniPod system, which is the top tubeless insulin pump available right now. The OmniPod is both waterproof and discreet when worn under clothing.Tandem Diabetes' t:slim X2 insulin pump isn't waterproof, requires tubing, and is much more conspicuous, so at least for now, the OmniPod is able to distinguish itself from its competitor. The biggest problem for the OmniPod is that it doesn't feature a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system like the t:slim does. 's CGM system is considered the top system of its kind.Although Insulet's OmniPod doesn't come with Dexcom's monitoring system (whereas Tandem's t:slim already does), that's expected to change quickly. Insulet is planning to launch the OmniPod Horizon system later in 2020, which will incorporate the Dexcom monitor to automate insulin dosing for patients.What's truly impressive about Insulet is its growth over the past few years. In the company's most recent Q3 2019 financial results, revenue is up 27% from last year, growing from $151.1 million to $192.1 million. Looking further back, 2017 sales came in around $121.8 million, while income in 2016 was $94.9 million. This strong trend of revenue growth is impressive and shows little sign of slowing down.Actual profits, though, are less striking. Net income for the most recent quarter was just $900,000, whereas last year saw net income of $1.7 million. While it's common for high-growth companies such as Insulet to focus more on growth rather than profit, investors should keep in mind that this stock is barely breaking even despite its growth.However, when we compare financial figures with Insulet's competitors, primarily Tandem Diabetes, Insulet's financial figures aren't that special. Tandem is less than half the size of Insulet and is growing at a much faster rate. Sales shot up by 105% in Q3 2019 to $94.7 million, and while Tandem reported a net loss of $2.9 million, it's a significant improvement from the $34.2 million loss seen in the previous year.Data sources: YCharts, Insulet, Tandem Diabetes, and Medtronic. YOY = year over year.Despite growing at a slower rate than Tandem, Insulet trades at a pricier premium. Insulet's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is currently 18.7, in comparison to Tandem's 14.8. The only other major player in the insulin pump market, Medtronic, is much larger than either Tandem or Insulet, commanding a market cap of $156.3 billion in comparison to Tandem's $4.9 billion or Insulet's $12.7 billion. However, Medtronic's P/S ratio is just 5.1, substantially cheaper than either of its two competitors (although its revenue is growing at a much smaller pace, so it's far from a perfect comparison).The point, here, is that Insulet is definitely on the pricier side in comparison to its competitors, and it's not immediately clear what justifies this premium. While Insulet is technically profitable, it's also growing slower than some of its rivals, something that is much more important for high-growth companies in such a young market.The reality of the insulin pump market is that there's plenty of room to grow, and all of the main players in this sector are expecting growth rates to stay strong for quite some time, including\u00a0. By all accounts, the company has a very bright future ahead of it.However, compared to its competitors, it might not be the best insulin pump/diabetes stock on the market right now. If I were forced to pick just one stock in this market, I'm not sure Insulet would be it. However, that's not to say Insulet is a bad company by any means: Strong growth, a competitive product, and a very promising market make this \u00a0a buy in my book.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But the sector picked up some steam in the last three months of the year as those worries subsided and investors turned to the sector looking for opportunities that could hold up well if the economy turns down.  and   are two very successful healthcare companies that appeal to different sorts of investors. DexCom is a pure play in one of the hottest areas in healthcare, while Abbott Labs is a diversified, steady performer. Which one wins the nod as the better stock to own for the next few years?DexCom specializes in one type of medical device for people with diabetes, continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), and has been wildly successful in that space. The company's current line of monitors uses a small sensor inserted under the skin and a Bluetooth transmitter that connects to a DexCom receiver, a smartphone, or a smartwatch.

Through the first three quarters of 2019, revenue is up a whopping 46% to $1.01 billion, and non- (adjusted) earnings per share are $0.69, up from a loss of $0.19 in the first nine months of 2018.Abbott Labs also makes CGMs, but it's a broadly diversified healthcare company that's over 20 times the size of DexCom and sells more than 1,500 products. The company has four business segments: Medical devices (at 38% of revenue)\u00a0is the company's biggest, along with diagnostics, nutrition, and established pharmaceuticals.All four segments are contributing to Abbott's steady but relatively unspectacular growth. Overall, the company has grown year-to-date revenue by 7.4% on an organic basis (that is, excluding currency effects and the effect of a discontinued business) to $23.6 billion. Revenue from medical devices has grown 10.2% organically over the prior year, pharmaceuticals are up 6.5%, diagnostics has grown 5.7%, and nutrition 5.2%. Earnings per share are up 10.6% to $2.29.Abbott's glucose monitor, FreeStyle Libre, actually outsells DexCom's and is growing faster. The Abbott CGM generated $496 million in revenue in Q3, compared with $396 million for DexCom's. Sales growth for the product line was 63%, beating DexCom's 49% growth in the quarter.DexCom's rapid growth will , although perhaps at a somewhat slower pace. In a recent update, the company gave muted guidance of revenue growth between 17% and 21% in 2020, down from 42% growth in 2019, but the company regularly underpromises and then beats expectations.DexCom's G6 glucose monitoring system. Image source: DexCom.DexCom's core customers are diabetes patients on intensive insulin therapy who need to regulate blood glucose level to within a range. That market is growing with the diabetes epidemic, and DexCom has plenty of runway. Only about 15% of the type 2 diabetes patients in the U.S. on intensive therapy are using CGMs. The company is gearing up to launch an improved version of its devices in late 2020, which should boost sales and improve profits due to a lower manufacturing cost.Longer term, DexCom has plenty of room to grow outside its core market, though. The company is growing its sales team to market to hospitals for glucose monitoring in inpatient settings and is conducting studies with pregnant women for management of gestational diabetes. Ultimately, the larger population of patients with type 2 diabetes who aren't on intensive diabetes therapy and even the 84 million people\u00a0in the U.S. who are pre-diabetic could be part of the company's addressable market. Monitoring blood glucose could become an important part of controlling diet and exercise to halt the progression of the disease.Sales of Abbott's CGM may be growing faster than Dexcom's, but they're small compared with the overall total for the company. Fortunately for Abbott's shareholders, the company has other bright spots that are driving growth.Abbott's Alinity ci-series. Image source: Abbott Laboratories.Abbott's MitraClip, an implant to repair leaky heart valves, is growing sales at over 30%. Alinity is a family of high-throughput systems for core laboratory testing such as blood chemistry analysis, and the recent rollout of the products in Europe is helping to grow that product line in double digits. Abbott's established pharmaceuticals business is focused on selling branded-generic medicines into emerging markets, where demographics and improving standards of living are tailwinds for growth.There really aren't any weak points in Abbott's highly diversified business, which makes . It is guiding toward non-GAAP EPS growth of about 12% for 2019, and it should be able to maintain growth at about that rate for years.DexCom doesn't pay dividends, but Abbott is a Dividend Aristocrat, having increased its payout for 48 consecutive years. Last month  a healthy 12.5%, and it now yields 1.6%.Shares are priced to reflect the massive growth that investors expect to see from the business. The stock sells for 122 times the analyst consensus estimate for earnings in 2020, which assumes about 33% growth from 2019.Abbott's stock sells for about 25 times expected 2020 EPS, which is much cheaper than DexCom, but doesn't exactly put the stock in \u00a0territory given a growth rate in the low teens.Given DexCom's strong business momentum and wide-open avenues for long-term growth, I think investors will continue to award the stock a high multiple and the shares will likely outperform those of Abbott Labs over the next few years. But DexCom's valuation adds risk to the stock, and there is also a good chance the investors will have a bumpy ride on the way to gains, especially if the market turns down and shuns risk for a time. DexCom would be my pick for risk-tolerant  investors.Abbott Laboratories is more suitable for some investors, though.

When I was researching  on the subject, I was surprised by the winners. I had no idea that any of these companies had run up so far. But at least I had heard of most of these stocks; companies like\u00a0,\u00a0, and\u00a0\u00a0are familiar to a lot of Fools.\u00a0On the other hand, two of the best healthcare stocks over the past decade were complete mysteries to me. Both of these companies were micro-caps in 2010, and they went on to have magnificent runs.\u00a0 had a 19-bagger for the decade, and\u00a0 returned 2,000% to its investors. Let's dig a little deeper into them.Image source: Getty Images.Accelerate Diagnostics is a fascinating medical device company. Accelerate sells a device called the Accelerate Pheno, a small machine that tests for bacteria and fungus infections right in the hospital. The status quo is to run a test on a patient, send it off to a lab, and get the response back in two to three days. With Accelerate Pheno, the doctors can get a response back in a matter of hours, and that speed makes a big difference in treatment.When you are invaded with bacteria or fungus, your body can have an extreme immune response, called sepsis. About 270,000 people die from sepsis every year in the United States. Sepsis also costs hospitals an estimated $27 billion each year \u2014 it's the No.1 cause of hospitalizations in the U.S. Most of these sepsis deaths are preventable if the doctors know what the infection is.Speed is paramount in these situations, and the Accelerate Pheno cuts the wait time by 75%. It's over 40 hours faster than traditional methods.\u00a0It's early in the company's story.\u00a0Right now, it's broadening its focus from selling to the top hospitals (influencers) to selling to all hospitals. In the last quarter, Accelerate reported 167 instruments sold so far in 2019.\u00a0There are 6,146 hospitals in the U.S., so there's a huge runway for growth.\u00a0\u00a0One exciting thing about Accelerate Diagnostics is that the company has a  business model. It sells its Accelerate Pheno\u00a0in a one-time purchase, and then racks up recurring revenue from the use of the device. Once the hospital buys the machine, high-margin future revenue is pretty much assured -- consumables (the recurring revenues from the use of the device) are growing by 150%.Accelerate recently hired a new chief operating officer, Jack Phillips, who will become CEO when Lawrence Mehren retires next month. Phillips was the CEO of Roche Diagnostics, a subsidiary of\u00a0. Roche is a mega-cap ($275 billion), so to have the chief executive of its diagnostic division step down to become COO of a tiny company deserves attention.Sales are expected to start ramping this year, and insiders are getting excited. Tom Brown, a member of the board of directors and a former executive at , recently bought $136,000 worth of shares on the open market, at a price of $14 a share.\u00a0Simulations Plus has been around for 24 years, growing\u00a0from a tiny micro-cap into a $600 million .\u00a0Its modeling software is used by 19 of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies, as well as many biotechs and .\u00a0Simulation Plus offers an array of software, including its flagship product, Gastro Plus, a modeling platform that simulates various absorption rates of molecules through all the major dosing routes. It's faster and cheaper to do these tests on the computer than in the lab. One of the modules of Gastro Plus allows scientists to test for drug-drug interactions. The company also sells ADMET Predictor, a software that analyzes absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity of various molecules.The company rang up $8 million in revenue in its most recent quarter, growing its top line about 20% from the same period the previous year. Its profit margin sits at 25%, with\u00a0$11 million in cash and no debt. One worry with Simulations Plus is how expensive the stock is, with a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 70 and a PEG ratio () over 4.\u00a0. But it's clearly a well-respected name in the pharmaceutical space. If the company can fortify its current business with new offerings, the stock should continue to advance.Right now it seems that Accelerate Diagnostics has a much larger market opportunity than Simulations Plus. The vast majority of hospitals don't have a Pheno yet, so most of the company's revenue is still ahead of it.\u00a0 In addition, once those sales are made, Accelerate will have continuous revenue streams into the future.Simulations Plus, on the other hand, has already made sales to 19 of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies. That's an enviable record, but it also makes you wonder if the company has any room to make new sales. Simulations Plus will either have to make additional sales to existing customers or sell its software to smaller and smaller firms.Also worrisome is that Simulations Plus' software is not based in the cloud; its model is the old \"one and done\" software sale, with a buyer who installs the software and owns a perpetual license. And some of the company's revenue comes from consulting fees, a business that doesn't scale well at all. Nonetheless, it might be an outstanding acquisition for a larger player like\u00a0.Simulations Plus is definitely a stock to keep on your watch list.

Over the last , shareholders have been rewarded with a 2,563% return. DexCom achieved that impressive return with a singular focus on diabetes. Traditionally, people with diabetes had to prick their finger to check their blood in order to monitor their insulin level. DexCom introduced a wireless device inserted under their skin. This sensor, called a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), is appreciated by patients because of its ease of use and valued by doctors because of its superior data and better health outcomes.DexCom recently signed a distribution deal with\u00a0\u00a0to . Patients insert a tiny sensor under the skin using an automatic applicator.\u00a0DexCom's sensor starts automatically and continuously taking glucose readings in the patient's interstitial fluid.

The CGM can also be set to alert the patient if certain glucose levels are reached. \u00a0\u00a0In its , DexCom reported $396 million in revenue for the quarter, 49% higher than the previous year.

That's a good return, of course, but not impressive enough to make this list.Our top 10 is filled with medical device makers and companies that are providing services to the healthcare industry. Only three drug companies made it to the top. If you invested $1,000 in each of these 10 companies on Jan. 4, 2010, 10 years later your portfolio would be worth $247,607.

Such a review could help investors with their stock picking. Lists of past huge winners are often great places to look for future winners if you subscribe to the theory that \"winners often keep winning.\" Moreover, such a review might spark some insight as to what makes for a big long-term winner.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images.The stocks are listed by descending order of their return over the just-ended decade. (To\u00a0avoid listing stocks that were quite tiny and obscure 10 years ago, only stocks that ended the decade with market caps of at least $10 billion, meaning they're \"large caps,\" are on the list.)Data sources: Yahoo! Finance and YCharts. EPS = earnings per share.If singer Meat Loaf is right that \"two out of three ain't bad,\" then the profitability profile of our group is slightly better than \"ain't bad.\" Seven of the 10 are profitable on a trailing-12-month basis, while Exact Sciences (No. 4), DexCom (No. 5), and Cheniere Energy (No. 6) are not.\u00a0There are probably just two companies among the decade's 10 best performers that the vast majority of Americans would know -- Netflix and Domino's Pizza -- and they top our list. This is probably not entirely coincidental. There's a reason these consumer-focused companies are so well known: They sell products or services that are extremely popular. That strong demand for their offerings has driven their financial performances, which in turn, has powered their stocks' performances.While Netflix and Domino's are in entirely different businesses, they have a key commonality that's at the core of their immense success: They're both pioneers. Netflix's pioneering of video streaming disrupted the massive cable TV and movie theater industries and largely put video rental stores out of business.\u00a0Investors should monitor competition, which continues to heat up. Notably,  launched a broad streaming offering in November.Domino's pioneered pizza delivery on a large scale. It offered a key service feature that set it apart from the largely mom-and-pop pizza delivery competition: guaranteed delivery in less than 30 minutes. Its stores are also open considerably later than most independent pizza shops, so it can be the only option for many consumers who get a late-night hankering for pizza delivery.\u00a0MarketAxess (No. 3) and Fair Isaac (No. 9) could be described as financial-tech companies, though one also might consider Fair Isaac a tech company. MarketAxess operates the leading electronic bond-trading platform\u00a0for institutional investors and dealers. It's been benefiting from the shift in bond trading to online platforms.Fair Isaac describes itself as a \"leading analytics software company.\"\u00a0While the company might not be a household name, its flagship product -- the FICO credit score -- is quite well known. Fair Isaac also offers a wide range of other products and services for various industries aimed at helping management run their businesses better. Legendary investor Warren Buffett owns the stock in his  portfolio, which is certainly a good endorsement.With stocks ranking No. 4 (Exact\u00a0Sciences) and No. 5 (DexCom), the healthcare sector makes a healthy showing on the decade's list of stock champs. While both these stocks are unprofitable on a trailing-12-month basis, DexCom recently achieved solid quarterly profitability.\u00a0In 2014, Exact Sciences launched its initial product,\u00a0Cologuard, the first stool DNA test for colorectal cancer. \u00a0It aims to build the \"world's leading advanced cancer diagnostics company,\" according to CEO Kevin Conroy.\u00a0The company made a notable step toward that goal in November when it closed on its $2.8 billion acquisition of Genomic Health, which makes tests for breast, colon, and prostate cancer that use advanced genomic science to optimize cancer treatment decisions.\u00a0DexCom makes a\u00a0continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system, the G6, for people living with diabetes. G6 has been a big winner for the company, with third-quarter revenue soaring 49% year over year.\u00a0With the global population getting older and heavier, the incidence of diabetes is on track to continue to increase.The remaining big winners on our list include one energy stock (No. 6, Cheniere Energy), two industrial stocks (No. 7, TransDigm, and No. 10, United Rentals), and one technology stock (No. 8, Broadcom).Cheniere Energy\u00a0is an energy company primarily engaged in liquid natural gas (LNG)-related businesses. It \"owns and operates the Sabine Pass LNG receiving terminal and Creole Trail Pipeline located in Louisiana, through [its] general partner ownership interest in and management agreements with Cheniere Energy Partners,\" according to its website. It has several development projects under way.TransDigm is a leading global designer and manufacturer of highly engineered aerospace components, systems, and subsystems. It got notably larger last year thanks to its acquisition of Esterline Technologies. A big thing to like about TransDigm is that its operating margin is significantly higher than others in its industry.Broadcom\u00a0is focused on semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. It targets seven markets: data center, networking, software, broadband, wireless, storage, and industrial.United Rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world with locations across the U.S. and Canada. \u00a0Its stock can be expected to be quite cyclical since it largely serves the construction industry.

This medical device exchange-traded fund (ETF) also trounced the 18% gain delivered by the , which includes stocks from across the healthcare sector.Will 2020 be another great year for medical device stocks? I think so. Here are three top medical device stocks you can buy in January to profit from the booming industry.Image source: Getty Images.  ranks as one of the most attractive  on the market right now, in my view. While Abbott's 20% return in 2019 lagged behind the broader market indexes and many other medical device stocks, I expect 2020 will be a big year for the healthcare giant.The biggest catalyst for Abbott should be the anticipated FDA clearance for the new version of its popular Freestyle Libre continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. This new version of Freestyle Libre supports interoperability with other devices and will include alarms, features that will enable Abbott to compete even more effectively against 's\u00a0G6 CGM.But Freestyle Libre isn't the only thing Abbott has going for it. The company markets a wide range of products that generated close to $32 billion in sales last year. Among those were several new products that, along with Freestyle Libre, are important growth drivers for Abbott, including Alinity\u00a0diagnostic systems and MitraClip mitral regurgitation devices.Investors should also like Abbott Labs' dividend. The company , marking its 48th consecutive year of dividend increases. Abbott's dividend currently yields close to 1.7%.  is another big medical device stock that underperformed a bit last year. The robotic surgical systems maker delivered a gain of more than 23%, which isn't too shabby but wasn't quite as good as some medical device stocks. But my view is that Intuitive should remain one of the steadiest winners on the market.The key reason behind my long-term optimism about Intuitive Surgical is its 21st-century version of the old razor-and-blades business model. Intuitive derives over 70% of its total revenue from recurring sources, primarily replacement instruments and accessories for its da Vinci robotic surgical systems. This recurring revenue continues to grow as the company sells and leases more systems and as customers use robotic surgery for more procedures.Procedure volumes will almost certainly increase due to two key factors: demographic trends and product innovation. With aging populations in the U.S. and across the world, more surgeries that are ideally suited for robotic assistance will be performed. Intuitive Surgical also continues to launch new products like its\u00a0Ion robotic system for lung biopsy and da Vinci SP for transoral surgery, which expands the types of procedures for which its technology can be used.I also expect that robotic surgery will gain more widespread acceptance and adoption with new rivals entering the market. Although increased competition usually isn't great news for a stock, my view is that the moves by \u00a0and others to launch new products will expand the robotic surgery market and .Unlike Abbott Labs and Intuitive Surgical,   handily beat the broader market indexes last year, with the stock skyrocketing 44%. The small medical device company took investors on a roller-coaster ride, however, more than doubling by May, , and then rebounding.I like ShockWave because I like the potential for its technology. The company uses intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) to break up calcium deposits in patients with\u00a0atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries. It's a simple process and arguably a safer approach than traditional methods used to treat the problem, such as balloons and minimally invasive surgery. And lithotripsy has been used for decades to break up kidney stones made of calcium without harming surrounding tissues.ShockWave also has a huge potential market. Different types of\u00a0atherosclerosis that the company is targeting combined represent an annual sales opportunity of more than $6 billion. ShockWave plans to launch new products in 2020 and expand into new international markets this year, both of which represent key catalysts for the stock.There are a couple of downsides for ShockWave, though. It isn't profitable yet and could have to issue more shares in the future to raise cash (as it did in November 2019), a move that would dilute the value of existing shares. Also, the stock is valued at a steep premium, with shares trading at nearly 36 times trailing-12-month sales. Any bumps in the road will likely cause ShockWave's share price to plunge. Still, my view is that the growth prospects for ShockWave make it a stock for aggressive investors to seriously consider buying.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Some will generate returns, while others will harvest losses. Some will soar magnificently, while others will crash and find it hard to reignite. The eternal question for the intrepid investor remains unchanged, though; which are the ones bound for fortune and, conversely, which are the ones to avoid.While nothing is certain, there are ways to help make the right decision. TipRanks\u2019  tool tracks 8 key metrics and uses the results to score stocks accordingly. The tool displays the most compelling investments and gives them a Smart Score; from 1, down in the doldrums, all the way up to a \u201cPerfect 10\u201d at the peak of the summit.In this case, the data crunching tool recognized 3 healthcare stocks, which not only display Strong Buy status but also earned a \u201cPerfect 10\u201d Smart Score. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the data at hand.In the rollercoaster world of healthcare so much hinges on the FDA\u2019s approval or rejection of a new drug. Of course, it\u2019s imperative to look at the bigger picture, and realize what these companies are trying to achieve in terms of their respective therapies. There is no doubt, though, that especially in this sector, the market reacts dramatically to both good and bad news.One such company looking forward to an FDA decision in the new year is biopharma Horizon Therapeutics. The company\u2019s focus is on rare and rheumatic conditions, and a PDUFA date of March 8 will determine the future of Horizon\u2019s teprotumumab drug, a treatment for active thyroid eye disease (TED). The disease can potentially lead to loss of vision and the drug could be the first treatment for TED to gain approval from the FDA.Clinical trials in both Phases 2 and 3 have displayed positive data, and an approval will add the treatment to a portfolio that the company thinks will generate between $1.28 billion and $1.31 billion in net sales in 2019.Piper Jaffray\u2019s  believes Horizon is \"on the cusp of a seminal milestone.\" The analyst reveals in a note to clients that a recent physician survey indicated positive feedback for the drug and the approval of teprotumumab will lead to a \"relatively high probability of wide adoption.\" Amsellem sees \"ample room for significant further value creation\u201d and thinks Horizon shares are set for multiple expansion.Unsurprisingly, then, Amsellem reiterated his Overweight rating and raised his price target from $36 to $49, which represents a potential upside of 36% from current levels. (To watch Amsellem\u2019s track record, )The rest of the Street backs the Piper Jaffray analyst unanimously; all the analysts, 7 to be precise, tracked over the last 3 months, rate the biopharma a Buy; Therefore, Horizon has a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average price target of $40.57 indicates upside potential of 12%. (While the market has provided plentiful returns in 2019, not many have performed better than biotech Aravive. The micro-cap, which is focused on treatments for life threatening diseases, has added almost 300% to its share price throughout the year.Aravive\u2019s lead candidate is AVB-500, a treatment for ovarian cancer and IgA nephropathy (kidney fibrosis). Recent data from a Phase 1b clinical trial of the drug in platinum-resistant recurrent ovarian cancer patients displayed positive results, with the study showing that women taking the drug exhibited higher rates of progression free survival. It is still early, though, and the trial was small, with only 31 patients.The company recently began a Phase IIa study of AVB-500 in IgA nephropathy patients, and Piper Jaffray\u2019s  noted the predictive modeling shows that AVB-500 \"should provide sufficient exposure for therapeutic efficacy and may support a pivotal trial start next year.\u201dThe 5-star analyst reiterated an Overweight rating, alongside a price target of $31. This implies upside potential of an excellent 125%. (To watch Tenthoff\u2019s track record, )Further adding to the bull\u2019s case is Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s , who believes \u201cpositive data readouts from Aravive's pipeline will drive shares higher.\u201d Chen rates ARAV an Overweight alongside a $30 price target. (To watch Chen\u2019s track record, )Over the last three months, two other analysts have joined the bullish pair with an opinion on Aravive. Both also rate the biotech a Buy, which grants Aravive a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average price target of $28.50 implies upside potential of 109%. ()The synergy between technology and healthcare is constantly on the rise. The development of new tech enables treatment focused companies to break new ground and solve people\u2019s day to day issues in ways not possible only a few years ago.This brings us to DexCom, the maker of the CGM (continuous glucose monitoring) system. The system enables diabetics to track and manage sugar levels by inserting a small sensor underneath the skin. The sensor measures glucose levels and through a transmitter which is fastened on top, wirelessly sends the data to a smart device.Statistics have shown that over 30 million people had diabetes in 2015 (over 9% of the population) and a further 84 million adults have had prediabetes, which if not treated, is a possible gateway to full blown diabetes. Although the numbers are alarming, they present significant market opportunity for Dexcom\u2019s sugar monitoring products.The company has had an excellent 2019 and its share price skyrocketed over 80%. The recent third-quarter report helped continue the upward trend, with revenue of $396 million exhibiting growth of 49% from the previous year\u2019s same period.Merrill Lynch\u2019s  thinks Dexcom\u2019s 2019 performance is set to continue in the new year and rates the stock a \u201ctop idea for 2020.\u201d The 5-star analyst highlights the company\u2019s \u201ccompetitive moat\u201d and thinks DexCom is undervalued by the Street.Therefore, Steed reiterated a Buy rating on DXCM and raised his price target to $250 from $220. This conveys the analyst\u2019s confidence in the company\u2019s ability to add 14% to its share price over the next 12 months. (To watch Steed\u2019s track record, )Steed is not alone in his bullish thesis, as 12 Buys and a single Hold bestow Strong Buy status on the groundbreaking glucose tracker. The average price target of $220.82, though, implies only small upside of 1%. This could mean that the analysts haven\u2019t updated their models yet to reflect its 2019 gain.

For the full year, the company has guided for revenue growth of 38% to 41% year over year. Moreover, it expects a gross profit margin of 63% and an operating profit margin of 7%.Insulet is slated to report its fourth-quarter and full-year results on Monday, Feb. 24, after the market closes. For the full year, it expects revenue to increase about 28% to 29%. The company doesn't provide a profitability outlook.DexCom and Insulet have a business tie.

Not only did   win the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's clearance of its new insulin pump management platform, but it even spurred the FDA's creation of a whole new category of insulin-dosing technology.\u00a0The Control-IQ technology is a complete automated insulin dosing (AID) system that offers interoperability with other manufacturers' insulin monitoring devices. In this case, Control-IQ works with 's \u00a0G6 continuous glucose monitoring tool. Other diabetes-management tech companies could make compatible devices in the future.The rub is that rivals are already nipping at Tandem's heels. In fact, a sizable piece of the insulin-dosing market is rooted in open-source options and do-it-yourself solutions that make a diabetic's smartphone the centerpiece of their self-management effort.Image Source: Getty Images.Last week, the FDA cleared Tandem's Control-IQ technology for use with its t:slim X2 insulin pump and , creating the first-ever hybrid closed loop that delivers automatic correction doses to prevent high or low blood sugar levels.\u00a0The exciting innovation here is the fact that Control-IQ's software is 'interoperable,' meaning this device is compatible with hardware from other manufacturers of diabetes devices.To people who don't have diabetes, the detail might mean little. But for the 1 million people in the U.S. who have type 1 diabetes, this initially looks like the long-overdue answer to a significant need for reliable insulin-management solutions using devices from multiple makers. Other stand-alone solutions like the MiniMed 670G insulin pump from   were initially seen as similar game-changers. But research by the Boston Children's Hospital in 2017 and 2018 revealed roughly one-third of its sample patients -- people with diabetes between the ages of 14 and 25 -- discontinued use of the pump because it was too complicated to manage. Tandem's Control-IQ is different in that it removes the need for constant manual adjustment of the pump and it does so in a clinically verified way.At stake is a piece of a digital diabetes management market that's estimated to be worth $12 billion by 2025, growing at an annualized pace of more than 20% to reach that figure. The emergence of closed-loop systems like the ones Medtronic and now Tandem Diabetes created is expected to be one of the diabetes management market's key growth drivers.The FDA's green light for Tandem's Control-IQ platform marks a milestone for the company and for the diabetes management movement. Theoretically, the pump/monitor/software combo could be a mostly automated solution that offers people with diabetes a variety of choices with very little hassle.It's not a selling point Tandem Diabetes will have to itself for much longer, though, if Medtronic's plans pan out. Its next-generation MiniMed 780G automated insulin dosing system, expected to launch in the coming year, will also make the corrective doses that Control-IQ facilitates. Perhaps even more marketable is that the 780G can connect with smartphones, providing easy access to information about a user's glucose levels.Beyond that, the Omnipod Horizon from   is expected to become\u00a0. As is stands now, that insulin pump will be entirely manageable from a smartphone rather than requiring a device attached to a pump and monitor.France's has also seemingly toyed with the idea of marketing its EU-approved DBLG1 closed-loop insulin monitoring and pump system. Medtronic's 670G is available in Europe, but Diabeloop's DBLG1 is the first and only such system that -- like Tandem Diabetes' technology -- offers interoperability with other companies' hardware and devices. Clearly the FDA is now OK with the idea.Other  are likely to start eyeing this innovation now that Tandem has validated the idea.Despite the FDA's warning in May 2019 that DIY solutions for diabetes management can be dangerous, the DIY diabetes management community has organized which in turn, gave rise to free availability of the open-source artificial pancreas software that makes this development possible using older, sometimes secondhand equipment. A nonprofit called Tidepool is also working on open-source software called Loop, which will initially work with Insulet's Omnipod, Medtronic's MiniMed, and Dexcom's G6 and is also intended to be an FDA-regulated platform.Aside from the sheer cost of new and fully branded closed-loop systems, some people with diabetes simply like the idea of nonproprietary options, which tend to offer more functionality than regulator-approved ones. Whatever the motivation, it all works against demand for Tandem's Control-IQ.Such closed-loop systems are the future to be sure, and adding interoperability is a nice touch. As it stands now, though, it doesn't look like this innovation will be enough to rekindle the slowing growth comparison that made Tandem such a strong performer last year.That's not necessarily disastrous. Its fiscal trajectory should still push it out of the red next year, and analysts' profit estimates for the following year are compelling. It's progress the market can latch onto. But even at its present pace, Tandem Diabetes' current company value is more than 100 times 2021's expected earnings. That's rich even for a high-growth name like Tandem.

A /Merrill Lynch report released in 2016 found that the average annual return for value stocks was 17% between 1926 and 2016, compared to 12.6% for growth stocks over the same 90-year period.Yet, here's something investors will find interesting: Since the Great Recession, growth stocks have run circles around value stocks. The historically low-interest-rate environment has encouraged lending and borrowing, which is great news for rapidly expanding growth stocks. And with rates expected to remain low for the foreseeable future, it leaves the door open for ongoing outperformance.Though you might be tempted to look for growth stocks in the small-cap and mid-cap arena, don't forget about large-cap stocks (those with markets caps of at least $10 billion). Despite often being viewed as mature businesses that left their growth phase in the rearview mirror a long time ago, the following three companies would respectively disagree. In fact, these three large-cap stocks are some of the fastest-growing companies on the planet.Image source: Getty Images.Although Wall Street estimates can be incredibly fluid, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system manufacturer   is expected to see its sales grow from $1 billion in 2018 to $2.5 billion by 2022, with the company's earnings per share (EPS) on track to grow 11-fold, from $0.30 per share in 2018 to $3.62 (estimated) by 2022.Make no mistake about it, DexCom isn't a cheap company at 119 times next year's projected EPS, but that's not scaring away Wall Street or investors. That's because diabetes is a , with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finding that 30.3 million Americans (more than 9% of the population) had diabetes in 2015. Further, more than 84 million people aged 18 and over had prediabetes, which, if left untreated. could lead to diabetes years down the line. This presents a massive market opportunity for DexCom and its monitoring devices to help diabetics take better control of their health.\u00a0With DexCom continuing to innovate, it should be able to grow its core U.S. CGM market share, which . Look for the launch of the G7 in 2020 or 2021 as the next major growth driver for a company that's on track for 40% full-year sales growth in 2019.Image source: Getty Images.The tech sector is another area where you're bound to find high-growth companies, and large-cap   does not disappoint. The software-as-a-service (SaaS) cloud company is expected by Wall Street to grow sales from $1.07 billion in 2018 to around $3.6 billion in 2022. At the same time, full-year EPS will climb from $0.38 in 2018 to an estimated $2.92 over the same period.The beauty of Shopify is that its . There's the higher-margin SaaS services, such as website hosting and file storage, which have seen growth taper a bit in recent years but does an excellent job of avoiding client churn. There's also the faster-growing merchant solutions, which helps with in-house payment processing and shipping, and even provides cash advances to merchants. Even though merchant solutions is a lower-margin segment than subscription services, it requires considerably less upkeep and marketing to drive this growth, making it an indispensable operating segment.Similar to DexCom, Shopify isn't cheap at 400 times next year's EPS, but few cloud companies of its size ($43 billion market cap) are expected to grow sales as quickly. With Shopify even acting as a  in Canada, it's bound to remain a popular stock among growth investors.Image source: Square.Speaking of growth you can bank on, point-of-sale solutions provider   is projected by Wall Street to see its sales skyrocket from $1.59 billion in 2018 to a cool $4.8 billion by 2022. At the same time, EPS for the company should nearly quadruple from $0.47 in 2018 to $1.75 by 2022.Square is quickly becoming a juggernaut in the payment processing space as an alternative to traditional merchant solutions providers \u00a0and . In the most recent quarter, Square processed $28.2 billion in gross purchasing volume (GPV), ultimately helping the company generate 44% year-over-year net revenue growth. What's really impressive is that GPV from large sellers rose 34% from the prior-year quarter (Q3 2019 vs. Q3 2018), with these large sellers now accounting for 55% of the company's total GPV. Translation: Square isn't just for small- and medium-sized businesses anymore.This is also a company . The company's Cash App, which allows users to send, store, and even invest money, generated year-over-year net revenue growth of 115% in the third quarter.

There are many potential blockbuster drugs awaiting U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, with a number of treatments having already received a thumbs-up earlier this year.For the companies that have been behind these breakthrough solutions, their financial prospects have never been better. Specifically, , , and  are all likely to see their stock prices rise dramatically in the coming year due to treatments they are developing or have already developed.Image source: Getty Images.The excitement behind Amarin has only further jumped after an FDA committee recommended its . This drug has already been approved to treat patients with elevated levels of triglycerides, but not necessarily those at risk of adverse cardivoascular events such as heart attacks and strokes. However, results from a new study have shown promising results in Vascepa's effectiveness as a way to help patients with these conditions.\u00a0Amarin hopes that the FDA will widen Vascepa's potential use for patients at high-risk of having a heart attack or stroke, a decision which would substantially increase Vascepa's potential addressable market.\u00a0A five-year trial involving over 8,000 patients considered at risk of cardiovascular events found that patients who took a two gram dose of Vascepa twice daily had significantly reduced changes of either having a heart attack or a stroke. Specifically, the fish oil drug produced a 31% reduction in the chance of heart attack, a 28% reduced chance of suffering a stroke, and a 20% reduced chance of death due to cardiovascular failure.\u00a0\u00a0For this reason, investors were paying close attention to the FDA committee scheduled in mid-November to review Vascepa. The results were overwhelmingly positive and gave Amarin's drug a major thumbs-up. Now, investors are waiting to see if the FDA will extend Vascepa an expanded indication for high-risk cardiovascular patients on Dec. 28.Many analysts on Wall Street are already considering Vascepa to be the next blockbuster drug in the cardiovascular disease sector, with some expecting peak revenues to exceed $4 billion annually by 2028. Considering that Amarin's third-quarter 2019 revenue came in at only $112.4 million for the quarter, Vascepa's potential approval would be a game-changer for the company.At the same time, major healthcare organizations such as the American Heart Association, American Diabetes Association, the European Society of Cardiology have all recommended Vascepa as an effective way to lower LDL cholesterol in patients. When one looks at these recommendations, as well as the thumbs-up from the FDA committee in November, it's not surprising to see why the odds seem to be in Amarin's favor for Vascepa's official approval later this month.Portola Pharmaceuticals is developing the only anticoagulant reversal agent on the market, something that can be a lifesaver for patients who suffer from uncontrollable bleeding often seen as a side effect of today's generation of blood thinners (also known as anticoagulants). Specifically, Portola's drug treats patients using \u00a0rivaroxaban and\u00a0\u00a0apixaba, two of the most prevalent blood thinners on the market.\u00a0This drug, Andexxa, has already received a number of designations from the FDA, including the all-important Breakthrough Therapy designation, and has earned approval for commercial production in the U.S. earlier this year.Although Andexxa is a relatively expensive treatment, costing $27,500 per patient dose,\u00a0the fact that it would be the sole treatment to an otherwise life-threatening side effect means that cost won't prove much of a deterrent until a cheaper replacement to Andexxa is produced (which doesn't seem to be imminent).In 2017, there were 140,000 hospital admissions due to uncontrollable bleeding due to anticoagulants, which are prescribed to patients to lower the risk of blood clots..\u00a0Assuming a $27,500 average price point per patient dose,\u00a0this would put the American market for Andexxa in the $3.85 billion range, if not more. Thus, it's not surprising that this one drug could catapult Portola, a $2.2 billion market value company, into a much higher valuation.Tandem Diabetes is different from the other two biotech stocks mentioned above. Instead of offering a revolutionary new drug candidate, Tandem is a leading manufacturer of insulin pumps for patients with type 1 diabetes. These pumps help automate insulin dosing in patients and managing their blood sugar levels.Shares of Tandem have already more than doubled since the start of the year, but there's still plenty of  for the company. Sales for Tandem's newest insulin pump -- t:sim X2, which incorporates a continuous glucose monitor from -- have been surging and show little signs of slowing down.Worldwide pump shipments jumped by 112% worldwide from last year, while the company's profit margins have improved steadily, from negative 34% to just negative 6% during the same period. Tandem's year-end projections put its 2019 sales somewhere around the $365 million ballpark. This is a significant increase from the $183.9 million revenue in 2018 and the $107.6 million figure in 2017. The market for insulin pumps is still quite far from being saturated, with plenty of room for Tandem to grow in the coming years. This is especially true in international markets, with other countries such as Canada having recently announced regulatory approval for Tandem to sell t:slim X2. Overall, Tandem's strong growth so far seems likely to continue for at least a few more years before slowing down, with investors likely to enjoy significant gains from the stock in the meantime.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In the middle, 3 would be a Hold.  So anything below 3 leans toward Buy as the average analyst sentiment.  The average rating of 1.39 for DXCM leans strongly towards the bullish end of the spectrum, yet the DXCM price target paints a different picture.  Clearly, there is something more to the story here that is worth investigating for investors looking at DexCom Inc.  Of course, the average price target is just that \u2014 a mathematical average, and is only one metric.  There are analysts with higher targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $240.00.  And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as low as $125.00.  The standard deviation is $25.439.\n\n\nBut the whole reason to look at the average in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes \u2014 much like with guessing the number of jelly beans in a jar, where the average guess tends to be very close.  And so with DXCM trading so far above that average target price of $201.62/share, the -10.29% downside to that average target does seem to be a paradox against the bullish analyst ratings.  Might analysts be behind the curve with their targets and upward adjustments are forthcoming?  Or, is it time for some of these analysts to turn bearish and downgrade on valuation?  One thing is for sure: this apparent paradox makes for a good \"signal\" to investors in DXCM to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding whether analysts have it right with their sentiment, or have it right with their price target for DexCom Inc.

Today is Thanksgiving, and as is appropriate, we're giving thanks. I'm your host Nick Sciple, and today I'm joined by Motley Fool contributor Jason Hall via Skype. Jason, what's up?Nick, thank you for having me on today, and happy Thanksgiving! Thank you for joining me and happy Thanksgiving. And just so our listeners know, we're not crazy people. We're not at work on Thanksgiving. We're prerecording this on November 21st. But we thought it'd be fun to give you all a nice little Thanksgiving show. Jason, you just moved into a new house. What are your plans for your first Thanksgiving in your new home? Are you going to be there? Are you going to the grandparents? What's going on?My plan is to get out of this house and to get out of this state and find my sanity. Moving is horrible. Moving with a three-year-old is especially painful. So I will be, thankfully, in the beautiful little coastal town of Panacea, Florida -- about 45 minutes south of Tallahassee for anybody that's not familiar. It's kind of in the elbow of the Gulf Coast. We're down there with family. Some family goes every year, and we try to go every other year. Very excited about that, to be on the Gulf Coast for Thanksgiving.Going to God's country, the Gulf Coast, man. As a Mobile, Alabama native, really, really jealous you're going to make it down there. This will be the first year, actually, I haven't made it down to Alabama for Thanksgiving. Going to be spending Thanksgiving with my girlfriend up here in the D.C. area. Excited to do that, but also going to be missing family a little bit. I hope you enjoy the Gulf Coast as much as I enjoyed growing up there.We're going to run through some fun little list of that stuff we're thankful for. The first one that I want us to do is, Jason, what is the product or service that you are most thankful for in your life?+, buddy. It's changing lives, I'm telling you. Disney+ is changing people's lives every day. OK, all right, no, I'm sort of kidding. As a consumer, . There's no doubt about it. It is truly something that has given me back hours of my life. As someone who hates going to stores, it's so much easier just to flip open the app and just buy whatever I need, and know that it's going to be at my house the next day or the day after that. That's fantastic.I'm going to do one more. You know me, I can't just do one of anything. Professionally, , the Motley Fool stock-picking service that was launched by Tom and David. I can truly say that this changed my life. I started with The Motley Fool as a paid subscriber to . Got really involved on the message boards. This service played a huge role in helping me develop as an investor, and is actually the thing that opened the door to me ending up on this podcast with you right here. It's truly changed my life.We didn't pay him to say that, folks. [laughs] I would say for me, to echo your sentiments there, The Motley Fool podcasts. I mean, that's why I'm here. That's how I ended up here at this company. But my product that I will say is  . I don't know how my life would be like without Google. It changed the bar conversation forever. There's no more debating anything anymore. I've got the answer right at my fingertips. I can't tell you the number of things I google every day. Google probably knows more about me, and probably every person that's listening to this show, than I know about myself. I get so much value out of it. The way I picture Google is, the internet has every bit of information you could ever think of in the world, right? Before the internet, where you needed to go to get that information is, like, your local library. Now, imagine if you walked into that library, and nothing was in order. You couldn't find anything. Well, that's what the internet's like without Google. The internet's really not that useful without a search engine that can let you find what you need in this massive pile of information, quickly. I think it's brought so much value to me and lots of folks around the world. So, I'm going to go with Google.Did you watch the Matrix movies?Of course. To me, in my head, even to this day, I imagine that Google is actually just a white room with a person that's inside of it. It's the Oracle. That's Google. That's it. It's not computers. It's the Oracle. That's quite possible. All right, our next thing we're most thankful for. We're going to talk about, what is the investor you're most thankful for, Jason?Charlie Munger. Absolutely Charlie Munger, no doubt about it. I don't think he gets anywhere near enough street cred. He is a huge reason has created so many billionaires. I still don't think he gets anywhere near enough credit for Buffett's evolution as an investor. I still read these articles to this day, and it makes me cringe when somebody calls Buffett a value investor. Buffett hasn't been a value investor in 30 years. Buffett likes to pay a fair price, but because of Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's focus for years and years has been more on buying high-quality businesses that have competitive advantages and have these real durable strengths, the moat that he talks about, something that's going to allow them to continue to grow their business and generate an adequate rate of return over the long term. And Charlie Munger, I think there's a good chance that the Warren Buffett would have remained a cigar-butt investor if it wasn't for Charlie Munger.Yeah, absolutely. Charlie Munger would be my 1-B here. When you talk about that, moving away from value investing, I think what Charlie Munger really did is moving Buffett from value as a quantitative methodology to value as an analytical style, of thinking, paying less for what you buy than what it's worth relative to saying, because of this number, this company is undervalued. I think that's been transformational. And that's a much more scalable style when you get to tens and tens of billions of dollars than it is trying to find cigar butts, as Buffett did coming up. Nick, you know, also, Charlie Munger is an attorney.Yeah. We have a theme here. I was going to say, we have a theme here. My investor I'm most thankful for is also an attorney, Peter Thiel, at for a few reasons. The first is more personal to me. When I first got started in investing, I was in law school, doing that sort of thing. And one observation Peter Thiel had, I think was super influential to me. He went to law school at Stanford, went to work at a big firm in New York. Famously made it three months, and he said, from the outside, the law firm was a place that everybody wanted to get in. And from the inside, it was a place that everybody wanted to get out. I didn't really realize that that was explaining my observations until I'd really read that observation, and it really just clicked with me, and is a big part of why I'm here doing what I'm doing right now.In addition to that, on the more investing side of things, I think is probably the best investing book I've ever read. Really kind of transformed the way I think about companies. One of his conceptualizations is, where most people would say competitive advantage, he says monopoly. I want these companies that have a monopoly on their brand or a monopoly on this asset, versus having a competitive advantage. What does this company have that no one else has? Another analytical thing to think about is, what do you believe that most people would disagree with you on? I think, if you're an investor, you really have to disagree with most people to find any sort of value in the market. If you're not doing something contrarian to the market, you're just getting the market's return. So, that has been super valuable to me.And then one other thing, it's exposed me to mimetic theory. For folks that haven't been exposed to that, read up on it. Really, it's a theory of everything. I can't really explain it to you here. But, read up on. Has really changed the way I view the world in a significant way. We talked on this show a while back about T. Boone Pickens. I think Peter Thiel shares some of the political controversy that T. Boone Pickens has. But, like T. Boone Pickens, an incredible number of lessons, an incredibly clear thinker, and I think everyone can learn from him about his observations both on life and investing.Yeah. I want to just tie this together real quick. I think it's really interesting, you think about Munger, you think about Thiel, think about you, and think about, I'll include in this, John Maxfield, one of our colleagues that rights for The Motley Fool. You're all attorneys. And, other attorneys I've known in my life -- I have an uncle -- if you want to learn how to really ask good questions, make good friends with an attorney. You will become so much better at asking the right questions, to get to not the answers that you want, but to learn. So, I'm going to mix you in there with Mr. Munger and Mr. Thiel, too. Something about that law training that teaches you really how to get to the crux of things. It's so powerful.So what Jason is saying is, everybody be nicer to lawyers.Well, no. You don't have to be nice to them. [laughs]\u00a0All right, let's move on to, what is the investment you're most thankful for, Jason?It's an investment that has cost me a substantial amount of capital over the years. In terms of dollars invested, it's one of my largest. Bought my way out of a really ugly position. It's . And the reason I'm picking Clean Energy Fuels is because I've learned so much. This is one that, I look at the capital losses I've taken over time as a great tuition. It's a great education. It's taught me a lot about how to analyze companies. Also, I've learned some really valuable lessons. Even great ideas don't always work out exactly as you planned. And sometimes, things work that you expect to work, but other things prevent them from necessarily being profitable investments. I think this is a great case for that. That's why I picked it. I didn't pick the one that's made me the most money. I didn't pick \u00a0or Amazon, that have made me the most money. But I've learned more about being a good investor from Clean Energy Fuels than any other stock I've ever owned.Jason, I'm not as enlightened as you. I picked the stock that's been my best performer since I've owned it, and that's . It's not just because it's been my best performer, although, of course, that really helps. But it's one of those cases where observing what happens in the world, I think, was more valuable to me than observing what had happened in the market. When I bought that stock, it had just sold off pretty significantly because one of its competitors, I believe , had come out -- for background, Dexcom makes continuous glucose monitors. These are, for someone with Type One Diabetes, will be typically an implantable sensor that will go in your upper arm usually, and it measures your glucose over time to track to make sure you're not too high, not too low. It was a pioneer in that device, and they continue to be one of the leaders in the space. Well, the stock had really sold off significantly because Medtronic had introduced a continuous glucose monitor that was the first one on the market that didn't have to be calibrated every day. You didn't have to stick your finger and draw blood to make sure the sensor was measuring properly. The market came out and said, basically, they're going to take away the market, and all these other competitors are gone.Well, the reason I bought Dexcom, I talked to several people who had the sensor and said, \"Are you going to switch over to this new product?\" And they said no. They said no for a few reasons. The reason why I think Dexcom still a great stock today, they have the most accurate sensor on the market. When it comes to keeping yourself in the proper glucose range, the more accurate you can be, obviously, the better, going through highs and lows. They also were the only product on the market, at least at the time, that had the seamless integration with your iPhone. So, you could easily monitor your glucose and those sorts of things through your phone. If you talk about parents who have young children that have Type One Diabetes, it lets them get alerts whenever their child would hit a high or low. So it really adds a lot of utility to folks there. And then third, that competing product that I mentioned to you, you could only use that CGM with their insulin pump. What Dexcom really is, it's a product that is agnostic. You can use all kinds of different pump options with them. So, it's one of those things where the market really overreacted. But, talking to people and learning how people actually used the product was able to make a decision that led to a great investment, which was particularly valuable.A little Peter Lynch here. Let's go ahead and bring it a little here, talk about using what you observe in the world to identify potential opportunities. Nick, good job, buddy. Well done!Yeah. The other one would be Phil Fisher, the Scuttlebutt method. I think there's a lot of scuttlebutt there involved in that thesis. I really encourage folks when they're making investment decisions to talk to people who actually use these products. Pay attention to the world. When you go to a restaurant and there's a line out the door, maybe that's a good sign. Or, if you go to a restaurant, and maybe it looks really cheap from a valuation point of view when you look at the numbers, but there's nobody in the restaurant when you go there, you don't like the product, and that sort of thing ... trust the people who actually use these products when you make these decisions, and I think you'll be rewarded over time. Well done!OK, for this last one, I want to talk about, every time I have you on the show, Jason, we like to talk about a little bit of college football. Thanksgiving is a notoriously big NFL day. And, that Saturday is always the biggest rivalry weekend of the year. I know I would always have to build my Thanksgiving plans around, how can I get back to Tuscaloosa or Auburn for the Iron Bowl that weekend? So, in that vein, Jason, what or who is the college football player you're most thankful for?You know me, I can't do just one of anything. I'm going to say the strength of Georgia's team this season by far has been defense. I'm going to go with J. R. Reid. Safety. One of the true greats. Georgia strong safety. Just got nominated for the Bronko Nagurski award for the best defensive player in college football. That's pretty big deal. Did you know that Georgia's defense has not given up a single rushing touchdown this season?I know now. Through 10 games! Not a single one. On offense, I'm going to go with Andrew Thomas, the superstar blindside offensive tackle. Probably going to be the first offensive tackle, probably the first offensive lineman drafted this year. He's a junior, I'm sure he's going to leave early. He's an Outland Trophy semifinalist for the best offensive lineman. I also want to point out that, did you know that the University of Alabama did not have a single offensive lineman nomination for the Outland Trophy? I don't think that's happened in like six or seven years. That's a big deal. Auburn's got one. Well, darn... [laughs] OK, so, Georgia is also ranked higher than Auburn in the college football playoff standings. That is accurate. That is accurate. All right. [laughs] I have a few. I'll give you some honorable mentions. A. J. McCarron, huge part of my early college career. From my hometown? His tattoo choices, I don't know about that. Folks who are unfamiliar with that, maybe Google that.But, I think, a college football player I'm really most appreciative of, and I don't think there will ever be a moment that will match, the National Championship a couple years ago, Tua Tagovailoa. It's very rare that someone is one of the best at what they do and also one of the nicest people that do what they do. I think Tua is one of those people. It's really unfortunate, his injury that happened a couple weeks ago. He dislocated his hip. But I think he's just one of the nicest, most genuine people, and also probably the best quarterback to ever play at Alabama throughout history. Again, I was at that National Championship game. Second and 26 is probably the greatest football moment of my college football career. Jason may not agree. Really, so appreciative of what he stands for and he's represented the University and just college football in general. Really thankful for Tua.Yeah, I think it stinks that his college career could have ended on a fluke, weird kind of thing like that. And there's risk to his professional career. Here's the question I have. I agree, great choice. Tua Tagovailoa. Do you think there's any chance, if he's healthy, he comes back for his senior year?There's always a chance! I don't want to get my hopes up too much, but there's always a chance. The factor that I've seen some folks talk about is, he does have an insurance policy if he falls in the draft. So, there's not a significant economic reason for him to do so, as some I think. But, we'll just have to see. Whether he does or doesn't, super thankful about how he's represented the University and, like I said, college football in general.Jason, all our listeners, I hope you have a happy Thanksgiving. We will see you next week.Happy Thanksgiving, everybody!As always, people on the program may own companies discussed on the show, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against the stocks discussed, so don't buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear.

More than 425 million adults around the world have been diagnosed with the condition, a figure that will only continue to grow over the coming years.Because diabetes has a relatively low mortality rate and an increasing patient population, many  that focus on this market have quickly become compelling investments. One of these is , a leading manufacturer of insulin pumps used by patients with type 1 diabetes to manage their blood sugar levels. Shares of Tandem have  since the start of the year as sales continue to skyrocket.Let's take a look at some reasons Wall Street considers Tandem Diabetes a buy and whether these reasons are justified.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Type 1 diabetes patients require insulin on a consistent basis, usually administered either by multiple daily injections (the most common method) or by continuous subcutaneous insulin infusions, also referred to as just insulin pump therapy. This second option, which is becoming increasingly popular among type 1 diabetes patients, relies on a portable pump that automatically delivers insulin in a way that mimics the bodily process of a nondiabetic person.Although only a portion of type 1 diabetes patients use insulin pumps, not needing to take multiple daily injections is a major convenience factor that will likely convince many to give insulin pumps a try. At the same time, the fact that most patients aren't using insulin pumps yet means there's plenty of room for the limited number of insulin pump manufacturers, such as Tandem Diabetes, to grow significantly.Tandem's sales really started to take off after it received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to use its latest insulin pump, t:slim X2, alongside the Basal-IQ glucose monitor from . This combination almost completely automates the insulin dosing process for patients, which is a significant selling point over other competitors that haven't integrated glucose monitors yet.Specifically, the FDA ended up classifying the t:slim X2 as an ACE pump (alternative controller enabled infusion pump), a designation that allows integration with other externally produced components. Since this approval, sales of Tandem's insulin pumps have skyrocketed. In its most recent Q3 financial results, the company saw insulin pump shipments surge by 105% worldwide, growing from 8,434 in Q3 2018 to an impressive 17,893 pumps in Q3 2019. At the same time, Tandem's margins have seen a significant improvement, rising from negative 34% to negative 6% since last year. The company currently estimates that its 2019 sales will come in at $365 million, compared to the $89.8 million seen back in 2018 and the $44.1 million of 2017. Tandem experienced a little bit of a setback recently when the FDA reported the death of a patient who was using the company's t:slim X2 pump in October. More specifically, the coroner found that the patient's blood sugar was extremely low at the time of death. While shares of Tandem slid in light of this news, the company provided an update to the case, saying that the death wasn't caused by a pump malfunction.Considering the automated nature of these insulin pumps, patients trust that they will operate perfectly, as a malfunction or outright failure in insulin dosing can easily lead to hypoglycemia and other emergency conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis. While why exactly the man died remains a mystery, especially since privacy reasons prevent Tandem from clarifying the cause further, the most important thing for investors to know was that the t:slim X2 pump wasn't the cause.\"While this event is certainly tragic, unfortunately some patients experience such issues and ultimately expire while on insulin pumps,\" said Piper Jaffray analyst J.P. McKim in a research note following this news.While  and  used to be competitors in the insulin pump market, both companies sold their pump businesses in 2016 and 2017. This leaves only a couple of major players, one of the most notable being Tandem's rival insulin pump manufacturer .A comparatively positioned and similarly sized competitor to Tandem, Insulet has also seen strong sales growth over the past year. Revenue has gone up by 27% in comparison to the previous year, according to its third-quarter results, and its omnipod insulin pump has also received an ACE designation from FDA to start incorporating glucose monitors. While Insulet's new glucose-monitoring insulin pumps won't be ready until sometime in 2020, Tandem will have to prepare for a new competing product that might chip away at its market share.However, considering the sheer size of the type 1 diabetes population, the number of potential insulin pump users, and the relative lack of competition beyond a handful of companies, there's enough room in this market for both companies to grow without stifling each other too much.The biggest concern insulin pump makers like Tandem Diabetes have to worry about is the prospect of a potential type 1 diabetes drug. While there's no miracle cure on the horizon as of yet, there are some treatments that help slow down the onset of the disease in patients who are at high risk of becoming diabetic.Most notable is 's Teplizumab. This drug candidate, which is specifically designed for type 1 diabetes patients, is currently in a phase 3 clinical trial that has shown promising results so far. The drug has shown to be able to delay or even prevent the eventual onset of type 1 diabetes in patients considered to be at high risk of developing the condition.However, Teplizumab is a preventative drug at its core and doesn't target patients who already have full-blown diabetes, meaning most of the current diabetic market won't be eligible for the treatment. At the same time, even if all goes well with the FDA, Teplizumab likely won't be available until 2022 at the earliest, when its phase 3 trial concludes. That gives insulin pump makers plenty of time to continue growing with little concern.Tandem Diabetes has seen stellar revenue growth over the past year and shows no signs of slowing down. With just a handful of competitors in a rapidly growing market, the company is an extremely compelling growth stock at this moment.While future diabetes drugs such as Teplizumab could end up hurting Tandem's growth figures, such a situation is still fairly far in the future. For the next 12 to 24 months, there's nothing stopping Tandem from continuing its growing spree. For those comfortable with investing in a small, high-growth, high-risk biotech stock, Tandem Diabetes is an excellent addition to your portfolio. Just don't put all your eggs in this one basket, and make sure Tandem is just one part in a larger, diversified portfolio.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Today is Wednesday, November the 13th, and we're talking healthcare. I'm your host, Shannon Jones, and I am joined via Skype by 's health and tech specialist, Brian Feroldi. Brian, how's it going?Hey, Shannon! We are in the throes of earnings season, although it is coming to a close. This is one of my favorite times of year. I just love getting the nonstop information. It was awesome to see you in person last week. I really enjoyed my trip down to the Fool. Yeah, always good to have you here at the Fool, especially in the midst of earnings season. Yeah, you're right. Earnings season to me, you've got so many shocks, surprises, disappointments. It really takes you through the entire loop of all of your emotions within a few short weeks. So I'm excited for today's show, because we're going to be talking about three notable healthcare companies that recently posted some blowout earnings results. We've covered all three on the show before. Of course, at the end, we're going to reveal basically which one is our top pick.\u00a0Let's kick things off here, Brian, let's do the first earnings report coming from Guardant Health, that's ticker symbol GH. This is a company whose mission statement is a simple yet very profound one, Brian. It's very simply conquering cancer with data. What in the world does that actually mean, though?This is a fascinating company that came public less than a year ago and it's just been on fire for investors. Guardant Health is a leading provider of liquid biopsies. The company's technology is able to detect cancer from a simple blood draw, instead of the traditional way to diagnose types of cancer is with a sample, so you have to go in and actually get a biopsy of the tumor. By contrast, Guardant enables clinicians to diagnose cancer from just a simple blood draw, which has so many benefits. The big one for patients is, it's way less invasive. Some cancers actually, you have to set a patient under anesthesia to get it diagnosed, which is just a huge pain for them. It's also very expensive. Guardant's technology can diagnose lung cancer for about $3,500, something like that. By contrast, a traditional lung biopsy costs about $14,000. So not only is it better on the patient, but it's also much less costly. This technology is groundbreaking.Yeah, in more ways than one. It's also safer. For a lot of these solid tumors, when you have to go in and do a biopsy, there is a chance that you disturb the tumor and cells can then escape and go throughout the body and cause cancer in other places that it didn't originally start. Having the ability to do these liquid biopsies really is innovative. But at the heart of it is really the fact that we're talking about precision medicine. With a company like Guardant, and there are many others that are now coming in this space, it's about getting the right treatment to the right patient. Really, where I think you're starting to see Guardant is really focusing on how can we do that sooner and earlier in the process for cancer patients? We'll talk a little bit about that in a second. But, cancer in and of itself, second leading cause of death around the globe. By 2030, researchers are expecting 21 million new cases every single year. The market opportunity for a company like Guardant is huge, and it's no wonder why the stock has taken off. I was just looking year to date, the stock is up 98%, which is pretty astounding. Up 8% just off of Q3 earnings. What did we see for their Q3, Brian?Guardant just knocked the cover off the ball in the third quarter. Revenue growth has been very high since this company came public. The third quarter was no exception. We saw revenue growth of 181%. That landed the company at about $61 million in total revenue. Way ahead of Wall Street's estimate. If you double click on those results a little bit, you saw that the number of tests completed just about doubled, but revenue grew by 181% because it's actually they are charging more for each test. So, you have the number of tests doubling and revenue per test going up. That just creates magic on the top line. Trickling down a little bit more, we saw gross margin expand greatly from the sales leverage. Gross margin was up 1,400 basis points. It's now touching 70%. Operating expenses are growing quickly, but they only grew 67%. That's much slower than revenue growth. The net result was that the net loss came in at $13 million, or about $0.14 per share. That is far below the $0.37 loss that analysts were expecting. And that $13 million is almost a rounding error. This company has $825 million in cash. The strong results allowed the company to raise its guidance for the full year again. They now expect $202 million to $207 million in revenue. Previously, they were guiding for $180 million to $190 million. That's a nice boost. And that does represent 126% revenue growth for the full year. The report was just excellent.It's amazing to me to see numbers like that posted by a company whose bread and butter is really centered around this Guardant360 test. One of the more surprising things, Brian, is that this test isn't actually FDA approved, right? At least not yet.\u00a0That's correct. They actually are pending FDA approval. But insurers and pharmaceutical companies have been clamoring to get this thing because of the benefits that we talked about above, namely the extreme cost savings that come with it, as well as the convenience for patients. As you mentioned, it really enables clinicians to get a view of the DNA of a tumor. That can really help to guide their treatment process. This is a device that is just a win for the healthcare system all around, and it's no surprise that demand is just incredibly high.And you can only expect demand to go even higher once they do secure that FDA approval. So far, Guardant 360 has been ordered more than 100,000 times by more than 6,000 oncologists. It's not just the physicians and the oncologists, it's also biopharmaceutical companies who are looking to expedite clinical development. Guardant is partnered with more than 50 biopharmaceutical companies that have actually ordered 360 and even their OMNI test as well. I think what's really remarkable, you mentioned, of course, you've got the insurers that are now coming on board. You've got biopharmaceutical companies, you've got physicians. They're expanding their capabilities, expanding their tests, really trying to drive some of the screening diagnostic tools and even the prevention much earlier in the timeline. They've got a LUNAR-2 test. What's really exciting to me about this is that you're trying to pinpoint and go after those that are asymptomatic, those that are at extremely high risk of getting cancer and be able to really drive early detection. So they've got a LUNAR test. It's a huge market. You're talking about $35 billion market opportunity for this company. Of that, $18 billion goes to that early prevention, early detection segment. That's really where they're going with LUNAR-2. There's a lot to like with this company, and when I see them posting triple-digit revenue growth, I get excited. But the growth runway I had is so long and so wide for a company like this.Yeah, it really is. To your point, they're really focused on patients that are clearly symptomatic right now. The huge opportunity for liquid biopsies is really just used screening among the general population. As we've talked about on the show many times, the earlier you can detect and diagnose cancer, the chances of treating it successfully just go up massively. That is the real potential of Guardant and the other companies that are in the liquid biopsy space. Right now, Guardant is definitely the leader, and it's growing very nicely. But if liquid biopsies do what we hope that they can do, the growth runway for Guardant and all the other companies is just huge. I mean, we're talking about $100 billion in revenue potential if they can expand as they want to. The sky is the limit for this company.Truly, sky's the limit. A lot to watch in this space. Of course, you've got Grail, the Silicon Valley start-up and spin-off from gene sequencing giant . You've also got , who's also just secured a breakthrough device designation from the FDA for blood-based liver cancer detection. A lot to like in the space. Guardant Health, as you mentioned, the clear leader.\u00a0Let's switch gears. Let's talk about some more notable earnings, this time turning our attention to the diabetes space. Specifically, we're going to be looking at Dexcom, and that is ticker symbol DXCM. The stock is up nearly 34% off of earnings. Brian, we've talked about Dexcom before, but when it comes to their specialty, which is CGM, continuous glucose monitoring, what exactly does that mean and why is it so important?Dexcom has been the leader in the continuous glucose monitoring space for more than a decade around. When somebody has diabetes, they lose the ability to regulate their blood sugar levels. Historically, the way that people check their blood sugar levels is with a finger prick, and they put their blood up to a meter, and that gives them a point-in-time reading. The trouble is, your blood sugar is always changing. With people with diabetes, it can swing wildly based on a huge number of factors. So, those point-in-time readings make it hard for somebody to control their blood sugar because they just know where they are, but they don't know where they're heading or where they're coming from. CGM technology allows people to track their blood sugar levels in real time. Dexcom has been the leader in the space for more than a decade now. This company's growth has just been astronomical as more people with diabetes ditch their meter in favor of a continuous glucose monitor.\u00a0Last quarter we saw a phenomenal quarter all around. Dexcom's revenue grew almost 50% to $396 million. That was way higher than Wall Street's estimate at about $345 million. The huge sales leverage allowed operating margin to expand. This company actually produced net income of about $60 million. Wall Street was looking for a number of about $15 million to $20 million. Way higher on the top line and the bottom line. The strength caused management to raise guidance. They're now expecting about $1.44 billion in revenue for the year. That represents top line growth of about 40%, also way higher than estimates. The stock took off after the company reported its earnings, and the numbers just make it clear why.Yes. Phenomenal quarter for them. I think you've kind of seen, Brian, some, I want to say skepticism that the company can really keep up this type of revenue growth, 40%-plus over the long term. You do have competitors in the space. This is a crowded space, and they're all going after the same thing. Of course, the G6 has really been what everybody has been watching, but they've also got a G7 model coming online potentially in late 2020, early 2021. When you think about the competition, do you at all get concerned about them being able to sustain top line growth to this level?Yeah, I think that was a major concern. A little more than a year ago, launched a competing product that was going to be much cheaper than Dexcom's. It wasn't clinically superior. It did have some drawbacks when compared to Dexcom's system, but it was much lower price. That caused a lot of people to worry that Dexcom's margins were going to take a hit and that its demand was going to dry up. We've seen exactly the opposite. Dexcom's revenue growth has been extremely strong. It's actually accelerating. Dexcom likes to say that their technology is superior to the competition. They've been proving that for years. They've really helped to squash those fears. Shares are at an all-time high today, especially in response to this earnings report. You have to give management credit here for executing so well. I think at this point, you can safely say that the market for diabetes products is so huge that it's not a winner-take-all market. It can easily support multiple players. Dexcom has proven so far that it can maintain its leadership position even as the market gets more competitive.Yeah, totally agree there. All right, let's keep it going in the diabetes space, this time looking at Insulet, that is ticker symbol PODD, and how they fared with their most recent earnings. Brian, last time we chatted when you were here at Fool HQ, we were talking about some of the top-performing med tech stocks of the year so far. We talked about , we talked about , but Insulet is right up there as well, up 123% on the year. Brian, this is a company you've got some former ties to as well, right?Yeah. I was fortunate enough to join Insulet when it was still basically in the start-up phase in 2004. I spent about 10 years there before coming to the Fool. When I joined, the company was, again, still in the start-up phase. It's just so heartwarming for me to see that this company has now grown to the point where it's a $10 billion company. We saw that their stock price jumped very high. I think they're at an all-time high right now in response to their great third quarter results.\u00a0Before we get into that, let's quickly talk about what they do. Insulet focuses on the insulin pump market for people with diabetes. Dexcom is on tracking your blood sugar side. Insulet is, if your blood sugar's out of range, what do you do about it? Insulet makes a tubeless insulin pump that is programmable by a remote control, and it constantly puts insulin into the patient's body to help them to keep their blood sugar in an acceptable range. When they eat, they can use their remote control to program their pump, which is just a small little device that's worn directly on the body, to give them a bolus of insulin to cover their meal. The insulin pump market is actually also very competitive. There's companies like and that have been in the space for a long time. But Insulet is unique in that it's the only insulin pump that is completely wireless. It's a very attractive option for people that have, say, small kids, or that have active lifestyles, or want to go swimming a lot. That's really Insulet's core market. They've been steadily taking market share since the device was launched about 10 years ago. Last quarter, we saw revenue growth of 27%. Revenue came in at $192 million. That beat the top line by about $12 million. It came in way ahead of their guidance estimate. Their growth was both in the U.S. and international, which is great to see. This company has finally become profitable, after about almost 20 years. We saw earnings of $0.09 per share vs. $0.03 estimates. And, we saw them raise their guidance. They now expect full-year guidance at about $722 million to $730 million. That's good for about 28% top line growth. A beat on the top line. Another fantastic earnings report from top to bottom.Yeah, another beat and raise. Brian, this is more than just a company that's focused on the diabetes market, right? They're aiming to be really a device of choice for automated injectable drug delivery, even beyond the diabetes space with their Omnipod system. One example of that I think back on is with  and their Neulasta treatment. Neulasta is a drug to stimulate white blood cell production for cancer patients who are taking chemotherapy. For them, of course, they're known for the diabetes space, but they've got some optionality, and really trying to carve out a name for themselves and really modernize how drugs get delivered.Yeah, that is the promise of technology. The delivery demands of diabetes are higher than almost any other type of drug that you can deliver because of the variability and the time spans that need to be going on through the day. Delivering drugs for other diseases is actually a fairly straightforward and simple process by comparison. They have invested and worked with other companies to get their device to be used in other types of drug markets. Last quarter, we did see that revenue actually declined 20% from those other opportunities, but that's not all that concerning because revenue from that can wax and wane based on a number of factors. There is definitely embedded optionality in this company to grow that number significantly over time. But for the time being, that's going to take time before it ramps up. This company is still primarily focused on diabetes. The good news there is, they've come a long way, but they're still only about 5% penetrated into their core markets within the U.S. If you zoom out to include worldwide, it's about 1% of their target market. That is just the type 1 diabetes market. There's two main types of diabetes -- type 1, which is only about 5% to 10% of people with diabetes. The big opportunity for this company is to treat people with type 2 diabetes, which is a market size that's 10 times bigger. They are starting to penetrate that market, but that is an opportunity that will take decades to fulfill. That is the promise of Insulet, is that they've still only penetrated a tiny portion of their market.Yes, yet another long-term growth opportunity.\u00a0With that, we've covered three companies, Brian. Of the three, which one is your favorite, and maybe which one do you think won earnings so far this season?Well, if I had to pick a winner for the earnings season, I would have to go with Dexcom. You're talking about 49% revenue growth, just blowing past estimates. They are just making it dead clear that the competition is not slowing them down at all, and the market opportunity is so large that it can easily support multiple players. It also just makes me happy to see that this company is now producing net income, whereas it was losing money for years. From a pure \"who won third quarter earnings,\" I'm going to go with Dexcom.\u00a0But, in terms of which company is my favorite, say, going forward, one thing I do like to do before I make those kind of calls is check on valuations. Guardant is trading for about 36 times trailing sales. Not yet profitable, but it is growing the fastest of these three. Dexcom is about 14 times sales, and 117 times next year's earnings. Insulet is about 15 times sales and 233 times next year's earnings. Those sky-high P/E ratios don't concern me because these companies are just now crossing over into the point where they're producing net income, so their margins are much lower than they would be ultimately.\u00a0When picking between those three, I think I'm going to go with Guardant Health, even though their stock is priced the most aggressively at 36 times sales. Triple-digit revenue growth makes very expensive valuations become very cheap in not that long of a time. I just think the company's runway for long-term growth is enormous. How about you, Shannon?So true. Guardant Health, far and away the better of the three. You mentioned the large market opportunity. They're really only just starting to scratch the surface. But, because we always agree, Brian, I'm actually going to do something a little bit different. Of course, I love Guardant Health, I think it's great. But I'm actually going to go with Insulet on this one. I don't think they had the best quarter. But like I said, I like the optionality, if they can learn how to execute well moving forward, especially when it comes to managing chronic diseases. Overall, long-term, now you're starting to talk about increased patient compliance, increased patient health outcomes. I think there's more to this company than meets the eye. Of course, as we're long-term investors, it takes more than one quarter to give a yay or nay for either a long option or even a short option for that matter. But for me, I like where Insulet is positioned, and I do like to see them, hopefully, position into a drug delivery platform. Again, I love that they're executing on diabetes, but I do think the long-term opportunity here is pretty impressive for Insulet.I can't blame you there. I think all three of these companies deserve a spot on any medtech investor's radar, for sure.Absolutely! That'll do it for this week's  show!

Unfortunately, the U.S. healthcare system is not designed to provide these patients with the continual care that they need. This forces many of them to manage their condition on their own with limited guidance.  says it's on a mission \"to empower people with chronic conditions to live better and healthier lives.\" The company created a platform that uses\u00a0data science and technology to provide\u00a0personalized coaching to patients in real-time. Livongo calls these interactions \"health nudges,\" and it has the data to prove that they lead patients to make smarter health choices that drive behavior changes, improve clinical outcomes, and lower healthcare costs.Image source: Livongo Health.The company's revenues are growing at a , and it's starting to attract the attention of . I was recently afforded the opportunity to interview Livongo's CEO Zane Burke to learn more about the company and the opportunity ahead. Below is a transcript from our conversation (which has been lightly edited for clarity).I think I have a pretty good understanding of the company's founding. Your founder is named Glen Tullman and his son was diagnosed with diabetes years ago. Tullman was a very successful businessman who created Livongo to make it easier for people with chronic conditions to live a healthier life. Is that the gist?\u00a0The whole idea is, how do you help people live their healthiest life? How do we keep people out of the system? How do we create a platform that provides a great experience and helps our members stay healthy? And how do we create a great return on investment for our clients overall?\u00a0Can you talk a little bit about your business model, your go-to market strategy. Are you guys focused on employers, payers, or do you go direct to consumers?CEO Zane Burke. Image source: Livongo Health.Our go-to market strategy is focused on Fortune 500 companies, large organizations that are self-funded and take on all of the risks without any regard to quality, what the experience is going to be like, or return on investment. That's really where we started. We have a number of very large clients already, over 20% of the Fortune 500 today. That has allowed us to move into the health plan market. Four of the seven largest health plans are resellers of our solutions. The two largest pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) in the country are resellers of our solutions. And then we also sell to labor unions, governments, and health systems. That's the lineage of how we started. Today, we're exclusively in the U.S. Is your sales force focused on the employers, the payers, or the PBMs? And once they sign, how do you go get members on board?\u00a0 We sell to the client first, so whoever has the risk, and then we come back and enroll the members. Our clients only pay for members who we enroll and [who] stay engaged. So we are absolutely aligned with whoever has that financial risk, whether it's the employers or the health plan. We benefit when we get people enrolled and keep them engaged. And we do that by using data science at the core to enroll people in a personalized manner so we can learn about who they are and we can tailor our messages to them. We're pretty unique in our core solution of diabetes, where we get 34% enrollment across our book of business today. And that number continues to grow over time. And we only get paid on a per-participant/per-month model as we keep them engaged. It sounds like there is no financial risk for clients to sign up since they only pay if their members enroll. And then you have the data to prove that your model leads to better health and cost savings -- is that right?That's right. We're seeing in excess of 3x return on investment in our core diabetes solution in year one. And we've been able to validate that in multiple medical journals and third-party groups. You can really tell that the model is working because we're getting into the self-insured business. So, we've sold to big, self-insured employers. Now, the health plans are seeing the great clinical outcomes and the financial ROI, and they're putting it into their core product. That's really a huge win for us because my cost of sales goes down and my sales team could not effectively market to those members, but the health plans can.Can you just walk me through the consumer experience? When a new member says \"yes,\" do they just download an app? Do you guys send them a free blood glucose meter? Are there any fees?\u00a0We are very consumer-focused, starting with enrollment. We personalize the enrollment experience to encourage people to sign up and then once they sign up we send them a two-way cellular glucometer [and] strips for them to take their glucose readings. When they open the box, it's pre-configured; when they put the strip in, the machine automatically turns on, it already knows who they are, and they can immediately begin to utilize the solution. The consumer has no costs on their side from a device perspective or from a strip perspective, nor do they have those on an ongoing basis. Oftentimes, one of the big elements is that persons with diabetes have to pay for the strips that are necessary to manage their condition. We send the strips for free because we know when they're using the strips electronically through the two-way cellular connection. They can reorder directly off of the device. It creates a great consumer experience.There's a lot of thought that's gone into the design of all the pieces. We know that people will stick their finger and then wipe their blood on the neoprene. That may not be sound important, but it is super-important as it relates to a person with diabetes. Then we can help them make sure they have those strips with no co-pays. And in those moments when a member is outside the bounds, either too high or too low, we coach them every single time electronically. So every time they interact with us, we're using our data science to say \"try this\" to help nudge them electronically. At those moments when they need somebody on the other end, we have certified diabetes coaches monitoring what's going on.And for the first time in healthcare, there's somebody that's there when the consumer wants them to be there. That's what is so cool about our model. When that member has decided to prick their finger, or step on a weight scale, or put the blood pressure cuff on, at the moment of that health signal when the member is actually taking their health into their own hands, there's a real live human on the other end. They're electronically coached every time. And that's just totally different than the rest of healthcare, and that's what makes us really unique from a consumer-experience [standpoint]. I like to say, we meet the member in their life flow. The members also choose if it's a call or a text from a health coach. They get to choose and opt into that. It also depends on whatever their reading is, whether it's in the high range or low range. So with all the members, it's all in their hands. If they choose, they can use our app, cause sometimes people prefer that. But there is communication directly on the meter itself? The \"health nudge\" comes up on their glucometer screen? : Yes, it's a two-way cellular [connection]. So they're getting the nudge in that moment when they're waiting for the reading to go to the cloud and get trended data. We've found that people are the most susceptible to coaching when they want to be coached. We use those two or three seconds while they are waiting for the reading to give them a little piece of advice, a little bit of knowledge. I worked for  for 10 years as a field rep, so I know all about certified diabetes educators (CDEs) and I have a huge respect for them. I've also dealt with plenty of patients who have had co-pay problems with strips,\u00a0so this model is intriguing. So you're saying that if I had diabetes and had a copay on my strips, if I become a Livongo member then my copay disappears because it's built into the per-member/per-month cost?\u00a0Yes. It disappears. So that's an easy sell. It's a huge satisfier right out of the gate for members. And then we automatically ship the strips to the member because we know how many they've used because we're connected to the cloud. And those are free to them. It creates a better experience overall. \u00a0That makes total sense. Do you have tie-in with doctors and healthcare providers to allow them to access that data?  We do. We have relationships with the big electronic medical record providers if that's what the member wants to happen. They control it for themselves. The member can send it to their endocrinologist, or they could send a fax, or use the app.  Got it. Making that process as simple as possible for providers is a big deal. What's fascinating is that we have a handful of clients where the experience and the outcomes are so good that they're paying for the insulin if the member uses Livongo. Wow.  Because again, the clinical outcomes are so strong and the return is so good and people just love it. So we were actually seeing a number of clients who are going that route, and we're seeing the same thing on hypertension. Hypertension is really about medicine compliance. We have companies that say if the members are doing the test, if they'll take their blood pressure reading three times a month, then the company will cover the co-pay on their hypertension medications.  And there's no cheating!That's right. There's no cheating. We know how they're doing. It's been really fun to just think about how this problem in a different way. Our return on investment comes from fewer emergency room visits and fewer outpatient visits. Over time, it turns into the really big ROI from fewer surgeries and fewer complications. But there's also an immediate return on investment.  Can you explain your relationship with the Food and Drug Administration?\u00a0We do have a relationship with the FDA. The devices are all certified and HIPAA compliant. We do have a responsibility from an FDA perspective to abide by their rules and regulations, and we do that. \u00a0But as long as your CDEs are practicing within the guideline, that's alright? They're providing advice within their licensure. What I'm not doing is changing the medication or medication orders. We do hot referrals to providers in those instances. We have relationships with the two largest PBMs in the country -- one of those is . If a member comes into a CVS pharmacy, we're so integrated at CVS that if that person is eligible, but hasn't yet received a kit, they can automatically receive a kit. We can also do a hot transfer to the\u00a0pharmacist as part of our solution set. And that's kind of what we're doing with telehealth too. We made an announcement around behavioral health where we are actually integrating with partners at the behavioral health level. So from our electronic coaching piece, we're able to hand off those patients to a telehealth visit with a doctor.\u00a0For outside investors, what are the metrics that we should pay attention to the most? We're a subscription model, so growth in our members is a really important metric. We just announced our revenues were up 148% year over year, and we're over 207,000 members, which was up 118% year over year. And our number of clients is up 121%. I'm really pleased with the short-term results. But more important is the long-term progress we're making. It's really about becoming a true platform for chronic condition management. That's the long-term piece for investors to watch. Our strategic march into other marketplaces such as government, and other conditions like hypertension and weight management. Those are just a handful of things that I think are really important future growth drivers for us. \u00a0Your net loss was just $0.05 per share, or about $3 million, so peanuts in the grand scheme of things. \u00a0Peanuts. Yup. We've been on a march to profitability. We've made a huge leap if you go from last year to this year. Our EBITDA margins were negative 40% last year and our guidance would take you to kind of the negative high teens this year. Even if you just even rounded to 20%, you're talking about a 20 [percentage] point increase in our march to profitability. I feel really good about that.  I'm a fan of fast revenue growth and high margins, and you guys have both. Me too! That's what I love about healthcare.\u00a0You can really root for companies, because if they're successful, they're usually doing something great. Can you talk briefly about the international opportunity? It doesn't exist right now, but is it on the horizon? \u00a0Chronic conditions are not just a U.S.-specific challenge. We do not have any announced or definitive plans on going outside the U.S., but we'll continue to evaluate the timing for that. We're certainly not opportunity constrained. If you look at the rest of the executive team, it's a really deep team, kind of beyond the size of our company at this point. And that's on purpose since it will allow us to be more aggressive as we tackle additional conditions and additional geographies. That's something we're actively thinking about. Nothing to formally announce at this point in time. We are big believers in looking at corporate cultures since we believe that great places to work attract great employees. What makes you guys special? I'll tell you what makes us special: It's the mission. It's about our members. Almost every corporate interaction that we have is with one of our members. It reminds us why we're doing what we do. We're also reflective of the rest of the U.S. population, where one out of two adults has a chronic condition. Our associate base is very much a mirror of our membership. Two-thirds of our associate base will identify that they either personally have a chronic condition or that they have a loved one who has one of those conditions. It is really about that mission and vision.On the recruiting side, people will talk about how hard it is to recruit in Silicon Valley and other places, and yet we have not used any external hiring agencies. None. So we've grown over 50% on headcount, and we use zero outside agencies. And the reason for that is because the mission and the culture are so strong, and its a very accountable and self-policing culture. So people don't hire other people who are not going to be dedicated to the mission. It's incredibly diverse and inclusive. And I'll just say that I've never been associated with or known a company that's been like this. I'd love to say this was all made by me, but it's not. The culture was here before I got here. I certainly applaud it and love it. It just allows people to be who they are and bring their best self to work every day. It creates a really fun and energetic environment.\u00a0Well, you guys get good ratings on Glassdoor.com, so it seems to be working. It's funny, I read negative reviews on Glassdoor because there's a kernel of truth in all those. I actually do read the comment box.I personally never invest in a company without checking out Glassdoor.com. I realize that it's not a perfect metric by any means and that it's a biased sample size, but it's usually directionally accurate.  I agree. You've got to look at the good and the bad. Just like when you're checking out something on . You throw away the good, you throw away the bad, you kind of take the average. \u00a0Is continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) a threat to you guys? I know that  and  are just crushing it right now. We love CGM because we love the data. What we do differently is we aggregate that data and use it to coach. And in fact, we have a relationship with Abbott, which makes the Freestyle Libre, and then informally, we take that data. We're big believers in the value of that data. Our president is a person with type 1 diabetes. She actually wears both devices. So she's a self-described nerdy doc who loves data. She would tell you that it's the coaching, it's the data science, and the fact that sometimes the darn thing falls off, or she just has an issue if she wants to wear a dress that night and she doesn't want something sticking out. She'll take a night off. She can use her glucometer instead. And when she's not using her Libre, she's using the Livongo app and still getting the coaching. So we love CGM. We think it's great. It's probably going to continue to be used by just a portion of people with diabetes who are able to utilize that technology. So even though they're doing really well and we want them to do better, the vast majority of people with diabetes will never be CGM users. 87% of people with diabetes are type 2 and 13% type 1. Can you comment on your customer concentration? Two of your partners accounted for 51% of revenue in Q2 2019.I talked about how we've co-opted the rest of the health ecosystem to become a force multiplier for Livongo. These partners and health plans that are resellers of our solutions have helped us grow in the marketplace significantly. We create relationships with each one of those clients, but it's not as if we're subject to being exclusive through any one channel. And what's really important is that even with that 51% with those two very large partners, there are multiple ways we could go to market if we had to, because we have relationships with almost all of the employee benefit planning consultants and many of the health plans as well.So there are multiple ways we can go to market if we had to, and we have a very good direct sales force. The two biggest partners we have are with the pharmacy benefit managers like CVS Health, where we are expanding our relationship. So if I look at it as the breadth of what we're doing, we're more and more of a strategic partner for them all the time. If you listen to their conference calls, they talked a lot about chronic condition management, and we're at the core of what they're doing in that space today. So I feel really good about the strategic value of that. But we do think about the case of having multiple entry points to a client such that we're not beholden to any one partner.Do you guys have any direct competition? Is there anybody that's doing what you're doing?  Well, the biggest competitor we have today is inertia. When you think about it from a competitive standpoint, it's not as if hypertension or diabetes management or behavioral health are new challenges. But the problem is that disease management programs just haven't been effective enough. What we do is really bridge a gap between the healthcare system and the me-as-a-person programs. Today I have not seen anybody that has taken a whole-person approach to the problem. What we do have are a number of niche players in each market space, but on a platform basis, we don't have a direct competitor.\u00a0One of the things that attracted me to you guys is that your ROI for new clients is very strong. You're also unique in the space with the idea of the real-time intervention. I know that diabetes is the main focus, but can you talk a little bit about hypertension, behavioral health, and...what's the third one? Weight management and prediabetes. If you think about it, diabetes is at the core, because if you have type 2 diabetes, you're 70% likely to have hypertension. You're also highly likely to have weight management challenges. If you have more than one of those conditions, the percentage odds that you actually have behavioral health [issues], anxiety, or depression goes up dramatically. Strategically, we're continuing to build our condition set for the whole person, but really starting with that diabetes at the core. You can almost pick the next couple of things that we'll go do because there are places where persons with diabetes have higher preponderance rates to those chronic conditions.The cool part is that it's architected to be at the person level, so we don't think about it as disease states. We were very purposeful about that in our language. If you hear me say the term \"diabetic,\" it is a slip of my tongue. Because it's a person with diabetes, a person with hypertension, a person who has weight management challenges, or behavioral health challenges. We don't want to identify people as their disease. That is dehumanizing. And so we really do fundamentally believe in that whole-person strategy. So we're continuing to build out.We've had great success. We built hypertension from the ground up because there wasn't anything else that made sense. We built that into our platform stack. We do Amazon Alexa integration. So we're using the whole ecosystem to engage patients. We said in our recent investor call that 20% of our bookings in the third quarter of 2019 came from solutions outside of diabetes management. That was 500% growth year over year. So we've really built up a lot of trust from our existing clients because we've delivered great results. We're going to continue to build out those on a single platform that we call \"AI AI\" -- we call it our artificial intelligence engine. And that helps clients who want to buy. The marketplace doesn't want to have all these contracts that manage sleep deprivation, anxiety, and depression. I mean, behavioral health alone is in the teens and twenties of conditions, let alone diabetes management and hypertension and weight management. So our clients want one place to go. We want to offer that and our members want a single experience. And that's really the strategy and logic that we're using as we move forward. But we're seeing really good success, especially for the age of those solutions.\u00a0I saw that your average prediabetes and weight management user sheds 7% of their body weight in the first year. That's impressive. It's pretty cool. I'm having so much fun. I was previously the president at , the big EMR (electronic medical record) company, and I had gotten to know Livongo early in the company's history. In 2014, I brought Livongo into Cerner so we could resell it to our clients and use it for our own associate population, mostly because I could just see this was the right mousetrap if you will. It's where I always thought the healthcare system would go, but it never did. I couldn't be having any more fun in terms of thinking about how to make this a very large-scale business with a huge addressable market. So we're talking billions upon billions of dollars market for our solution set.\u00a0Makes complete sense. This has been incredibly informative. You have a very interesting business here.

Now I will turn it over to Kevin.  -- Thank you, Sean, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. The third quarter was another great period of growth for DexCom. There are many things that we can highlight today, but let me give you three key statistics that point to the strength of our business. The third quarter represents our highest U.S.growth rate since the first quarter of 2016 when the business was much smaller. The third quarter included the highest absolute dollar growth in the history of our company, increasing nearly $130 million over the third quarter of 2018. We not only achieved profitability in the third quarter, but for the first time ever, through nine months, we are profitable on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. The explanation for this performance remains relatively simple.More and more people are becoming aware of the value of DexCom's real-time CGM. And with G6, we have the right product to meet their needs. We often highlight access and awareness as the primary answers for the growth that we are experiencing, but this is the result of years of work from the DexCom team. It is the result of many people embracing our core value to think big.We think big in the way we design our products, the way we serve our patients, our approach to device integration and empowering user choice, and the way we structure our business to meet the expectations of our patients, our employees and our shareholders. Thinking big includes thinking about long-term profitability. As I stated earlier, through the first nine months of the year, we find ourselves profitable on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and on our way to our first GAAP profitable year. But even as we embrace this visionary mindset, it has not come without challenges.This explosive growth continues to leave supply levels much tighter than we expected as we ramp capacity. And because of these supply constraints, our customer-facing infrastructure has been stretched to its limits. As Quentin will explain later, our guidance considers these challenges. I can assure you that as we think about DexCom's opportunities in diabetes and beyond, we are continuing to think big.In addition, as many of you have recently seen, we've had some key developments over the past few months. In September, we began selling G6 in Canada and have seen a great response to this launch. In early October, we officially began shipping G6 to our Medicare patients. Toward this end, we are partnering with Walgreens to ensure that all Medicare patients can fill their prescriptions for DexCom CGM through any of Walgreens' nationwide retail locations.This provides a wonderful opportunity to improve upon the DexCom experience for our Medicare patients and is an important step in our long-term move to the pharmacy as our primary distribution channel. As you can see, we are innovating beyond great product design and focusing on the customer experience that we create around the product. Whether this involves DexCom directly or work with our valued partners, we are thinking with the interest of our patients in mind. We continue to make excellent progress with our insulin delivery partners.As Tandem Diabetes said on their call, they are on the verge of launching their advanced hybrid closed loop with Control-IQ system. On top of that, Insulet is making great progress with their Horizon closed-loop pump with DexCom G6 integration. The combination of Insulet and DexCom will provide a unique and compelling user experience and form factor. Our strategy for the intensive insulin delivery business is playing out according to our plan, and in fact, vastly exceeding our initial expectations.As we look to the future, we continue to gather data on markets to pursue outside of our core intensive insulin business. We are investing in our new markets team to execute on this strategy and expect to increase investment there in the future. Time and time again, we are learning that our product has an incredible impact in these markets. Doctors all over the world are clamoring for real-time CGM use in the hospital to improve patient outcomes and streamline workflows for healthcare professionals in this environment.We continue to believe that the opportunity for expanded use of DexCom in pregnancy is significant and are aware of several independent studies in progress around the world that will demonstrate the importance of CGM in this patient population. And finally, with respect to type two non-intensive diabetes and pre-diabetes, data from CGM usage continues to point to promising outcomes, including potential long-term cost reductions for this costly patient group. The experience here reminds us of where we were many years ago when we started our CGM First campaign for the intensive insulin market. While there may be many use cases for these patients, we believe that CGM will be the primary tool to drive improved outcomes in the type two non-intensive and pre-diabetes populations.And we all know the size of these markets. Overall, 2019 continues to exceed our expectations. Based on the strong third-quarter results, we are pleased again to be able to increase our revenue outlook, as well as our full-year operating margin and adjusted EBITDA targets. I will now turn the call over to Quentin, who will provide detail on this outlook, as well as a review of our financials.Quentin? -- Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release, as well as on our IR website. Today, we reported worldwide revenue of $396.3 million for the third quarter of 2019, compared to $266.7 million for the same quarter in 2018, representing growth of 49% on both a reported and constant-currency basis.Our momentum has continued, driven by strong new patient additions and customer satisfaction with G6. As Kevin mentioned, these factors drove absolute dollar growth of nearly $130 million versus the prior year, a new DexCom record and significantly above anything we've seen in the past. The U.S. business grew 53% in the third quarter, the fastest pace since early 2016, as the rapid adoption of CGM in the U.S.across all of our major channels, continues to exceed our expectations and has been the primary driver of our outperformance this year. We continue to gain traction in our effort to prioritize customer access in our commercial business and believe that our efforts to remove upfront barriers across all channels, including the pharmacy, are contributing to new patient growth. Our OUS business continues to grow very well, ahead of our internal expectations. In the third quarter, we came up against our highest OUS growth comp in the past six years, with 93% year-over-year growth in the third quarter of 2018.Despite that, we were still able to grow at 39% on a constant-currency basis or 36% on a reported basis, both of which represented a nice sequential uptick with solid increases across the board for both our direct and distributor markets. Our third-quarter gross profit was $246.9 million or 62.3% of sales, compared to 63.2% of sales in the third quarter of 2018. The Q3 sequential improvement of 90 basis points was in line with our expectations that we noted on the second-quarter call. While pricing remains consistent with our expectations and we are gaining the cost benefit of our new transmitter design, we did experience challenges with one of our automated G6 sensor production lines late in the third quarter which temporarily lowered production levels.This lower production output, combined with the strong product demand, have left inventory levels tight as we head into the fourth quarter. As a result, the remaining transition from G5 to G6 for certain channels of our business will be slower than originally anticipated. We still expect a strong sequential improvement in gross margin in the fourth quarter, but the magnitude will be less than original expectations. We now expect full-year gross margin of approximately 63%, slightly lower than prior guidance.Operating expenses were $187.8 million for Q3 2019, compared to $153.9 million in Q3 2018. This reflects an increase of 22% year over year. The business continues to demonstrate excellent operating leverage, with third-quarter revenue growth once again exceeding the growth in operating expenses by more than two times. As a result of our continued focus on operational discipline and commitment to process improvement, robotics, automation in our Manila location, we are achieving leverage while maintaining investments into research and development of our core business while also increasing investments in new market opportunities.Operating income was $59.1 million or 14.9% of revenue in the third quarter of 2019, compared to $14.7 million or 5.5% of revenue in the same quarter of 2018. This reflects a year-over-year improvement of 940 basis points in operating margins for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $92.5 million or 23.3% of revenue for the third quarter of 2019, compared to $48 million or 18% of revenue for the third quarter of 2018. As our operating margin and adjusted EBITDA margin indicate, we are making great progress toward our profitability targets, and we see these as strong indicators for the long-term cash flow potential of the business.Net income for the third quarter was $60.4 million or $0.65 per share. Through the first nine months of the year, we are now GAAP profitable for the first time in our company's history, and we are on track to deliver our first-ever full year of GAAP profitability. We remain in a strong cash position with greater than $1.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet at the end of the third quarter. Our immediate priority remains the expansion of our G6 production capacity, as well as capital investment in preparation for the eventual launch of G7.We also continue to have flexibility as we invest to lengthen our growth runway, including our investments in support of our new markets team. Turning to guidance. Given the incredible growth that we have experienced through the first nine months of the year, we now anticipate 2019 total revenue of $1.425 billion to $1.450 billion, an increase of greater than $85 million at the midpoints of our prior incurring guidance, respectively. Importantly, and unlike prior guidance, this contemplates the production capability that we currently anticipate for the fourth quarter.The revised revenue guidance implies an annual growth of 38% to 41%, which is an impressive organic growth number for a company of our size. As I mentioned previously, we now expect full-year gross margin of approximately 63%, improving sequentially in the fourth quarter as we start to realize the benefit of a full quarter of our new low-cost transmitter. In light of our better-than-expected revenue growth, we now expect operating margins of approximately 9% and adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 19.5%, reflecting increases of 200 basis points and 100 basis points, respectively, from our prior guidance. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve for a strategic update. -- Thanks, Quentin. Our great results in the third quarter are a validation of our strategic efforts, and we remain well-positioned to take advantage of our long-term growth opportunity. As some of you may have seen at September's EASD Conference in Barcelona, the full three-year results of our Comisair study showed that DexCom CGM, when paired with either insulin pumps or pens, drove an average increase of more than 20% to time and range. That is nearly five hours per day of improved glycemic control.Another clear validation of DexCom CGM as the first-line defense for people with diabetes and that CGM connected devices are here to stay. Our insulin delivery partners continue to make progress on CGM-enabled integrated systems. As Kevin mentioned, with the pending approval and launch of Control-IQ, we are thrilled to be bringing our first advanced hybrid closed-loop technology to market and commend Tandem on their progress to date and their dedication to bring this best-in-class platform to reality. DexCom is proud to provide the enabling CGM and AP algorithm technology for this platform.Together, these tools helped keep the system in a closed-loop mode 92% of the time during the pivotal study. Similarly, Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Companion Medical are all making progress in their efforts to commercialize connected smartpens. We are seeing more and more interest from additional insulin delivery companies that recognize the value of connectivity to CGM, and we will continue to be the demonstrated leader in these efforts. As we expand the rollout of G6, we are simultaneously taking steps to prepare the way for G7 which we still plan to launch on a limited basis in late 2020 and more broadly in 2021.We intend to be very thoughtful on the rollout of G7 as we scale the infrastructure necessary to support the anticipated demand for this exciting new platform. On our previous call, we announced the FDA submission of our G6 Pro product, and we were pleased to announce its approval in early October. This is another strong example of the streamlined review process enabled by our iCGM designation, giving us the opportunity to quickly iterate products to serve the needs of different customer segments. The G6 Pro represents the first disposable professional CGM product that is indicated for either blinded or unblinded real-time use.In blinded mode, the product is available for all people, ages two and up. In unblinded mode, G6 Pro is indicated for all people with diabetes, ages two and up. Both options provide valuable insights into the impact of activity, food choices, medications and other factors on people's glucose levels. It also provides clinicians a wonderful tool to introduce their patients to real-time CGM and to adjust or optimize treatment based on observable patterns and time and range.We've spoken at length this year about our efforts to improve access for our patients, whether advocating for coverage for type two intensive patients, pushing for ways to reduce the upfront cost to our patients or negotiating for the removal of administrative hurdles for patients to start on CGM. As you can see from various public and private data sources, we are making good progress with the long-term transition of the U.S. business to the pharmacy channel. As we've noted previously, this is a complex task.We have long-standing relationships with our DME distributors and many of our patients have grown accustomed to their process through the DME channel. With these challenges noted, our field team is doing solid work, and we look forward to continued expansion through the pharmacy channel. Specific to formulary placement, we don't plan to comment on every contract win, as this is a normal part of our business operations. What we will say, as many of you have likely seen, is that we have good momentum here in our efforts.The value of DexCom CGM speaks for itself, and payers and PBMs continue to demonstrate their understanding of what our product brings to the customer. With that, I will pass it back to Kevin. -- Thank you, Steve. It is hard to continue to put words around the growth that we have seen since the launch of G6, and the third quarter is certainly no exception. At DexCom, we have the stated mission to empower people to take control of diabetes. As this quarter, and clinical studies like Comisair continues to demonstrate, we have a product that is enabling people to do just that.It seems like every day we hear stories have people gaining confidence with their help. Children and patients living with less fear and overall quality of lives improving. These are the stories of people being empowered. To wrap up, 2019 has proven to be a wonderful year thus far, and we remain excited for the long road ahead.To the DexCom team, let's finish the year strong. I would now like to open up the call for Q&A. Sean? -- Thank you, Kevin. [Operator instructions][Operator instructions] And your first question comes from Danielle Antalffy from SVB. Your line is open. -- Hey good afternoon guys, thanks so much for taking the questions. Congrats on what can only be described as a phenomenal quarter. I'll keep it to -- I'll follow instructions and keep it to one question. Kevin, you mentioned capacity -- some capacity challenges and the line that went down during the quarter.Can you give some additional color on how that factors into your guidance for the remainder of the year? And why you weren't concerned about meeting increasing demand going forward? Thanks so much. -- Thanks for the question, Danielle. Give a little history here. We launched G6 a year ago, and we launched it earlier than we planned. And we've been chasing this ever since we started.As you look at 2019, we've grown over $300 million in the first three quarters and $130 million in the last quarter. And while we've experienced large growth percentages in the past, we've never experienced anything like this. We committed to doubling our capacity this year. And by the time we exit the year, in all fairness, we will have double the capacity to build G6 product that we had before.We're doing everything we can to put additional capacity in place to meet the demand for the fourth quarter. As we talked about, our manufacturing line went down in September, late in the third quarter and for some time early in the fourth quarter. That's production we can't make up today. We do have some levers to pull and some things that might come on board in December.We can see some upside to making that up. And in our worst case, we assume in our guidance this year that we're not going to make that up. We're not going to plan on that. And if we do, there's some upside there.So by the time we exit the year, we will have doubled our G6 capacity. And I can tell you we have more automated lines coming on, some in the first quarter, more in the second quarter to the point by the time you get to the middle of 2020, we will have doubled our capacity again and be able to serve everybody. We're confident we have enough capacity to meet the numbers that we've given you. We believe we have an opportunity to do more if certain things go well, and then we'll go from there.And your next question comes from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is open. -- Hey, guys, good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. First one for me. It's a little bit tagging answer, and from Danielle, in terms of the marketplace demand that you're seeing. Given the capacity constraints you have, I assume a lot of the growth that you're seeing is actually push-driven, meaning that patients are educated and they're reaching out to you versus you trying to convince them.So is that true? And then should we assume that patient add growth is still growing at the same pace or better than U.S. revenue growth and why or why that shouldn't change going forward? Thanks. -- You know what, let me start with that. And if Quentin, Steve want to jump in, they can. With respect to new patients, Q3 was very comparable to Q2. We had a very good new patient, third quarter.And so that has not been an issue with respect to patients reordering. We have not seen a change in reordering patterns from our patients. They're ordering what and when they can and when their insurance will reimburse for them. So there's no real difference here as to what we've experienced in the past.In reality, what we're experiencing, what we're working through is getting product out to them as quickly as we can. Sometimes they wait just an extra day for the product, sometimes it's as long as a week. But we are getting product to everybody. We'd like to get it to them sooner, and we'd like to have more at our discretion here.But we're keeping up with everything. And we're doing well. -- I think Margaret, the only thing I would add is it's a combination of both, right? I mean patients continue to become more and more aware of the technology and find their way to the device. And clearly, our commercial team continues to do just an outstanding job of creating opportunities as well. So it's a bit of both. And the new patient additions continue to outpace overall revenue growth.So it's a strong indicator of where the business is heading. -- Perfect. Thank you, guys.And your next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird. Your line is open. -- Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. I was -- I wanted to ask -- I know, Steve, you said you're not going to say a lot on formulary status, but we've seen a few positive moves with the sizable payers for 2020 with regards to DexCom's placement. So I'm wondering, what's driving that favorable treatment into next year? Maybe how does some of your tiering placements for next year compared to your lower price competitor? And Quentin, are you still comfortable with the $100 million to $125 million pricing headwind next year as you give up some price to move into pharmacy? Or are these big wins, maybe push that expectation a little bit higher in trade-off or volume? Thank you. -- So I'll start off, and then I'll turn it over to Quentin on the numbers. Yes. Look, I mean, this is what we told you guys. We're executing on exactly what we told you we would do, which is why it was somewhat tongue in cheek, the prepared remarks, that we're not going to put a press release out every time we get a new pharmacy win.But this is what we told you we would do. We've been telling you we would do this, and we're executing on our plans. And with respect to pricing, Quentin you can comment? -- Yes. No. It's right in line with what we have always anticipated, Jeff. I don't, at this point, see any need to kind of revise the expectation we've put out there.I think that $100 million to $125 million of headwinds is something that we'll continue to see throughout the course of next year. But we aren't changing our strategy here. I think what's being demonstrated is that our plan is being effective. It's working, and the payers are seeing the value of our products.And they understand it for the premium product that it is, and we're opening doors. So no change there.And your next question is from Ryan Blicker with Cowen. Your line is open. -- Hi, thanks for taking my questions. For G7, how much progress have you made working on automating your manufacturing processes over the past few months? And is there still a significant amount of work to be done, nailing down your exact manufacturing process? And then for G7 overall, what are the biggest steps in the development process you hope to accomplish over the next few months? Thank you. -- Hi, this is Kevin. I'll take that. G7 is on schedule as we sit right now with the schedule that we put together on all fronts. We are now in the process of evaluating the final tweaks to the configuration to lock down the entire design.The majority of the design is locked down, but we've got a -- as always, when we get to this point in the sensor, what's that exact sensor configuration going to be, and then we've got some algorithm and some effort to do, but none of that will slow down the clinical study. With respect to the total automation of the G7 plant, Steve, very, very truthfully said we're going to do a limited launch in 2020 and be careful how we launch in 2021. We don't want to put ourselves in a position we're talking about today, because we see that as a product that we can market to the world at great, great -- with great, great success. So our automated lines are in design.They're being built. The equipment's not all in yet because the process isn't completely done. But things like ordering molds which have a long lead time and things of that nature are happening. And you will see significant capital expenditures by us over the next several months as we get these lines up and running.We have a great automation team. We have good processes that we're counting on. They'll certainly be adjusted as the product becomes more mature. The product was designed to be more manufacturable than G6.So we think these processes could be simpler over time. And I'll just add one other thing. We're not just asking the guys to automate G7, at the same time, they're automating the G6 factory, as well as we have automated lines for the assembly of our G6 product going up both in San Diego and in our Mesa facility. So we've got a lot on our plate manufacturing-wise.We're confident with the progress we're making, what the guys are doing, and expect a very successful launch in product.And your next question comes from David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. -- Good afternoon, and congrats on a great quarter. Yes, Quentin, just in terms of just the fourth-quarter guidance, you typically guide a fair amount of sequential deceleration, kind of in line with historical precedent. And in the fourth quarter, it's a little heavier than normal coming off a very, very strong third quarter. Is there anything from a timing perspective or pull-forward perspective for the fourth quarter that's worth calling out? -- Let me just talk through the fourth quarter for a second and give you a little bit of color on it. There's nothing significant in terms of timing that, I think, changes the impact of either Q3 or Q4. But one thing to keep in mind is the OUS business is a bit more choppy than the rest of our business. The sequential trends there can move around a little bit.If you look historically, international has typically been flat to slightly down in the fourth quarter, and we continue to expect that's how it will play out this year. I think the other thing to keep in mind is that as we continue to move more and more of the business toward a subscription-based model, the historic seasonality is going to play a little bit differently in the current year than what we've seen throughout history. So we're trying to model that as well. I think the other thing just to keep in mind is, Q3 was truly a remarkable quarter for us.We were up 18% sequentially from Q2, whereas, historically, we've been up 8% to 10%. So for us to look at that and call it a trend and anticipate that we're going to see the same sequential increase into the fourth quarter, that's a bit premature. We want to see this play out a little bit longer than just 90 days worth of experience in the third quarter. So we're trying to be mindful of that.And I think the other thing just that is worth noting, and Kevin has hit on it, we are capacity -- we're at the top end of the capacity in our guidance range. And if we can pull some of these incremental opportunities forward in terms of production lines, then terrific. There's going to be opportunity to exceed what we set the expectation for. Worst-case scenario, as those lines come up in the very early part of January, and we're off and running at that point.But if we can get those brought forward, then there's potential upside.And your next question comes from Robbie Marcus with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. -- Thanks, and congrats on a great quarter. I was wondering if you could just help parse out what the drivers of growth were, clearly breaking down the barriers of costs that the pharmacy is having a big impact. But anything you could add on Medicare versus pharmacy versus DME would be really helpful. Thank you. -- Our big driver this quarter was the U.S. commercial business. Our U.S. commercial business, not Medicare, but our U.S.commercial patients and our U.S. commercial revenues grew at a rate faster than any quarter we've ever seen. And that was the primary driver. Medicare growth continues to be good.But in all fairness, in the third quarter, we know there's some pent-up demand for patients to shift over to G6. We expect Medicare to really take off next year as we roll out our Walgreens and pharmacy delivery mechanism for the Medicare patients and make it much easier for them and get them all over to G6. International was also a great quarter. The growth sequentially there was very strong.Quentin talked about the fact that we're comparing to a 93% growth quarter internationally last year, and we still grew 39% over that number. So the international markets were good as well. I really can't tell you whether it's DME or pharmacy that's driving it. I think just the drive is awareness.And people are becoming much more aware of CGM, and what it can do for them and having great experiences with the product that we have.And your next question comes from Kyle Rose with Canaccord. Your line is open. -- Great. Thank you very much for taking the questions and congrats on a terrific quarter. You talked a little bit -- or talked at length about some of the capacity from a manufacturing perspective. But if we look back at some of the last two years, when you think about some of the growth you've had, you've also been somewhat constrained just from a customer support perspective.Given the surge in growth from a new patient perspective, maybe help us understand just what other investments and infrastructure changes you're making from a customer support perspective, both currently now with the G6. I know you went to OUS or offshore in some of that support earlier this year, but also in prep for G7 in 2020 and then 2020 and beyond. And then I'll hop back in queue. Thank you. -- Yes. Well, certainly, the operation that we've set up in Manila has turned into a real corporate asset of ours. I think you look at the performance that we're seeing there, both from a quantitative, qualitative perspective, quite honestly, we're operating at some of the highest levels that we've ever seen in the company's history. And that's allowing us to scale more aggressively than what we have historically and address some of the increasing demand that we see.I think another thing that we spend a tremendous amount of time looking for opportunities in the organization is just around what we call RPA or robotic automation and taking processes that are incredibly labor-intensive and finding those aspects of those processes and automating those, so that the folks who are doing those things can focus really more on value-added capabilities to the organization and serving the patients or even our commercial team in a much better way. And I think, encouragingly, we're seeing NPS scores start to reach some of their highest levels here in recent weeks than what we've seen over the last 18 to 24 months, even before we started down the path of taking some of the things outside the States and into the Philippines. So we're encouraged by what we're seeing. We continue to make investments in those ways.I think as we continue to head into the future, the more we can automate the patient experience with us and eliminate the need for a live person to be on the other end of every phone call, the greater we're going to have an ability to scale and improve the patient experience along the way. So those are the things we're focused on. We're encouraged by what we're seeing. But to be fair and truthful, it has been a challenge over the time that the growth has really put pressure on it.And we're doing everything we can to stay out ahead of it. -- I'd just add one other thing. We have an opportunity with G7 to reset the bar as to how we're going to act with patients and what distribution and reimbursement channels we'll pursue. Everything we're doing with G6 is positioning us to put G7 in its most accessible light to make sure patients can get right to it. Again, our Walgreens announcement with the Medicare patients to whereby Medicare patients will be able to go to Walgreens and get their monthly supplies, rather than calling us and being on the phone with us or our distributors, is a major win.I was on the phone with a physician just a couple of weeks ago, and he explained to me his frustration with -- we have three or four Medicare distributors on ourselves, and all three of those ask -- all of those ask for different paperwork. We think we can make this much more efficient for our patients with that move. And that's part of the innovation and thinking big I was referring to. We're going to make this easier.And so everything we're doing with G6 is going to fly right into G7, and we are preparing to become a company that serves several million patients, not just several hundred thousand.And your next question comes from Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Your line is open. -- Thanks, and good afternoon. So I guess, just given the U.S. growth, I think it begs the question around traction in people with insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes. So can you just comment on what you're seeing in this patient population and the impact the pharmacy has had on penetrating this opportunity? -- I'll take that, Jason. We are growing in that space, but in all fairness, we do not have the broad reimbursement for insulin-using type 2 patients that we so desire. Medicare covers those patients. And some of the payers have come along, and some of them have not.We think it will continue to grow over time. But even with our pharmacy contracts, there are sometimes limitations as to what insulin-using patients can have access to our technology. We are negotiating through that. We are willing to give, for example, willing to give price to have those patients covered if they will cover them.The Medicare patients do have coverage. And that's where a large portion of this population exists. And we will be able to get those and go after them. But it's still a chore and it's still not -- certainly not the majority of our business, even the majority of our Medicare patients at this point in time.It's a great growth opportunity for us.And your next question comes from Travis Steed with Bank of America. Your line is open. -- Hi. Congratulations on an outstanding quarter. So it's been almost a year since you laid out the various non-core market opportunities at your Analyst Day. You've got a dedicated team looking at that and doing research there.Just love to hear kind of what you've learned over the last year if there's anything you can elaborate on in terms of different business models or any different views on the market sizes there? -- Yes. This is Kevin. I'll let Steve and Quentin take a little more of that, too, because we've all had interesting experiences. As this has evolved, we've gone from -- we're going to have a complicated type two program to using other programs, to having payers run the thing, to how is this model going to go.And the one learning that I've seen that I'll share with you is, it doesn't matter what the model is. CGM is what drives it. And I think there's going to be opportunities across the board, directly with payers, directly with the programmatic entities, directly with employers, directly with clinics to better manage these patients. And you'll see CGM usage vary from model to model.There are some who think you need a specific number per year, but the most recent group I talked to said, \"I just put them on them on it all the time because we get such good results.\" We don't know how it's going to play out. But again, look at the size of that market and look at the amount of dollars spent taking care of those patients. Look at the cost of drugs for those patients and their effectiveness. We think there's a cost savings play here that might be even greater than what we're saving in the type 1 space and intensive insulin using space, when all is said and done, if we can develop the right algorithms to get into the right groups.I don't know, Steve, Quentin, you got to anything? -- No. I think you hit it just right. -- Yes. I don't have anything to add to that.And your next question comes from JP McKim from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions. It's actually Matt on for JP. So as I look back at the business on the top line over the last five years, you guys haven't grown less than 25% per year in any of those last five. In the last two, it's been much, much faster than that.So as we think forward a little bit, I know you've got a little bit of capacity constraint at the moment, but it seems like you've got a lot of tailwinds here on the Medicare side and the pharmacy side. So is there anything specifically that could keep you from that level of growth as we look forward? -- Yes. I think, Matt, more than anything else, as that business gets larger and you get into kind of the law of large numbers, the growth rate continues to come under pressure. I think that you look at -- last year, we grew $300 million year-over-year in terms of absolute dollar growth this year. At the midpoint, we're talking about $400 million of absolute dollar growth, yet the growth rate is arguably a little bit slower, still at elevated levels, but arguably slower.So I think that as we continue to move into the future, the rates' going to just be pressured from the tougher and tougher comps that we have and a larger base of business. But you hit the nail on the head. There's a lot to be bullish about. And we couldn't be more bullish around the opportunities that sit in front of us within the core business itself, the alternative market opportunities.I mean these markets are enormous. And I think what we learn more and more every day is that at the end of the day, it's CGM device that really opens up the opportunity to either impact cost, improve a patient's life, whatever it might be. It comes right back to our device. So we couldn't be more bullish about the future.But at the same time, we're not going to get ahead of ourselves. We're going to be thoughtful, but we're going to pursue every one of those growth opportunities as far as we can.And your next question comes from Mathew Blackman with Stifel. Your line is open. -- Good afternoon, everyone. You guys spent a lot of time answering questions about the pricing implications of pharmacy access. I was hoping you could talk a bit about the potential profitability implications of increasing mix running through the pharmacy. -- Yes. I think the pharmacy is a very, very attractive business model for us. Obviously, it reduces the burden that a patient and a physician and even our back-office staff here has to work through to get a patient onto the technology. So it's attractive from that perspective.But it's also very attractive from a profitability perspective. We firmly believe that we can make more profit dollars per patient through the pharmacy channel than we can to the DME channel. So -- and much of that comes by way of reducing the back office effort and just reducing the amount of time that it takes to get that patient on to the product. And then it clearly opens up by having easier access, the opportunity to address more of the market.So for all those reasons, pharmacy is very attractive to us, but from a profitability perspective, it's going to deliver profit dollars on a per-patient basis that are higher than the DME channel.And your next question comes from Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer. Steven, your line is open. -- Thank you. Hi, guys. Yes. Just following up on the very strong international performance.Were there any standouts in particular that stood out? Or was it across the board? And what was the -- what are some of the big new opportunities you're focused on ahead outside of the U.S.? Thanks. -- I'll speak to the quarter itself. I mean it's pretty simple, and maybe Steve or Kevin can speak to the opportunities. But within the quarter, it was very widespread. It was across our direct markets, it was across our distributor markets and it was across all of the regions.There wasn't anyone country, in particular, that far and away led the pack. There wasn't anyone country that was far and away behind the pack either. So it continues to be very broad-based strength across each and every one of our markets and the teams' are doing a remarkable job with it. -- I'd just add, I spoke a bit about the Canadian launch in September. And that launch was a great success and win for our Canadian team. If I depict one other geography, the one I'll call out is the U.K. They had a month in December that far exceed -- I mean, September, that far exceeded anything that had ever done.And we're pretty proud of the results. And we got an email, \"Hey, we just hit this mark.\" And it's pretty exciting because we don't have widespread reimbursement in the U.K., it's regional, and there's a lot of cash pay. We think as we grow in the U.K., we can get widespread reimbursement, and then this becomes a much greater market for us. So kudos to the U.K.team as well. -- Yes. I think the only final add for me would be, as you guys are building models, don't build anything significant this year from Japan. But Kevin and I just spent some time over in Japan. And kind of detailed G6 for the first time, G6 is filed in Japan.And we expect to launch it there, probably the first half of next year. And there's some real excitement around that product. So we'll get you guys updated when the time comes. But that's still really a nonexistent market for us at this point.[Operator instructions] Your next question comes from Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim. Your line is open. -- Thanks, and congrats on the quarter, guys. Quentin, the SG&A leverage this quarter was very impressive. Can you talk about the sustainability of that? You didn't raise EBITDA guidance by quite as much as I thought you may have given the progress this quarter. So I'm just wondering if there was anything in terms of timing of spend that may have shifted some dollars from Q3 into Q4. -- No. Nothing specific around the timing of spend, although I will tell you, in the fourth quarter, we're going to start to see some incremental spend, particularly around the development efforts of automating these G7 lines. We have the product pretty well dialed in, in terms of its design. Now it's all about designing these lines.And conceptually, we know what the lines need to look like, what they need to produce. Now it's fine-tuning that work and making sure that we have them up ready to start to roll. So you've got that cost coming through in the fourth quarter that you didn't necessarily have in the third quarter. To your point, on a year-to-date basis, we made incredible traction from a profitability perspective.OPEX has levered over 1,000 basis points. And on a full-year basis, we're going to see tremendous leverage from both an operating margin and EBITDA margin, even though it might not have been raised in line with what you were expecting. It's still tremendous improvements. I think what it tells you is that this business has the capability to perform very appealing profitability measures if you will.There's nothing structurally in the business model that keeps us from being able to do that. I think what we want to be able to do is balance the investments that are going to open up all these new growth opportunities, that we continue to become more convicted are real. And so we're going to balance that over time. But we remain committed to those long-term profitability goals we've laid out.We're making tremendous progress toward them and feel good about where we're at today. So we're pleased with the progress that's being made.And there are no questions at this time. -- All right. This is Kevin. I'm going to close up as I usually do. We want to thank everybody for participating on the call this quarter.In closing, I want to acknowledge the contribution of all of our team members to get to this point. $130 million in growth in this quarter combined with our best financial results ever. We've never delivered a quarter like this. And we've asked our people to go above and beyond in 2019 to achieve these things.While our year-to-date revenue growth is near 50%, I can assure you all that our volume growth, of all product components, far exceeds that number. And we've been running all year to keep up. And while we see a light at the end of the tunnel, it's just not as quickly as we'd hoped for. Our commercial teams have hit on all cylinders this year.International growth remains strong and a great opportunity going forward for us is global access and awareness continues to improve. We also talked about the effectiveness of our U.S. reimbursement team and positioning us for the future, enabling our shift to more efficient distribution channels with numerous contract wins and our relationships throughout our distribution channels have been nothing but strengthen over the course of the year. And finally, our U.S.sales team, both internal and external. They've navigated through some very difficult situations with respect to our supply constraints, yet remain engaged and effective. There isn't a better group anywhere. Many of our accomplishments this year can be measured by numbers, all of the letters and emails of lives that we've changed.Standing up a facility and a business in the Philippines over the past 9 months that's grown to a nearly 700-person workforce of people who have committed to this company, as everybody here in the States, and who demonstrate the commitment to patients that we've always had that have made DexCom the company than it is today. We look forward to continuing this success in the future. Thank you.[Operator signoff] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the DXCM options chain for the new November 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $145.00 strike price has a current bid of $6.90.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $145.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $138.10 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of DXCM, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $152.59/share today.\n\nBecause the $145.00 strike represents an approximate 5% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if DXCM shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for DexCom Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing DXCM's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $155.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $155.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 856 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the DXCM options chain for the new January 2022 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $150.00 strike price has a current bid of $32.70.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $150.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $117.30 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of DXCM, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $154.98/share today.\n\nBecause the $150.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .

If an investor was to purchase shares of DXCM stock at the current price level of $154.98/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $170.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 32.21% if the stock gets called away at the January 2022 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if DXCM shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for DexCom Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing DXCM's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $170.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $170.00 strike represents an approximate 10% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

Underneath the big selloff, would you ever guess that plenty of stocks made\u00a0new 52-week highs\u00a0that very same day?No, I\u2019m not talking about the good old \u201cFANG\u201d stocks \u2013\u00a0 (NASDAQ:), \u00a0(NASDAQ:),\u00a0\u00a0(NASDAQ:) and\u00a0\u00a0(NASDAQ:), which fell 2.4%, 3%, 1.8% and 3.2%, respectively.In fact, the FANG stocks have been well off their highs for at least a month \u2013 if not 10 or 11 months!However, several of my stocks\u00a0did\u00a0hit new 52-week highs\u2026including\u00a0\u00a0(NASDAQ:),\u00a0 (NYSE:) and  (NYSE:), one of my Top 5 Stocks in my  service. A medical device maker, a defense contractor, and a power company\u2026what a motley crew.Well \u2013 what\u00a0do\u00a0these stocks have in common?Take a look at how these companies measure up in my\u00a0Portfolio Grader\u00a0and I think you\u2019ll spot the common thread:Yep, this diverse group of stocks from different corners of the U.S. economy all earned an \u201cA\u201d for their Quantitative Grade.That formula is one of the most important aspects of the stock-picking system behind\u00a0Portfolio Grader. And it\u2019s responsible for all the best wins of my investing career \u2013 so let me explain what I\u2019m measuring here:Essentially, a stock\u2019s Quantitative Grade lets you know whether or not it is experiencing strong\u00a0buying pressure. Simply put, I believe in \u201cfollowing the money.\u201d If the \u201csmart money\u201d on Wall Street, like hedge funds and mutual funds, is pouring into a stock, that provides great momentum to keep the stock moving higher, all in itself. If the smart money is\u00a0avoiding\u00a0a stock \u2013 that\u2019s a major red flag.For example, most all of the FANG stocks currently have a \u201cC\u201d for their Quantitative Grade. Not terrible\u2026but DXCM, LMT and NEE are simply better favored on Wall Street, as shown by their \u201cA\u201d grades. And the new 52-week highs demonstrate that.Energy stocks, on the other hand, are racking up lots of \u201cDs\u201d and even \u201cFs\u201d for their Quantitative Grade. So, while many of them have juicy dividend yields, the incredibly weak stock performance cancels out that thesis for investing in energy at this time.This all being the case\u2026it won\u2019t surprise you to learn that at\u00a0, we\u2019re largely avoiding energy. By focusing on companies with strong fundamentals, and popularity on Wall Street \u2013 even if they don\u2019t receive much press \u2013 we\u2019ve been able to ride stocks like DXCM, LMT and NEE to new 52-week highs, despite the volatile market.In fact, at\u00a0, we\u2019ve enjoyed such strong relative performance that we haven\u2019t had to sell any stocks in three months.So would I recommend that\u00a0you\u00a0respond to the trade-war terrors by dumping your stocks?\u00a0No.I\u00a0would\u00a0recommend, however, that you\u00a0. For example, you might not want a portfolio that\u2019s overly exposed to Europe \u2013 given that President Trump has proposed tariffs on EU goods as well. While the \u201cbig fish\u201d is\u00a0 (OTCMKTS:), the European rival to \u00a0 (NYSE:), consumer staples like olive oil, wine and cheese may also incur the extra tax.Tariffs or no, I say \u201cbuy American\u201d is the way to go, anyway. When you get down to it, the United States is not only the country with the largest economy \u2013 but we also have some of the best growth prospects as well. At this point, countries from Sweden to Japan and even Germany are even willing to resort to negative interest rates to juice their growth. This is largely why global capital is pouring into the U.S. bond market\u2026and the U.S.\u00a0stock\u00a0market has been the oasis for quite some time already, and clearly, it still is today.As you see below, the S&P 500 (with its 14% year-to-date gain) is beating other global indexes by a mile.Out of those 500 stocks \u2013 which becomes more like 5,000 when you factor in the whole U.S. market \u2013 how do we find the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me?Well,\u00a0.You already saw Step 1 earlier: \u201cfollow the money.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0to profit and protect yourself.These days, if you want to invest with the \u201csmart money,\u201d you\u2019ve got to have a healthy weighting in bulletproof stocks like my\u00a0.Not only did these stocks earn an A in my\u00a0Portfolio Grader, thanks to strong buying pressure and great fundamentals\u2026The stocks\u00a0also\u00a0earn an A in my\u00a0Dividend Grader.

Not everyone believes in AT&T\u2019s path forward, which explains the firm\u2019s ultra-low valuation. However, I think T stock\u2019s future looks bright in the streaming space and its position in 5G means the company has a definite future growth catalyst.

Honeywell not only makes everything from connected fire alarms to thermostats for consumers, but the firm also delivers a wide range of connected solutions at the enterprise level as well.\u00a0There\u2019s a lot to like about HON stock from its modest P/E of 18.4 to its respectable 2% dividend yield to the fact that it\u2019s been able to grow its earnings per share by 14% annually for the past three years. However, what I find most compelling about Honeywell is the fact that the firm is making big moves into the internet of things space in an unprecedented way.

The chips that power connected devices and the networks themselves are an integral part of the overall future of the internet of things. However, choosing which semiconductor stocks to buy right now is a tricky business as the industry has been up against some pretty strong headwinds in recent months.\u00a0My pick here is (NASDAQ:), a Massachusetts-based semiconductor firm whose share price has been on a roller coaster ride for the past year.

The firm\u2019s tech is also included in Oculus headsets,  (NASDAQ:) virtual reality arm.So, although you\u2019re taking on a lot of risk considering that the trade war with China looks unlikely to let up anytime soon, SWKS could offer a great deal of reward as well. Not only will its connected chips drive growth in the future, but the firm\u2019s comparisons in 2020 will be much easier after the dismal year it\u2019s had.

Its shares are up over 40% year to date and have nearly quadrupled over the last five years. Despite fears that a recession could be on the way and worries about escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China, DexCom stock is .Some investors might worry that gravity could kick in for this high-flying stock. But is DexCom still a smart stock to buy?Image source: Getty Images.Probably the strongest argument for buying shares of DexCom is that the company's growth is still only in its early stages. DexCom's G6 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system has been a huge winner so far. Its momentum isn't slowing down, with the G6 CGM driving  of 2019.DexCom plans to launch the G6 in Canada and make the system available to U.S. Medicare patients later this year. The company is on track to double its manufacturing capacity for the G6 by the end of 2019 in anticipation of higher demand.The realities of the current state of diabetes treatment and management are stacked in DexCom's favor. Of the estimated 415 million people across the world with diabetes, only around 12.5% consistently achieve their target glucose levels. Most individuals with diabetes have glucose levels outside of desired thresholds roughly 70% of the time.Real-time CGM provides a solution to this issue. And DexCom's G6 currently reigns as the most powerful CGM on the market. It's the only CGM that meets all of the special controls established by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for fully interoperable continuous glucose monitoring (iCGM) systems.\u00a0DexCom expects to launch a new CGM, the G7, by late 2020 or early 2021. This system will be even smaller and more cost-effective than the G6 and have longer sensor wear. DexCom thinks that the G7 will accelerate its expansion into adjacent markets beyond its core intensive insulin focus.There are around 3.2 million patients in the U.S. that are included in DexCom's core market. The company currently claims a little under 20% of this market. DexCom is especially targeting the gestational diabetes opportunity and the intermittent monitoring of diabetes in hospital patients, which represent another 4 million and 14 million patients, respectively.One knock against DexCom is that its share price already reflects expectations of significant growth. Shares currently trade at 123 times expected earnings. The consensus Wall Street one-year price target for the stock is less than 3% above DexCom's current share price.Achieving the lofty growth projections isn't a slam dunk, either. DexCom isn't the only player in the CGM market. '  lower-cost FreeStyle Libre has taken the market by storm as well, with sales growing even faster than the G6.Abbott awaits FDA clearance to market a new version of its CGM that meets all iCGM standards. Abbott CEO Miles White stated in the company's Q2 conference call that he expects the new Libre device will achieve annual sales of at least $5 billion. DexCom's competition could soon intensify, and it's going up against a much bigger rival with Abbott.It's also possible that DexCom will find its expansion into adjacent markets is more challenging than anticipated. At this point, the company is only exploring how it can move into some of these new markets.The decision about buying DexCom right now boils down to whether or not the company can keep its phenomenal growth rate going. I think it can.I referred to Wall Street's one-year price target for DexCom earlier, but there's another estimate that I didn't mention. Analysts expect the company will generate average annual earnings growth of 140% over the next five years. That puts DexCom's seemingly sky-high valuation in a different light.What about the stiffer competition from Abbott Labs? My view is that the market is big enough to support both DexCom and Abbott. DexCom should be able to compete much more effectively against FreeStyle Libre with the G7 because of the lower manufacturing cost for the new system. I don't expect the G7 to beat Libre on price, but a lower cost will help tremendously.As for expanding into adjacent markets, I won't be surprised if it takes longer than many hope it will. However, my take is that CGM offers significant benefits in managing gestational diabetes, in hospital intermittent glucose monitoring, and for patients with type 2 diabetes who aren't intensive insulin users.I believe that the future continues to look very bright for DexCom. There could be some bumps in the road along the way, but I think this stock is a good pick for investors with a long-term perspective.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Some are now worried that a recession could be imminent.While inverted yield curves can be predictors of oncoming recessions, it's important to note that those recessions sometimes don't happen for several years. And the yield curve can quickly reverse its inversion. It's already happened earlier this year.\u00a0More importantly, stocks can continue to perform very well even while bond yields appear to be out of whack.Three healthcare stocks are proving this point and then some.  ,  , and   just hit all-time highs. Here's why these stocks continue to soar despite overall market uncertainty and whether they're smart picks to buy now.Image source: Getty Images.Back in March, a short-seller published a report that predicted DexCom's shares would plunge 50% or more with the company's leadership in the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) market threatened. While that report , its predictions haven't panned out so far. DexCom is up close to 40% so far this year.The reason behind DexCom's great performance is that business is booming for its G6 CGM system. In DexCom's  announced three weeks ago, the company easily beat Wall Street revenue and earnings estimates. DexCom reported year-over-year revenue growth of 39% thanks to higher sales for the G6 CGM system.\u00a0CEO Kevin Sayer  that DexCom is \"just scratching the surface of the potential\" for its CGM technology. Thus far, CGM has focused on patients with diabetes who require intensive glucose monitoring to regulate insulin administration. However, the company is exploring the use of its CGM system beyond these traditionally intensive insulin-using patients by conducting studies for the use of CGM in pregnancy and inpatient settings.The company also is developing the successor to the G6 CGM. Sayer stated that DexCom expects a limited launch of the new G7 CGM system in late 2020 with a broader launch in 2021. The G7 system will be a fully disposable CGM that's significantly smaller than the G6, less expensive, and will have a longer extended-wear period.Edwards Lifesciences is another medical device stock that's having a great year so far. Its shares are up over 40% year to date, with no signs of investor fatigue yet.Like DexCom, Edwards Lifesciences  driven by increasing demand for its products. The company posted 15% year-over-year revenue growth, topping analysts' projections. Edwards' success has been fueled mainly by its\u00a0transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) artificial heart valves, its\u00a0surgical structural heart and critical care solutions, and its new Pascal transcatheter mitral system.Innovation is key to Edwards Lifesciences' growth. The company already launched its Sapien 3 Ultra heart valve in Europe and won U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the TAVR artificial heart valve this week.The company also thinks that increased adoption of TAVR therapy will be a tailwind in the future. Edwards Lifesciences CEO Mike Mussallem  that \"we are increasingly confident that there are many patients who would benefit from TAVR and who are not diagnosed, referred, or treated today.\" Mussallem also noted that the company anticipates solid international growth because of relatively low TAVR therapy adoption outside of the U.S.West Pharmaceutical Services has delivered the most impressive year-to-date performance of these three healthcare stocks at all-time highs. Shares have jumped nearly 50% so far in 2019.West specializes in making containment and delivery systems for injectable medicines. The company doesn't usually generate spectacular growth. However, West has consistently beaten Wall Street earnings estimates this year and boosted its full-year 2019 revenue and earnings guidance in July.The company's\u00a0NovaPure and Westar components have been especially popular with customers that develop , which are made from living organisms. That's great news because biologic drugs themselves have become more prevalent. Eight of the top 10 best-selling drugs last year were biologics.West Pharmaceutical Services is also growing through acquisitions. The company recently acquired its distributor in South Korea to establish a more direct presence in the important Asian market. CEO Eric Green  that the company will \"continuously look at bolt-on technologies that will enhance our current portfolio.\"\u00a0\u00a0I like two of these three high-flying stocks. My view is that DexCom should have plenty of room to run, with continued momentum for its G6 CGM and tremendous potential for its new G7 CGM on the way. I also think that Edwards Lifesciences' prospects look great, especially now that it's won FDA approval for the Sapien 3 Ultra heart valve.But while I like West Pharmaceutical Services as a business, I'm not convinced the stock can keep its upward trajectory going for too much longer. Shares trade at more than 42 times expected earnings. West isn't growing fast enough to deserve that lofty valuation, in my opinion.\u00a0When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Edwards Lifesciences wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.\u00a0\u00a0The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["wo companies stand at the forefront of the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems market.   has enjoyed tremendous success with its Freestyle Libre CGM.   has also seen sales skyrocket for its G6 CGM.\u00a0Shares of both companies have performed really well over the past couple of years. But which stock is the better pick for long-term investors now? Here's how Abbott and Dexcom stack up against each other.Image source: Getty Images.Abbott Labs ranks as the  based on market cap. But the company doesn't focus exclusively on medical devices. Abbott also has multibillion-dollar established pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, and nutritional products businesses.The main reason to consider buying Abbott Labs is that it should be in a great position to deliver a solid total return to long-term investors. One component of that total return is Abbott's dividend, which currently yields 1.5%. Abbott is a member of the elite group of stocks known as  and has increased its dividend for 47 consecutive years. The company has paid a dividend every quarter since 1924.But the case for Abbott isn't limited to its strong dividend. Wall Street analysts project the company will grow its earnings by an average of nearly 12% annually over the next five years.A key driver for that growth will almost certainly be Abbott's Freestyle Libre CGM. Abbott CEO Miles White  that he thinks the company's second version of the Libre device, which will meet U.S. standards for\u00a0integrated continuous glucose monitoring systems, should generate annual sales of at least $5 billion in the not-too-distant future.Abbott should also be able to count on strong growth from its structural heart business, with its MitraClip device for treating mitral regurgitation leading the way. The company's diagnostics business also appears to be in a solid position to deliver growth, thanks in large part to the continued momentum for its Alinity diagnostic instruments.It's possible that Abbott could make additional acquisitions to fuel growth even more. However, with its strong organic growth prospects, the company doesn't have to complete any significant transactions to deliver an attractive return over the long run.Dexcom isn't the healthcare giant that Abbott is. It doesn't pay a dividend as Abbott does. But Dexcom's growth prospects appear to be fantastic.Analysts think Dexcom will be able to deliver average annual earnings growth of 140% over the next five years. Is that sizzling rate of growth really possible? I think so.The key is the continued rapid adoption of Dexcom's G6 CGM system. Thanks to tremendous sales growth for the G6, Dexcom . The company also boosted its full-year revenue outlook.Dexcom is on track to double its manufacturing capacity for its G6 devices this year. This increase was needed to enable the company to beef up its sales efforts outside of the U.S. But Dexcom also anticipates even more sales growth inside the U.S., especially as it launches the G6 system to Medicare patients.The company isn't resting on its laurels. Dexcom hopes to launch a new and improved CGM device called the G7 by early 2021 at the latest. The G7 will be smaller than the G6 and will be more cost-effective. This should help Dexcom compete better against Abbott's new Libre version.\u00a0Dexcom also thinks that the G7 could enable it to expand into adjacent markets. The company\u00a0especially likes opportunities for CGM in gestational diabetes monitoring and the intermittent monitoring of diabetes in hospital patients.If you like win-win decisions, the choice between Abbott and Dexcom will be right up your alley. I don't think investors would go wrong buying either stock.My view is that which stock to pick depends primarily on your investing style. If you're retired and are seeking income, Abbott is definitely the better stock to buy with its long track record of dividend increases. Even if you're younger, Abbott would be more suited for you if you're a relatively conservative investor. While Abbott would also be a solid stock for growth-oriented investors, Dexcom might be more attractive for aggressive growth investors.\u00a0Keep in mind that the risks associated with  are elevated right now as next year's national elections approach. The potential for major healthcare reform could take a toll even on solid healthcare stocks like Abbott and Dexcom. However, I think that the long-term prospects for both stocks are very good.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

A 10-year-old boy with diabetes is able to live a normal life with an insulin pump implanted in his body. A physician uses a robotic surgical system to obtain a tissue sample from a middle-aged coach's lungs to determine if he has cancer. All of these are examples of how medical devices are improving the quality of life and even saving lives for people around the world.While medical devices are helping patients, they're also helping some investors. Medical device stocks overall have delivered more than twice the gains generated by the S&P 500 index over the last 10 years. Investors hoping to profit from the continued boom in medical device stocks have lots of alternatives. But what are the top medical device stocks to buy now? Here's what you need to know.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images.When you think of medical devices, you might picture machines that beep in hospital rooms. While those machines certainly are medical devices, there are many other kinds of medical devices as well.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is a federal agency responsible for protecting the American public by overseeing the safety of food, drugs, cosmetics, and medical devices.\u00a0 a medical device broadly, stating that a medical device is any \"instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article...intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals.\" In addition, a medical device can be intended to \"affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals.\"The bottom line is that medical devices can include a wide range of things, from surgical staples to artificial heart valves. As a result of the FDA's broad definition, the medical device industry is huge, with at least 32,000 medical device companies based in the U.S. and Europe alone.Some of these medical device companies are large, with annual sales in the tens of billions of dollars. However, most medical device makers are small. Many of them aren't profitable. The stocks of unprofitable companies are generally riskier for investors because a business can't survive indefinitely without making money.Regardless of their size, medical device companies operate in a highly regulated industry. In the U.S., the FDA oversees which medical devices are allowed to be marketed. The FDA requires all medical devices to at minimum be registered with it. Medical devices that present a moderate risk to patients must undergo\u00a0a more detailed review. Devices that pose a high risk to patients must first be tested in clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. The FDA determines the risk level based on the potential negative consequences to patients' health of the given medical device.Medical devices have existed for thousands of years. Archaeologists have even found evidence that prehistoric dentists used drills made from flint heads. Today, medical devices account for as much as 6% of total U.S. spending on healthcare.\u00a0Market researcher EvaluateMedTech projects that the global medical device market will increase in size from $405 billion in 2017 to nearly $595 billion by 2024.As mentioned earlier, medical device stocks, in general, have more than doubled the return of the S&P 500 over the last 10 years. They have also outperformed stocks in the broader healthcare industry by close to 90% during the same period.There are three primary characteristics that differentiate top medical device stocks from others in the industry.\u00a0Top medical device stocks:Many companies focus on relatively simple medical devices. However, these types of products tend to be more commoditized -- meaning they are largely interchangeable with devices made by another company. As a result of this commoditization, lower-tech medical devices primarily compete on price and don't provide high  (the amount of money left over after paying all the costs of running the business) to the manufacturers. On the other hand, companies that focus on medical devices that use advanced technology typically have higher profit margins.Top medical device stocks also have a significant opportunity for growth. In some cases, companies offer new products that can capture market share away from established products. Other medical device makers introduce new products that meet an unmet need. There are also other companies with medical devices that have been on the market for a while but have opportunities to expand into additional geographic markets, expand the conditions for which the devices are approved, and/or increase revenue by obtaining higher reimbursement from payers.Just having a significant opportunity for growth isn't enough, though. A company must enjoy one or more key competitive advantages, or moats, that enable it to capitalize on its growth opportunity. These competitive advantages can include offering products that are more cost effective than others or that offer more benefits than other products. Some medical device makers also claim competitive advantages from their status in the industry and their large customer bases.Each of the top medical device stocks to buy now focuses on medical devices leveraging advanced technology, having significant growth opportunities, and enjoying key competitive advantages over rivals. The top five medical device stocks to buy now are:Data source: Yahoo! Finance, company regulatory filings. Market caps as of July 22, 2019.Abiomed makes heart pumps for heart failure patients to temporarily assist the pumping function of the heart, allowing the heart to heal and recover from heart surgery. The company's Impella family of heart pumps includes several products, the first of which won FDA approval in 2015.Abiomed's heart pumps incorporate advanced technology. Each type of Impella heart pump includes integrated motors and sensors. As an example of the complexity involved in these heart pumps, the company's Impella 2.5 heart pump\u00a0is inserted through the femoral artery in the thigh to reach the left ventricle of the heart. It then draws blood out of the ventricle and delivers it to the circulatory system.Abiomed estimates its addressable market in the U.S. alone is around $6 billion annually. The company has only penetrated 11% of this market, but it expects to capture 100% of the market over time. Outside of the U.S., Abiomed claims 17% penetration in the German market and 1% in the Japanese market.\u00a0The company is , including\u00a0myocarditis, peripartum cardiomyopathy, postpartum\u00a0cardiomyopathy, and spontaneous coronary artery dissection.The company's Impella heart pumps have been used to treat more than 100,000 patients across the world. Other companies are developing heart-assist devices but haven't progressed enough to secure regulatory approval yet.\u00a0Abiomed's head start in the heart recovery market gives it a strong competitive advantage.Align Technology is best known for its Invisalign clear orthodontic aligners used to straighten teeth. The company also markets the iTero line of intraoral scanners. While clear aligners made from plastic might not seem like very advanced technology, the process Align uses to make the aligners is certainly\u00a0advanced.Dental professionals use the company's intraoral scanners to create a 3D model of a patient's teeth. This 3D model is sent electronically to Align, where its technicians create a treatment plan for multiple iterations of Invisalign aligners.\u00a0 The treatment plan is sent back electronically to the dentist or orthodontist for review. Once the treatment plan is reviewed, Align's manufacturing facility uses the plan to make custom clear aligners for the patient.Align claims 16% of the 8 million orthodontic cases per year for which Invisalign is applicable. The company's market share of the large teen market is only 6.7%. As Align aggressively markets Invisalign, it should be able to significantly increase its share of the market. The company should also be able to expand its addressable market by introducing new versions of Invisalign that can treat more difficult cases of misaligned teeth. to challenge Align Technology, which for years had the clear aligner market all to itself. However, the company's network of dental professionals gives it a competitive advantage over rivals seeking to sell direct to consumers. The company's first-mover advantage and marketing efforts also have made more patients aware of the Invisalign brand than of other clear aligner brands.DexCom specializes in developing and marketing continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, which continually monitor glucose levels in patients with diabetes. DexCom's lead product is the G6 CGM. The G6 sensor is implanted under a patient's skin, often on the back of the arm. A transmitter connects to the sensor and sends real-time data on insulin levels to a receiver or smartphone. This information can also be shared with other people, for example with doctors or with parents of children using the device. The G6 CGM sensor can be worn up to 10 days before being replaced.Unlike most glucose monitoring systems, DexCom's G6 doesn't require fingersticks. The system can alert individuals when glucose levels are too low or too high as well as send alerts to others (a nice feature for letting parents know when their diabetic child's glucose levels are out of whack). The G6 can also integrate with other devices, including insulin pumps, smart insulin pens, and insulin patch pumps. And it can improve the health of patients by continually monitoring glucose levels rather than requiring patients to remember to check their levels.Fewer than 25% of intensive insulin users in the U.S. use CGM systems. DexCom has captured less than 20% of the total addressable market.\u00a0\u00a0This core market gives DexCom significant growth potential. The company is also looking to expand its market by exploring ways to use CGM in diabetes screening and intermittent monitoring (scheduled monitoring at specified intervals as opposed to continuous monitoring)\u00a0for pregnant women, hospital patients, and patients with type 2 diabetes who aren't intensive insulin users, as well as diabetes screening for prediabetes patients. DexCom also has opportunities to expand more internationally. The company currently makes a little over 20% of its total revenue in international markets, but there are roughly 13 times more individuals with diabetes in other countries than there are in the U.S.The extensive functionality and convenience of the G6 give it advantages over competitors. DexCom executives  that the new G7 CGM system should launch in late 2020 or early 2021. The G7 should build on DexCom's competitive advantages through its smaller size, extended sensor wear, and lower cost.Intuitive Surgical pioneered the use of robotic surgical systems with its 1999 launch of the da Vinci system. More than 6 million surgical procedures have been performed using da Vinci since then, with more than 5,100 systems implemented across the world.To use the da Vinci, a surgeon sits at a console a few feet away from the patient. The surgeon can view a 3D high-definition image of the region on the patient where surgery is to be performed. Intuitive's system enables the surgeon to manipulate surgical instruments on da Vinci's robotic arm, eliminating the potential impact of\u00a0tremors that can occur in the surgeon's hands. The robotic surgical system is used in multiple types of procedures, especially hysterectomies and prostatectomies.Intuitive Surgical should be able to grow in three ways. First,  are increasing demand for the types of surgical procedures for which da Vinci is most used. Second, the company continues to expand the types of surgical procedures that its technology supports. (For example, Intuitive launched its ION robotic system for lung biopsy in 2019.) Third, Intuitive plans to increase its international presence. More than 60% of its da Vinci systems are installed in the U.S., but there are many more surgical patients in the rest of the world.The company's biggest competitive advantage is its big head start in the robotic surgery market. Intuitive's existing customers who purchased its systems have a financial incentive to maximize their return on investment. The company's  such as operating leases and usage-based agreements don't have to worry about buying new systems (their deals allow them to upgrade to newer models), which reduces the chance that they'll switch to a rival. In addition, Intuitive's long track record gives existing and new customers a solid reason to choose its systems. Also, as doctors become familiar with the system, they're likely to want to continue using da Vinci on more procedures rather than switch to another system.ShockWave Medical focuses on unclogging arteries by developing intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) technology for the treatment of calcified plaque in patients with peripheral vascular, coronary vascular, and heart valve disease. Its first IVL systems were approved in 2018 by U.S. and European regulators.Lithotripsy has been used for more than 30 years in breaking up kidney stones. ShockWave's systems integrate lithotripsy into a device that resembles a balloon catheter. Physicians can guide the catheter through artery walls and send shock waves into the arteries to break up calcium deposits, clearing the blood flow through the artery.ShockWave Medical thinks that its total addressable market is more than $6 billion per year. This market includes using IVL in procedures for clearing calcium in coronary arteries, aortic valves, common femoral arteries, and iliac arteries.The company's main competitive advantage is that it is the pioneer of IVL technology and holds patents on this technology. IVL offers several benefits over traditional methods of unclogging arteries. The approach is safer, enabling physicians to treat even complicated cases with very few complications. It's simple: Physicians don't have much of a learning curve.\u00a0IVL is also highly effective, cracking both superficial and deep calcium.Although each of these medical device stocks has competitive advantages, the possibility that rivals could take away their market share is always a key risk. Most of the five top medical device stocks already face competition. And the medical device industry changes quickly. A competitor could launch new medical devices that are more cost effective or that offer more attractive capabilities.Align Technology faces more direct competition than it has in the past. Intuitive Surgical once enjoyed a monopoly in the robotic surgical systems market but now has a handful of competitors. DexCom directly competes in the CGM market with one of the . Both Abiomed and ShockWave could face increased competition in the future.All five companies also face regulatory risks. New medical devices might not win the necessary regulatory approvals. A delay in securing FDA approval for a new medical device could seriously impact a company's growth prospects. Even after a device is approved, the FDA could identify potential safety issues that cause problems for the companies. And because medical devices have a lower bar for entering the market than prescription drugs do, the potential for issues being identified after launching the device is higher. This can lead to product recalls in which the medical device makers must ask patients to return the devices.Abiomed experienced this kind of issue in February 2019 after the FDA issued a letter to healthcare providers about the Impella RP heart pump. The letter \u00a0as indicating that the heart pump was being recalled or had safety issues that were being reviewed by the FDA.Each of these companies is at risk of product liability litigation. Patients could allege that a medical device caused physical problems or was defective.\u00a0Such litigation can be costly to medical device makers and potentially cause negative publicity that makes it harder to attract new customers.The companies could also come under attack from rivals that want to have their key patents revoked. For example, ShockWave Medical's key IVL patents have been challenged by a competitor, Cardiovascular Systems. The company  but this illustrates a real threat for any of these medical device makers.Like stocks in most industries, these medical device stocks could also be dragged down by macroeconomic issues such as a recession. It should be noted, though, that medical device stocks tend to be more recession proof than many other stocks, because individuals need healthcare even in bad economic times.\u00a0The stocks of companies that hope to grow in international markets could be hurt by the possibility of increased trade tensions. In addition, the  could cause these stocks to fall as investors worry about limitations to the companies' ability to price their medical devices.DexCom and ShockWave Medical also face one risk that the others don't: The potential need to raise cash. Unlike Abiomed, Align Technology, and Intuitive Surgical, DexCom and ShockWave aren't profitable yet. It's possible that they could need to raise additional capital by either taking on debt or issuing new shares. Higher debt levels increase interest expenses and reduce the amount of money available to invest in expansion. Issuing new shares causes  -- the value of existing shares decreases because more shares become available for trading.These risks show there's no guarantee of success for any of these five top medical device stocks. However, the overall prospects for the stocks still appear to be quite good. Abiomed, Align Technology, DexCom, Intuitive Surgical, and ShockWave Medical should provide plenty of excitement for growth-seeking long-term investors.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

We are pleased to report another outstanding quarter for DexCom with awareness of DexCom CGM continuing to rise within the diabetes community and beyond. Second-quarter revenue grew to $336 million, a 40% increase over the second quarter of 2018 on a constant currency basis, continuing the momentum that we're seeing for the past five quarters. As we have observed in previous quarters, the primary driver of our growth in all channels including our U.S.commercial business, Medicare and other OUS businesses remains volume growth attributable to new patients. In fact, new patient additions once again reached a record level in the second quarter. And as our results indicate, the volume growth that we are experiencing is more than offsetting the pricing pressure that we anticipated with lower revenue for patient associated with our move to the pharmacy channel, as well as the continued expansion of our Medicare and OUS businesses. While attending the American Diabetes Association Conference in San Francisco in early June, two conclusions became increasingly clear to me.First, awareness of real-time CGM is quickly progressing and driving CGM toward standard of care status. We've been on record for years stating that the future is CGM First, and we believe that future is here. At ADA, CGM was no longer a minor presence relative to the various drug therapies. Instead, DexCom CGM featured prominently in standing room only product presentations, academic papers and as the driver of automated insulin delivery devices, all of which reflect the growing market awareness that we are seeing.Timing range is quickly becoming the most important metric to assess glucose control with new timing range guidelines being established this year. Only CGM can provide these types of metrics, it is very clear to us that CGM as a diagnostic tool will become another large market for us in the future. This is well-planned with the recent submission of our G6 pro product, which we expect to launch in 2020. With significant room for further adoption in both the Type 1 and intensive Type 2 populations, we are ever more confident in the growth opportunity that lies ahead for these core business segments.Second, we are just scratching the surface of the potential for DexCom CGM. Discussions around CGM and ADA were not limited to traditional intensive insulin-using populations, was extended to preliminary studies on use in pregnancy and inpatient settings. And as we stated on our last call, we are exploring applications of our technology into these settings as we position DexCom to maximize its long-term growth opportunity. To support these significant opportunities, our team's operational performance remains critically important.At the start of the year, we established the ambitious goal of doubling our G6 production capacity, and I'm pleased to report that we are on track to achieve that goal. We are excited about the fact that we have initiated production of our low-cost transmitter in our San Diego and Mesa locations. We are now building inventory as we prepare for launch. Based on the hard work of our operations teams in both San Diego and Mesa, we continue to strengthen our G6 capacity.This positions us well to expand the launch of G6 in the second half of this year. We look forward to bringing G6 to Canada later this year and driving the ongoing transition to G6 in additional OUS markets. We remain committed to G6 launch for our Medicare patients later this year and believe that this should drive incremental demand in patient satisfaction in an already strong category. Also on the Medicare front as a number of you have seen, CMS recently differentiated reimbursement between Class 2 and Class 3 CGMs.And while the rate for the G6 system will be less than Class 3 CGM, please keep in mind that we will ship fewer centers and no BGM supplies with the future G6 bundle. Based on our better-than-expected second-quarter performance, we are pleased again to be able to increase our revenue outlook for 2019, as well as our full-year operating margin and adjusted EBITDA targets. I will now turn the call over to Quentin, who will provide detail on this outlook, as well as review of our financials. -- Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics presented today will be discussed on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release, as well as on our IR website. Today, we reported worldwide revenue of $336.4 million for the second quarter of 2019, compared to $242.5 million for the same quarter in 2018, representing growth of 39% on a reported basis.Our momentum continues to be strong with this being the third consecutive quarter that we have added more than $90 million in absolute dollar growth on a year-over-year basis. And as Kevin stated, another quarterly record of new patient addition for the company. On a geographic basis, our revenue growth continued to be strong in both our U.S. and OUS businesses, which grew at 40% and 37%, respectively on a constant currency basis in the second quarter.I'd like to remind you that our growth comps in both our U.S. and OUS businesses were meaningfully more difficult in the second quarter than the first quarter and will continue through the remainder of the year. Our second-quarter gross profit was $206.5 million or 61.4% of revenue, representing a 120 basis point sequential improvement over the first quarter of 2019, while increasing our G6 capacity and was in line with our expectations. On a year-over-year basis, gross margin was negatively impacted by our ongoing investments to drive capacity expansion, as well as the increasing mix in both our OUS and pharmacy channels.Our full-year gross margin expectations remain unchanged. As we invest in the long term, our team has done an excellent job of introducing automation and innovation into the sensor manufacturing process, and therefore, decreasing the cost profile of our systems. We are confident that we can continue to do this both within the G6 platform and as we progress toward the launch of G7, providing the company with flexibility, as we evaluate future growth opportunities. Operating expenses were $200.3 million for Q2 2019, compared to $155.8 million in Q2 2018.This reflects an increase of 29% year over year. As a result of our continued outperformance on the top line, we realized an uptick in our variable operating expenses for the quarter. In addition, the second quarter included two sources of higher-than-expected expense that we expect to normalize in the near term. First, we made a number of investments in the quarter toward the development of G7 as we continue to prepare for launch.We made good progress in the quarter, which triggered a small incentive charge of $3.2 million to barely for accelerating development work. Even as we continued the worldwide rollout of our G6 system, we are beginning to invest aggressively in the product, in manufacturing innovation, which will ensure rapid introduction of our G7 product when launched. Second, we incurred duplicative costs within our customer service organization as we ramped our operations in Manila. We've been willing to incur these costs to this transition and believe we've built a world-class team in our DexCom Manila location.However, we recognize that our third-party service capabilities have not met our expectations and are working to bring them up to the same level. Normalizing for these individual items, operating expense growth would've been approximately half the rate of revenue. Overall, we are on track to demonstrate good operating leverage this year and anticipate continued improvement in operating margins in the second half of the year. Operating income was $6.2 million in the second quarter of 2019, compared to an operating loss of $2.2 million in the same quarter of 2018.Even with the second-quarter expenses that I just highlighted, we achieved nearly 300 basis points of year-over-year operating margin expansion in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $45.9 million or 13.6% of revenue for the second quarter, compared to $24.5 million or 10.1% of revenue for the second quarter of 2018. We remain well-positioned to achieve our long-term margin targets that we established at our investor day in late 2018, while generating cash to invest in the next wave of innovation that will extend our growth trajectory. This includes our investment in the G7 platform, as well as our exploration of the value of the CGM in new markets.Our net income was $7.8 million or $0.08 per share. We ended the second quarter in strong cash position with nearly $1.4 billion on our balance sheet providing the company with significant financial and strategic flexibility. For now, as evidenced by the $47 million of capital expenditures in the second quarter, our priority remains expansion of our production capacity. And as Kevin stated in his remarks, we are tracking toward our target of doubling G6 capacity this year while beginning to invest for G7 production.Given the strength of our first-half performance and the continued demand that we're seeing for DexCom real-time CGM, we now anticipate 2019 total revenue of approximately $1.325 billion to $1.375 billion, reflecting reported growth of 28% to 33% for the year, up from our prior outlook of 21 to 26%. As I mentioned previously, our full-year gross margin expectations stand at 64 to 65% and approaching 70% as we exit the year, driven primarily by the broad introduction of our lower-cost G6 transmitter in the back half of the year. In light of our better-than-expected revenue growth, we now expect operating margins of approximately 7% and adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 18.5%, reflecting an increase of 100 basis points and 50 basis points, respectively, from prior guidance. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Steve for strategic update. -- Thank you, Quentin. We had another great quarter in the books. We are excited about the growing acceptance of CGM around the world as a first-line technology for people with diabetes on intensive insulin therapy. Despite a number of rapidly changing market dynamics, DexCom is capitalizing on massive growth opportunity, and we are confident that the business is well-positioned to succeed over the long term.One of the core strategic objectives in early 2019 was to expand access to DexCom CGM. Within the U.S. market, our teams have been focused on two primary areas. First, as we have discussed in detail, we are making a strong push to ensure that patients have access to DexCom CGM through the pharmacy channel.Although this has not been a primary driver for our volume growth in the first half of the year, we are confident that it is the most efficient channel for patients, clinicians and for DexCom over the long term. The second area where we have thought to expand access is in the intensive insulin Type 2 population with an estimated more than 1.5 million people with Type 2 diabetes using real-time insulin. This population effectively doubled the addressable market of our core business in the U.S. Most importantly, CMS recognized when they first approved our CGM for the Medicare population.This is a group of patients that clearly stands to benefit from our technology for better glucose management and safer insulin dosing. Our proactive effort to drive these two initiatives will be crucial in driving CGM to the standard of care over the long term and has also been the primary factor behind the pricing headwinds that we've detailed throughout the year. While it will take time to realize the full benefit of these strategic priorities, we are pleased to report that we are gaining steady traction in both of these efforts. Our insulin delivery partners are progressing well toward the commercialization of integrated products.On the product side, both Tandem Diabetes and Insulet presented encouraging results at ADA related to their respective automated insulin delivery systems. We believe that these solutions will not only gain share among pump users, but will attract those interested in pump therapy. At ADA, we also announced our intent to integrate the DexCom G6 into Type 2. This represents yet another example of DexCom support of patient choice and interoperability in the diabetes ecosystem as we leverage our ICGM designation.We remain excited about our partnerships with Novo Nordisk on the smart pen side and with Eli Lilly on the development of both the smart pen and connected pump. As a reminder, the majority of people with diabetes on intensive insulin therapy around the world continue to choose insulin pens as their preferred means of insulin delivery, which highlights the importance of our smart pen relationships. In early June, we also announced a collaboration with smart pen maker, Companion Medical, which allows us to integrate insulin data from Companion's pen users into DexCom's Clarity software. We are committed to helping people, manage their diabetes by bringing together the two critical components of treatment decisions, glucose levels and insulin dosing to give patients and clinicians a comprehensive picture for their diabetes management.We intend to continue delivering additional sources of insulin data into the DexCom ecosystem over time. As Quentin mentioned, even as we roll out G6 to additional markets, the development of our G7 platform remains the key strategic objective for the company with a significantly reduced form factor, our market defining accuracy and a one-piece disposable wearable, we are confident that G7 will be highly desirable to our existing and prospective patients, as well as a product that accelerates our entrance into new markets outside of our core intensive insulin business. On this front, we are pleased to reaffirm our time lines for a limited launch in late 2020 and a broader launch in 2021. With that, I'll pass it back to Kevin. -- Thank you, Steve. Any time you exit the first half of the year having reached full-year revenue guidance by $150 million or more than 10%, you know that the year must be going well and it has truly been a great first half of 2019 for DexCom. To grow at our current scale, there are a lot of things you have to come together, and this is a great testament to the team that we have here at DexCom to those in the field, in the clean rooms, and those thinking years down the road asking what's next. Thank you for your commitment to DexCom and to the people we serve.There is still a huge growth opportunity for DexCom's core business in diabetes and beyond. The technology that we worked so hard to develop positions us well to go after any significant market opportunity that we choose. In summary, it's been a great first half of 2019, but we're just getting started and we will not rest. I would now like to open up the call for Q&A.Sean? -- As a reminder, we ask the audience to limit themselves to only one question and one follow-up. Operator, please provide the complete Q&A instructions.[Operator instructions] And the first question comes from Robbie Marcus with JP Morgan. Your line is open. -- Great. And congratulations on an another really nice quarter here. Maybe I could start, and I don't want to get greedy here and this is for Quentin. But after the big beats and raises you put up in the first half of the year with north of 45% growth in the first half of the year, guidance implies 17 to 25% growth in the back part of the year.I know there's a lot of moving parts here in terms of pricing as you switch from DME to pharmacy, Medicare international, but maybe as a catchall question here, Quentin, help us understand some of the moving pieces here and the impact that each of them have on guidance for the back part of the year? -- Sure, Robbie. You point out the decelerating growth in the back half of the year, which is accurate. I think probably the most important thing just to draw everybody's attention to is the fact that comps get meaningfully more difficult in the back half of the year to the tune of roughly 15 to 20% percentage points of headwinds in the third and fourth quarter, respectively. So if you think back to the launch of G6 last year, you saw a growth in the back half of the year starting to get up into the mid-40s, even north of 50% in the fourth quarter.We are now anniversary-ing that and it creates a meaningful comp headwind. So I think you start to normalize for that and you get growth rates back into the ranges that you've seen in the first half of the year. So you have to be mindful of that aspect. And then, certainly, from a price perspective, we continue to anticipate double -- see those headwinds throughout the course of the back half of the year even probably accelerating just a bit in the fourth quarter when you start to contemplate some of the incremental moves that CMS has made with the Medicare business that will create a little bit of an incremental headwind from a pricing perspective.Although from a margin perspective, we feel pretty good that over time it's actually going to be beneficial to us as we no longer have to provide all the BGM supply. So we feel good about where that goes longer term, but it's going to create a bit of headwind. So I think those are the big moving pieces, but the biggest one being that the tougher comps. -- Okay. Great. And then follow-up question. Everybody's focus is ahead all the way to G7 as we sit here today.Can you lay out just the time lines of what we should expect? I know it's an ICGM filing that's going to be different than what we have historically seen for your different iterations. But give us sort of the time lines of what we'll see, when we'll see it, whether it's data presentations or manufacturing, ramping up and product out there? Now help us understand the time lines from here on now. -- Yes, Robbie, this is Kevin. I'll take that one. We continue a lot on the development side on G7. We're making some very big decisions over the next couple of months before we lock in design and go.As far as clinical trial presentations in all Canada, we probably will not have much till the product is approved and the pivotal has been submitted to the FDA because we really don't want to play our hand. We are running small trials all over the place right now, looking at configurations and things we can consider putting in that product. But none of those are really contemplated for publication. [indiscernible] since our ICGM standards is we know what the outcome has to look like.Therefore, we're going to run a trial that will meet those outcome points and no one should be overly surprised or confident that the G7 platform will perform very well. We have some really wonderful things going into it and technology that we've been developing for years. As far as the launch, as Steve said in his remarks, it'll be a limited launch in late 2020. We will not have the capacity to roll it out to everyone in the fourth quarter and we are not going to try, and we do not want to -- we've learned enough about capacity this year.We are not going to relearn those lessons in even bigger way. We will then -- once we get approved, roll this thing out as we get our manufacturing plant up and fully ready to go to whereby we can support significant volumes. And other lesson we've learned on G6 from G5 is the conversions with new technology can actually be very fast. We probably underestimated the rate at which our patients will convert from G5 to G6 just given what we know about our patient behavior.We are not going to underestimate this conversion is going to go fast and it is going to be a wonderful product. So 2021, we really want the capacity to be able to swap everybody out. We will continue to support G6 in specific markets and with integrated products and such, the G7 becomes our flagship product by the end of 2021 with G6 supporting entirely different roles. -- Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.And the next question comes from JP McKim from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. -- Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I'd like to just touch on the pharmacy, if you could just give us an update on where you are in terms of coverage and maybe volume going that way, and if you could touch a little bit on the Walgreens announcement? It was in the PowerPoint, but you didn't talk about it in your prepared remarks. So maybe talk about that partnership and what that could do for you guys going forward? -- I'll speak to the pharmacy question, and Kevin will give you an update on the Walgreen. We continue to make good progress on the pharmacy front in terms of adding vibes that are able to access the products through pharmacy coverage. So we continue to move down that path. I think, importantly, the new patients that continue to come into the company continue to come in through the pharmacy channel.We see good progress being made there. Obviously, we've got an existing business that we've put in place over the years. I've trained folks how to navigate through the DME channel and they're still accustomed to that. So that shift out of DME in the pharmacy on the existing base has gone a bit more slowly than what we see coming in with the new patients.So we fully anticipate that the business model over time will be through the pharmacy channel. We continue to push the organization down that pathway. We're making good progress, but there's still a lot of runway ahead of us, there's still a lot of room to go. So we'll continue to focus on it.You'll hear we talk about it for quite some time, I'm sure. -- And with respect to Walgreens and that announcement, Walgreens has been a good partner of ours for quite a while. In fact, as we started pharmacy coverage for patients, one of our best distribution outlets in the early days was the Walgreens specialty pharmacies where our patients were -- could very easily get access to the technology via pharmacy benefit. Going forward, with all the data we gather from our patients and all the data we gather from our patients and other devices and other centers and such going forward. With Walgreens, they've and we view this as opportunity to be a very strong data partner for general healthcare.While we have certainly [indiscernible] ambitions and we need to partner in relationship. We think it'll be a great place for patients to get their product over time. And we're looking forward to working much closer together. So this is the beginning.And if you take a look at their website and how they've talked about this, it's pretty front and center, so we're very happy. -- That's helpful. And Quentin, if he could just address like the delta and the growth rate between the segments, on transmitter, receivers, -- especially on the receiver side was down 4%. So I assume it has to do with international and the move into the pharmacy, but if you could just maybe give people some expectations around why the growth rate should be so different across the various products? -- It's a great question, and to your point, the receiver is actually down from a dollar perspective in the reported figures. I can tell you from a unit basis, they were up significantly. And as Kevin pointed out in his prepared remarks, our new patient numbers were at record levels, an all-time record for us, again, in the second quarter. So volumes continue to trend very well.What you're seeing play out there is really a dynamic in how we think about strategically pricing the product for the future, both as we move into the pharmacy, but as well as we start to think about new product iterations like G7 over time, that start to remove the transmitter or the receiver component altogether. And so, where the values of getting placed is a bit different from a category perspective, but it's not reflective of the underlying volume growth in the business. So I think that's what are you seeing play out there. It's certainly something that we have made very distinct decisions around in terms of how we set up these pricing strategies.And you're now seeing it start to play through in the categories from a dollar perspective, but nothing that would indicate any underlying concerns or anybody needs to pay attention to. Volume growth is incredibly strong, new patient growth is strong as it has ever been. -- Thank you.And the next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird. Your line is open. -- Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Can you hear me OK? -- Yeah. -- All right. Maybe I'll follow up on that question there and trying to move away from looking at centers versus transmitters versus receiver revenue. Conceptually, we thought of you guys kind of generate maybe $3,000 per year per patient in kind of ex-receiver revenue anyway. With G7 launching late next year into 2021 and going for maybe 10 to 14 or more likely, I think, 15 days, what do you think that $3,000 per year per patient revenue? How does that -- what are the puts and takes on where that could go? -- Yes, Jeff, we're not going to get into the specifics of that price point. I think importantly, as we sit down with payers and negotiate positions, we tend to look at this from an average value per patient on an annual basis and so to the degree that we are going to give that information, we've put the playbook out there in front of everybody to see, particularly the payers, and you can imagine that since this is out there, you're going straight there. I think the important thing to note is that we understand the configuration of G7 when it comes into the marketplace. It's very different than the G6 product.We are having discussions with payers today around how we structure these contracts, so the G7 can come in very seamlessly and we move right into it. And so, the revenue does start to change across each of the buckets. And it does start to come down on an annual basis on a per user perspective. So as we move further into the pharmacy, we know it has to come down over time.And I would just point you back to our long-term goals. When we put out the 2 to $2.5 million of revenue, we absolutely anticipated that the revenue per patient has to come down over time, and we are playing right along the path where what we anticipated that might look like. We're executing nicely on that front and feel very good about the progress being made. -- All right. Fair enough. And then on your fourth-quarter comments around Medicare and with that Class 2 bundle down, I think, 13 or 14% or something like that, you size that as one of the impacts why 4Q maybe modestly impacted or the guidance implies maybe a little bit slower growth then. How do we think about that into 2020, understanding you're not giving 2020 guidance, but is that around in there as we start thinking about 2020? Is that something we need to put a finer point on in our models thinking about next year's revenue growth, just that change in the Medicare dollars? -- I think we need to be mindful of it. It is going to be a headwind for us as we now will have a full year of the impact relative to just one quarter of 2019. So it's certainly something that we'll speak more about as we get closer to the end of the year and start talking about 2020. But you're going to want to be mindful of it.I think importantly the ability to eliminate the BGM supply from the bundle or no longer having to provide that actually puts us in a position where it becomes margin accretive relative to the current position that we're in with Medicare channel. So overall, we view it as an opportunity from a margin perspective to show some improvement. It's not going to move the needle in a significant way, but it does become the headwind then. -- Fair enough. Thank you.And our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is open. -- Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. And maybe one for me switching over to the OUS dynamic a little bit. If you could walk us through the near- and long-term outlook and really what are the two or three scenarios for you guys in a bear and bull case? Where and when will market penetration be outside the U.S.above 20%, above 50% penetration? -- Yes. I mean, look, I think for us Europe is lagging a little behind our penetrations in the U.S., but there is no reason that -- particularly in the reimbursed markets in Western Europe that over time, Western Europe should look a whole lot like our U.S business, as frankly should Japan and Canada and Australia and the other developed markets. We're not going to give obviously specifics on when and how quickly we think we can get to those levels of penetration. But it's coming.The European business, one comment I would make on the European business in revenues, particularly in the second quarter, is that our -- we've said this time and again on our calls that the European business because it's still predominantly through third-party distribution, tends to be a little more choppy. We don't have the same seasonality from DME deductibles that reset in the first quarter, and in the European distribution network, the order patterns just tend to be a little choppier. So the European business is still humming along. It's a big price buck for us, and we expect it to continue to be great from a growth perspective. -- Yes. And then Quentin, just wanted to follow up a little bit on some of the outsourced support organization and some of the commentary you guys had on that. Walk us through what you guys maybe have missed? What you guys are doing to fix it? And over kind of what time horizon should we still assume that we can contract toward the operating margin goal long term? -- Yes. I don't think you should have or walk away from the call with any incremental concern being added to an operating margin goal. We are tracking incredibly well from that perspective, and we feel great about the decision that we made there and it's going to be a really nice leverage point for us over time. I think the difference is when we stood up that Philippines operation, we started with really two paths.There was a direct DexCom employee base that has performed incredibly well and then there's a third-party outsourced component that we've utilized as well. And I think what we've learned is the standard that we hold ourselves to honestly is just not the same standard that other parties probably hold themselves to. And so, the question or the issue that we're starting to remedy is to get into those situations, elevate the standard that we expect and hold them accountable to deliver that for us and to us. I think it's going to be a few months here as we work through it.It's front and center, it is a priority for the team. We've got our resources all over it. The reality is we can do better. And I think that's what we're trying say here, is we understand the challenge.The experience can get better for our patients, we know that, and we're after it. And so, we're committed to investing and improving in that. I don't -- you shouldn't look at that as a significant investment beyond the current spend rate that you see us executing until now. -- Great, thanks.And the next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO. Your line is open. -- Thank you for taking the question. I just want to get my head around the move to the pharmacy channel a little bit more. It sounds like last quarter, you were able to announce a share that the Cigna had granted pharmacy benefit. Are there any other larger insurers that we -- you can give us an update on? Or another way to look at it, a percent coverage moment? -- Yes, I'll take that. We haven't had any large contracts that we disclosed that have come to fruition this quarter, but we continue to roll along really well. One of the things we're struggling with, in all honesty, is having to find how much -- how many covered lines we have because we -- as we look at all the payers we have or our competitor may have, we're way about the same, but we don't really want to disclose that same percentage. We know we are well over 50%.We're always getting where we want to be. The more important factor, Margaret -- I mean, not Margaret, Joanne, I'm sorry, in this situation is we got to give patients move to the coverage that we have. And we continue to flow the new patients through there, that would be helpful. And as we continue to -- we'll just continue to have programs and you'll see a lot of effort there in the future.Our strategy has been working very well as we go before payers, and I've gone before a couple of them. Our presentation has been very strong, and we've been able to get the reimbursement that we're wanting and very frequently get to the pharmacy channel. So we -- but we've just have to keep knocking them out. -- Just as a follow-up. If I calculate this correctly on a dollar basis, your international revenue was flat sequentially. Am I looking at that right? And is there something going on there I should know about? -- Yes. You're looking at it correctly. I don't think there's anything there that you need to particularly be concerned about. I think from a sequential perspective, your point is accurate.To Steve's point earlier, this is a lumpy business. Nearly half of it is still close to the distributor channel, and I can tell you in a market or two, the matter of an order coming through in the first quarter or second quarter or falling into the third quarter, it can cross over from time to time. So we did have a little bit of that played out in the second quarter that would change the sequential trend. I think the important thing is when you look at new patient adoption, you look at existing patients' performance in these markets, it's consistent with what we've seen.There is no change in that trend. So I think you're seeing more of a timing issue when you look at it from a sequential perspective. In terms of the year over year, I think the other thing just to point out is you've got a meaningfully more difficult comp in the second quarter than what you had in the first quarter in this international business, nearly 30 points of incremental growth that showed up in Q2 of last year versus Q1, which again, I think, just kind of comes back and demonstrates the lumpiness in the international business. So nothing that we are concerned about playing out there.We still are incredibly bullish on the international business. The new patient opportunities continue to be strong and probably, most importantly, the overall adoption of our technology in the market is still quite liked, which leaves a lot of room to run. -- Thank you. Nice quarter.And our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy from SVB. Your line is open. -- Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on another really, really strong quarter. Quentin, I was hoping if you can give a little bit more color on the pricing headwind that you've seen so far year to date? I know you guys talked about 100 million for the year.How much that's been absorbed thus far? And how much incremental should we expect in the second half? And I have a follow-up. -- Yes. So I think if you go back to the first quarter, we commented then it was a bit less than the $20 million. Here in the second quarter, it's closer to the 25 million that we've had commented on, on a per quarter basis. I would tell you it was right in line with expectations.I think in the back half of the year, we expect that to accelerate a bit. I think importantly, there's a couple of dynamics playing out. Certainly, the move into the pharmacy is a big priority for us, and we've talked very clearly around our intent to allow price to come down a bit to open up that channel. You've got the Medicare revision in their rates.That will play a bit into -- a bit of a headwind there as well. And then I think importantly, we're also seeing willingness and opportunity with the payers to continue to even move into DME channel to create easier access to product and technology. And so, we're willing to give a bit of price in that scenario as well, knowing that over time, it's going to have to walk itself down. So in those negotiations generally what happens is you're negotiating for easier access to the technology, less paperwork, less requirements in terms of logging glucose levels.Those are the kind of things that if we can make that easier for the patient, we are willing to concede pricing a bit because we understand that volumes are likely to pick up, and we certainly have seen that play out. So we've got that base into the back half as well. That should give you some color on the incremental price in the back half versus first. -- OK, that's helpful. And then my follow-up is at a very high level, Kevin. I don't know if you want to take this one, but you talked about, it's not necessarily been the pharmacy efforts in driving the outperformance. And I'm just curious if you can talk about, like, what has been driving the outperformance, what level of visibility do you have? You've raised guidance $150 million, but you've only beat consensus year to date by $65 million.So you clearly have some level of visibility into that, I would expect. And it sounds like it's expanded access, could you quantify at all, like how much over the last 12 months access has actually expanded as the percentage of your addressable patient population has increased by a certain percent or something? -- You know what, I'll walk through that. And if Steve and Quentin have anything they want to add, they're welcome to. I think there's a couple of factors. I think awareness has become a huge factor in our marketplace.Many more people are aware of CGM and what it can do now than ever been before. As we do our own marketing research and ask about our brand awareness and CGM awareness, the responses are much, much better than we've ever seen. I would tell you also, the G6 is a big deal. Those patients have learned about G6 and learned the experience they can have and all that it does.This has been extremely helpful in our growth. There's other well things, Tandem having an approved pump that's integrated with our system. It's certainly been helpful in driving new patients at DexCom, the growth in the international markets. And it's interesting.Oftentimes, we would look at growth, and I look back in the old days. I look at Steve. You all had asked us, what about peds? Is peds driving growth? Or -- and then recently, is Medicare driving growth? Every segment is growing. Every single business line is growing and growing nicely.Commercial business, the Medicare business, you look at peds and adults, they're both growing. You look at Europe, it's very much across the board. It is really driven by CGM awareness and the fact that people really are figuring out that this is something they really need to control and manage their diabetes. I don't know you if you guys have anything you want to add on that. -- Thanks so much.And our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. -- Good afternoon. Just a couple for me. Maybe first quarter for Quentin. So Quentin, I think ADA was the first time you offered some qualitative specifics around what G7 COGS could be.I think, specifically, you said you think G7 COGS can get down to competitor levels at scale. I just want to be sure, there's a couple of things. What you think those levels are? How do you define scale from a revenue perspective? And what's diving your confidence now in kind of providing that kind of qualitative commentary? -- This is Kevin. I'll take that, David. When we started the G7 project back in 2015, one of the things we put on the table was cost target. That was very aggressive, and we didn't think we'd ever be able to meet.But we marched through that cost target going forward. We know when we roll the thing out the door. In the beginning, we're not getting to that target. But over time, as we look at the cost of the electronics, the battery, the manufacturing processes, we're implementing that are different than anything we've done before.Even the number of parts in the insertion system, everything has been designed not only to perform at our standard, but it's been designed to manufacture. It's been designed to manufacture at a lower cost in a more reliable way. So we're very confident we can get to lower COGS. Quite honestly, I said in the meeting yesterday, our G6 COGS, as we get to volumes next year and as we increase our manufacturing capacity and fill out our initial plan, are going to come out significantly as well.Our COGS are moving in the right direction. It's just taking more time. And as we've invested dollars to expand before the expansion, you think it's getting a little bit tough on the absorption side. But as we fill that plant and keep working hard in San Diego, we're very confident we'll get there.But G7 is just designed completely different than anything we've ever done. -- OK. Very helpful, Kevin. The second thing is just pharmacy coverage percentage. I think you said 50% last quarter.Can you just sort of update us what that number is today? I think one of your competitors shared that they were at 75% this quarter. So where are you guys today? And could you just -- can you give us any sense by year-end what percent of revenue you think will come through the pharmacy? And just a sense of scale on that number, what that number could be perhaps in a year from now? -- Yeah, this is Kevin. I'll go into a year from now because I think that's easier than today. We would be -- I can set a goal. We certainly would want to be in the 80% range as far as coverage a year from now.And that certainly is what we're shooting for. As far as where we are today, we know we're above 50%. We've gotten some more contracts. Having -- it's better than it was last quarter, but there's some -- we haven't a lot of these calculations.We've -- I've heard one number, 57%. I've heard others, above 60%. I don't have the perfect number for you, David, but we're comfortable where we. And like I said earlier in our comments, we've gone through each payer.We do this on a regular basis. What do we have, what do the rest of the market have? We don't see a lot of difference there. So maybe we compute our lives different over there. It doesn't matter.We're making the progress that we want to make. As far as the percentage of our business going through, I'll reiterate Quentin's comments. We've never disclosed that percentage, and we won't until it becomes very obvious. At the end of the day, our new patients are very much going over there.We have not launched a major effort to move the existing patients over there. And again, this relates to people being comfortable with how they process things in the past, having good insurance and coverage in DME. This is going to be a process that's going to take time, but we'll get there. -- Yeah. I mean, David. As we were talking in our preparations earlier today, Kevin pointed out, we spent 13 or 14 years, the last 13 or 14 years building a big DME business, and it's just not going to shift overnight. Our doctors, our field sales force, our patients are used to processing the existing business.So you'll see new patients shift to the pharmacy much quicker because we're, obviously, opening every new patient who comes in the door to see if we have pharmacy coverage, but transitioning the DME base over to pharmacy is going to take some time. -- Great. Thank you. Nice quarter.And your next question comes from Travis Steed from the Bank of America. Your line is open. -- Congrats on a great quarter again. So we've heard a lot about the capacity constraints, but both of you and from patients. So wanted to get a sense for how much the limiting factor capacity has actually been on adding new patients in the first half of the year and what you could see from a tailwind as you double capacity in the second half. -- I'll start. We don't think we've lost many new patients for capacity. The issue that we've had, literally, is timing of shipments and we've delayed things a bit. And at the end of the quarter, we really had filled pretty much everything.Patient-wise and direct patient-wise, that was on the books. The double capacity, the goals they have in place by the end of the year, we will not have double capacity running as we go through the rest of the year. That's a process that is ongoing, and we got some new processes. For example, we have our first fully automated G6 lines up and running here in San Diego, and we'll then replicate those lines over in Arizona over the next several months to get those things up and running.And the fully automated G6 processes really exciting leases for me to see. Over the course of the end of the year, again, you can see capacity is constrained just a bit. Still, we are delaying the Medicare launch till the fourth quarter. We have Canada coming online in the second half of the year, but it's not coming out immediately.And there are some other international geographies we want to be in with G6 as well when we last swap out the G5 patients, particularly those in our European markets and in our existing Medicare base. So we're still a bit constrained on all the things we would like to do. But we'll work through it, and we think by then end of the year, we'll be in a very good place. -- Great. And Quentin, gross margin in the first half of the year, low 60% range, and still committing to that, approaching 70% by Q4. Anything you can give us confidence on to -- really in the ramp in the back half in gross margin. How much of that is coming from the lower-cost transmitter versus other things? -- Yeah, sure. It's a great question. And the vast majority of our ability to get that 70% range in the fourth quarter is really tied to that lower-cost transmitter. So I think what you want to plan to see is Q3 will step probably somewhat in line with what you saw Q2 over Q1b.I think you'll see that same kind of sequential improvement. I think you'll see the nice improvement in the fourth quarter to 70%. In terms of trying to deliver a little bit of confidence or help you become more confident in that number, we've got our first low-cost units off the production lines as we speak. So we're producing them now in San Diego.They've come off the lines in Mesa. We have a high degree of confidence in being able to scale that up and ramp it. And so, our confidence level is quite high that we can get to these numbers.And our next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Your line is open. -- Hi. This is Ryan, on for Doug. You talked of making steady progress, expanding coverage for intensively managed Type 2 patients in the U.S. Is there anything more quantitive you can say? I believe Medicare represents about a third of this patient population.How much progress have you made within commercial payers, specifically? Do 50% of commercial labs have coverage, or anything close to 50%? -- It's a great question. I'm not -- I don't know that we have a specific answer for you. We continue to make progress, certainly as we push to move into pharmacy, pushing for greater access for intensively managed Type 2 is right at the top of the list. -- Yeah. And an example I can give you is in the past, as you go back a couple of years, one of the things we would give up to get better access for our Type 1 patients was Type 2 access sometimes in our contractual pricing discussions. That's not going on now. We are pushing aggressively to get the Type 2 insulin users covered.And quite honestly, having CMS issue that type of guidance has been very helpful for us. It's been a catalyst for us to go to payers and say, \"Look, if Medicare patients get this, so should the others.\" So we're making progress, but we're not there yet. -- OK, that's helpful. And then I apologize if I missed this. I think, previously, you had talked about launching a decision support system for MDI patients, along with the smart pen partner around late this year or early next year. Is that still on track? Or has that been pushed out a little bit? -- Yeah. So our first commercial smart pen launch will be together with Companion, right, where we're doing a -- it's really a retrospective review of insulin data together with CGM data in our clarity system. With respect to a real-time display of insulin in the DexCom app, that's still could happen later this year or first part of next year. We haven't been specific with who and what that product might look like, but we're still making good progress. -- I'll just add to that. We don't view that as a revenue driver as we sit here today. That would be nice to have.And the next question comes from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. Your line is open. -- Thanks. Just a couple of quick ones here. In terms of the new transmitter, I realize the COGS benefit to DexCom, but are there features and benefits to users? -- It's identical to the existing G6 transmitter. But I will add, we couldn't go to direct to- pple Watch until we get to this new configuration. So there is some better electronics we'll be able to use the features on and get some new firmware in, and such. But as far as performance, that's, I guess, I -- it's my understanding, the range is a little bit longer, but it's not a huge change. -- OK. And then I just want to get back to the international commentary about kind of flat sequential. You mentioned that half the business goes through distributors. Did you see more consistency from the direct business? And I guess, the other question is have you seen any change in market dynamics in Europe? -- Yeah. We do see more consistency in that direct business. That revenue cycle is a little bit different. We're recognizing revenue upon the sales to the end-user, whereas the distributor, generally, they'll take inventory positions, work though inventory, replenish and so forth.So you get a bit more lumpiness in that distributor business than you do in the direct. In terms of end market trends or anything changing, no, and I think we were pretty clear with the comments earlier. The new patient numbers continue to be a very nice for us, continue to track in terms of what we've seen historically from the overall international business. Existing patient trends, from an overall international perspective, looking very good as well.And so, again, I come back to, it's a bit of lumpiness. You got a tough comp. Honestly, you're going to have a tough comp in the third quarter as well in the international business. Last year, the third-quarter growth rate was even beyond what it was in Q2.So I think you'll see this again for another quarter. And then I think you'll start to see it pick up again in the fourth quarter. But nothing unusual here, nothing that is drawing our concern. We stayed very close to it.We understand the patient dynamics quite well and we're very encouraged with what we see.And your next question comes from Raj Denhoy from Jefferies. your line is open. -- I guess I -- it's late in the call, but I figure I'll ask the question anyway, just on competition, right? So that's been asked on most conference calls. We're still waiting for Libra 2.0 to get approved here. I guess do you any updated thoughts on that product or the competitive landscape and really anything about the delay on the product getting approved? -- No, we don't. And we're not going to give them our air time. We've dealt with competition ever since we've been here, and we'll deal with that one when it comes. So no, we don't have anything to add. -- Fair enough. For my second question, I just wanted to ask about your expectations around -- and you mentioned some of the pump partnerships, and I guess, over the next several months, we're going to see the first automated insulin delivery systems with your CGM. Do you have any thoughts on what that could do to CGM adoption or your growth really into next year? -- You mean, I'll somewhat defer to Tandem. But their latest public guidance is that their in control system would launch in Q4 of this year. So that will be a DexCom G6 sensor with a DexCom/TypeZero algorithm running on the Tandem X2 pump. The beauty -- as I said before, the beauty of the architecture of that -- the current system with Basal-IQ is that patients who are already taking advantage of the G6 system with Basal-IQ will be able to field-upgrade their system.So many of their existing patients are already joint patients that are already using the G6 system. It remains to be seen as -- I've said this a number -- on a number of occasions, do these automated insulin delivery systems -- as we get more automation, does that kind of reinvigorate, reaccelerate growth in the pump market? And I think we're optimistic that it does, and so to the extent we attract new patients and do pump therapy, be it Tandem, Insulet, that's obviously a benefit for all of us. -- OK, that's helpful. Thank you.And the next question comes from Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim. Your line is open. -- Yeah, thanks. Quentin, I want to follow up on the question about gross margins. You had talked about not assuming that the level with every office is a sustainable one for you in 2020 given ongoing pricing pressure. Could you just update thoughts on where gross margin shakes out over the course of the next 12 to 18 months? -- Yeah. Again, we're not going to get on into setting the expectation for 2020 just yet. Obviously, you'll see where the fourth quarter is expected to exit. And again, we feel very good about that number approaching the 70% range.So I think it talks to the potential that we have in front of us, but we are trying to be very transparent about the fact that the pricing headwinds are going to continue to exist. We're going to continue to navigate toward the pharmacy channel. We know Medicare is a bit of a headwind from a top line, but from a margin perspective without giving the CGM supplies, we actually feel like that could be a bit accretive. So we'll get more color as we start to get closer to the end of the year or exit the year, but I don't think you should anticipate it being up at that 70% range that we see in Q4.I think that's a fine starting point, but then you start model in the pricing headwinds that we talked about and the pressure that comes from the shifting mix of the business even as OUS becomes a bigger component, you can start to work yourself into a number, but we're not going to give any more specifics than that at this point. It's too early. -- That's fine. That's helpful. And then if I do a little bit of math here on the duplicative cost piece that you talked about. It looks like it was about 7 or $8 million in the quarter by my math.Is that in the right ballpark? And how does that trend over the back half of the year? Does it stay in there? Or does it gradually come out? -- Yeah. I think you're a little bit high, to be honest with you. You're not meaningfully off, but you're bit on the higher end of where that is. So I wouldn't look at that and annualize that per se, but you're getting down the right path.We do think that that start still alleviate a bit in the back half of the year. So one of the things that we said that we would do and be very careful about was we would ensure that we have the capabilities stood up in our new facility before we let resources go here. And we are now demonstrating that. We have had a wave of resources go or two.We'll see that continue to play out in Q3. And so, the duplicative costs will start to step down in the back half of the year.And the next question comes from Steven Lichtman from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. -- Thank you. Hi, guys. As you continue to move toward G7, I was wondering if you can give update us on your latest thoughts on how you see the usage model within the non-intensive patient population. Do you still expect it to be intermittent use? Just related thoughts overall and moving into that large channel long term. -- Long term, if we had a device that would be we reimbursed that patient could wear all the time, I think they would wear it. The issue becomes what is going to be reimbursed and what type of model is going to serve those patients best from a cost perspective. I can't tell you and give you feedback on at least three programs we're aware of or intermittent use of G6 is going on right now. And different levels of intermittent use.Some wear for three months straight, some wear one. Some wear it for one month, depending upon where they are. And the outcomes in these patients exceed anything ever in a Type 2 patient in any drug. They learn more from wearing the sensor than any pharmaceutical product that's ever been introduced in that market.We're very optimistic we can make a big difference there. And we will continue to work on that business model with our G6 platforms and with those parties we're working with, the programmatic people, the payers and such to develop the right model. So when we're ready, we're ready to go. And we would -- and quite honestly, we would walk away from an opportunity if somebody wants to use G6.It's just not the perfect product with the reusable three-month live transmitter to attack out, but we're learning a lot. We've committed a lot of resources to this. We're very confident we can make a huge difference, but the business model has yet to be developed. -- Great. That's helpful, Kevin. And then just secondly, on international, Steve, you mentioned Japan briefly. I was just wondering if you could provide an update on that opportunity and when you think you can start becoming a personal and not just professional use there? -- Yeah, we're still working through the regularly aspects of G6 in Japan. So if you remember, we actually launched in Japan with a professional version, utilizing the G4/G5 sensor platform. So I would tell you, it's probably not before the end of this year, but probably sometime. I'm hoping in the first part of next year, we're launching G6 as a direct-to-patient consumer use product.And our next question comes from Suraj Kalia from Northland Securities. Your line is open. -- Good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Kevin, can you hear me all right? -- Yeah, I can hear you fine. -- Perfect. So just one question. Most of the questions have been asked, but maybe this is better positioned for Quentin. Quentin, I know this whole thing about you all have been consistent about Q4 margins stepping up to 70%, at least the math you have suggested is Q3 is going to be give or take 63% and then it steps up to 70%.Can you help us fill in the blanks here? So I just did some rough math. If the transmitters, those are the ones that are going to cost a step change, am I right that they have to be 80%-plus gross margins on that? How should we think about that because I'm not getting to that 70%? Any additional fill in the blanks would be greatly appreciated. -- Yeah. I don't think, Suraj. We've never given specific gross margin profiles of any particular product of ours. But I would tell you, the cost reduction that we have in that transmitter from where it was is significant.It is orders of magnitude less cost than what it used to be. So we're not going to give you the specifics, but it was a very meaningful reduction. The team did an incredible job, really both the R&D teams and operations teams combined in designing cost out from a design perspective, but also just the process of manufacturing the product with the whole team effort that generated incredible benefit.And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin Sayer for final remarks. -- Thank you, operator. I guess I want to talk about one other recurring theme at ADA that kept coming to me over and over again. I met numerous people there that I've known for a number of years who have Type 1 diabetes, and I literally heard the same thing over and over again. I haven't stuck my finger for six months, I haven't stuck my finger for eight months.I heard a story from one patient who said he rubbed his wife on the -- on her shoulder, and she said for the first time in many, many years, his fingers didn't have scales on them or weren't rough. Other patient said I've never been healthier in my life because this is so easy to use. One well-known position, actually, we took the opportunity to make me aware of the responsibility we have as a company because these patients relying now only on G6 to manage all their diabetes, and no one sticks their finger anymore. These are great stories.But to assume that type of responsibility, we have to be really good. And we have to continue to perform on the financial side, so we can meet our goals on the technology, manufacturing and operations side. There are things we have to do better. As Quentin said earlier, we will address our customer service area, particularly outside service, and we will get that in line with all of the wonderful experiences our patients have with our product.We appreciate everybody's continued support, our patients, the physician community, our investors and especially our employees. Our sustained performance -- and this actual performance we have over the first half of the year only shines a brighter light on what we think is going to happen in the future. Thank you.[Operator signoff] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Investors were , but the worries soon faded away.There wasn't anything spooky about DexCom's latest quarterly figures. The company announced its second-quarter results after the market closed on Wednesday. Here are the highlights from DexCom's Q2 update.Image Source: Getty Images.DexCom's Q2 revenue jumped 39% year over year to $336.4 million. Analysts estimated that the company's revenue for the second quarter would come in at a little over $307 million.The company announced a net loss in the second quarter on a generally accepted accounting principles () basis of $10.5 million, or $0.12 per share. This reflected deterioration from the prior-year period when the company announced GAAP net income of $30.2 million, or $0.34 per share.DexCom reported non-GAAP adjusted net income of $7.8 million, or $0.08 per share. This represented a significant improvement from the prior-year period adjusted net loss of $6.5 million, or $0.07 per share. Wall Street analysts estimated that DexCom would post adjusted earnings per share of $0.01 in the quarter.It's apparent from DexCom's strong revenue growth in Q2 that its G6 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems remain very popular with customers who have diabetes. The company said that increased awareness of real-time CGM is a key factor in driving higher sales volumes.This revenue growth came from all geographic regions where DexCom sells its products. U.S. sales soared 40% year over year to $266.3 million. International sales jumped 33% higher to $70.1 million.You might wonder, though, why DexCom's bottom line looked so much worse than the prior-year period. There were two primary culprits. One was that the company's interest expense increased significantly from a year ago. However, the biggest factor was a $42.7 million gain from an equity investment posted in the second quarter of 2018 that resulted in a temporary profit on a GAAP basis.That one-time equity gain was adjusted out of DexCom's non-GAAP net income figures. As a result, the company's non-GAAP comparisons looked much better.DexCom now anticipates revenue to be between $1.325 billion and $1.375 billion in full-year 2019, up from its previous guidance of $1.25 billion to $1.30 billion. The company projected 2019 non-GAAP operating margin of 7%, compared to 6% provided in its previous outlook.CEO Kevin Sayer said that the company remains \"confident in DexCom's long-term growth opportunity.\" Investors will want to watch closely, though, to see how the future launch of 's new version of its FreeStyle Libre CGM system impacts sales of DexCom's G6 CGM.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Image source: DexCom.Tandem's presentation of data from the iDCL study was also great news for DexCom. This was the first large-scale study of a closed-loop system that included a dedicated control group.In , Steve Pacelli, the company's executive vice president for strategy and corporate development, said that this data would \"probably be the highlight\" for DexCom at the ADA meeting. And it was indeed a highlight. Probably the most impressive result from the iDCL study was that the time that patients were in an acceptable range for glucose levels was 76% for those using the closed-loop system compared with only 59% for patients in the control group.The popularity of the G6 CGM system is a big reason DexCom stock has soared nearly 50% over the last 12 months.\u00a0DexCom should have more good news for its G6 system later this year.

As a result, the demand for diabetes products has been going through the roof over the past decade, especially among next-generation medical devices.Which diabetes-oriented healthcare companies are in the best position to benefit from this global trend? We asked three of our Motley Fool contributors this question, and they picked\u00a0 ,\u00a0, and\u00a0. Here's why these three medtech diabetes companies should be on your radar this month. \u00a0 \u00a0Image source: Getty Images.Single-product companies with stocks that sport stately price-to-sales ratios over 12 are rarely compelling buys. However, the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device company DexCom is an oddball in this regard. Despite its  and limited product portfolio, this diabetes medtech titan remains an attractive growth play, even at these elevated levels.\u00a0What's the lowdown? DexCom launched its factory-calibrated \u00a0device last year to rave reviews by end users. In fact, the company has barely been able to keep up with demand since launch, resulting in its first-quarter revenues growing by an astounding 52% to\u00a0$280 million compared to the same period a year ago. And as the G6 launch matures, DexCom expects its gross margins to improve to a healthy 70%, perhaps by the end of 2019. The company, in turn, recently upped its annual revenue guidance by , thanks to the strong demand for the G6 system, in conjunction with its steadily improving profit margins.\u00a0DexCom's growth story, however, is only getting started. The company expects to roll out its next CGM device, the G7, in\u00a0late 2020 or early 2021. The G7 will feature a slimmer design, an entirely new sensor platform, and a far more customer-friendly price. The main goal with this next-generation CGM device is to greatly expand the market beyond type 1 or type 2 diabetes patients. DexCom envisions a day where individuals simply at risk of developing diabetes will be outfitted with one of their CGM devices. That's a lofty goal, but one that could exponentially growth DexCom's target market in the coming decade.\u00a0 Most diabetes patients don't have to wear insulin pumps. But for those who do, the long tubes associated with most insulin pumps on the market today can be a hassle. That's not the case for Insulet's OmniPod, though.Insulet stock has already been a big winner so far in 2019. Shares soared after the company posted . Although Insulet doesn't announce its Q2 financial results until Aug. 5, 2019, don't be surprised if the stock runs up in advance of its next quarterly update.The company thinks that year-over-year sales growth in the second quarter will be at least as high as the 29% growth delivered in Q1. Insulet\u00a0CEO Shacey Petrovic predicts that the company is on track to achieve $1 billion in revenue in 2021 with a 70% gross margin and an operating margin in the midteens. To put that revenue figure in perspective, it's nearly double the total revenue that Insulet made in 2018.A big reason for this optimism is the strong launch of the OmniPod DASH insulin management system in the U.S. Initial adopters of OmniPod DASH have praised its ease of use. And fewer prescribing restrictions have opened up access for more patients to use the insulin pump system.Insulet looks really expensive if you look at earnings-based valuation metrics. But the company's earnings should grow rapidly. Insulet definitely appears to be a diabetes stock to keep your eyes on in July and beyond. I agree with Keith that tubeless pumps offer advantages that make them desirable, but I'd also add that there's a good reason to cozy up to shares in the leading tubed-pump player, Tandem Diabetes.Unlike Insulet, Tandem Diabetes' pump is FDA approved for use  with DexCom's continuous glucose monitors to form a first-generation automated insulin dosing system. This system, which won the go-ahead last summer, disables the pump from dosing additional insulin when real-time data from the CGM shows dangerous blood sugar lows.Since approval, demand for Tandem's pumps have taken off. In Q1 2019 the company shipped 14,732 pumps, up 75% from Q3 2018, and sales , up 142% year over year. What's really remarkable about that performance is that the first quarter is typically weak because patients usually wait until later in the year, when their deductible is met, to buy equipment like this.Since we're already in the second half of the year, I suspect more people meeting their deductibles will further accelerate pump shipments and revenue into the end of the year. Results could also benefit from the expected rollout later this year of next-generation software that will allow Tandem's system to make decisions based on high glucose readings, too. This additional feature will make Tandem's automated system much more helpful to many more patients.Importantly, pump makers are only scratching the surface of the market. Only about 30% of the 1.5 million type 1 diabetics in the U.S. are using pump therapy currently, and Tandem's market share is only about 12%. Given that tailwinds may strengthen from here this year, buying this tubed-pump player this month could be profit-friendly.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The numbers are so big that investors have\u00a0\u00a0that address diabetes treatment.So which diabetes stocks do our team of Motley Fool contributors have their eyes on right now? They've called out  ,  , and  .Image source: Getty Images. The expected launch of '  next-generation Freestyle Libre 2.0 continuous glucose monitor (CGM) has increased worries that Dexcom's status as the  CGM player could be in jeopardy.Diabetics often rely on frequent finger sticks to determine insulin dosing, but that approach only provides point-in-time insight, so patients spend a lot of their day outside their desired range. That's a problem, because it can lead to dangerous glucose highs and lows that contribute to disease progression.To better control their disease, patients are embracing CGMs for real-time insight. Dexcom and Abbott are the biggest CGM manufacturers, and sales at both companies have been surging because of new products. Dexcom's revenue has been rising because of its G6 launch in the U.S., while Abbott's sales have benefited from the launch of the Freestyle Libre 2.0 in Europe.There's no timeline for a Freestyle Libre 2.0 approval in the U.S., but it's expected this year. When the Libre 2.0 launches, Abbott should be able to better compete against Dexcom, because the Libre 2.0 is the first Abbott system to include glucose high-and-low alarms, and its sensors last 14 days, versus 10 days for the G6. The Libre 2.0 is also expected to launch in the U.S. at a price that could undercut the G6, making it even more attractive to users.The Libre 2.0 threat shouldn't be ignored, but investors might not want to bet against Dexcom. Millions of patients can benefit from CGMs, so there's room for multiple offerings. In addition, the G6 is incorporated into Tandem Diabetes' insulin delivery system, which pairs it with a pump to deliver insulin automatically. A similar system incorporating the G6 is expected to be available from  in 2020. The G6 is also being incorporated into smart insulin devices at and , the two biggest insulin drugmakers.Furthermore, Dexcom's collaborating withspinoff Verily on the G7, a cheaper solution that could help insulate it against Abbott beginning late next year.There's no telling how market share will shake out, but Dexcom reports its most recent quarterly results on May 1, so investors will want to tune in to see what it says about the competitive landscape, market share, and its progress on the G7.\u00a0I worked in the diabetes industry for more than a decade, so I've been following Tandem Diabetes Care since its product first hit the market. I've been highly skeptical of the company for years, since I didn't think its product offering was different enough to set it apart in a crowded market. I even thought the company was going to have to close up shop last year, since it was running out of money and its stock price had fallen drastically.Thus far, Tandem has proved me wrong on both accounts. The company has done an  job at stealing market share from the likes of Medtronic and Insulet. What's more, the stock price has seen\u00a0 ever since the company performed an incredibly dilutive common stock offering in early 2018 -- Tandem sold 34.5 million shares of stock for just $2 each, which diluted existing shareholders by several hundred percent at the time.Tandem is in a much better financial position today than it was just a year ago, and it looks poised to continued rapid growth. Management is calling for revenue growth of  39% in 2019, which is a clear sign that it expects the company to continue grabbing market share. That fact alone puts this company high on my watch list.To be clear, \"watch\" is the keyword I want to emphasize. Tandem does look poised for continued growth, but I can't help thinking Wall Street's enthusiasm for this company has gotten way ahead of the fundamentals. Shares are currently trading for more than, a figure that's pricing in  of continued prosperity. While I'm no longer fearful about this company's ability to survive, I do question whether it can live up to the extreme optimism baked into its share price. After all, the company is still squaring off against formidable competition, its longtime CEO is stepping down, and it's still expected to post big losses both this year and next. When combined with an astronomical valuation, I can't help thinking caution is warranted.I've been dead wrong about Tandem before, and it's possible the company could go on to be a great investment from here. However, my view is that the risk/reward ratio is very unfavorable at today's prices, so I'm happy to watch this story from the safety of the sidelines.\u00a0Type 1 diabetics are typically totally dependent on externally supplied insulin for their survival.\u00a0Without it, their bodies can't metabolize sugar properly, and they would eventually die from the disease if left untreated.\u00a0The challenge with treating diabetes with externally administered insulin, however, is that patients need to be careful how much they take and when they take it. Dosing insulin incorrectly can itself cause health problems, so vigilance is the constant refrain of Type 1 diabetics who want to live long and otherwise healthy lives.Yet while there , there is a treatment that can help sufferers of the disease better manage their condition. It's called an insulin pump, and it can monitor diabetics' blood sugar levels and automatically provide appropriate dosages as needed. The typical insulin pump user has better A1C scores -- an important measure for how in control a diabetic's condition is -- and lower risks of complications than those that don't use the technology.When it comes to insulin pumps, Medtronic stands out as a clear winner in the space. Its pumps have been called \"probably the closest systems to artificial pancreases available on the market today.\"\u00a0That leadership position gives investors reason to believe the business has staying power. The fact that its shares have drifted down over the past six months\u00a0makes it worth looking at today.Thanks to that downward direction in its stock price, Medtronic can now be purchased for around 16 times the company's anticipated forward earnings.\u00a0With those earnings expected to grow at around 7.8% annualized over the next five or so years, today's investors are getting an opportunity to consider buying a strong company at a reasonable valuation.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Omnipod sales were $160.8 million, an increase of 51% year over year. The remaining sales were associated with using medicines other than insulin in Omnipod pumps.Gross margin was 65.7% in the second quarter, down 30 basis points year over year, because of investments in a new automated manufacturing line. The dip in margin was more than made up for by sales growth and controlled operating expenses, so Insulet's net income in the period improved to $1.4 million from a loss of $1.7 million one year ago.The better top-line performance has prompted management to raise its full-year sales forecast to at least $700 million from prior guidance for at least $667 million.

Globally, over 420 million people have diabetes, including nearly 100 million people in the U.S. and Europe.

Now I will turn the call over to Kevin.  -- Thank you, Matt, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. We are off to a great start in 2019 with much of the momentum that we experienced in 2018 continuing into our first quarter. First-quarter revenues grew to $280 million, a 52% increase over the first quarter of 2018. Once again, this strong performance was broad-based, as increased volumes in both our U.S.and OUS businesses drove results above our expectations, even as we absorbed the pricing headwinds that we have anticipated. We have spent s developing our innovative technology and demonstrating real-world clinical outcomes. And as awareness builds, demand for DexCom CGM is very strong among both new and existing patients. We remain confident that the company is well-positioned to drive toward our long-term targets.Particularly, as we expand the rollout of G6 and improve access to CGM. With this growing demand in mind, we are on track to meet our goal of doubling our G6 capacity by the end of 2019. From a cost perspective, we are demonstrating good expense control with revenue growth outpacing the increase in operating expense growth by more than two times. We continue to believe that patient outcomes demonstrate the true value of a CGM.In the first quarter, we showed real-world data that demonstrates the effectiveness of our Urgent Low Soon alert in the G6, which provides an actionable warning in advance of a dangerous hypoglycemic low. Not only have we seen a further decrease in hypoglycemia among G6 users with this feature, but this has been achieved regardless of a user's frequency of screen views. We also show the correlation between users of DexCom SHARE and Follow apps and better timing range for children and adolescents with diabetes. Once again highlighting the importance of this feature to our user base.It is outcomes such as these that have contributed to DexCom's great reputation among clinicians and allow us to capitalize on the increasing global awareness around CGM technology. The kind of demand we are experiencing can also bring certain challenges. This is especially the case in the first quarter of every year as we must reconfirm benefits and document clinical necessity for each patient. The process can be burdensome at times with our teams going back-and-forth with clinicians and payers on the patient's behalf.To our customers, we understand the fundamental importance of DexCom CGM in your life and are working around the clock to make sure that you are cared for. We saw improvement in our ability to meet demand and serve our customers as the quarter progressed and believe that the initiatives that we introduced to expand our customer's volume per structure are progressing well, with several areas showing meaningful productivity improvements. Considering the significant level of demand for DexCom CGM and the strength of our first quarter, we are very pleased to be able to increase our revenue outlook for 2019. I will now turn the call over to Quentin who will provide detail on this outlook, as well as a review of our financials. -- Thank you, Kevin. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, the financial metrics that I discuss today will be presented on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations to GAAP can be found in today's earnings release, as well as on our IR website. Today, we reported worldwide revenue of $280.5 million for the first quarter of 2019, compared to $184.4 million for the same quarter in 2018, representing growth of 52% on a reported basis and 53% on a constant-currency basis or $96 million of absolute dollar growth.Clearly the growing awareness for CGM has continued into the New Year . Geographically, U.S. and international revenues both demonstrated strong growth of 45% and 79%, respectively, over the first quarter of 2018. International revenues grew 86%, excluding the impact of currency, at least 25% of total company revenues in the first quarter, representing a high-water mark for the business and tracking toward the long-term expectations that we highlighted at our Investor Day late last year.We have seen continued success in shifting to the pharmacy channel consistent with our expectations at the start of the year , and we will continue to prioritize this initiative as we seek to drive improved access to DexCom CGM. Our first-quarter gross profit was $168.8 million or 60.2% of sales. The sequential decline from the fourth quarter of 2018 was consistent with what we've seen in prior years. Relative to this first quarter of 2018, gross margin was negatively impacted by incremental investments to scale infrastructure as we drive significant capacity expansion in 2019 and the continued shift in our mix toward the U.S.pharmacy, and International business. As demand continues to exceed expectations, we're accelerating investments to increase capacity, which is putting some additional pressure on gross margins. We now expect gross margins for the year of 64% to 65% as we speed up our capacity ramp to meet the growing demand. We remain confident in our ability to bring cost out of the system as the year progresses and over the long term, beginning with the introduction of our new G6 transmitter, and continued to implementation of automation into the manufacturing process, which will allow us to exit this year with gross margins approaching 70%.These improvements provide us with the strategic flexibility to be proactive with payers and to navigate future uncertainties and the pricing environment as we continue to push for greater access to CGM. Operating expenses were $176.4 million for the first-quarter 2019, compared to $147.6 million in the same period last year. This reflects an increase of 20% year-over-year and compares favorably to 52% revenue growth in the quarter, resulting in significant operating expense leverage from the prior year. Operating loss $7.6 million in the first quarter of 2019, compared to $28.7 million in the same quarter of 2018.Our improved operational discipline resulted in a 1,290-basis-point improvement in operating margins from prior year. Adjusted EBITDA was $26.1 million or 9.3% of revenue for the first quarter, compared to $4.5 million or 2.4% of revenue for the first quarter of 2018. As we said throughout 2018, we believe there is an opportunity to drive significant operating leverage toward our long-term targets in both of our first-quarter adjusted EBITDA and operating margin reflect great progress toward these goals. However, we are not pursuing this leverage at the expense of the growth in our business.We remain confident in the opportunity that lies ahead, not only for our core business, but also the application of CGM technology to new markets. We will continue to invest in these initiatives, our R&D pipeline, and other strategic opportunities in order to maximize DexCom's long-term potential. Our net loss was $4.6 million or $0.05 per share and our balance sheet remains strong having ended the quarter with approximately $1.4 billion in cash and equivalents and no borrowing against our $200 million revolving line of credit. As mentioned, we continue to prioritize investment into our capacity expansion initiatives and automation of manufacturing, which led to $39 million of capex in the first quarter.Looking at the remainder of the year, given the strength of our first-quarter performance and the growing demand that we are seeing for DexCom real-time CGM, we are increasing our full-year revenue expectations by $75 million and we now anticipate total revenue of approximately $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion for the year, reflecting reported growth of 21% to 26%. As I mentioned previously, we anticipate full-year gross margins to approximate 64% to 65% for 2019, showing meaningful improvement in the back half of the year as we look to exit the year approaching 70%. We now expect operating margins of approximately 6% and remain comfortable with our original target of adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 18%. Our restructuring efforts associated with setting up operations in the Philippines are progressing well with nearly 200 employees now on the ground in Manila.We have been extremely pleased with early indications demonstrating significant efficiency and scaling benefits. We now expect the restructuring-related costs to come in at approximately $15 million to $20 million, with the majority in the first half and now slightly below our original estimates. With that, I will now turn the call over to Steve for a strategic update. -- Thank you, Quentin. As our first-quarter performance indicates, global awareness and demand for real-time CGM continues to increase dramatically, not only in the U.S., but also in international markets like Germany, the U.K. and Australia. In February, DexCom stood front and center at the annual Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes or ATTD conference, with DexCom product utilized in numerous clinical studies and presentations from key leaders in the diabetes community.As anyone in attendance can attest, there is genuine excitement toward our efforts around Decision Support, app enhancement and of course, the G6 platform. The global rollout of G6 remains a key strategic objective in 2019. As Kevin noted, we are doubling G6 capacity by the end of 2019. Given the level of performance and ease-of-use that the G6 system brings, we expect G6 to continue to function as a platform product for DexCom for many years to come, even certain markets beyond the launch of our next-gen G7 product.Yet as we push the rollout in production of G6, our teams are also making significant progress toward finalizing G7, and we remain on track for a late 2020 or early 2021 initial launch. As a reminder, G7 will be an entirely new sensor platform for DexCom. One that meets the iCGM standards and further extends our leadership with a significantly reduced form factor and extended wear in a fully disposable one-piece wearable. Strong, therapeutic, cost-saving outcomes utilizing CGM continue to present themselves across the healthcare landscape.For several quarters, we have discussed CGM usage in non-intensive type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, gestational diabetes, broad potential deployment in the hospital, and application in overall wellness. While it is now time for an increased focus in investment in these areas, particularly since we know that these opportunities will require completely different business models and distribution channels, in order to lead this effort, I'm pleased to announce that we have pointed Matt Dolan as General Manager of New Markets. As many of you are already aware through his involvement with our Investor Relations and Corporate Development Efforts, Matt is a great leader and we are confident that he and his dedicated team are the right people to guide these key growth initiatives for DexCom. Turning back to our core business, we have now proven ourselves to be early advocates of the principle of interoperability and patient choice, having established partnerships with multiple insulin delivery players, and we will continue to leverage the iCGM designation.We're seeing significant progress from these collaborations and look forward to the launch of a few of these connected products over the next 12 months. We are especially thrilled for our patients as these innovative products stand ready to minimize the burden of diabetes management. And we are proud that DexCom stands at the center of this progress. With that, I'll pass it back to Kevin. -- Thanks, Steve. This is obviously an exciting time to work at DexCom. Not only are we working hard to bring our technology to the increasing number of people with diabetes, who see the benefit of real-time CGM, but we are very actively exploring possible applications of our sensor technology to additional populations. My personal expectations for New Markets group are very high.We need to gather as much clinical cost-based evidence as possible with our G6 platform so that we are truly prepared to attack these markets in a big way with G7. In the meantime, we are capitalizing on the continued momentum in our core business, leading to a significant increase in our annual revenue guidance. With this success, we have to put everybody on the DexCom team to roll out in the first quarter, from the commercial team, to manufacturing, to customer support, to R&D and beyond. We know you have worked incredibly hard, and we thank you.In summary, we are pleased with DexCom's performance to start the year , and believe that we are well positioned for another great of revenue growth, technology advancement and increasing profitability. I would now like to open the call up for Q&A. Matt? -- Thank you, Kevin. [Operator instructions] Operator?[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. -- I'll ask my question and related follow-up upfront here. First, Quentin, just implied in the initial guidance was about $100 million in assumed pricing headwinds due to the mix in the pharmacy, international, etc. Is that -- what's still baked into the new guidance? And second, in terms of the move to the pharmacy I realize the inherent benefits for existing users migrating to what should be a lower-cost setting but receiver growth continues to be quite strong. So my question is, do you think the move to the pharmacy has stimulated incremental growth in new patient adds? And any color that you could provide around the pharmacy dynamic in the quarter would be great. -- Sure. So yes, Jason, to you point, the $100 million that we talked about on the initial call for the year setting the original expectations, that's still consistent with how we think about it over the course of the year, so no change there. Obviously, we've got a concerted effort in place to move to the pharmacy channel, and that's playing out about just like we anticipated that it would. Your point on new patient growth, I am certain that the pharmacy channel makes access more easy and more convenient for folks.I'm certain that's a part of the driver. And when you look at that overall growth in the company, there is no question that the primary driver of our growth is new patient volume. So I am sure it's connected.And our next question comes from Travis Steed from Bank of America. -- Just looking at your Q1 revenue, it seems typical seasonality, so that's 20% Q1 for the full year. Just trying to think about that suggested $100 million more than you're guiding to for 2019. So is that just the typical conservatism that you have or is there anything else we should consider as we model out 2019? -- I think the right way to think about it, and I know we talked about 20% back on the last call. I think a few things came through in the quarter. We talked about the strength in the fourth quarter being really driven by new patient additions that came in late in the quarter. Now if you recall, at that point in time, we shared that we expected those folks -- maybe back with their next reorder really early in the second quarter.We saw a lot of that end up coming through in the month of March was a bit ahead of our expectation, a great signal and great outcome. But at the end of the day, that was a bit of the upside surprise. I think the other thing to keep in mind just around seasonality is that, as we continue to move more into the pharmacy channel, and as we continue to see the OUS business become a bigger part of the overall business, and as that Medicare continues to grow faster than the commercial business, all of those have very different seasonal patterns to them, generally, which might have more revenue early in the year. So we're just trying to be thoughtful around all of those different dynamics in the business, as we set expectations for the full year, surely not trying to signal anything.We know what your math would indicate that you laid out, but we're just being mindful of some of the shifts in the mix of the business. -- All right. No, that's helpful. And then I want to make sure I heard you correctly. You're exiting the with 70% roughly gross margins? Just kind of give us a little bit more info on how you're going to get there, and is that sustainable into next year? And also, does it give you a little bit more flexibility on pricing, if needed? -- Yes. So, I think, this is -- the 70% ability to get into that number by the end of the year is in line with the plans that we've always had around our gross margins progression into the future. You go back to our Investor Day and we laid out the path that arguably could take us up north of 70%, and then you have the headwinds that continue to play in with the revenue per patient, mix challenges that we envision as we continue to move into the pharmacy. OUS becomes more significant.So there's nothing out of the ordinary here. It's right in line to what we've planned to be able to do. The big enabler for us, and we've talked about this lower cost design transmitter for some time now, you're going to see that start to play through in the fourth quarter. So the teams have done an incredible job of designing cost out of the system.We'll start to produce that in the back half of the year. You'll actually see it start to get produced in the third quarter. That will get hung up in inventory a bit. We'll start to sell through it in the fourth quarter, and the benefit will start to play through.So it's in line with the plans that we've had. I think in terms of next year -- I would just tell you, let's stick in the mid-60s at this point in time. I think it absolutely gives us the flexibility to continue to navigate the pricing environment and do what we need to do to ultimately generate the most significant growth for the company. But it's these kind of things that give us the strategic opportunities to be flexible on how we think about positioning ourselves.And our next question comes from Robbie Marcus with JP Morgan. -- Congrats on the great quarter. I want to address the question that's been impacting the stock and clearly, top of mind for investors lately, and what's the potential impending approval of your competitor's Libre 2.0 product? And there's a lot of questions out there about -- what does it look like? Does it get iCGM? And how those alerts and alarms will compare as a product versus G6 today and eventually G7? So I'd love to get your thoughts here. And any clarity or insight you can give us would be much appreciated? -- Robbie, this is Kevin. I'll take that one. Thanks. Let's go back a bit, it was about a year ago at this time that we talked about the iCGM standards for the first time.And we remain very bullish on the fact that the FDA did give us guidance and standards by which we can develop products in the future that will be safe and in the best interest of our patient. And we stand by that. We've wanted standards and guidance for years so we know what the bars to shoot at, and we actively look at that. We never assumed when we started this process that we would be the only iCGM company in the world, that eventually others would up their game to get that approval.And in the event that Abbott does get approval on the iCGM standards, that's -- they've obviously provided enough clinical evidence to do so with the FDA. If you look back at the history of our company, and we were reminiscing about this today as we were preparing for the call. Ever since I've been here, we've always had a competitive offering from another company in the field that claim to be as good as a DexCom. But you'll notice the claims of those companies have always been, \"We're as good as a DexCom.\" Never as good as somebody else.We're as good as a DexCom. Real life use in field has proven over and over again that our technology leads the way snd that our actual real-world clinical performance, on-body and on-patients, has always been the best and has always survived and given us the position to do that. We're very confident that our product will remain top-of-the-line and will do -- and will be extremely well received. We have not seen a lot of Libre 2 in Europe where it's been launched, so we don't have a lot of answers.And we're not going to speak to the characteristics of their product. We know a lot about ours. We have enhancements coming for G6 over the course of the year that will make it an even better product offering. And over time, as we offer theDecision Support and other things for our patients, we intend to have the best experience that a patient could possibly have with G6.When we move to G7 and it's size advantage, the body wearable, the one-piece component where we don't have to put a transmitter in the system anymore. The lightweight nature of it. And many of you know, I wear the G7 quite a bit now as I've always been a sensor snob, it is a patient experience. It's a bigger leap than from G5 to G6 has been in our previous history.So we know that product will be wildly competitive and have all the features and benefits of the current G6 system and more. So we -- our pipeline is fabulous. It's a great market opportunity and there's room for a number of participants and a number of products, not just one. -- That's really clear. I appreciate the thoughts, Kevin, and then just a follow-up. Maybe not too far off of this, but can you give us some flavor of what your discussions with payers are like? Are the payers focused on cost avoidance of diabetes, adverse events, and improving patient outcomes or are they just simply focused on moving reimbursement to the lowest-cost dominator? I appreciate it. -- It depends on the meeting and it depends on the payer. We have been very successful in our payer discussions over the past several months and have had wins on numerous payer discussions. For example, Cigna just gave us pharmacy coverage and pharmacy benefit. We do not issue press releases every time we have a win because that's our job, that's normal course of business for us.But we have great coverage there and some local payers and pharmacy coverage. We do spend a lot of time discussing outcomes and educating payers. And I think over time, as we get more data and as we can build a better case, we can get those type of contracts in place. I would put the onus for that back on us rather than on the payers.We just need better measurables and better data. It's taken us years to develop that clinical evidence. The DIaMonD study that we talked about for the first time a couple of years ago was really our first endeavor to do just that. And now, with all this data coming to our servers, to our mobile platforms, we believe we'll be able to make some very strong real-world evidence just from our patients as we look at time and range statistics, and compliance with the system and how well they do on hypo avoidance.I have an example in my prepared remarks of the predictive alert that we have in the G6 system and how we're seeing a significant reduction in hypoglycemia because of that alert. That type of evidence is something we really haven't presented in the past, and we will do that going forward now that we have so much data from the mobile systems. We're very comfortable playing in that realm because we know the outcomes that our device provides to patients are outstanding.And our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy from Leerink. -- Congrats on a really good quarter. Just a question, and this is sort of following up on the question around the impact of a competitor potentially getting iCGM. But just curious if you can give any color directionally or what have you on the percent of your installed base domestically today and/or new patient adds that are MDI versus pumpers? I think historically you've said, the majority of the patients coming on to the DexCom are MDI and not actually pumpers. Anything you can say to that? -- The majority of our new adds now are MDI patients, Danielle, by a reasonable margin. As we're getting a much larger patient base, we're going over into those who are not on the pump systems for more of the new adds. But I anticipate, as our partners get new systems out, that we will see significant growth in that segment, as well as these systems do more than just deliver insulin but actually have algorithms that can improve outcomes. Right now our new patient adds are primarily MDI patients.That's most of them. -- Got it. OK. That's helpful. And then just a question on the G7, and I want to make sure I'm understanding correctly how pricing is going to change with G7.I know you guys haven't sort of outlined your go-to-market strategy per se, but I think you've said in the past that at some point, you're expecting to be at -- well, tell me if this is correct. Are you expecting to eventually be pricing at parity with the competition as we look down -- further down the line to G7 and beyond? Or do you think that even with G7, you'll still be pricing at a premium? -- I'm not going to outline all the specific details regarding that. But here is our strategy and here's how we look at that. We look at the annual revenue per patient per -- and what is the appropriate amount to charge a patient. For example, as we've gone from G7 to G6, that's how we look at that product offering as annual revenue per year rather than pricing on the individual components.With respect to how we price G7, there's a lot of variables involved there. If we have Decision Support tools that lead to better outcomes. Does that justify a premium? Does it not? I think we'll have to see it over time. What's most important for the investment community to know is from a cost basis, we have a lot of flexibility with G7.We designed that product for manufacturing. We designed that to be a lower cost product offering than we have today, particularly with the extended wear. We're prepared for what the market will do, but we will study this at great length and have a very detailed go-to-market strategy before we go, but I can't commit to anything specifically now. We're very optimistic about all the directions we can go.And our next question comes from JP McKim from Piper Jaffray. -- I wanted to ask, one, just, Kevin, you made a comment that you -- that I think you're wearing a G7 now. So it feels a little more real me. And so, I don't know, maybe initial thoughts on it. And then, will we see a trial start for G7 this year or is that still something that will happen in 2020? -- Look, we run trials with G7 all the time. But they're small trials that we're gathering data to learn and fine tune the features of the system. With respect to the experience, the regulatory people are probably going to kill me if the legal guy doesn't first, but it really is spectacular. The wearable is pretty much nonexistent on your body.As I look at projects we've started and innovation that we've attempted during my term at this company, this is the biggest leap we've ever taken. And it's a huge leap. And kudos to all the people involved in it because if I were to design what I'd hope CGM would have been when I started in this business, 25 years ago this week, I would have designed this. And so we're finally here. -- That's really helpful. And then maybe just on -- if I could ask one on just the non-intensive programs. There are several trials that we should see some data at ADA around. I mean, either Matt or Kevin, like how do you -- how to define success in those trials? Is it -- are payers really akin on recent amount of medications or are they'd sort of give the time, the range of the metrics? Or -- I guess, how do you -- how should we look at those trials as successful? -- Yes. I would say, you have to take the individual markets and kind of look market-by-market. So certainly, in the non-insulin-using, non-intensive type 2 market, reduction of drug cost is paramount, right? In the hospital, things like length of stay -- reduce nursing time is important but reducing length of stay, getting people out of the ICU down to a step-down ward, into the general ward and out of the hospital. And actually, as important these days, prevention of hypoglycemia in a hospital setting is becoming increasingly important, it's on CMS's radar as a key metric for hospitals.So reduction of hypoglycemia is going to be important going forward in that market. Gestational diabetes, we're still early in exploring opportunities. I'd love to tell you that at some point, the CGM session will actually replace the oral glucose tolerance test. That's going to take some time and effort and some clinical trial work on our part, so there's no kind of one size fits all in the new markets' development opportunities, but Matt has developed and will continue to develop a pretty robust team to tackle all these markets.And clearly, over the next several s, three-years to five-years time horizon, those markets becoming increasingly important for us.And our next question comes from David Lewis, Morgan Stanley. -- Just 2 from me. Quentin, just want to come back to the gross margins. I appreciate your commentary about the 70% for the back half of the year in mid-60s next year. But if I take the LRP, which obviously as you're aware with 65% in 2023.Scaling and innovation, about 700 basis points of that. So it actually feels like both of those factors are playing a pretty powerful role on the back half of '19. So is it safe to assume the 65% 2023 number, given you're seeing earlier scaling and innovation is a -- is now a conservative number and we should think about that number being kind of materially higher? -- Yes. I don't want to get out to five years out from now and talk about whether it's conservative or aggressive. I think what we tried to lay out for you is that we have very clear lines of sight to some very specific improvement efforts that will drive the gross margin higher over time. What becomes a bit more of a variable that we're prepared to be able to address is the revenue per patient headwind.And as the mix shifts between different channels, we're going to have more than enough leverage flowing through the COGS profile of our business to be able to address that very aggressively and still produce a very attractive gross margin profile. So we're happy with where things are at. The lower-cost transmitter coming in the back half of this year had always been something that we planned for and knew that we'd see a nice benefit from -- to Kevin's point earlier, you're going to see an incremental benefit coming from G7, as well as that's been designed to be even more cost-effective. So there's a lot of nice levers in front of us that give us the opportunity to combat some of the headwinds that might be out there. -- OK. And just a quick follow-up on just the pharmacy benefit, the [Inaudible], can you just update us, Steve, maybe on where you are into the pharmacy benefit coverage. I think it was 50% last quarter. And more specifically, a lot has been made, sort of, intra-quarter about first provider or primary provider relationships.Can you just sort of talk about whether preferential provider or formerly relationships are having any impacts on U.S. demand? And sort of how you see the future of preferred provider relationships in the channel, so the -- who you are in mix and we would say I'm preferred provider? -- I'll answer the second part of that question first, which the answer is no. I mean, we've seen some isolated instances of companies trying to negotiate for preferred status, but that's certainly not something we're seeing as a trend as we move to the pharmacy benefit. As for commercial lives under coverage, we're certainly north of 50%. We haven't given a more granular number than that, and we're still not processing.In terms of commercial business, we're not processing close to 50% through the pharmacy channel at this point. We're working hard to move more and more patients into that channel. So when we say we have north of 50% of the commercial lives covered, we're certainly still not processing 50%.And our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. -- Very nice quarter. Two questions really. At the ADA meeting in June, can you give us a feel for what we should be looking for there? -- Yes. Steve, why don't you take that one? -- Yes. I mean, I would say the most exciting data set, if you will, that we hope to see at ADA will be really a combined data set together with Tandem, where we should get a, at least, a first peak if not a full-blown view of the iDCL data. So that's -- again, that's Tandem's X2 pump with the DexCom G6 and the DexCom/type 0 algorithm running a hybrid close loop systems. So that's probably the highlight for us and for Tandem collectively at ADA.There will be a number of additional kind of poster and some podium presentations, but from a data perspective that's really what we're looking forward to. -- Yes. I'd just add. The other thing, Joanne, that we're going to continue to see is anybody who stands up to speak starts talking about CGM. Every outcome, every trial, everything going on, CGM is clearly becoming the standard of evaluation -- of evaluating diabetes care across the board.And I believe that trend is going to continue at ADA, and you will see CGM pretty much interwoven everywhere with everything that's done. -- That's helpful. And then my second question has to do with the OUS market. Growth was strong there again this quarter, and I'm just trying to get an idea of sustainability and into what other regions you might be looking to venture into? -- You were talking about the OUS market? -- Internationally, yes? -- Yes, yes. -- Clearly, the growth was strong there, and I think, you look at overall adoption of CGM in that overall marketplace is probably still sub-10% in terms of the long range opportunities. And so there's a huge amount of runway that continues to exist in front of us. And our core markets continue to drive the primary growth for us today. Germany was another standout performer in the quarter leading the way for us.But there is significant other new markets that are coming online. We just saw significant growth coming out of the Nordic markets, for example. We saw incremental reimbursement approved in Australia that allowed significant amount of contribution over the course of later part of this year into next year. And then you get into some of the Asian markets, where we haven't started to see the contribution yet, but expect nice tailwinds coming out of Japan and Korea, for example.So there are several new market opportunities, or even markets that we're in today, that it is growing at incredible rates, in paces of growth and a relatively untapped market opportunity. So I think there's several channels for overall growth in that international business that -- to get it to the point where in our long-range plans, we talked about it being closer to 30%, 35% of the overall business, which means it's going to be growing faster than the U.S. business. I think there's a lot of channels that will continue to make that available to us.And our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. -- So first one from me is more a bigger picture prospective, because we've now seen several quarters of strong patients growth. So what I'm curious about is whether you guys are seeing a change in prescription patterns in the market? Whether it's [Inaudible] or patients, and irrespective more of pharmacy or G6, but is CGM really becoming widely expected and a go-to from those type 1 patients? -- Margaret, this is Kevin. I believe it's becoming much more widely accepted and prescription patterns are rising across the board. That -- it's just becoming the tool of the manager insulin delivery. And it's not -- while it is becoming a tool and more accepted, penetration rates are still not at the point where we need to step back and worry.In the type 1 market, we think the penetration rates in the U.S. are still in the 30% range across the board. And type 2 intensive insulin using it is still not that big a number either. So over time, there's plenty of market runway here to continue to go on the international front.Penetration rates in the intensive population are close to being at that high but we think it is much more accepted than it was before. And we think G6 has had a very positive impact for us in these new markets, because it's much easier to use. There's no calibration feature, the easier insertion, the direct-to-phone connectivity. All the things we've built into G6 were designed to drive this market and we're seeing the benefits of that as we go forward. -- And so just to follow up on that. It seems like you guys have got nice improvements. So the indoors saw selecting patients that they think that will see the most benefits from that. And what else maybe do you need, I know you mentioned new connected product launches this year.I don't know if those are digital software or hardware? -- It's interesting. I just spent some time with several of the folks from the field. And I would tell you, a lot of this varies territory to territory. It varies practice to practice still.There is not a standard guideline where all the doctors are identifying different patients and having different criteria. I would say like anything, that it's changing rapidly. When I first went out on the field, when I started here, the only patient recommended for CGM was a pumper. I would ask doctors, who do you put on CGM? They'd say somebody with a pump is where we start.That certainly is not the case anymore. And so it varies across the board, but it is much more prevalent than it used to be. There's still plenty of room.And our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird. -- Kevin, I want to go back and ask you a question on the MDI versus pump mix that was talked about earlier. Especially within the MDI category, are you seeing any change in that patient base? Are you winning any competitive converts there? Or are those all native first-time users of CGM that you're winning on that MDI side? -- I don't have a good piece of data here. -- Yes, I would say -- I would say, anecdotally, just honestly coming out of our national sales meeting and talking to our field force, who really they're on the front line, that you hear anecdotal stories that yes, people would try Libre and then if they are content with an on-body experience, with a sensor experience that they do migrate to a DexCom, but we don't have any real metrics to kind of give you as to what sort of conversion rate we have on Abbott to DexCom. With respect to Medtronic, they've launched a stand-alone system, but we -- honestly, we just don't do that system out in the marketplace at all. -- Yes. Fair enough. And then on Medicare, I just -- we didn't get much color on that this quarter. Any update there on stick rates, on demand trends, things like that.I know G6 is pushed till later this in that channel. Has that been impacting near-term demand? Just any updates would be helpful? -- Yes. No change in trends there, Jeff. I would say our stick rates remain very, very high. I mean we're incredibly encouraged by what we're seeing there.And the new patient funnel continues to be very full. So pushing the G6 launch out into later in the year has not impacted any trends that we've seen in that Medicare business right now.And our next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen.This is Ryan on for Doug. And first off, Matt, congrats on the new role. You referenced G6 enhancements coming this year and earlier in the call and talked about new algorithms on the last quarterly call. Can you provide any more details? Should we expect the new algorithm to noticeably improve the performance metrics of G6 during 2019? And then should we expect extended wear for G6 during 2019? -- You know what, let us -- we're going to keep that close to the vest and not lay out the -- the road map. In the U.S., I can tell you in 2019, we don't expect extended wear for the G6 in 2019. The decisions that we are making around things that would require extensive trials of that nature are very interesting. Do we commit those resources to G6? Or do we commit those resources to accelerating G7? And in many cases, we're choosing the G7 acceleration over that.But there are new features coming out in the fall on G6, and we'll kind of wait a while before we lay what all those are out to everybody.And your next question comes from Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim. -- I just want to follow up on the comment about the gross margin, Quentin, and why we shouldn't assume that 70% is a good number going forward? I'm assuming some of that has to do with the continuation of the pharmacy dynamic next year but just kind of flush out how much you have to sort of swim upstream to maintain margins in the mid-60s? And what you're thinking about over the next -- call it, 18 months? -- Yes. Without getting into specifics around 2020, maybe I'll just point you to one of the dynamics that we feel in the business right now, which is somewhat considerable to what we saw last as well. For the full year, when we set margin expectations, we talked about there being roughly a 200-basis-point headwind relative to the revenue per patient impact of moving into some of these other channels, both pharmacy and OUS. I think based upon what we know at that point in time, that's probably the right way to continue to think about that headwind as we roll into next year.Clearly, we'll refine that as we learn more as we exit the year but they start to push up into the 70s with the lower-priced transmitter. It clearly gives us opportunities to be more thoughtful around pricing strategies into the future. So that's why I come back into the mid-60s for the time being. But in terms of the pressure we're feeling from mixed channel, a couple of hundred basis points right now it's what we're seeing.So you can model from there where you want. But I still think the mid-60s is right way to think about it over the long-term. -- That's helpful. And then on the new markets, I'm assuming it's going to be a little while before we see some real data in some of these new indications. But at this point, is there a lead candidate that you guys think is most promising or that you -- you think you want to go after first? -- I would say, we're -- look, we're already commercial to some extent in the non-intensive type 2. I mean we've characterized some of the work we're doing, particularly with UnitedHealthcare as pilot studies, but we're talking about multiple thousands of patients. So there are large pilot studies. With respect to the work being done by United, Onduo, etc.You're not going to see any data. In fact, they hold some of the findings and the learnings there to be highly proprietary, so they're not going to share that with anybody. To the extent we run a more formalized clinical protocol for a hospital indication or a gestational indication or something like that, that data may become available. But right now, I don't think we have any plans to -- really, to tip our hat to our potential competitors in those markets as well.And our next question comes from Raj Denhoy from Jefferies. -- Just really wanted to ask about the leverage, the middle of the income statement you guys are talking about. And I appreciate the comments on the increase to the folks in the Philippines now. So a couple of questions there. One is, if you think about the environment getting potentially more competitive, one of the concerns is that customer service for you guys has always been such a really strong shoot and as you move that now -- offshore and how you maintain that? And so I'm curious if you have any kind of really data or anything you can offer in terms of how that transition is going. -- Yes. Raj, we've been incredibly impressed by the team that's being built over there. And we pay very close attention to, not only quantitative assessment and performance metrics, but also qualitative. And so, we try to take the opportunity with every single patient as they work with our folks over there to get feedback from them -- on how the calls went and what we can do better.And I can tell you out of the gate, our qualitative scores are higher than what we've seen in our domestic teams. So we're seeing great results and something that we're paying very close attention to. From an efficiency perspective, we've been beyond, to be quite honest, what we anticipated we might be able to recognize in the early stages there. You look at some of the work coming off our customer advocacy or complaints area, our tech support and other back-office functions, and the efficiencies are significant that lead us to believe that it's going to make it much easier to scale, much more quickly and clearly, more effectively.So we couldn't be more encouraged by what -- we're seeing out of that effort there. I believe that over time, that becomes a real strategic asset to this company and allows us to be more aggressive in how we think about other strategic opportunities in markets we might want to pursue. Or how we just compete in the local markets that we're in already. So very encouraged by what we're seeing there.And your next question comes from Ravi Misra from Berenberg Capital. -- So my first one is again on gross margins. Just hoping, Quentin, maybe you could give us a little bridge between the first-quarter and fourth-quarter ramp? And then on the first quarter, what are the headwinds that showed up in that margin that are going to fall away, maybe break it down versus year-over-year versus mix-shift or underutilized overhead? -- Ravi, when you're talking fourth quarter, you're talking about from Q1 this year to Q4 of '19? -- Right. Yes, actually. -- Sure. So I think -- let me just talk year-over-year real fast, Q1-to-Q1 around some of the headwinds that we had. There was about 200 basis points of impact related to the continued shift toward pharmacy, and the OUS business being a bigger part of the overall contribution. And then there's about 200 basis points associated with -- really, our focus on doubling capacity.And we talked about the fact that with the demand being beyond what we had anticipated, we're accelerating some of that spend. So we pulled some of that forward. Not all of that is capitalizable or inventoriable. And so it's run through the P&L a bit earlier than what we had anticipating.So I think you'll see Q1 will be that low-water mark. I think you'll start to see it improve a bit in Q2 and see some real improvement in Q3 and onto Q4. And really what drives that, in Q3, you're going to start to get just the benefit of levering the fixed overhead that we put in place right now to design the automated manufacturing capabilities. In Q4, while you're getting some of the benefit of that leverage or the fixed overhead, you're really going to start to get the play-through of the benefit on the low-cost transmitter.So hopefully that gives you a bit of a bridge over the course of the year in terms of what the contributing factors are. But I think for us, we can see a clear line of sight of getting close to that 70% range as we exit this year. -- Great. I can add some follow-ups offline. And then my second question is, just around type 2 usage and kind of some of the commentary you had around moving patients from the ward -- from ward to ward, just curious, what's the take on the proposed rule changes around new technology add-on payments? I mean do you see a space for your CGM products to fit into that designation? And what could that mean from a reimbursement or payment perspective? -- Yes. Absolutely, and particularly in the hospital setting, as I mentioned, CMS has a renewed focus and has identified hypoglycemia in the inpatient setting as a huge problem. And so you're not going to detect hypoglycemia with finger sticks, even if you're taking a couple of finger sticks an hour, right? So I think that the CGM plays into that environment. And we've long known that referring hyperglycemia in the hospital is a problem leads to reduced healing times.We can get CGM put on this -- the idea would be to get CGM put on these patients potentially pre-op, get them into the hospital with the sensor already on, get their blood sugar under control before a procedure and get them in and out of the hospital as quickly as possible. So yes, we think there's great application here. We think also the disposable nature of G7 is the perfect product opportunity there.And our next question is from Matt Taylor from UBS. -- So I wanted to ask, Quentin, a question, see if you could give us a little bit more detail on what changes here sequentially in terms of some of the assumptions that are embedded in the revenue guidance for the year? Did address a little bit of this in the earlier question about the pricing headwinds, but can you just give us a sense for what has changed? And if you could provide broad strokes on the different components, that would be helpful? -- Yes. I think -- it's really quite simple. To be honest with you, it's not a lot of different moving pieces. It comes down to new patient volume more than anything else.I think the demand that we continue to see in the business coming off at Q4 and the strong Q1 continues to increase our confidence in the adoption of the technology in the marketplace, and so it's really new patient volumes that are driving the incremental growth. I think you'll see a lot of that come thru on the commercial business through the pharmacy channel. From our experience, we believe that's where the majority ends up showing up, and then the international business is a bit strong as well. So those two channels are the primary drivers.And at the end of the day, it's all new patient volumes that are driving it. The pricing assumption, I talked about earlier, no change in terms of the $100 million headwind. -- OK. And then maybe just a follow-up with the Head of New Markets here or just for the team, can you talk about which of the new markets you think is really going to be able to bear fruit for the company in the near term? Anything that you can share on the strategy there that's changed since -- you talked about some of the things at Investor Day? -- This is Kevin. I'll take that. I'm not as concerned about bearing fruit on the revenue side, as I am building a long-term case. So our efforts this year go -- as we rolled this stuff out, as I said earlier in my prepared remarks, are to develop the outcomes, the cost base evidence that show these are markets where we're going to save patient's money and deliver better outcomes.So it will be largely developing that evidence in those business models, establishing relationships we need to go to distribute into these markets and taking some steps like that over 2019 and early 2020. And then when we roll out G7, we expect to roll that out to these other places as well. And that becomes more of a commercial thing right now. And again, I will echo something that Steve said earlier.We haven't just been sitting around on this and not working. We've had some of our best people working on these fronts for quite some time. Now what we've done is formalized the structure and said, you guys have a home, you have a group, you have some goals, go get this done. And we're going to start measuring that progress more, rather than just as projects.And that's what we're expecting in the near-term.And our next question comes from Steve Lichtman from Oppenheimer. -- Kevin, on intensive type 2s, where do you think we're at penetration-wise today? And any updated color on your discussions with commercial payers and expanding access to those patients? -- We continue to pursue that with the payers and certainly, using the CMS ruling as a basis for that. It gives us a very good start. I don't think penetration is very deep there right now. I can give you a number, I think it's less than 10%, in general.However, a lot of those type 2 intensive patients are Medicare patients. And as we launch -- as we look at launching G6 into Medicare later in this year, for example, we think we have an opportunity to grow that significantly, and that's a nice opportunity for us going forward in the future. I can't tell you that the type 2 intensive patients on the system, Quentin referred to the stickiness of our Medicare patients. It's been extremely good so far.So they're getting very good outcomes, those who use it. So we're happy with it. It is a tremendous opportunity for us and I -- we look forward to for more coverage. It's a chore.Getting the insurance companies to pay more and spend more money is never simple. -- Got it. And then, you also talked about the positive results you're seeing from the predictive hypo alerts. When do you think we could see data aggregated and published around the benefits there? -- I believe, Steve, that our predictive hypo alert paper was presented at ATTD. So that's already out, the G6 system, the patients that experience less hypoglycemia with the predictive alert.And our next question comes from Suraj Kalia from Northland Securities. -- Congrats on a great quarter. So Quentin, a lot of my questions have been asked. Maybe I'll just kind of lump both my questions into one. And forgive me if you all have mentioned this on the call.What are the expectations for U.S. versus OUS contribution in FY '19? I'd love to get some perspective on how you'll see the margins for these two different buckets. I mean roughly speaking, the math tells me that roughly $400 million -- a little over $400 million would be OUS, the remaining would be U.S. Maybe you can kind of parse out for as what the -- how we should think about this? How the gross margins for the different buckets would be? And finally, this transmitter that is expected to bump up gross margins to 70% in Q4, what is the incremental gross margins contribution from this transmitter? I'd love to get some color, if possible? -- Sure. So in terms of U.S. versus OUS split, on the full year, our OUS business is expected to grow in the mid- to high-30s range, which -- the U.S. business is growing in the teens, the 20%-or-so.That's about what we've expected on the course of the full year. We haven't given specific gross margin data points on the U.S. or OUS business and we're not going to put that out there. And that shifts, honestly, quarter to quarter just based upon the mix of revenue within -- so, OUS, where you've got a direct marketing, you've got a distributor business as well.So it just fluctuates based upon the mix. But we haven't put those data points out there, nor are we going to right now. In terms of the incremental benefit associated with the transmitter, the G6 low-cost transmitter, without giving you the exact specific cost differential, we can tell you it's more than 50% cheaper than what the G6 existing transmitter is today. So in terms of orders of magnitude, I think that it's clearly a very significant benefit for us that drives the overall improvement in the gross margin in that fourth-quarter time frame we've talked about.And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin Sayer for final remarks. -- Thank you very much, and thanks everyone for being on the call today. I actually wanted to stop the call at 52% growth and $95 million-plus in incremental revenue over Q1 of last year, but we decided we would keep going. Much of the discussion around this call and recent months has focused upon 2 things: The pricing environment and anticipated competitive offerings in the space. And I think too often we forgot one thing.This market opportunity is huge. It is extremely large, not only in the intensive insulin space, but ultimately, in the type 2 space and the other areas, so we're looking at all the way down to health and wellness. We continue to see people now buying our system, getting a prescription, because they want to manage the nutrition on the side and they're paying cash and using it, but seeing some very interesting things. We truly see today when CGM, in multiple configurations and forms, becomes a very useful tool across all of healthcare and truly the standard of care in the intensive management of diabetes.With respect to pricing, our channel and payer teams are doing very well at DexCom. I talked earlier about the recent win with Cigna. We are -- we're hitting all cylinders here and that team has gone very well. Given the size of the opportunity with respect to the competitive environment, I said earlier, we didn't expect to remain the sole voice of CGM forever.We always knew others would come. An increased awareness generated by all parties move patients to the technology that best meets their needs, and that technology remains DexCom. With G6, our planned enhancements coming later this ; our next-gen G7 offering, and the technologies that will be following that, we expect to be the leader in this industry, in this the space for a very long time. Thanks again everybody and have a great day.[Operator signoff] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

The numbers are so big that investors have  that address diabetes treatment.So which diabetes stocks do our team of Motley Fool contributors have their eyes on right now? They've called out  (NASDAQ: DXCM) ,  (NASDAQ: TNDM) , and  (NYSE: MDT) .Image source: Getty Images. The expected launch of  ' (NYSE: ABT) next-generation Freestyle Libre 2.0 continuous glucose monitor (CGM) has increased worries that Dexcom's status as the  CGM player could be in jeopardy.Diabetics often rely on frequent finger sticks to determine insulin dosing, but that approach only provides point-in-time insight, so patients spend a lot of their day outside their desired range. That's a problem, because it can lead to dangerous glucose highs and lows that contribute to disease progression.To better control their disease, patients are embracing CGMs for real-time insight. Dexcom and Abbott are the biggest CGM manufacturers, and sales at both companies have been surging because of new products. Dexcom's revenue has been rising because of its G6 launch in the U.S., while Abbott's sales have benefited from the launch of the Freestyle Libre 2.0 in Europe.There's no timeline for a Freestyle Libre 2.0 approval in the U.S., but it's expected this year. When the Libre 2.0 launches, Abbott should be able to better compete against Dexcom, because the Libre 2.0 is the first Abbott system to include glucose high-and-low alarms, and its sensors last 14 days, versus 10 days for the G6. The Libre 2.0 is also expected to launch in the U.S. at a price that could undercut the G6, making it even more attractive to users.The Libre 2.0 threat shouldn't be ignored, but investors might not want to bet against Dexcom. Millions of patients can benefit from CGMs, so there's room for multiple offerings. In addition, the G6 is incorporated into Tandem Diabetes' insulin delivery system, which pairs it with a pump to deliver insulin automatically. A similar system incorporating the G6 is expected to be available from  (NASDAQ: PODD) in 2020. The G6 is also being incorporated into smart insulin devices at  and  , the two biggest insulin drugmakers.Furthermore, Dexcom's collaborating with  spinoff Verily on the G7, a cheaper solution that could help insulate it against Abbott beginning late next year.There's no telling how market share will shake out, but Dexcom reports its most recent quarterly results on May 1, so investors will want to tune in to see what it says about the competitive landscape, market share, and its progress on the G7. I worked in the diabetes industry for more than a decade, so I've been following Tandem Diabetes Care since its product first hit the market. I've been highly skeptical of the company for years, since I didn't think its product offering was different enough to set it apart in a crowded market. I even thought the company was going to have to close up shop last year, since it was running out of money and its stock price had fallen drastically.Thus far, Tandem has proved me wrong on both accounts. The company has done an  job at stealing market share from the likes of Medtronic and Insulet. What's more, the stock price has seen  ever since the company performed an incredibly dilutive common stock offering in early 2018 -- Tandem sold 34.5 million shares of stock for just $2 each, which diluted existing shareholders by several hundred percent at the time.Tandem is in a much better financial position today than it was just a year ago, and it looks poised to continued rapid growth. Management is calling for revenue growth of  39% in 2019, which is a clear sign that it expects the company to continue grabbing market share. That fact alone puts this company high on my watch list.To be clear, \"watch\" is the keyword I want to emphasize. Tandem does look poised for continued growth, but I can't help thinking Wall Street's enthusiasm for this company has gotten way ahead of the fundamentals. Shares are currently trading for more than  , a figure that's pricing in  of continued prosperity. While I'm no longer fearful about this company's ability to survive, I do question whether it can live up to the extreme optimism baked into its share price. After all, the company is still squaring off against formidable competition, its longtime CEO is stepping down, and it's still expected to post big losses both this year and next. When combined with an astronomical valuation, I can't help thinking caution is warranted.I've been dead wrong about Tandem before, and it's possible the company could go on to be a great investment from here. However, my view is that the risk/reward ratio is very unfavorable at today's prices, so I'm happy to watch this story from the safety of the sidelines. Type 1 diabetics are typically totally dependent on externally supplied insulin for their survival. Without it, their bodies can't metabolize sugar properly, and they would eventually die from the disease if left untreated.The challenge with treating diabetes with externally administered insulin, however, is that patients need to be careful how much they take and when they take it. Dosing insulin incorrectly can itself cause health problems, so vigilance is the constant refrain of Type 1 diabetics who want to live long and otherwise healthy lives.Yet while there  , there is a treatment that can help sufferers of the disease better manage their condition. It's called an insulin pump, and it can monitor diabetics' blood sugar levels and automatically provide appropriate dosages as needed. The typical insulin pump user has better A1C scores -- an important measure for how in control a diabetic's condition is -- and lower risks of complications than those that don't use the technology.When it comes to insulin pumps, Medtronic stands out as a clear winner in the space. Its pumps have been called \"probably the closest systems to artificial pancreases available on the market today.\" That leadership position gives investors reason to believe the business has staying power. The fact that its shares have drifted down over the past six months makes it worth looking at today.Thanks to that downward direction in its stock price, Medtronic can now be purchased for around 16 times the company's anticipated forward earnings. With those earnings expected to grow at around 7.8% annualized over the next five or so years, today's investors are getting an opportunity to consider buying a strong company at a reasonable valuation.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Medtronic wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ost of us would probably describe the internet as a vast network of websites, social networks, and videos that users can virtually access with computers and mobile devices.

A smart refrigerator can order food that is running low.Several of today's largest companies are now making  that can control the rest of the home's smart devices from one central location.

That said, Apple continues to believe there is a market for a smart-home speaker that prioritizes privacy and sound quality above all else. \u00a0There are many contrasting projections concerning the growth of the installed device base of the IoT over the coming years. IHS Markit, a global information provider, estimates that the total number of IoT devices will surge from 27 billion in 2017 to 125 billion by 2030. \u00a0estimates that it will be much higher by then, believing that 500 billion devices will be connected to the internet in 2030. Global consulting firm Bain believes spending on the IoT will grow to $520 billion in 2021, more than double the $235 billion that was spent in 2017.When it comes to investing, the better approach is often to be generally right than precisely wrong. In other words, the important takeaway from these statistics isn't the exact number of devices that will be connected in a certain year or the precise spending that companies will invest in this industry. Rather, the relevant fact is that the IoT is still growing by leaps and bounds, with a long runway still ahead of it.One of the biggest tailwinds for the IoT is the coming of . 5G, the fifth generation of wireless networks, will bring:By increasing wireless networks' speed and reliability, 5G will enable a whole host of applications, including , , and . This will literally increase the real-world number and use of IoT devices.The greatest risk facing the IoT is that while it is big and growing, its future growth rate remains a projection. Nothing is certain to come to pass. 5G networks might launch slower than anticipated. Fully autonomous vehicles might prove to be . Virtual reality may never see  among consumers. Industries may never find uses or ways to analyze the troves of data IoT can give them.\u00a0With all of the money pouring into the IoT in the years ahead, it's only natural for investors to wonder how to capitalize on this huge trend. While we'll discuss individual stocks shortly, there is another, easier way to attempt to profit: The . An , or exchange-traded fund, is a basket of equities that are grouped together under one trading entity.Many, as in this case, are grouped together under . The Global X IoT ETF contains large holdings in a wide range of diverse companies, including:In other words, buying this ETF can instantly diversify investors across industries, yet still be centered on the common theme of the IoT. Investing in ETFs can also be a smart way to mitigate risk through diversification as well as take advantage of macro trends without the heavy time investment that studying individual stocks involves. While this ETF could very well beat the  index in the years ahead, I believe there are still better ways for investors to profit from the Internet of Things.Data source: Google Finance.Let's take a closer look at some of these companies to see why they make such good investments today.DexCom is a health-care device company that designs and develops  (CGM) systems for diabetics. A small sensor, placed just under the skin, measures glucose levels every five minutes. An adhesive patch holds the sensor in place throughout the day. A small transmitter then sends the readings to a compatible mobile device, usually an Android or iOS smartphone. \u00a0DexCom makes sensors that provide continuous glucose monitoring for diabetics. Image source: DexCom Inc.DexCom's CGM solutions are shown to reduce users' A1C scores (a blood test that shows your average glucose levels over the past three months), reduce hypoglycemia, and provide active monitoring at night, making them an extremely attractive value proposition for diabetics. \u00a0The company expects to grow revenue by 15% annually through 2023, a reflection of its huge total addressable market and the number of patients it has yet to reach. Over the same period, it expects to grow its  from negative 3% to 15% through a variety of cost controls and the winding down of research projects. \u00a0GrubHub is the country's largest digital platform for placing restaurant take-out and delivery orders. As the devices that connect to the internet increase in number, mobile platforms for ordering delivery should only grow more ubiquitous. In addition to being a huge mobile platform, GrubHub is also one of the best ways to invest in the growing . The company finished 2018 with 17.7 million active diners, the number of unique diner accounts that have placed an order on the company's platform in the past year. During that same time, there were also 467,500 daily average grubs, or DAGs,\u00a0which the company calculates by taking the number of total orders and dividing it by the number of days in the measured period.\u00a0Both figures were up approximately 20% from 2017 totals.GrubHub is constantly working to improve its mobile interface so hungry diners can find exactly what they're looking for in a quick and seamless process. In a 2018 conference call, founder and CEO Matthew Maloney stated:\u00a0Continuous improvement of our diner-facing product remains a priority and a source of growth for us. Recently, we reengineered our mobile experience implementing a new, cleaner tile layout for restaurant search as well as improvements to navigation and a more photo-forward approach to discovery.GrubHub is also providing mobile support for many of its partners, including '\u00a0Taco Bell and KFC chains. In late 2017, the company  with the two iconic fast-food brands to become their exclusive digital online and mobile ordering platform. When asked if GrubHub would be integrating its platform with the restaurants' mobile apps as well, Maloney responded:\u00a0[W]e're powering their white label for everything. All transactions and their websites ... We are not only supporting their restaurants on our marketplaces and across our affiliate network, but we are also supporting them on all of their white label properties. We're providing order management, including pickup and delivery for KFC and Taco Bell ... It's a very close, unique partnership in the space because we're extremely aligned and both parties are agnostic to what channel the order comes in on.It doesn't take a crystal ball to see that more restaurants, especially smaller chains and stand-alone locations would want to outsource their mobile offerings to GrubHub as well. While the company faces competition from the likes of DoorDash and Uber Eats, GrubHub seems to be one of the few winners that will emerge from the pack for mobile ordering of food delivery and takeout.Mastercard and Visa sport similar , essentially collecting tiny fees for every transaction facilitated over their respective networks. While they obviously compete with each other and other credit-card networks for market share, their primary rival remains cash. Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga estimates that about 80% of the world's transactions are still facilitated with currency. \u00a0As such, trends like  have been a boon for Mastercard and Visa. Visa CFO Vasant Prabhu explained at a recent analyst conference that online purchases have been a huge boon for credit-card companies:\u00a0E-commerce is growing five times as fast as face-to-face transactions. And in an e-commerce transaction, the propensity to use a Visa card is twice as high as a face-to-face transaction. So something growing five times as fast where your propensity to be used is twice what it might have been. That's phenomenal.Mobile commerce should propel electronic forms of payment and be a boon for Mastercard and Visa. Image source: Getty Images.Not only does  continue this trend, it accelerates it. The more devices connected to the internet, the easier it will be to make electronic payments where cash was previously used. This can be done through apps, such as those hosted by Domino's and GrubHub, or even via sensors on your vehicle's gas tank that will automatically pay for the gas as you pump. As more devices come online, transactions that traditionally had to be negotiated using cash -- think parking meters, toll-booth collections, etc. -- will now be facilitated with digital payments.For those not familiar with the company, Skyworks Solutions designs analog semiconductors, a key component for any connected device to wireless networks such as LTE or Wi-Fi.\u00a0Most of Skyworks' revenue comes from smartphones, and its \u00a0by far is Apple.As the advent of 5G approaches, more devices will be connected than ever before. For payments purposes, this includes things from smartwatches that wearers can use to make purchases at stores to cars that will automatically pay the pump once the nozzle is inserted in the vehicle's gas tank. All of these devices will need to connect to a network to make the payment, and the more of these connected devices there are, the more the world will need Skyworks' chips.In a 2019\u00a0, CEO Liam Griffin specifically called out several industrial and consumer applications as catalysts for IoT device growth once 5G network coverage spreads:\u00a0With expanded 5G network capacity on the horizon, we expect 75 billion devices will be connected by 2025. That's three times today's installed base. Leveraging our leadership across all major wireless standards, including ... 4G LTE and 5G, we are well-positioned to capture a disproportionate share of this growth, particularly with the advent of autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, Industrial IoT, and frictionless commerce.Skyworks has shown a clear ability to  as smartphone architecture grows in complexity and connected devices in numbers. In the 2018 fiscal year, Skyworks' non-GAAP EPS was $7.22, more than triple its 2013 total of $2.20. That's greater than 27% annual growth over a six-year time frame. \u00a0The faster network speeds that the next generation of wireless coverage offers are essential to the growth of the IoT. While other networks have begun to  between their own infrastructure and Verizon's, I believe Verizon will deploy 5G coverage in more major domestic markets sooner than the rest. As the  between the telecom carriers really heats up, I believe Verizon's quality will, once again, clearly surpass its competitors'.\u00a0Verizon looks poised to be the first telecom carrier with nationwide 5G wireless coverage.There are several reasons I think Verizon occupies the inside lane in this race. For starters, Verizon was the first to launch a commercial 5G service. In late 2018, Verizon launched , a 5G-internet service for residences in Houston, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, and Sacramento.\u00a0This will give Verizon a head start over its rivals as it figures out the best way to install and maintain this type of service. In a recent , CFO Matt Ellis explained, \"And we've seen performance as we've expected since we started doing those installs, the technology works. Our customers are getting the experience they expected.\"In tests leading up to the 5G Home launch, Verizon engineers were pleasantly surprised by the real-world capabilities of the network. For instance, in an  with Motley Fool contributor Nicholas Rossolillo, Verizon Vice President of Network Engineering Mike Haberman stated, \"Some of the examples we use were it got higher up buildings, up to the 19th floor of buildings, when we didn't think it would reach that high. We were seeing locations 2,000 feet from the cell site and still having good speeds.\"\u00a0Verizon also has higher aspirations for its 5G networks than just faster smartphone speeds, such as its , where the company is working with specific municipalities to use the technology to solve different pain points around the city. \u00a0What might make Verizon a particularly interesting stock for some investors is that it sports a  that is consistently . For income investors looking to invest in the growing mobile payments trend, Verizon might be their best bet.Since the inception of the internet, mankind's tendency to use technology to make the world a smaller, more connected place has only accelerated. I do not think this race to connect to the world around us will slow down, much less cease, any time soon. The IoT represents one of the best ways to invest in this trend.\u00a0As you can see, there are a number of great companies to choose from that have exposure to this sector, ranging from the tech companies making the smart devices, to the makers of the components, to the providers of the services that will be offered through these devices.\u00a0These companies also encompass the different styles of investing. For , there are stocks such as Apple and Verizon that pay growing and hefty .\u00a0  might be interested in beaten-up semiconductor stocks or undervalued telecom carriers that stand to benefit from IoT's growth.  will probably be attracted to the big tech and payments companies.

After all, both the  and  indexes were down for the year. But for many medical device stocks, 2018 was a fantastic year, with at least a dozen medical device stocks racking up gains of more than 25%.\u00a0There's no way to know whether medical device stocks will perform as well in 2019 as they did last year. However, there are still quite a few stocks that should be long-term winners and have a decent shot at delivering nice gains this year. Here's what you need to know about the top medical device stocks for 2019.Image source: Getty Images.The most important thing to understand about the medical device industry is probably its product diversity. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines a medical device in broad terms. This definition includes any \"instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including a component part, or accessory\" that is used in diagnosing, curing, preventing, or treating a disease.\u00a0With a definition that expansive in scope, you'd expect that there would be a lot of companies making medical devices. And you'd be right. There are around 5,500 medical device companies in the U.S. alone, making products that range from artificial joints to bedpans to robotic surgical systems.Some of these medical device companies are large and very profitable. However, over 70% of these companies have fewer than 20 employees. Many of them are still in the development stage and have no consistent revenue.The competitive dynamics for these companies vary greatly depending on the type of product they make. Simple medical devices such as surgical supplies tend to compete primarily on price and typically have low profit margins. On the other hand, medical devices that use advanced technology often have little competition, can be very expensive, and in turn generate high profit margins.All medical devices in the U.S. are regulated by the FDA. The agency places a medical device into one of three classes:Data source: FDA.\u00a0\u00a0The regulatory hurdles that a medical device company must clear depends on the class its medical device is assigned to. Class I devices usually only require registering with the FDA, and there's no approval process. For a small number of Class I devices, though, a regulatory filing called a 510(k) notification must be submitted to the FDA. This filing shows the FDA that the medical device is at least as safe and effective as an already-approved product that didn't require more extensive approval.It's the opposite scenario for Class II devices. Just a few get by through only registering with the FDA, while most require the filing of a 510(k) notification.The regulatory process for Class III devices is more involved. Companies must submit a premarket approval (PMA) application to the FDA, with clinical data that shows the medical device is safe and effective. The FDA reviews these PMA applications closely, and sometimes enlists the help of outside experts in the review process. Class III medical devices can only be marketed after receiving FDA approval.\u00a0\u00a0The medical device industry should benefit from aging demographic trends for years to come. An aging population translates to more cases of chronic disease and a greater demand for all types of medical devices. In addition, the emergence of larger middle classes in developing nations should increase opportunities for some segments within the medical device industry.Overall, the global medical device market is projected to grow by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.5% through 2023 to $409.5 billion, according to market researcher Lucintel.However, medical devices that use advanced technology should grow even more. The global high-tech medical device market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 29.2% through 2026 to reach $252 billion, according to Research and Markets. This rapid growth is expected to be bolstered by emerging technologies such as the  (IoT) -- the connection of all types of devices to the Internet\u00a0for the purpose of collecting data, tracking usage, and automating systems. \u00a0There are three primary things you should evaluate before buying a medical device stock:The most important aspect of a medical device company's financial position to consider is its profitability. Many up-and-coming medical device makers don't yet have profitable operations. As a result, they must raise the capital needed to fund operations, typically through either borrowing money or by issuing new shares -- both of which can have negative consequences.When a company takes on additional debt, its interest expenses increase. This reduces the amount of money available to spend in other areas like reinvesting in the business. Issuing new shares\u00a0\u00a0the value of existing shares. The company's total value doesn't change when more shares are issued, so dividing that value into more shares makes each share worth less.Another key component of a medical device maker's financial position is its available cash, including cash equivalents and short-term investments. For companies that aren't yet profitable, the amount of cash available is directly related to how long it will be before additional capital must be raised through debt or issuing new shares. For profitable companies, the cash stockpile is important in providing flexibility for expanding through acquisitions or other business development deals.Over the long term, competitive advantages will matter even more than a company's current financial position. When evaluating a medical device stock, research how its products compare to that of its competitors. The stocks of companies with medical devices that offer significantly more functionality than rivals or provide significant total cost advantages over rivals are more likely to be successful.It's possible that a medical device company has a strong financial position and solid competitive advantages but weak growth potential. How? Some medical devices can have a small total addressable market or a market that is already saturated with little room for additional growth. Check out the potential markets for a medical device stock before buying to make sure that there's plenty of room for long-term growth.The top medical device stocks for 2019 illustrate the diversity of the medical device industry, with products as simple as clear plastic aligners for straightening teeth to robotic-assisted surgical systems. But these stocks have two key things in common. They all have solid competitive advantages. And they all have exceptional growth prospects.Here are five top medical devices stocks to consider buying in 2019:\u00a0Data sources: Yahoo! Finance, company presentations.Abiomed focuses on medical devices for treating cardiovascular diseases. Around 25,000 of its Impella heart pumps are implanted in patients annually. The company celebrated its 100,000th patient in the fourth quarter of 2018.\u00a0Revenue has more than tripled since 2014. Abiomed , calling for a revenue increase this year of around 31%. And its earnings per share are growing even faster.\u00a0All of this has put Abiomed in an enviable financial position. The company reported cash of around $450 million in its latest quarterly update and the company has zero debt.Abiomed created the field of heart recovery using temporary heart pumps. The company really doesn't have a direct competitor in this market. That's the kind of competitive advantage that investors love.\u00a0The growth prospects for Abiomed continue to look very good. Abiomed estimates that its current total addressable market in the U.S. is around $6 billion annually. It has only penetrated 11% of that market so far but expects to capture all of it. Outside of the U.S., Abiomed has penetrated 17% of the total addressable market in Germany and 1% in Japan. And these markets continue to grow as the country's populations age.\u00a0Align Technology's flagship product is the Invisalign clear dental aligner. The company also sells iTero intraoral scanners that dental professionals use to create 3D images of patients' teeth, which are then used to development Invisalign treatment plans.Strong revenue and earnings growth has been a common theme in Align's quarterly updates, although its earnings growth trajectory . The company continues to be highly profitable and has amassed a cash stockpile of $744.5 million, including cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.Align pioneered the use of clear aligners for straightening teeth. The company continues to develop new products to treat more serious cases of malocclusion (misalignment of teeth). Align has also created a strong network of orthodontists and dentists who\u00a0recommend Invisalign to their patients.While some competitors have entered the clear aligner market, Align Technology . Actually, the company owns a significant stake in one of its top rivals in the direct-to-consumer market, SmileDirectClub.Even though Align has been tremendously successful, there remains a huge untapped market. The company currently claims a market share of only 14% of the current addressable market. With new products on the way to treat more difficult cases, Align should be able to expand its addressable market significantly as well.DexCom focuses on developing and marketing continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems for individuals with diabetes. The company has been a leader in the CGM market for several years.Sales have soared for DexCom, with an impressive CAGR of 44% from 2011 through 2018. The company reached profitability in 2018 and appears likely to keep the earnings flowing. DexCom also has plenty of cash on hand, reporting cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling nearly $1.4 billion as of Dec. 31, 2018.DexCom's latest CGM system, the G6, enjoys several competitive advantages over rival products. G6 is the only system that meets all of the FDA's integrated CGM special controls for accuracy in determining glucose levels. It's the first CGM that doesn't not require any finger sticks -- a huge plus for patients with diabetes. The system also integrates with leading insulin pumps, smart insulin pens, and insulin patch pumps.The market potential for DexCom is huge. DexCom has plenty of room to grow by focusing on its core patient population in the U.S. of 3.2 million individuals who require continuous glucose monitoring. However, there are an estimated 415 million people with diabetes worldwide. Only 6% of them achieve their desired outcomes, presenting a large potential opportunity for DexCom.\u00a0The company also has an even more advanced product on the way -- the G7. This CGM system will be fully disposable and cost-effective for patients and payers. DexCom CEO Kevin Sayer said in  that the G7 is on track to launch in late 2020 or early 2021.\u00a0Intuitive Surgical pioneered the use of robotic surgical systems with its da Vinci system. More than 6 million procedures have been performed using the da Vinci, with around 1 million of those procedures occurring just last year.\u00a0The company is in great financial shape. Intuitive's revenue jumped nearly 19% last year to $3.7 billion, while earnings soared 68% year over year to more than $1.1 billion. The company ended 2018 with a cash stockpile of $4.8 billion.\u00a0Intuitive Surgical enjoys a couple of significant competitive advantages. First, it has a large base of customers who are motivated to maximize their return on investment with da Vinci rather than look for a new system. Second, the handful of companies with products that could potentially challenge Intuitive don't have the long track record that da Vinci has. CEO Gary Guthart noted in\u00a0\u00a0that there have been nearly 1,500 peer-reviewed clinical journal articles for the da Vinci system.But can Intuitive Surgical continue to generate strong growth? It seems likely. Many surgical procedures still have way too many complications resulting from differences in the skill of surgeons. Robotic surgical systems like da Vinci help reduce these issues. The \u00a0also should increase the numbers of procedures performed in the types of surgeries for which da Vinci is most used.Also, Intuitive Surgical is investing heavily in research and development. The company's latest system, ION, enables lung biopsy using minimally invasive robotic technology. Investors can expect more advances from Intuitive in the future.\u00a0Like DexCom, Tandem Diabetes Care focuses squarely on the diabetes market. Instead of CGM systems, though, Tandem develops and sells insulin pumps.Tandem's sales have been growing at a phenomenal rate, jumping 71% in 2018. And the company posted a profit for the first time in the fourth quarter of 2018. As of Dec. 31, 2018, Tandem had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $129 million.\u00a0While there are other insulin pumps on the market, Tandem's newest product, the t:slim X2, has several competitive advantages. For one thing, it integrates with DexCom's G6 CGM system. It also is the smallest insulin pump on the market, which makes it more convenient for users to wear. Also, the pump's Basal-IQ technology helps predict when insulin levels are about to move outside of thresholds before they do.\u00a0Tandem has a big growth opportunity in the U.S. The company thinks that it will be able to increase the number of Americans with diabetes who use insulin pumps from around 550,000 to 900,000. Tandem also is targeting another 3 million people with type 1 diabetes who live outside the U.S.\u00a0The greatest risk for these medical device stocks is the threat of competition. The medical device industry is constantly changing, with new and improved technology regularly introduced.Align Technology and Intuitive Surgical enjoyed virtual monopolies for several years, but now both companies face new rivals. The other companies are also likely to see stiffer competition in the future.Several of the companies also could be hurt if global trade issues aren't resolved. In particular, U.S.-China trade tensions could present challenges for medical device companies that either already have a presence in China or hope to establish operations there.There's also a risk that new products in development could fail to secure FDA approval or encounter delays in receiving clearance for marketing, as well as the risk for product liability lawsuits and legal action if any of the medical devices turn out to be less safe than once thought.Despite these risks, the future appears to be bright for the medical device industry -- and particularly for companies with high-tech medical devices. Abiomed, Align Technology, DexCom, Intuitive Surgical, and Tandem Diabetes Care should be in great shape to succeed in 2019 and beyond.\u00a0When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In 2019, sales could be harder to come by, though, according to short-seller Spruce Point Capital Management. In a report released last month, Spruce Point said the launch of  ' (NYSE: ABT) next-generation Freestyle Libre CGM and a maturing market among type 1 patients could cause DexCom to lose significant value.Currently, DexCom competes against  's Guardian brand of CGMs and the first-generation Freestyle Libre, a CGM that, unlike DexCom's G6, still requires patients to prick their fingers during the first 11 hours of wear to confirm readings -- and doesn't include blood glucose high and low alarms.Abbott's already next-generation finger-stick-less Freestyle Libre has launched overseas, and while there's no timeline for a potential launch in the U.S., an eventual release could challenge DexCom because G6 sensors are approved for only 10 days of wear, while Freestyle Libre's sensors can be worn for 14 days.

Abbott's shares jumped 27%, while DexCom stock more than doubled. It's a different story so far this year, though. Both medical device stocks lag well behind the .Investors shouldn't give up on either of these stocks because they've underperformed over a short period. Both Abbott and DexCom should have solid long-term growth prospects. But which stock is the better pick right now? Here's how Abbott and DexCom compare in three key areas.Image source: Getty Images.DexCom is the hands-down winner when it comes to recent growth rates. The company's revenue soared 52% year over year to $280.5 million in the first quarter of 2019. That makes Abbott's  look puny by comparison.\u00a0\u00a0Wall Street definitely views DexCom as having better growth prospects. Analysts project average annual earnings growth of 140% over the next five years compared to growth of close to 12% for Abbott during the same period.\u00a0It's important to note, though, that Abbott's product lineup is much more diversified than DexCom's. Abbott claims four multibillion-dollar business segments: diagnostics, established pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and nutrition. Each of these segments markets a wide lineup of products. DexCom makes nearly all of its money from its G6 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system.\u00a0DexCom's reliance on the G6 system arguably makes its growth prospects riskier than Abbott's. Spruce Point Capital Management analyst Ben Axler  when Abbott launches its second-generation Freestyle Libre CGM system. Although the G6 system will still offer more features than the new Freestyle Libre, Abbott is expected to price its system around 80% below the G6 price.\u00a0On the other hand, Freestyle Libre should continue to fuel growth for Abbott. The big healthcare company should also benefit from several other new products, including its HeartMate 3\u00a0left ventricular assist device. It should also see higher sales from MitraClip's new indication in treating\u00a0secondary mitral regurgitation, a leaky heart valve resulting from advanced heart failure.There's no contest as to which stock has the better dividend, because DexCom doesn't pay a dividend while Abbott does.Abbott's  currently stands at a respectable 1.61%. What's more impressive is the company's commitment to its dividend program. Abbott recently declared its 381st consecutive quarterly dividend. The company is a member of the elite group known as  and has increased its dividend payout for 47 years in a row.Neither of these stocks looks cheap right now. Abbott Labs' shares trade at 21 times expected earnings. But DexCom's forward earnings multiple of 101 would probably be viewed by most investors as astronomical.However, we do need to factor growth prospects into the valuations of these stocks. Remember that Wall Street has much loftier expectations for DexCom's growth than it does for Abbott. As a result, DexCom's  of 1.1 makes its stock appear to be more attractively valued than Abbott, which has a PEG ratio nearly twice as high.\u00a0I like both of these stocks. Which is the better pick? I hate to equivocate, but that's what I'm going to do.Abbott Labs is by far the better choice for conservative investors. The company is about as steady as they come. It pays a great dividend. And Abbott has solid long-term growth prospects.\u00a0If you're looking for more aggressive growth, though, DexCom will probably be a better fit. Although it's possible that Abbott's new Freestyle Libre CGM could hamper growth for DexCom's G6, I think the market is big enough for both products. I'm also bullish about DexCom's long-term prospects with its more advanced (and less expensive) G7 system likely on the way by late next year.\u00a0\u00a0When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $105.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $103.80 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of DXCM, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $118.63/share today.\n\nBecause the $105.00 strike represents an approximate 11% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 86%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .

If an investor was to purchase shares of DXCM stock at the current price level of $118.63/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $120.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.03% if the stock gets called away at the April 18th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if DXCM shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for DexCom Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing DXCM's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $120.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $120.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

Management at BD claims to have evidence from seven separate studies that successfully demonstrated the safety and efficacy of these products.This apart, BD has analyzed and reviewed all available data about the LUTONIX DCB over the past several months, all of which had favorable outcomes. | BD conducted a LEVANT 2 study to evaluate the possibilities of the long-term mortality risks of LUTONIX DCB. The study enrolled 1,189 patients - a sample that is significantly more than the pooled dataset by the FDA. BD confirmed that the company did not witness any abnormalities or an indication of long-term mortality in this large patient cohort.Interestingly, the FDA has accepted that the underlying cause pertaining to the increased risk of mortality for LUTONIX DCB is yet to be decoded.

A little fear went a long way on Friday, exacerbated by Thursday's surprisingly big advance. When all was said and done, the  lost 1.9% on the last trading day of last week. Yet, it's still above all the key moving average lines. Assume nothing.The action at the CBOE left little to discuss. The single-session equity put/call volume ratio remained at 0.59 while the 10-day moving average slipped to 0.62. (NYSE:  ) did the most damage, losing more than 6% following reports that it was  . Though not likely, any discovery of issues could lead to penalties.  (NASDAQ:  ) logged a much bigger loss though, off more than 9% after analysts with Spruce Point suggests  as competition within the glucose monitoring system market heats up. (NYSE:  ) tried to resist the tide, advancing 2.5% as investors get fired up over its brewing rollout of 5G connectivity.There weren't enough names like Verizon to keep the broad market even close to a breakeven on Friday, however.As the new trading week kicks off, it's the stock charts of  (NYSE  ),  (NYSE:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) that are worth some technical scrutiny. Here's why, and what to look for.It has been a good run. Philip Morris International shares are up more than 28% from their December low. But the weight of the big gain is starting to bear down on the stock, and it's doing so at the point that's most opportune for the bears.A pullback wouldn't necessarily have to be a permanent condition though, and it's pretty clear where the bulls would regroup if PM shares suffer the setback being flagged here.Click to Enlarge \u2022 The make-or-break ceiling is around $92.80, where the stock peaked last week but also peaked in October.\u2022 Zooming out to the weekly chart, we can see shares are stochastically overbought and ripe for profit-taking.\u2022 While a setback may be in the works, the convergence of the purple 50-day, the gray 100-day and the white 200-day moving average line could readily combine to act as a floor.For the past several months, the bears have been trying to upend Twitter but have been unable to do it. That has given the stock time to regroup, and even move into a position to stage a full recovery. That's not happened yet, but one or two more good days could do the trick. And, that effort is taking shape with a very encouraging backdrop.Click to Enlarge \u2022 The foundation for the renewed bullish effort is the support supplied at $26.30, where shares made a double bottom in the latter part of last year.\u2022 But the big buy trigger here is a move above the white 200-day moving average line and above the falling resistance lines that has tagged all the major peals since December. It's plotted in yellow on both stock charts.\u2022 Fanning the bullish flames - at least partially - is the big bearish gap left behind in July. The upper edge of the gap range is just above the $42 mark.Finally,  UnitedHealth Group gave a second - and pretty decisive - selloff that largely confirmed a major downturn was in the works. That panned out as expected, with UNH stock making a few more days of selling.The bulls did push back, but that effort crumbled and turned back into a downtrend right where one would expect. The renewal of the downtrend at the ideal ceiling sets up a third bearish leg that could end up turning into a bigger selloff than the last couple of setbacks have been.Click to Enlarge \u2022 The rally effort was stopped and reversed just as the white 200-day moving average line was bumped. That reversal is highlighted on the daily chart.\u2022 The big floor from here is around $235, in line with the past two major bottoms UNH has made. That support is plotted with a red dashed line.\u2022 The weekly chart puts things in perspective. The three-year advance was amazing, but arguably overcooked. A little more weakness could easily turn into a lot of profit-taking.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Chicago, IL - March 22, 2019 -  DexCom  as the Bull of the Day, comScore  as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Lululemon  , Nike  and Under Armour  .Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: : is a $13 billion med-tech developer of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems for people with diabetes. DXCM became a Zacks #2 Rank after a strong beat and raise quarter reported on 2/21.DexCom delivered Q4 adjusted EPS of 54 cents vs the consensus of 17-c for a giant 217% beat. And Q4 revenues of $338 million beat the consensus view of $307.5 million by a healthy 10%. Much of the good news was baked in as the company had preannounced the coming strong results. But they even beat those numbers.As you probably know, diabetes patients must stick their finger several times per day to monitor their blood sugar. Dexcom is changing that with a device called a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). These devices track glucose levels throughout the day rather than rely on bloody finger sticks and test strips.And this, as you might guess, gives patients and their care providers more accurate data to measure and understand daily ebbs and flows in blood glucose levels.In February, DexCom received Health Canada approval for its G6 CGM System. Dexcom announced that the Health Canada thumbs up for its next generation CGM system was for people with diabetes ages two years and up. It was previously introduced into the U.S, U.K., Ireland, and several other European countries and has seen strong sales so the G6 commercial launch in Canada, planned for late 2019, is much anticipated.Here were analyst reactions to DexCom's Feb 21 report after the company offered 2019 revenue guidance of $1.175 billion to $1.225 billion, representing 19% growth over last year, and gross profit margin of approximately 65%...Cowen & Co: Analyst Doug Schenkel raised his price target on DexCom to $175 from $150 following its \"blowout\" Q4 results. The analyst believes its guidance leaves plenty of room for top and bottom line upside, though he admits a new competitor product could provide headline risk. He views the shares as a long-term core holding. Schenkel reiterated his Outperform rating on DexCom shares.Canaccord Genuity: Analyst Kyle Rose raised his price target on DexCom to $160 from $140 following its strong Q4 results. The analyst expects its exceptional growth to continue, supported by strong growth in sensor volumes, continued worldwide adoption of CGM, and the ongoing launch of G6, which is just now moving into additional territories and Medicare. Rose views DexCom as one of the best pure growth assets across the med-tech space.Piper Jaffray: Analyst JP McKim told investors in a research note that he believes DexCom is positioning itself for the next $1B in sales to be \"solid, profitable growth.\" The restructuring allows the company to scale quicker and at a lower cost over the longer term, McKim says. He reiterated an Overweight rating on DexCom with a $165 price target.Oppenheimer analysts raised their 2019 sales estimate to $1.22 billion from $1.13 billion, with US growth in the mid-teens and elsewhere up ~30%. Their EPS projection rose to $0.59 from $0.25 on solid operating leverage and their price target goes to $167 from $150.Leerink Swann analysts explained why DXCM could continue to commance a premium valuation. Their $170 price target applies a ~9.5X price-to-sales multiple to their $1.512 billion 2020 revenue estimate. DXCM shares currently trade at about 10X their $1.22 bilion 2019 sales estimate, which is a premium to comparable small-cap MedTech companies. : is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and checks in with an F for the Value Style Score and a D for the Growth Style Score. The company posted a beat of the Zacks Consensus Estimate on February 28, but it is now the Bear of the Day. Let's take a look at why that is the case.comScore, Inc. is a global leader in measuring the digital world. This capability is based on a massive, global cross-section of more than two million consumers who have given comScore permission to confidentially capture their browsing and transaction behavior, including online and offline purchasing. comScore panelists also participate in survey research that captures and integrates their attitudes and intentions.Through its proprietary technology, comScore measures what matters across a broad spectrum of behavior and attitudes. comScore analysts apply this deep knowledge of customers and competitors to help clients design powerful marketing strategies and tactics that deliver superior ROI. comScore services are used by global leaders such as AOL, Microsoft, Yahoo!, Verizon, Best Buy, The Newspaper Association of America, Tribune Interactive, ESPN, Fox Sports, Nestle, MBNA, Starcom USA, Universal McCann, the United States Postal Service, Merck and Expedia.Although the chart show that SCOR bea  , I see other data that suggest that SCOR missed in a big way. I see a loss of $0.46 compared to an expected loss of $0.21 on the bottom line.Revenue of $109M was good for 6% growth and topped the $104.8M estimate.Prior to this report, Zacks shows that SCOR missed the prior three quarter with an average negative earnings surprise of 52%.The estimate data on the detailed estimate page is not fully functioning at the moment, but I do see that there were negative revisions over the last 30 and 60 days.If you look at the agreement section, you can see there were negative earnings estimate revisions for this quarter, next quarter and for the full year.Without a positive earnings number, there is no PE, but I do see a 2.3x book multiple which is where value players should be happy. They tend to like a book multiple below 3x. A price to sales multiple of 3x is fairly rich considering the low growth profile.Margins are negative, but they are moving in the right direction. That said, SCOR will likely not post positive earnings this year or next.Lululemon shares popped over 3% Thursday heading into the release of its fourth quarter financial results, as part of its larger 2019 climb. The yoga apparel and athleisure giant's bottom-line looks set to surge as it expands its menswear business, its global reach, and more.Barclays analysts earlier this week elaborated on why they are high on Lululemon as it tries to grab market share from Nike and Under Armour-which has struggled to roll out compelling athleisure offerings. The firm currently has an \"overweight\" rating on Lululemon stock and a $200 a share price target, which represents roughly 39% upside compared to LULU's $144.35 a share closing price on Wednesday. Analyst Matthew McClintock  that Canadian company \"has a significantly larger [total addressable market] than even the most optimistic estimates likely expect.\"\"We continue to believe Lululemon's [total addressable market] is ever-expanding as the company has entered into men's in a meaningful way, has seen success in office, travel [and] commute offerings and continues to see a significant amount of opportunity in bras and outerwear.\"As the Barclays analyst mentioned, the firm has expanded far beyond its original women's yoga apparel in recent years. Lululemon currently sells men's and women's jackets for as much as $600 as it tries to compete against other higher-end brands.Lululemon now boasts a lineup of outwear, shoes, accessories, as well as more work-appropriate and fashion-focused offerings for both men and women-which will likely become a key growth area for LULU as companies around the country relax their dress codes. Earlier this month, Lululemon also signed NFL quarterback Nick Foles as its first men's ambassador in an effort to attract consumers away from more traditional sportswear brands.The company closed Q3 with 426 stores around the world. Investors should also note that LULU's e-commerce comps surged 46%. Going forward, the company's ability to expand its digital commerce business will likely become even more important in the internet-crazed retail age. This expansion includes the firm's presence across social media outlets, where brands are now built from scratch and consumers shop directly.As we alluded to at the top, shares of Lululemon have jumped over 22% this year to outpace the S&P 500's 13% climb, its industry's 18% average, and Nike. LULU stock rested up 3.10% through mid-afternoon trading Thursday at $148.82 a share. This marked a roughly 10% downturn from its 52-week high of $164.79 a share, which gives the stock some room to run.Before we look at what to expect from LULU's Q4 financial results, it is worth noting that company management raised its quarterly guidance earlier this year on the back of strong holiday period sales. The Vancouver, Canada-based firm upped its guidance based on total comparable sales growth in the mid-to-high teens, up from high-single to low-double digits comps expansion.With that said, Lululemon's Q4 revenues are projected to jump 23.7% to reach $1.15 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimate. This would top Q3's 21% top-line growth. Meanwhile, the firm's full-year revenues are projected to surge roughly 26% from fiscal 2017's $2.65 billion to reach $3.27 billion. Last year, total full-year revenue popped just 13%.Moving on, Lululemon is projected to see its adjusted Q4 earnings soar 30.8% to touch $1.74 a share. Plus, the athletic apparel company's full-year EPS figure is expected to surge 44.4% to reach $3.74 a share. We should also note that LULU has seen some positive earnings estimate revision activity recently.Lululemon is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) based, in part, on its recent earnings estimate revision activity. The company also boasts an \"A\" grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. And Lululemon executives have reaffirmed its goal to reach $4 billion in revenue by 2020, which includes hitting $1 billion in menswear sales.LULU is scheduled to release its Q4 and full-year 2018 financial after the closing bell on Wednesday, March 27.In addition to the stocks discussed above, wouldn't you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-holds for the year?From more than 4,000 companies covered by the Zacks Rank, these 10 were picked by a process that consistently beats the market.

Now, it is trying to leverage on the chronic diseases and the current development of the Chinese healthcare market. Precisely, Fresenius Medical is expected to form a network of more than 100 clinics and invest in home dialysis in China during the upcoming years.The company's focus is also likely to be on the Indian market, where it has just launched the 4008A machine.For 2019, Fresenius Medical expects adjusted revenue growth of 3-7%.

Notably, Fresenius Medical witnessed solid growth in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions. Its recent buyouts of Sound Physicians and NxStage Medical are added positives.Nonetheless, Fresenius Medical has numerous competitors in the field of health care services as well as the sale of dialysis products. Tough competition in the niche markets is likely to impede the company's sales opportunities and lose market share. However, per management, concerns that arise due to competition represent low risk for the company in the short-term as well as in the mid-term.

The stock was down about 8% as of 3:14 p.m. EDT.The drop is directly traceable to a bearish report that was released today by an analyst named Ben Axler, at a hedge fund named Spruce Point Capital Management. Axler published a report stating that DexCom's stock could be cut in half from today's levels.Image source: Getty Images.Here are the key points of his argument:Traders are selling off DexCom's stock in response.Bearish analys  s should always be viewed with skepticism when the author is short the security prior to publication. That's certainly true of this report as Axler and/or Spruce Point Capital Management are currently short shares of DexCom.That doesn't mean that this report should be dismissed, as it does raise some valid points. Abbott is a huge medical device company with vast resources, and its new FreeStyle Libre looks quite compelling. It could be a serious contender considering that it will be priced at a substantial discount to DexCom's products. That premium might not matter much to patients who are on intensive insulin therapy and demand the very best, but it will likely be a  selling point for patients who require less-intensive forms of therapy and are price sensitive.On the flip side, DexCom hasn't slowed down at all since the FreeStyle Libre was launched a few years ago, so it is possible that the updated version won't impact its growth rates, either. It is also worth noting that DexCom management is on record stating that it will pull in between  in total revenue by 2023. They knew that the next-generation FreeStyle Libre was waiting in the wings when they made that forecast, so they didn't think it will hamper their growth.My view is that total diabetes pie is  to support multiple winners, so I don't think DexCom's bulls need to panic. But there's no doubt that the competition in the space is heating up.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That realization initially tanked Apple stock, which dropped nearly 40% between early October and late December. Of late, however, investors have become more comfortable with that pivot: AAPL stock already has gained nearly 20% so far in 2019. Source: ShutterstockThe bull case for Apple stock, as Luke Lango argued this month, is that  . With Apple stock still cheap (it trades at less than 15x forward earnings), even modest growth is enough.Add in the fact that Apple still has more cash on its balance sheet  , and it doesn't take smashing success for AAPL to move higher.The bear case, which I laid out in detail last year, is that the iPhone  . The product still drives 60% of revenue. And with Apple's market capitalization nearly $900 billion, what would be a hit for another company barely moves the needle for Apple.The Apple Watch is an interesting microcosm of that bull/bear debate. And news this week of a landmark study involving the product adds an intriguing layer to the argument.From one standpoint, the Apple Watch could be a key part of the transformation of Apple and AAPL stock. From another, it hardly matters at all.On Monday, researchers from Apple and Stanford Medicine released  involving the Apple Watch. Some 419,000 subjects participated over eight months. Those individuals wore the target smartwatches with the capability to detect abnormal heartbeats.The results aren't conclusive. Roughly 0.5% of the participants received notice of an irregular pattern. Unsurprisingly, the rate was higher in older patients.Of those who received a notice, only about 20% followed up by wearing a patch to confirm the diagnosis. Of that group, 34% received a confirmed diagnosis. But in a smaller group of subjects who wore both a patch and the Apple Watch, 84% of atrial fibrillation cases detected by the path were also picked up by the Watch.On the whole, the study does seem like good news for Apple (and for patients). There are concerns about false positives from the technology. However, the innovation is constantly improving and will benefit from further tweaking. As one cardiologist told  , the results were \"moderately good for a screening tool, but not amazing.\" That description could change over time, and more studies should give a better understanding of just how effective the Apple Watch is.The study doesn't prove that the Apple Watch can be a successful cardiac screening tool, at least not yet. A two-in-three false positive rate might be too problematic for some (or most) doctors. But at the least, the study does show that Apple might be on the right path in terms of developing life-saving - and profitable - technology.From an investment standpoint, the question is whether even success here is enough. Again, this is a nearly $900 billion company.  (NYSE:  ), whose smartwatch category the Apple Watch has taken over, has an enterprise value well under $1 billion.Apple hasn't broken out its smartwatch revenue. But sales of \"other products\" - including Apple Watch, AirPods, Apple TV, Beats and other smaller lines - in fiscal year 2018 were $17.4 billion, according to  . CFO Luca Maestri last year said AirPods and Apple Watch combined were  in revenue.That's a big number. But the revenue from other products (now called \"Wearables, Home and Accessories\") still is about 7% of trailing-twelve-month revenue after driving 8.7% of first-quarter sales. Assuming its smartwatch revenue is $7-8 billion (roughly half of that category), it still drives  3% of total corporate revenue. Even modest declines in iPhone revenue will more than offset growth in the Apple Watch.So it's easy perhaps to argue that the smartwatch division simply isn't enough. But where the story gets interesting is not just in hardware sales, but how the company can monetize the services side of the product. Healthcare giant  (NYSE:  ) is joining in the next controlled study of the Apple Watch. And the product itself could be the tip of the spear in the company's healthcare strategy.Back in January, Dana Blankenhorn  and the ways in which AAPL stock could profit from healthcare services. Monitoring revenues could be large.  (NASDAQ:  ) is a $13 billion company built off the back of a continuous glucose monitoring system for diabetes. Other tech giants, including  (NASDAQ:  , NASDAQ:  ), are looking to profit from the intersection of medicine and technology. However, the Apple Watch puts the company into millions of homes, a huge head start.I still question whether it's enough. Even the development of a DexCom-sized business adds less than 2% to Apple's market capitalization. But combined with efforts elsewhere in services, in content, and through share buybacks, there's an argument that Apple can keep profits intact in the near-term before eventually driving growth again.That's the strategy needed to keep AAPL stock moving higher, particularly with the year-to-date rally. How investors view the potential of the Apple Watch given recent developments might show how they will view the possibilities of Apple's larger pivot away from its reliance on hardware \u2026 and just how successful that strategy is going to be.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n Mar 18, we issued an updated research report on  . A strong fourth-quarter show and solid prospects in Europe currently favor the stock. On the contrary, trade-related uncertainties plague this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.In the recently-reported fourth quarter of 2018, Inogen posted earnings of 44 cents per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents. The bottom line improved from a net loss of 3 cents in the year-ago quarter.Revenues came in at $86.5 million, which trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $82 million. On a year-over-year basis, the top line climbed 35.7%.Reflective of this, Inogen retained its revenue and EBITDA outlook for 2019.Notably, the company continues to expect revenues between $430 million and $440 million, representing 20.1-22.9% growth over 2018.Full-year adjusted EBITDA is projected between $67 million and $71 million, representing 9.3-15.9% growth year over year.Moreover, Inogen is optimistic about its prospects in Europe.In the fourth quarter of 2018, Inogen's business-to-business unit saw international revenues of $18.5 million, up 54.5% year over year on continued adoption by the company's European partners. Per management, Europe sales represented 87.8% of fourth-quarter international sales.Despite a better-than-expected fourth quarter, Inogen trimmed its 2019 net income guidance range to $40-$44 million from the previously-issued $48-$52 million. Per management, the slashed guidance is due to a fall in estimated provision for income taxes related to excess tax benefits recognized from stock-based compensation.Additionally, the company's guidance assumes a full impact of the tariffs on applicable Chinese sourced materials since the increase of China import tax has been currently delayed by the United States, giving rise to trade-related uncertainties.Over the past year, shares of Inogen have declined 23.5% against the  's 9.8% gain. The current level is also lower than the S&P 500 index's 4.3% rally.A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Penumbra, Inc.  , Wright Medical Group N.V.  and DexCom. Inc.  . Notably, each of these stocks currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .Penumbra's long-term earnings growth rate is expected at 20.9%.Wright Medical's long-term earnings growth rate is estimated at 11.3%.DexCom's next-quarter earnings per share are projected to grow 120%.In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-holds for the year?Who wouldn't?

The company issued an impressive guidance for 2019. However, intensifying competition and integration risks are primary headwinds for the company as of now.In a year's time, the stock has gained 31.1% compared with the  's 5.7% growth. Moreover, the company has an interesting earnings surprise history, having outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average being 0.5%. Notably, this trend of consecutive beats underlines the company's operating efficiency.So let us take a quick look at the primary factors plaguing this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company and discuss the prospects that ensure near-term recovery.Ecolab operates in highly competitive markets. Notably, the company faces competition from bigwigs like P&G, Unilever, PuroClean and ChemStation. The company's U.S. Cleaning & Sanitizing and International divisions face stiff competition from Clorox and Church & Dwight.Ecolab issued an impressive guidance for 2019.Notably, the company expects 2019 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.80 to $6.00, rising 10-14% from the 2018 figure.Adjusted tax rate is expected to be 20-21%.For the first quarter of 2019, adjusted EPS is projected between 98 cents and $1.06, reflecting year-over-year growth of 8-16%.Ecolab recently announced an efficiency program that will generate $325 million of run rate savings by 2021. Earlier, the company predicted it to be $200 million. These additional savings are likely to have a strong impact on 2019, 2020 and 2021 results.For boosting its G&A solutions, Ecolab will be strengthening its Workday and SAP platforms by consolidating systems, back offices and third-party vendors.The company has major launches underway. Ecolab also continues to invest significantly in customer-facing technology and infrastructure technology.The company's new Health Department Intelligence (HDI) platform also helps foodservice operators better understand their health inspection results, improve health inspection performance and better manage food safety risks across multiple sites.In recent times, Ecolab launched a Life Sciences cleanroom program in North America, developed specially for pharmaceutical manufacturing. The program provides comprehensive cleaning and disinfection for both sterile and non-sterile applications.Ecolab has been gaining traction in digital technology markets also. The company expects to invest largely in the coming quarters to enhance its digital portfolio. New customer-digital programs like SMARTPOWER, 3D CIP, 3D TRASAR, new QSR and FRS digital safety platforms continue to improve field efficiency, customer service and capability. Per management, new additions to its portfolio will help Ecolab reach its mid-teens EPS growth goal beyond 2019.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2019 earnings is pegged at $1.02, reflecting year-over-year increase of 12.1%. The same for revenues stands at $3.57 billion, indicating 12.6% rise.For 2019, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is at $5.91, reflecting rise of 13%. The same for revenues stands at $15.46 billion, indicating 5.4% rise. | Despite cutthroat competition in the niche markets, Ecolab seems to be positioned for growth on strong guidance and solid product portfolio. The company's long-term earnings growth rate of 12.6% also supports this view.A few better-ranked stocks from the MedTech space are DexCom, Inc.  , Varian Medical Systems, Inc.  and Masimo Corp.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see DexCom delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 132.3%.Varian Medical has long-term earnings growth rate of 8%.Masimo Corporation has long-term earnings growth rate of 15.6%.The biotech sector is projected to surge beyond $775 billion by 2024 as scientists develop treatments for thousands of diseases.

Maybe that someone is even you. It's a major health problem, not only in the U.S. but across the world. But where there are problems, there are also opportunities.Lots of companies are feverishly working to develop products to manage and treat diabetes. Many of these companies are publicly traded. We asked three Motley Fool healthcare contributors to pick the top diabetes stocks they think investors should especially watch in March. Here's why they chose  (NYSE: AZN) ,  (NASDAQ: DXCM) , and  (NYSE: MDT) .Image source: Getty Images. After a lengthy bout with the patent cliff, Anglo-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca finally turned the corner in late 2018, thanks to six key growth products. While the company's oncology franchise has grabbed the bulk of the credit for this return to form, Astra's diabetes franchise has played a crucial role as well.In particular, Astra's type 2 diabetes medicine Farxiga (Forxiga in the EU) has become a core element of the company's growth engine over the last few years. Farxiga's sales, for example, grew by an impressive 30% year over year in 2018, making it one of the best-selling  last year.Nevertheless, this top diabetes drug still has a lot more room to grow from a sales standpoint. If regulators agree to expand Farxiga's label to include type 1 diabetes patients and those at-risk of heart failure, for instance, Wall Street thinks the drug's sales can nearly double from current levels to reach a whopping $2.7 billion by 2023.So why is AstraZeneca's stock worth watching this month? The company is set to unveil new analyses from Farxiga's cardiovascular outcomes trial, Declare, in type 2 diabetics at the American College of Cardiology's 68th Annual Scientific Session this weekend. As Farxiga is a key piece of Astra's overall growth story, the market could react strongly -- either positively or negatively -- to this presentation over the course of next week. Billions in future sales, after all, could be at stake It's no exaggeration to say that quickly responding to out-of-whack blood sugar (glucose) levels can often be a life-saving move for individuals with diabetes. But to respond requires knowing the blood sugar level in the first place. That's where continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems come into play. These systems enable people with diabetes to  know what their blood sugar levels are.Around 415 million people across the world have diabetes. Only 6% of them, though, achieve their desired outcomes. Around 70% of the time, these individuals have blood sugar levels that are outside of a healthy range. The market is enormous for CGM systems and continues to grow -- and one company is the leader in this fast-growing market: DexCom.DexCom's share price  . This fantastic performance was driven primarily by success of the company's G6 CGM system. The G6 doesn't require finger sticks like most CGM systems do. It also integrates with top insulin patch pumps, smart insulin pens, and insulin pumps.I think sales for the G6 will continue to skyrocket, propelling DexCom stock even higher. The company is also working on its next-generation CGM system, the G7, which will offer individuals with diabetes a fully disposable, real-time glucose monitoring system at a relatively low cost. DexCom looks like a diabetes stock to watch in March -- and for a long time to come. Although diabetes devices comprise less than 10% of aggregate sales at Medtronic, a medical device conglomerate that's perhaps best known for manufacturing cardiovascular and spinal devices, I believe it to be the most interesting diabetes stock as a result of its  .In September 2016, Medtronic made waves when its first-ever \"artificial pancreas\" device, the MiniMed 670G, was  by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for type 1 diabetics. The company's closed-loop system uses a protruding needle that's slipped under the skin to measure insulin levels, which then relays those readings to a worn insulin pump that can then deliver insulin on an as-needed basis. While no insulin pump is perfect, the 670G is designed to significantly reduce dangerous hypoglycemic events for type 1 diabetics.Although we're talking about only roughly 1.25 million people out of the 30.3 million kids and adults with diabetes in the United States, these 1.25 million people have a much harder time controlling their blood glucose levels. According to the company's fiscal third-quarter results, released in February, more than 157,000 users worldwide are benefiting daily from the 670G. This figure continues to increase, with Medtronic having ramped up manufacturing capacity for the device in the U.S. and the company pushing into overseas markets.Additional innovation with the Guardian Connect continuous glucose monitoring system, which debuted last summer, is also helping generate superior diabetes sales growth. Guardian works with a user's smartphone to map out the highs and lows of a person's blood glucose levels in order to better help a patient track and tackle their diabetes.In recent years, diabetes has been Medtronic's fastest-growing segment, with high single-digit, or steady double-digit, increases to sales. I would look for this to continue, and for the ramp-up of Guardian Connect and the international rollout of the MiniMed 670G to \"pump up\" operating results in fiscal 2019 and 2020. For these reasons, Medtronic is my diabetes stock to monitor this month.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Since then, American stocks have gained despite concerns about global economic growth, anxieties related to central bank policies and tit-for-tat trade war threats. Having said that, the United States and China's initiative to reach a deal, stabilize interest rates and an uptick in consumer confidence have surely provided the required impetus to stocks.The current bull run has lifted both the S&P 500 and the  by more than 400%. Since the financial crisis, increase in share prices and dividends helped the broader S&P 500, in particular, add nearly $21 trillion to its value, per the S&P Dow Jones Indices.In the meantime, the tech-laden Nasdaq has risen more than 500%, mostly led by fast-growing tech bigwigs including the FAANGs. For instance, Apple has given its shareholders a 1,373.7% return since the financial crisis, while Netflix returned 6,396.7%. In other words, if you had bought $100,000 in Netflix stock on Mar 9, 2009, you would have been a millionaire by now!Not all stocks, however, have performed well over the course of the past decade. And the disparity between the top performers and the worst is rather shocking. Some companies, in fact, saw their shares tumble around 90%.

Around 10 years back, the company was struggling to get approval for its drugs. Its antidepressant Luvox was encountering hurdles, while narcolepsy drug Xyrem needed to gain traction. And how can we forget that the company was compelled to trim 24% of its workforce in 2008 due to earnings pressure.But things have changed for the better. Xyrem is now the company's primary brand and Defitelio used for cancer treatment is picking up.

But, the company had its share of ups and downs. It had to recall a few of its black yoga pants due to transparency issue in 2013, compelling the then-CEO Chip Wilson to step down.

DXCM became a Zacks #2 Rank after a strong beat and raise quarter reported on 2/21.DexCom delivered Q4 adjusted EPS of 54 cents vs the consensus of 17-c for a giant 217% beat. And Q4 revenues of $338 million beat the consensus view of $307.5 million by a healthy 10%. Much of the good news was baked in as the company had preannounced the coming strong results. But they even beat those numbers.As you probably know, diabetes patients must stick their finger several times per day to monitor their blood sugar. Dexcom is changing that with a device called a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). These devices track glucose levels throughout the day rather than rely on bloody finger sticks and test strips.And this, as you might guess, gives patients and their care providers more accurate data to measure and understand daily ebbs and flows in blood glucose levels.In February, DexCom received Health Canada approval for its G6 CGM System. Dexcom announced that the Health Canada thumbs up for its next generation CGM system was for people with diabetes ages two years and up. It was previously introduced into the U.S, U.K., Ireland, and several other European countries and has seen strong sales so the G6 commercial launch in Canada, planned for late 2019, is much anticipated.Here were analyst reactions to DexCom's Feb 21 report after the company offered 2019 revenue guidance of $1.175 billion to $1.225 billion, representing 19% growth over last year, and gross profit margin of approximately 65%...Cowen & Co: Analyst Doug Schenkel raised his price target on DexCom to $175 from $150 following its \"blowout\" Q4 results. The analyst believes its guidance leaves plenty of room for top and bottom line upside, though he admits a new competitor product could provide headline risk. He views the shares as a long-term core holding. Schenkel reiterated his Outperform rating on DexCom shares.Canaccord Genuity: Analyst Kyle Rose raised his price target on DexCom to $160 from $140 following its strong Q4 results. The analyst expects its exceptional growth to continue, supported by strong growth in sensor volumes, continued worldwide adoption of CGM, and the ongoing launch of G6, which is just now moving into additional territories and Medicare. Rose views DexCom as one of the best pure growth assets across the med-tech space.Piper Jaffray: Analyst JP McKim told investors in a research note that he believes DexCom is positioning itself for the next $1B in sales to be \"solid, profitable growth.\" The restructuring allows the company to scale quicker and at a lower cost over the longer term, McKim says. He reiterated an Overweight rating on DexCom with a $165 price target.Oppenheimer analysts raised their 2019 sales estimate to $1.22 billion from $1.13 billion, with US growth in the mid-teens and elsewhere up ~30%. Their EPS projection rose to $0.59 from $0.25 on solid operating leverage and their price target goes to $167 from $150.Leerink Swann analysts explained why DXCM could continue to commance a premium valuation. Their $170 price target applies a ~9.5X price-to-sales multiple to their $1.512 billion 2020 revenue estimate. DXCM shares currently trade at about 10X their $1.22 bilion 2019 sales estimate, which is a premium to comparable small-cap MedTech companies like  (INGN) at about 5X.The Leerink analysts forecast that DXCM can continue to deliver estimate upside and sustain the EV/sales multiple at current levels. Ultimately, they believe DXCM shares warrant at least a modest premium to other mid-cap MedTech stocks given: (1) A massive and highly underpenetrated TAM (total addressable market) of about $6 billion per their estimate; (2) consistent upside potential; and (3) a top-tier growth outlook longer term.Based on these analyst moves, consensus DexCom EPS for 2019 moved 70% higher in the past month from $0.27 to $0.46, representing 53% annual growth.

Its shares have thrashed the  over the last one, three, and five years, showing no signs of slowing.Can this winner keep thriving? Let's dig into the bull and bear cases for the California-based company to find out.DexCom, a medical device company focused on diabetes, sells a popular continuous glucose monitor (CGM) system called the DexCom G6. This device is worn on the body and constantly monitors a patient's blood glucose levels. That data is uploaded to a handheld controller, smartphone, or smartwatch that provides information needed to keep blood glucose levels in a healthy range.Image source: DexCom.DexCom operates on a  . The permanent \"razor\" is the company's handheld device that receives and displays the data, while the disposable \"blades\" are its sensors that are inserted directly into a patient's body. After 10 days of use, they need to be properly tossed and replaced, thus providing a dependable source of recurring revenue.This business model has allowed DexCom's top line to grow at a breakneck pace as it brings on new patients over time. . Data by  .DexCom's revenue growth has been incredibly impressive, and it remains strong to this day. In 2018, its top line rose by 44%, sending it over the $1 billion mark.Can the company keep its double-digit growth rate going? The odds look good for a number of reasons:Management forecasts that the company will pull in between $2 billion and $2.5 billion in total revenue by 2023 and improve profitability significantly. If those numbers prove to be anywhere close to accurate, shareholders should be nicely rewarded.Dexcom would be a no-brainer investment if the company had the CGM market all to itself. Unfortunately, it faces a fair amount of competition.Its primary competitor is medical device giant  (NYSE: MDT) , which has enjoyed a strong foothold in the diabetes market for decades, through its insulin pump division. It also launched a combination insulin pump/CGM system a few years ago, a device thath increased patient convenience and has proven quite popular with patients.Another heavy hitter in the CGM space is  (NYSE: ABT) , which won FDA approval for a CGM device called the  in 2017. The Libre was the first CGM system that did not require its users to perform daily finger sticks for calibration, and was also marketed at a much lower price point than DexCom's CGM. The Freestyle Libre has experienced  .Thus far, DexCom hasn't had any problems growing even with the competition from these well-funded giants, but it's possible that could change.Another potential pitfall that could work against investors who buy today is Dexcom's generous valuation. The company is currently trading for more than 12 times sales and about 150 times next year's earnings estimates. Those figures suggest that Wall Street is pricing in a lot of growth. If it fails to deliver on its ambitious growth targets, shareholders could be in a for a world of hurt.While DexCom isn't an appropriate stock for risk-averse investors, I still think there is a lot like about the company. Its product is innovative, and the company has secured numerous partnership agreements, which should ensure it continues to win more than its fair share of the new business. What's more, the diabetes market is  that it could easily support multiple winners.If you're a growth-focused investor who doesn't mind paying up for a high-growth business, DexCom could be a nice addition to your portfolio.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The presentation of this additional information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results or superior to results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release and the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.Now, I'll turn it over to Kevin. -- Thank you for joining us today as we discuss our year-end results. Simply put, 2018 was an incredible year for DexCom on several fronts. First and foremost we broke through $1 billion in annual revenue. Very few if any medical device companies have reached the $1 billion revenue mark, while growing revenues organically at greater than 40% year-over-year. Clearly, the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations, delivering growth of over 50% compared to the same period a year ago. The Company also posted its most profitable non-GAAP fourth quarter and full year on record, as we continue to focus on growth while demonstrating leverage.Beyond the numbers, we received FDA approval for our G6 system in late March with G6 becoming a Class II system and being the first to meet the agency's newly established Special Controls for iCGM. We launched G6 in the U.S. around mid-year and continue to roll it out to additional markets globally. Initial patient feedback for G6 has been outstanding. G6 has truly redefined best-in-class CGM and provides us with a platform that we believe will drive continued growth opportunities for DexCom. Beyond G6, we saw significant increases in adoption in both the Medicare and international markets, both of which remain significantly under penetrated. We advanced our interoperability and decision support initiatives, including the acquisition of TypeZero and we solidified our product pipeline by amending our agreement with Verily and strengthened our balance sheet with the convertible note financing that we did late in the fourth quarter.All of these accomplishments have positioned us for continued success in 2019 and beyond. The team at DexCom has worked incredibly hard for this achievements. And I must recognize all of the effort needed to make this happen. The organization is achieving milestones that few companies ever do which is gratifying and comes with significant dedication and determination from our team. But going forward that will not be enough. We must put the infrastructure in place for this business to scale to its full potential. This need in part drove the additional announcement that we made today. In light of our meaningful uptick in demand we have set the aggressive internal goal to double our G6 production capacity by year-end.We need to expand our footprint dedicated to manufacturing within the Arizona facility both to meet our G6 goals and in anticipation of a late 2020 launch of G7. Similar to our scaling and manufacturing capacity, we have had to rethink how we build our customer-facing infrastructure to better serve our rapidly growing patient base not just for today but also to build a sustainable infrastructure for the future. We have therefore expanded and reorganized our customer support efforts which includes an increase in resources on our new Philippines location, as well as outsourcing other functions through third parties. This move will provide the ability to serve our customers with the same high-level of quality that they have become accustomed to and grow in a much more efficient manner.This expansion will result in organizational changes, including a reduction in certain staff at both our San Diego and Arizona facilities despite an expected overall increase in employee numbers in these locations this year. These types of decisions are always difficult as we've had to increase our support staff significantly over the past several years and have relied on such individuals to meet the demand of our customers. This is a necessary step to continue to adapt and further differentiate our business by maintaining our focus on the patient experience. These changes will occur during a transition period and we have taken the necessary steps to ensure that they occur as seamlessly as possible, while being open with our employees and supporting those impacted over the next several months. Quentin, will walk you through the financial implications of this effort. To sum up DexCom continues to deliver strong results and our recent initiatives leave us well positioned to execute over the next several years.I'll now turn the call over to Quentin, for financial update. -- Thank you Kevin. As a reminder some of the figures that I will refer to on a non-GAAP basis and reconciliations to our GAAP results are available on our website. Today, we reported record worldwide revenue of $338 million for the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to $221 million for the same quarter in 2017, representing growth of 53% over the same quarter a year ago on both reported and constant-currency basis; a clear acceleration that drove us to $1.032 billion in revenue for the year. Sequentially, revenue was up 27% over the third quarter. This growth was driven by the sustained ramp in awareness that we saw building throughout 2018 particularly in our U.S. commercial business which was the primary driver of the upside. Notably, this growth materialized despite a decline in revenue per patient which was in line with our expectations provided on the third quarter call.As a result of our continued shift in channel mix, including continued growth of the International and Medicare businesses, as well as our proactive attempt to move commercial payer contracts into the pharmacy channel, we expected to see some overall pressure on revenue per patient. Nonetheless, we realized accelerating growth throughout the back half of the year as we saw these headwinds begin to play out and delivered an outstanding 2018. And we're particularly pleased with achieving 50% growth in our U.S. business in the fourth quarter.International sales in the quarter were consistent with our expectations and were up 72% over Q4 2017 on a reported basis or 75% excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate changes. Consistent with the first three quarters of the year, our fourth quarter growth continued to be driven by our direct markets. Fourth quarter gross margins improved from the third quarter as expected to 66%, resulting in a gross profit of $223 million. Operating expenses were $387 million for Q4 2018, including a $218 million one-time non-cash research and development charge related to the amendment of our Verily agreement. Apart from this non-recurring charge, fourth quarter operating expenses were $170 million compared to $142 million in Q4 2017. This reflects an increase of 20% year-over-year and compares favorably to our 53% revenue growth in the quarter.For the full year, we realized growth of 44% while non-GAAP operating expenses which adjust for the non-cash charge related to amended agreement with Verily, grew at less than half of that rate at 18%. In addition to the better-than-expected revenue result, this organization did a great job of controlling spend in 2018 and delivered meaningful improvements in our profitability profile. Importantly, adjusted EBITDA which excludes the impact of share-based compensation and the non-cash research and development fee was $86.3 million or 25.5% of revenue for the fourth quarter, demonstrating the profitability profile that this business is capable of consistently producing over time. Our non-GAAP net income was $48.9 million or $0.54 per share.We're incredibly happy with the progress being made on the profitable front and remain comfortable with the long-term financial goals laid out at our Investor Day back in December of 2018. We fortified our balance sheet, having ended the quarter with nearly $1.4 billion in cash and equivalents which includes roughly $700 million in net proceeds following our convertible note offering and share repurchase in Q4 of 2018. This offering provides the financial stability and flexibility we need to invest in our key strategic initiatives. We continue to have full availability of our $200 million revolving line of credit.Turning to 2019, as we provided in early January, we anticipate full year revenues of between $1.175 billion and $1.225 billion. This outlook assumes a higher rate of patient volume growth offset by headwinds associated with the decreased revenue per patient related to shifting channel mix. As you saw in our press release and as Kevin summarized, we announced a corporate initiative earlier today that will better position us to meet the increasing demands of growth in our business. As a result, we expect to incur roughly $25 million in restructuring-related charges that will primarily be incurred in the first half of 2019 and will be excluded from our non-GAAP financial results going forward. With that consideration we anticipate the following full year 2019 non-GAAP financial results. Gross margin improving to approximately 65%; operating margin increasing to approximately 5.5%; and adjusted EBITDA margin expanding to roughly 18%. We have included a reconciliation of GAAP versus non-GAAP results in our website, as well as historical trend presenting non-GAAP financial results on a consistent basis for comparability purposes.With that I'll now turn the call over to Steve for a strategic update. -- Thank you Quentin. The continued rollout of G6 remains a primary strategic priority for DexCom at the outset of 2019. In the U.S. we plan to begin shipping G6 to our Medicare patients in the near term and we have multiple OUS introductions planned for the balance of the year. 2018 was a year of great progress for our insulin delivery partners and we look forward to the launch of Tandem's Control-IQ system later this year, which includes our G6 sensor platform, as well as our recently acquired hybrid closed-loop algorithm from TypeZero. We're excited about the continued progress we're making with Insulet on the Horizon platform, as well as Lily, as they look to bring both connected pumps and pens to market. Our smart pen and integration program with Nova Nordisk continues to advance since we announced that partnership in October.We will continue to push these and other collaborations forward in 2019 and expect to see DexCom integrated smart pen systems that are commercially available in 2020.(ph)As we nearly saw in November, we amended our collaboration agreement with Verily, strengthening our product development goals and further aligning our interest as we work toward the commercialization of a fully disposable real-time CGM. This amendment eliminates all future royalty payments, significantly improving our long-term profitability outlook. Our next-generation or G7 system remains on track for a late 2020 or early 2021 release. With G7 on the horizon, we continue to collaborate on(ph)Paleo efforts in the non-intensive Type 2 population, working with United Healthcare, Onduo and others as they utilize CGM as a core tool and programs to drive health and economic benefits for people with Type 2 diabetes.In addition, we are on track to kick off study this year for applications in both the hospital and gestational markets. Both of these represent new markets in which uncontrolled glucose presents a major impediment to patient health and an economic burden to the health system. While we remain in the early stages, we are well positioned to leverage G6 as a platform technology that enables us to answer key questions and determine next steps. We look forward to providing updates as these studies progress. As you can see we continue to drive a number of important strategic initiatives and we're excited about the pipeline and market expansion opportunities ahead.With that I'll pass it back to Kevin. -- Thank you Steve. 2018 will stand as the year of historic milestone for DexCom. And in diabetes technology in general. Our outlook for 2019 contemplates the growing awareness in the value of CGM. Our leadership position based on G6 technology be increasingly competitive landscape and our own proactive moves to optimize distribution channels and position DexCom for long-term operating efficiency. Given the growing awareness of the benefits of CGM and our accelerating growth throughout 2018, we entered 2019 with excitement around the opportunity that lies ahead.I would now like to open up the call for Q&A. Matt? -- Thank you Kevin. (Operator Instructions) Operator, please provide the complete Q&A instructions.(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Jeff Johnson from Baird. Your line is open. -- Thank you. Good evening guys, can you hear me OK? -- Yes, no problem. -- Alright, great. Thanks for taking the call. So I'm sure there is going to be some revenue questions and things like that. So I was thinking I was going to be deeper in the queue but so my question is pretty simple, just have you heard anything from Medicare on any kind of updated hospital CGM use initiatives that they could be looking to put in place that you guys could participate in over the next year or two? -- Yeah, nothing specifically -- Jeff, this is Steven, nothing specifically in terms of programs but we are aware that CMS has a particular focus on glucose control in the in-patient setting that we think will absolutely lend itself to that business evolving in the relatively near term. You've heard mention before of readmissions as a result of poor glucose control not being paid for. We are seeing hypoglycemia as a new focal point for CMS. And then you should expect that that would obviously trickle down into the core commercial payers as well. So it's a pretty exciting opportunity. It's still early but we're -- we're all aware of it. -- Yes. And then Quentin, we're two months into the quarter and obviously the 2019 guidance looks to a lot of us to be at least somewhat conservative here. Just any kind of update than gating and should we be thinking of kind of higher first half growth versus second half? Or just how we should be setting that model to this point? Thanks. -- Yeah. I think we feel good about where we're at as we start to get into 2019 here. I think just given the tougher comps that we're up against in the back half of 2019 given the accelerating growth we saw over the course of 2018, you naturally would see lower growth rate. So I think you should expect higher growth rates in the first half, lower in the back half. In terms of the cadence, I would just point out we would expect the seasonal trends in the business to reflect more of what we saw in 2016 and 2017. 2018 was a year of tremendous acceleration and the growth profile over the course of the year which caused the seasonality trend to look a little bit different. So I think thinking about 20% or so of revenue in the first quarter which is in line with 2016 and 2017 is probably the right way to think about it.And our next question comes from Margaret Kaczor from William Blair. Your line is open. -- Hi, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just to start off with -- just to follow-up on the guidance question. You guys obviously delivered 2x the original 2018 growth guidance. So as you look at 2019, I'm in the assumption that you guys made, how do those differ this year relative to last year including kind of the risk-weighting as you were, Quentin you were looking into last year relative to this year? -- Well, I think if you go back to the beginning of last year, we laid out some of the headwinds that we anticipated may show up in the business over the course of the year. I think when you start to look back at it those headwinds did in fact show up but they showed up much later in the year than what we originally anticipated. So we're very clear early on we expected that there could be revenue per patient headwinds in the business. We didn't start to really see those until the third quarter and then really a full quarter's worth in the fourth quarter. So I think we were contemplating all the right things. It's just a timing of when they started to be impactful was probably a little bit later than we originally expected.When I think about 2019, we are approaching the year in a somewhat similar manner with respect to how we think about that revenue per patient headwinds that we know are in the business, although what's different now is we know they are playing out. We saw it Q4. We expect they're going to continue to play into 2019. And so when you look at the absolute dollar growth in our guidance, we are guiding to about $150 million to $200 million of absolute dollar growth but we've been clear there's about $100 million of revenue per patient headwinds in that guidance. So if you were to normalize back for that you've actually got a gross increase of about $300 million over the course of the year which is more or less right in line with what we just delivered in 2018. So the absolute dollar growth is pretty consistent. The growth rate is coming down obviously a much more difficult base that we're growing off of. But I think it starts to make a lot of sense when you look at it that way. -- Okay. That's helpful. And then just kind of I guess a little bit going on that vein as a follow up, can you guys give us an update on the percent-wise that are under pharmacy right now? I think it was about 20% last quarter. And then as you're seeing that grow as a percentage of the mix coverage, have you seen any change in terms of the patient ad mix driven by pharmacy yet? And how do you expect that plays out throughout 2019? -- I'll take that Margaret, this is Kevin. Our covered lives are over 50% now slightly above that. And again let me remind you just because we have the covered lives over 50% doesn't mean they'll process through pharmacy. Most of our pharmacy plans have a dual benefit with DME pharmacy. Then it's up to us to drive awareness, so physicians and patients know that they can be covered through that vehicle. We expect that to continue to accelerate over the course of the year. We've had some very good discussions and some wins with the local, regional and national payer level over the past several months and have some really exciting things untapped going into 2019. And I think as Quentin talked about earlier channel mix, we are expecting channel mix to a shift in that direction.We see a tremendous opportunity for patients if they can pick their product up in the drugstore rather than call us and go through the DME process which is alive and well in the first quarter. We're in a much better position. So we're definitely driving and shifting the business there and encouraging our field team to do so as well.And our next question comes from Raj Denhoy from Jefferies. -- Hi, good afternoon. Wondered, if I could ask about the international performance. Again very strong in the quarter. Are there other countries contemplated in the near term in terms of establishing reimbursement or is it still mostly coming from Germany and some of the markets you're already in? -- Yeah, the growth in our guidance is primarily coming from the existing countries that we are operating within. I think we've talked about the fact that we are seeing opportunities open up into countries like Japan, Korea where there has been regulatory approval more recently. We don't expect those to be big contributors to the overall revenue number in 2019. And I think we'll let the product get into the market and see how it performs and then we can start to think about how it becomes additive to the overall numbers, but it's all incremental opportunity as far as work and we look out into the future. -- Are there specific countries though that you've targeted here for 2019 where you expect to establish more routine reimbursement that could be larger contributors? I think in the past you mentioned UK and some other large markets that might open up? -- We're certainly making progress in the U.K. We continue to make progress in Italy. There are couple geographies where there are large government-funded CGM initiatives where they're announcing funding over several years and expanding the available population where CGM is available. For example, many of these countries will fund CGM for (inaudible) only and now they're saying OK, we'll expand this to adults and cover more. So we'll take advantage of those opportunities. There are competitive bidding situation, so I'm not going to go into those details and say where they all are but we will aggressively pursue those opportunities. We had a situation for example in Australia several years ago where they opened it up for bid and said they were going to cover not even 10 million in CGM. And within 60 days we have eaten up pretty much that entire budget as patients flocked to DexCom CGM. So we take advantage of those opportunities rapidly and we'll take care of the advantage of those where we can next year.And the next question comes from Steven Lichtman from Oppenheimer. -- Thank you. Hi guys, you've talked in the past that your discussions with payers revolve around the pharmacy course and I think also expanding into intensive Type 2s, I want to ask the second opportunity. How much progress are you making on getting coverage for intensive Type 2s and could that start becoming more of a revenue contributor this year? -- We think that it will become more of a revenue contributor. The Medicare coverage decision has been helpful but it takes awhile to get that Medicare coverage decision pushed down to all the individual payers and expend access. A lot of this is in conjunction with all of our pricing and overall access discussions as we ask for access to more patients than what is the pricing model, what is the business model for these people. And so all of these variables are in play and they've been -- we've been talking through all of them. We believe we'll increase our Type 2 intensive access. I'd love it to be faster than it is. But in all candid with Medicare Type 2 intensive insulin access, you have a very large portion of the Type 2 insulin intensive using population covered already. We just need really to increase awareness within patients and physicians that they can have access to that technology now under Medicare coverage. -- Got it. And then as a follow up, will we potentially get any update on the United non-intensive study and outcomes there this year? -- Again, we've said this before Steve, it's not really it, don't think of it as a study with a principal investigator and something that's going to be published into a medical journal. This is real world. The work we're doing not just with United but on a number of fronts on the Type 2 non-intensive kind of Type 2 non-insulin taking patient is really real world, think of them as real world, but very, really large pilot study. Frankly, the last thing any of these guys want to do is share their findings with the rest of the world, right, because these guys are all competitors and they hold this data and the programs that are evolving out of these pilot to be very proprietary. And so I don't think you're going to see or certainly we're not going to be permitted to publish anything about the United pilot. I can't imagine United is going to be too vocal about it. So I think the answer is probably not.And our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy from Leerink. Your line is open. -- Hi, good afternoon guys, thanks so much for taking the question. Just curious and I guess, it's -- more specific to Europe right now than the U.S. but any change in the competitive landscape that you're seeing. I mean, obviously it is not impacting your growth trajectory. That's the first question specifically as it relates to the updated Abbott product? And then the follow-up question I have is how do we think about pricing longer-term in the U.S.? So I appreciate what you're saying here for 2019. Is it right to think that that sort of pricing headwind will repeat itself each year and get incrementally worse? Or is this kind of like and we're at the bottom for price increase guys? Thanks so much. -- This is Kevin. I'll try and take that Danielle. That's a very good question. With respect to competition, we take competition seriously all the time. While it hasn't slowed our growth trajectory, I would say if anything our vision and our focus on the competitive environment is much greater than it's been before. And as we design our products and our future pipeline we want to take advantage of those things that we do well to continue to toward competition. With respect to pricing in the U.S., as Quentin often says, pricing by channel for us has remained relatively consistent. But as we move more business into other channels for example, the pharmacy channel and currently the Medicare channel that's lower priced than we recognized in the past. We are preparing as we talked at our Analyst Day, over long-term to be a viable competitor in the pricing environment whatever it turns out to be. We talked about doubling the capacity of Arizona factory for G6. We talked about building at the G7 lines. As we look at our cost profile going forward we're preparing for whatever the market brings. We believe CGM is a very valuable technology.And the fact is what we've seen in Europe so far is the reimbursement as way of recognize the value of our technology over others on the market and we've continued to get a premium price. We will work to those models. We will work to those models in the U.S. We will grow and adapt to where it ends but we do think our product with its accuracy, its performance, its connectivity and its features has been worthy of the premium price that we have received and so for the payers have been amicable to that. That being said as we've also talked about if we can increase access and make it easier for patients to get and decrease our operating expenses through better channel mix, we're all for it. And we will take advantage of those opportunities as well. -- Danielle I would just add I think we're still early in the opportunity of converting folks from traditional fingersticks to CGM. That the opportunity in the way of volume growth from the adoption of CGM technology is so significant that while there is going to be revenue per patient headwinds over time, I think the volume opportunity significantly more outweighs any of those headwinds. And I think as you open up some of these other markets that go beyond the intensive world of diabetes, you may see a different revenue per patient profile there but the volume numbers are again so significant that I think there is tremendous runway in front of us from a growth perspective for years to come. -- Got it. Thanks so much guys.And our next question comes from Kyle Rose from Canaccord. Your line is open. -- Great, thank you very much. Can you hear me alright? -- Yeah. -- Yeah. -- Great. So I just wanted to dig back into the product cadence here over the course of next 12 to 18 months. I mean, obviously the G6 rollout globally and into Medicare is a priority. I think you reaffirmed that the G7 time lines for late 2020, early 2021. I'm just kind of wondering is there anything that we should be expecting over the interim period there whether it be the lower cost transmitter, G6 professional version potentially getting an extended wear time on the G6. Just kind of help us understand what some of the near-term product milestones may be? And then I just have one more question on longer-term margins. -- That's a great question and certainly a fun one for me. We always look at interim improvements for our product. If you look at everything we've ever done every generation we launch we come for example with an algorithm that significantly improves performance. Not long after we launch because once we have all these data we can really go model and figure out where it is. So we are exploring new algorithms with our G6 technology. We're also exploring longer wear time. We have the caveat around meeting iCGM standards with that longer wear time and we want to make sure we can meet iCGM standards for that full longer period whatever that may be. We do have the lower cost transmitter that will be out certainly in broad scale during the second half of 2019.We've got thought through the inventory they have now but that will certainly be a cost reduction and a help for us. And remember one of our key features and differentiators is the patient experience and our ability to iterate through software changes. We are really focusing tremendously on software development and offering our patients a better experience and better tools to manage their condition. Certainly not tomorrow but as we look at the TypeZero acquisition and the tools they develop for decision support and offering patients information to manage their condition better we intend to bring those tools to market. If we can get them done with G6, we'll get them done and get them in there if we have to wait till G7, we will do so. But make no mistake about it we want to make this patient experience more meaningful and better for them each and every day. -- Thank you. And then from an operating perspective, obviously taking some near-term charges to expanding operations internationally, but may be Quentin, can you kind of help us understand how we should think about going to a lower cost region when you're building up some of those operational capabilities. Just how that should impact margins over the long-term? And then any CapEx guidance this year as you invest in the manufacturing capacity? -- Yeah, sure. So I think consistent with what we kind of talked about back at our Investor Day in December, gross margin expectations for us are to continue in that mid-60s range over the next five years or so. There are several levers that will allow us to improve that in terms of taking cost out of the product, including this lower cost transmitter that we expect later in the year but we also assume that there's going to be lower revenue per patient headwinds that we're going to be dealing with as well. And so I think the cost savings will ultimately offset the -- those benefits will offset headwinds that come from the lower revenue per patient. So think about that as being relatively consistent with where we're at now. And if we can deliver or execute better than great there is upside to it. I think one of the big areas of opportunity and Kevin hit on it is really focusing on how we double our capacity over the course of the year.We see tremendous opportunities in the markets in front of us. Markets that were not yet in but believe there is real potential to be in and we want to make sure that we have the capacity to address that. So you're going to see some significant CapEx spend over the course of this year, well north of $100 million to build out automated lines, stand up incremental clean rooms at our Mesa facility and ensure that we're building out capacity just as fast as we possibly can. So I think that's the way to think about it. In terms of operating margin cadence we laid out a plan to get to 15% over a five-year horizon. That's roughly 300 basis points a year. We are not committed to 300 basis points necessarily each and every year but I think we're making great progress toward it here in 2019 with our guidance that delivers roughly 200 basis points. And that's in the midst of a year that we are incredibly focused on getting G7 far down the pathway in getting that to market in late 2020, as well as the fact that we laid out this reorganization today. And I think it's important that we all understand.We are committed to ensuring that the patient experience is a good one through this transition. And therefore we're not looking at any reduction in workforce along the way until we are performing at equivalent or better levels than what we are performing in the Company today and then resources can start to come down. And so you got a bit of cost in the P&L this year that I would call duplicative. Just to ensure that there is a smooth transition here. Otherwise, you would see more leverage coming through the P&L this year alone. But we feel great about where are at. We're confident we can get to that long-term plan that we laid out and feel good about it.And our next question comes from David Lewis, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. -- Hi, this is (inaudible) for David. Congrats on the quarter. Just one for me and one follow-up I've got. Is there any update on the trials for the 14-day sensor for G6 and is that something we could see an approval for later this year? -- We are not going to comment specifically on the timing but it's certainly something that's in the near-term pipeline. -- Okay. And then the pharmacy channel that you had 50% covered lives today, 40% last quarter. Should we think about 10 percentage point increase quarterly going forward? Or would you expect that pace to increase over the course of the year? -- It's just not that predicable. I mean, we continue to push as hard as we can to transition the business into the pharmacy channel. And remember important thing Kevin said it, but the important thing to remember is when we say we had 50% of the commercial lives that have a pharmacy benefit that doesn't mean we're processing 50% of our commercial business through the pharmacy channel yet. So it's not just the addition of additional covered lives under contract. It's also then transitioning those folks into the pharmacy channel through education and otherwise.And our next question comes from Travis Steed from Bank of America. -- Alright. Thanks for taking the questions. I had a question about iCGM. I think we can debate all day if another competitor can better or not. But just wanted to ask on a big picture if one of your larger competitors does get iCGM, how do you think that changes the conversation for payers, patients and physicians? Does that have an impact on the conversation that you're having with those customers? -- Yes. This is Kevin. I'll take that. And honestly the iCGM designations set some wonderful standards for us to get products approved and get them through the system quicker. I don't believe as I sit here today as we butt up against our competitors in the various payer channel and payer meetings that they really know that much about what iCGM means other than they know about the performance of DexCom sensor. Where iCGM becomes extremely relevant is on two fronts as I said earlier. Standards for us to shoot forward when we get future product iterations improved. For example, the 14-day product we're talking about, we know exactly how many data points we need to have and how that product needs to perform before we file up with the FDA to get that designation. We love the clarity and we intend to (technical difficulty) operate in that space.Number 2, when we get into interoperability, with various software systems with software around insulin pen, software around the sensor-augmented pump systems and sensor-assisted pump systems and various AP algorithms. Then with an iCGM you can drop in a different CGM into different systems if they are already approved. And this will give us and others if they can attain that designation the opportunity to go partner with more people. We are evaluating that designation. We already partnered with a number of people. And it helps us go faster than (inaudible). We try and help our partners go faster all the time now anyway. When it becomes significant is when we change our technology so when we go to the G7 platform for example, or we go to a 14-day platform somebody like Tandem, because we're iCGM or Insulet when they are out on the market can immediately incorporate our iCGM technolgoty into their system without running another clinical study, just showing that the sensor works properly. In the past, we literally sat in meetings with former partners and they chose not to integrate our technology with future offerings because they want to do a trial and run a filing and do a filing. So this -- that's where the iCGM comes in. I don't know that it is a big driver on the sales side. DexCom performance has always been a driver and we've always led with that. -- And a question, one of your competitors is also talking about preferred co-pays. Is that something you're seeing gaining traction in the payer community at all and how important do you think that is in changing customer behavior? -- I think there is some of that that probably goes both ways quite honestly between the different competitors that are out there. I think keep in mind there is well north of 1,000 different payer policies and contracts that we're all working through. There is nothing of significance that we could point to in either direction where we've been advantaged or any other competitor has been advantaged to our knowledge. So we hear rumblings of it here or there, usually it's on a very small scale. So I'm sure it is out there in pockets but nothing of significance and nothing that concerns us.And our next question comes from JP McKim from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. -- Hi, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask just given kind of Tandem's strength from days like you now that you connect with that and then come and control like you. Have you seen any difference in your patient adds from MDI, pumps, any notable shift in the recent months? -- Yes. No, I think, I mean, what we've been seeing, we did see a shift over the last several years where historically, we had been more heavily weighted to pump users I think. Again, it's mostly anecdotal, we don't have perfect data but it appears that we're basically tracking our patient adds to what the market represents which is in the U.S. kind of 65%, 70% of our new patients are in MDI patients and the balance are pump patients. -- Okay. That's helpful. Then just one on the pharmacy. You hear more and more of these walgreens and these large centers that are actually stocking the G6 in-house and so I'm wondering how much of, I don't want to say revenue contributor or how much of a strategy push that is? Is it material enough to call out at this point? Or is it just kind of the strategy you have and you'll see how it evolves going forward? -- Yeah, look we -- there has been no shift in our business model toward stocking distributors or no incremental contribution that would skew the results in any way from stocking-type relationships or orders that would have come through. As a matter of fact, if they were significant enough and meaningful enough you would see us call those out in our MD&A of our Qs and our Ks and that's not the case. So we don't have any of that driving the results at this point. You go back into the fourth quarter I think what was most encouraging is the number of new patient additions was well beyond what we had anticipated. And honestly, it's accelerated every single quarter of the year. So the momentum has been tremendous there. And I think that's well as the driver. There is not anything from a stocking perspective that's drove any of these results.And our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital. Your line is open. -- Yes, hi, this is Matt on for Joanne. My question is with regards to expanding the capacity in Arizona. How is that going to impact gross margins in 2019 and 2020? Are you guys able to quantify that? -- What I'll lay out for you is kind of how we think about the different moving pieces. In 2019, if there is not a lot of incremental weight being put on the gross margin profile from standing up that Mesa Arizona facility it's already been stood up to degree and we're just adding incremental capacity into there at a faster clip but the unit production is increasing with it. So you're absorbing all that incremental cost. So you don't get any incremental weight put on your gross margin. What you have playing out over the course of 2019 is really you're going to get a benefit as a result of this lower cost transmitter that we've designed and will rollout in the back of the year. That benefit though will be offset by the headwinds associated with the revenue per patient impacts as channel mix continues to shift.Not getting to far ahead out into 2020 but now you are going to have a full year of 2020 with the benefit of the lower cost transmitter, you're going to have more full year impact of the Mesa facility but you will continue to have some of the channel shifts as the international business grows faster, as you now have a full year of pharmacy transitioned probably baked into the results. And again, I think the right way to think about the long-term gross margin is in that mid-60s but you will have those different levers playing out over time. -- That's helpful. And then just my follow-up. One of your competitors made an announcement that they are partnering up with Novo Nordisk, as well. Does that have any impact with your strategy with them and thank you for taking the questions? -- No. Not at all. I mean, as you know they just announced that relationship. We announced our relationship with Novo back in October. And I can tell you we've been working with Novo for far longer than that. We continue to push forward to develop software tools, robust software tools to integrate our CGM together with their intelligent insulin pen technologies that will be coming to market. So I don't think that announcement earlier this week has any impact.And our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JP Morgan. Your line is open. -- Hi, thank you. This is actually Christen on for Robbie. Just had a question on how you think about the development of the overall CGM market. Abbott put out that they now have 1.3 million active users. I know it's been harder for you to track user numbers. But where do see overall penetration levels for Type 1 diabetics for CGM in the markets you compete in? And where do you see that moving to over the course of 2019 versus the very rapid acceleration we saw in 2018? Thanks and then I just have one follow-up. -- I mean, I'm not going to comment specifically on Abbott's patient numbers because I think much of that will come down to how you actually define what is an active patient using your technology. But what we've seen we contract the Abbott prescriptions here in the U.S. and kind of what we know about our patient base I think from a Type 1 perspective, we're probably pushing 30% penetration, far lower than that in the intensive and non-intensive Type 2 space. It's a little harder to track in Europe. I think Abbott has been a bit longer in Europe, so their patient install base is probably a little larger over there but kind of hard to tell. I think we still really the story is that we're all still in our infancy here in terms of addressable patients. So we've got a long way to go. -- And then my follow-up is just you know you have the launch of Control-IQ coming up midway through this year with Tandem. How should we be thinking about that launch in terms of ASP of sensors that you will sell through that system? And have you baked in any incremental sales for the launch of Control-IQ of, uptick in the business that you do with Tandem versus your other partners? Thanks. -- Yes. So we're not going to break down the components of our guidance. Certainly, that launch is one of the many things that is anticipated in the guidance that we gave you for this year. But in terms of ASPs on the sensors there will be no change whatsoever. I mean, the way we process through either the pharmacy or DME won't change with respect to the product, at least in the relatively near term so there wouldn't be any delta there.And our next question comes from Ravi Misra from Berenberg Capital. Your line is open. -- Hi, thanks for taking the questions. So Quentin, just I wanted to kind of get you -- you have a kind of a range on revenues but a point figure on gross margin. So I guess, my first kind of question is, how do we think about that between the kind of bottom of the range, top of the range, any of the cadence there? And is it right to kind of think of OK, well you're taking a little bit of a haircut on a per patient revenue but your margin year-over-year is essentially flat because of these lower cost transmitters. I mean, is that kind of like-for-like reduction? And then my follow-up is around the restructuring. If you could just help us understand a little bit more around, give us the upfront investment that you're putting forward in the severances there. What kind of savings are you expecting there? And then how does that tie into as you look at risk to continue the tremendous growth that you have in driving? Thank you. -- Yes, so there is a lot there. I'll try to hit on it and you can remind me if I don't hit on a part of it. With respect to the lower cost transmitter and how that's playing through the margins, we're only getting the back half of the benefit for that and that's kind of offsetting a full year impact of the continued transition through the pharmacy channel or toward the pharmacy channel. So it's not a like-for-like one-for-one necessarily if it was a full year annualized basis of all items being considered. In terms of the range on revenue and the point on the gross margin, I think we came out and said approximately 65%. I think, you'll find it's going to round into their based upon the different revenue ranges. So we could flex a little bit but we feel pretty good it's going to right around that 65% whether it was on the low end or the high end of that range. With respect to the reorganization that we talked about today, there's going to be about $25 million of restructuring cost that we will incur this year that's primarily related to both severance and retention. Most of that's going to be incurred in the first half of the year as we work through the transition. And most of those costs are triggered when we identify the individuals impacted and we've set a date which most of that has now happened or happened today. So you've triggered a good part of that expense upon that communication. Therefore it's going to happen or the expenses is going to be recorded in the first half although those people will continue to be with us over the course of some part of the year until I like mentioned earlier we get performance metrics in line or better than what we currently run at today. So we did not separate out any of the duplicative costs. We left all of those in our non-GAAP results. We're holding ourselves accountable to those to managing those well. But first and foremost is ensuring a good experience for the patients through this transition. And then we'll start to remove costs where it make sense. We're not going to quantify exactly what that is. We are not going to quantify that benefit for 2020 at this point but it certainly will be a nice enabler of helping us to achieve that longer-term 15% operating margin goal and 25% EBITDA margin goal we put out there over that five-year horizon.And our next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen and Company. Your line is open. -- Hi, this is Ronald for Doug, thanks for taking my questions. It appears like your install base grew 50% in 2018. Is that correct? I'm looking at 2019 even factoring in the revenue per patient headwinds -- the headwinds, the high-end of your guidance seems to imply that install base growth(ph)disallow the decent amount versus that 50% this year. Is that correct? And if so why did that occur? I know it's a tough comparison but it doesn't seem like momentum is slowing? -- Yes, we're not going to talk about the install base or the patient number. I think Steve laid out earlier the differences in how each of the different players in the market tend to look at it and everyone has got a different definition tied into it. I think the way to think about it and we've been pretty clear in our guidance, our volume assumptions in our guidance is about 25% to 30% growth. We've layered on top of that the 10 points of potential headwinds coming from revenue per patient or price headwinds that take that down to the 15% or 20%. So our guidance from a volume perspective up 25% to 30% on yes what was much stronger in 2018 but I think you got to keep in mind a couple different things. You got a much different base that you're growing off of. It was much more difficult in 2019 growing off of 44% growth base than what 2018 was that grew off of 25% base. And you also had the G6 launch in 2018 that we don't repeat in 2019. So there is couple reasons why it might slow a bit. I still think 25% to 30% volume growth is something we're going to be very happy with. And if you can deliver more than that then terrific. There's a lot of opportunities there. -- Okay. And then can you talk about on Onduo's expansion plans for 2019? How broadly do you expect them to expand in the U.S.? And can you talk about how they're using DexCom CGM within their program? How often annually per patient on average? And is this only for a specific high-risk patients or more broadly? Thank you. -- We are not privy all of Onduo's plans. We do talk to them. Work with them. We provide them sensors. I believe they'll go as quickly as they possibly can. Their use of CGM is very much as an educational tool and something to reset the bar for people with Type 2 diabetes. Similar to other programs that we work with the Type 2 patient typically has not had any information like a CGM ever to help the manager condition their tool. He loves to exercise more and take your pills. And when you get on a CGM you can figure out well, gee, this is what exercise more does, this is what Eli Lilly different does. And this is what happens when I take my medications or when I change my medications. We believe CGM will be a critical component in all Type 2 diabetes management. There's nothing that can give a patient the information that CGM does. Absolutely nothing. And if we present it properly in a manner where patients can implement this information to make changes in their lifestyle and routines, it's going to be fantastic. The question then becomes how many a year do they use and what is the business model. And I think that's going to be worked out by a number of players through studies over time. And will be worked out by us as we look at potentially different product offerings to serve this market. We view it as a big one and we view it as something that can make a huge difference.And our next question comes from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. -- Good afternoon. Thank you guys. Maybe first question, if you can just give us an update for -- on the Verily program. In loose terms, what some of the key milestones are for development this calendar year in terms of what's making your expectations that will be a great starting point. -- Yeah, so Isacc, this is Steve. What you heard us talk about in the prepared remarks was G7 and committing to the time line of launching G7 by the end of next year or the first part of 2020 and that remains on track. That is will be the first launch of a product that incorporates our technology together with Verily. We're not referring to it specifically as the Verily platform anymore. It's really, it's a DexCom product and we're going to call it G7 going forward. In terms of milestones we're not going to comment specifically on the -- in terms of clinical trial or regulatory filings at this point but we'll probably update you guys as the year goes on. -- That's fine. Thank you. And then Quentin, a question for you on the guidance. Just given the velocity of top line growth, if we combine that with all the moving parts on the P&L from pharmacy and just funding the growth of the business. Can you help us think a little bit about the quarterly cadence of operating margin this year? Can you say that may or may not be kind of aligned with revenue seasonality. Can you just help if there's any kind of revenue to expense mismatch this year that could be a little bit non-obvious to us here in the beginning of the year? Thank you. -- Yeah, I think back to this whole point of ensuring that we have a smooth transition in the workforce into our Philippines and third-party service providers, we're going to be willing to run duplicative cost through the P&L for a period of time which really starts in the first half of the year and is going to continue to be that way through the first half and then start to alleviate towarrds the mid part, the late part of Q3 and into Q4. So with those headwinds I don't think that you should necessarily expect you're going to have significant improvements in operating margin year-over-year in the first half of the year but you ought to see sequential improvements in operating margin take place over the course of the year.Your next question comes from Matt Taylor from UBS. Your line is open. -- Hey Matt, are you there?Okay. We will move on. Next question comes from Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim. Your line is open. -- Thanks. I appreciate the sensitivity around the install base number but you guys have also provided some new color on new patient adds in the past. And I would think at least there definitions would be pretty consistent. Anything you're willing to share for 2018 to help us true up our models on that metric? -- I would tell you that new patient adds were the primary driver of overall growth but very similar to the install base. I think the definition of a new patient is very different across the players in this space. We don't consider a new patient really a patient of ours until they are actually repurchasing and buying a normal purchase patterns for a period of time. I'm not sure if that's consistent across the universe. So even how we define new patients I think is very different across the players in this space. -- Okay. And then Quentin, just trying to nail down the impact of the transmitter and how that flows through. Can you share anything in terms of actually quantifying the magnitude of the cost reduction on the transmitter from where you're today to what this next gen looks like? -- Yeah, we haven't quantified where it can go. It's significant I'll tell you that. The problem with it is the more volume that you're able to push through the plant and the more that you're absorbing in the way of cost, the better it gets. So we're not going to see the full benefit of it in 2019 as we get the full production capacity with it in '20 it becomes more meaningful to us. But we're not going to identify the complete difference or the total difference in that new structure -- new cost structure.And our next question comes from Matt Lismund(ph)from Raymond James. -- Hi, thanks for the questions. I'm on for Jayson Bedford. My question is really about retention levels. So are you seeing with the G6 increased complaints among user base relative to G5 and G4 and how is it here trended? And do you still kind of see room for improved retention levels going forward maybe with the G7? Thanks. -- Our retention levels we've been very pleased with what we've seen with G6 and the teams here have done a really nice job being focused on it and watching it. We have seen some improvements in our ability to retain folks although we've always done a really nice job retaining patients once they've got on to our DexCom technology. But there has been a bit of improvement there. -- This is Kevin. The one thing I will add is our retention is largely been a factor of economic circumstances as well. And what will be interesting for us is as we map and charge G6 particularly as the majority of those patients use the phone app much more than our G5 patients before, I think we can have better pictures going forward in time as we look at what happens in the first quarter where our co-pays and deductibles reset. I think G6 anecdotally we hear everybody likes it a lot better. We still need more data. I mean with all those sales in Q4 we don't know whether those patients are coming back yet. And the biggest reason we lose a patient is money. It's not been the product performance. It's what they can afford and what they can do.Are we still there? -- Oh, thanks, that was my only question, I'm sorry.I'm sorry. Your next question comes from Suraj Kalia from Northland Securities. -- Sure, good afternoon everyone. So Kevin, a lot of pointers you'll have provided and I'm trying to get my hands around it. Let's assume FY '19 around(ph)$1.025 billion right revenues. Can you give us directionally in terms of what the expectation is for the pharmacy channel? And the subpart of that question is, I don't remember you guys giving us a delta between the DME and the pharmacy channel. I guess the reason I'm trying to ask is from let's say six quarters ago to now, gross margins are down roughly 500 bps. I understand the channel mix. I understand the movement of manufacturing, how you're all trying to move OpEx line item agreed. Help us understand or reconcile how your outlook is for the pharmacy channel? And what the price delta is so that we can at least kind of put it into a model and makes sense of that. Thanks for taking my questions. -- This is Kevin. I'll take that one. I'll go back to my old CFO days Quentin, but I won't throw a bunch of numbers out. At the end of the day when we talk about channel mix and channel shifting and the effect on margin, average revenue per patient is not just the pharmacy channel. Again, a larger percentage of our business continues to go through foreign markets. And those foreign markets do have lower average revenue per patient per year. And as that increases, our margins in fact do come down. Medicare as we started was a lower-average revenue per year per patient based on the goods that we ship them versus other. And that was kind of a margin deterrent in the beginning. We think overtime as our costs come down Medicare margins will be very good. With respect to pharmacy and DME mix, we've never disclosed that and there is no magic formula for what the difference is between DME and pharmacy. It literally varies contract. The contract and how we structure each of these arrangements. I think we can do it overtime. -- Yes, Suraj, I would just add to it. The pharmacy model is a very attractive model to us. From an operating margin perspective we're convinced we can make more profit dollars in that business than we can at the DME channel. So we will continue to push for it hard. And while it might weigh on the gross margin a bit, it's going to ultimately be a tailwind for the operating margin. So at the end of the day it's the right thing to be looking at and it's going to be of value creator for us over the long term.And the next question comes from Matt Taylor from UBS. Your line is open. -- Hi, this is (inaudible) on for Matt. Sorry, I was on mute. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two quick ones. So first, what's the percentage of patients currently on G6 versus earlier generation of device? And also can you give us more color on the feedback you received so for for your pilot activities, with if possible G6 CGM? Thank you. -- Well, I can tell you the G6 in the U.S. business, the majority of folks have moved toward G6 in our U.S. commercial business. Obviously, Medicare is still a G5 product. And then the international space we still have a lot of markets that utilize G5 but transitioning into G6. But in the U.S. it's now moved into the majority of folks on G6 in the U.S. You're going to have to repeat your second question. I didn't get it. -- I'm sorry. So the second question is just the feedback you've got so far from your pilot activities with your disposable G6 CGM? -- It's really very small. Nothing really to report there. -- Okay, thank you.And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to Kevin Sayer for final comments. -- Thank you everybody for participating in our call today. Something you may not know is this year is actually DexCom's 20th birthday anniversary. We launched our first product in 2006 and after 10 years of commercial activity we hit the $500 million in annual revenues. But we picked up the next $500 million in annual revenues over the last two years. We're positioning the Company for the next billion dollars in revenues and beyond and I know it's going to go much faster. This is never easy but we are fully, fully committed to having the ideal technology in our pipeline to capitalize on this massive opportunity. As you heard today much of our focus this year in addition to growing our business and pushing the product pipeline is to build the infrastructure necessary to enable us to meet those goals. We look forward to a great 2019 and want to thank everybody once again. Have a great day.Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 21, 2019, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the  will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.This medical device company is expected to pos  of $0.14 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +40%.Revenues are expected to be $330.57 million, up 49.6% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.02% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For DexCom, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -14.29%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that DexCom will beat the consensus EPS estimate.While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the las  ed quarter, it was expected that DexCom would post a loss of $0.12 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.17, delivering a surprise of +241.67%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to bea  expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.DexCom doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 15 different analyst targets contributing to that average for DexCom Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $125.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $170.00. The standard deviation is $14.253.But the whole reason to look at the  DXCM price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with DXCM crossing above that average target price of $149.20/share, investors in DXCM have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $149.20 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

Notably, Claret Medical brought Sentinel (the only cerebral embolic protection system approved in the United States and Europe) to Boston Scientific's Structural Heart portfolio.Per the preliminary fourth-quarter result, sales from the company's IC were up 5.1% on a reported basis (up 7.6% operationally) on a year-over-year basis.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for IC revenues is pegged at $669 million, indicating an increase of 5.2% on a year-over-year basis.In recent quarters, the PI business consistently demonstrated a solid uptick across segments like peripheral arterial disease, venous and interventional oncology. In the last reported quarter, the company commenced the launch of Eluvia in the United States. According to Boston Scientific, Eluvia has significant market opportunity, given the large addressable patient population, differentiated, sustained-release technology and superior clinical outcomes with reduced need for reintervention. We believe, this launch will be accretive to the company's fourth-quarter results.Meanwhile, the preliminary release highlights the fact that in the fourth quarter, the Peripheral Interventions business was up 9.3% (up 11.4%). Accordingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter PI revenues stands at $295 million, reflecting a 6.5% rise year over year.Among the other segments, MedSurg is estimated to demonstrate a steady performance led by endoscopy. Urology and Pelvic Health are also projected to surpass market levels, driven by investment strategies in the key international geographies.Within endoscopy, the company is expected to display sturdy results, riding on a promising EndoChoice performance, particularly in pathology and infection prevention. Urology and Pelvic Health business should also continue to maintain its growth momentum on robust global performance.Boston Scientific's recent acquisitions have added several products (though many are under development) with immense potential to its portfolio. The buyouts of Apama MedicalSecurus Medical in Electrophysiology, Augmenix in Urology along with EmCision in Endoscopy deserve special mention.The company is gradually fortifying its presence in the emerging markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC). In third-quarter 2018, business from the emerging markets registered 20% growth owing to a commendable progress in China and Latin America.Boston Scientific is gaining traction in India as well. It is currently targeting about 10 emerging markets for additional emphasis. The company is also pinning hopes on its core cardiology segment, which is gradually stabilizing with growth in the BRIC nations. This trend is expected to sustain in the to-be-reported quarter as well.However, the ongoing tensions between the United States and China regarding the imposition of tariffs on imports have raised concerns for major MedTech players as a single adverse move might affect top-line numbers in the coming quarters.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $2.56 billion represents an increase of 6.24% from the prior-year quarter.

Following the announcement, share price of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company climbed 2.2% to $66.45 at close.If the company manages to outpace the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the fiscal fourth quarter, it will mark the second consecutive quarterly beat.Over the past month, shares of HealthEquity have rallied 25.7%, higher than the  's 12.5% growth. The current level is also higher than the S&P 500's rally of 6.4%.By the end of fiscal 2019, total custodial assets held by HSA Members totaled $8.1 billion, up 19% from the earlier year. | In fiscal 2019, the company set a record by opening 674,000 new HSAs which helped HAS members add $1.3 billion worth of custodial assets.For fiscal 2019, management at HealthEquity anticipates revenues within $284 million and $287 million. The midpoint of the latest guidance of $285.5 million is above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $284.3 million.Adjusted earnings per share are projected between $1.13 and $1.17, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.12.Additionally, the company provided fiscal 2020 revenue guidance.

In the las  ed quarter, the company's adjusted earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.53%. However, average trailing four-quarter beat was 1.55%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Within Diagnostics, the previous reported quarter witnessed trouble related to certain ransomware attack last July and an adverse impact of hurricane Florence. This induced lower-than-expected organic revenues for that quarter. To counter this effect, LabCorp has come up with its initiative to make certainorganizational changes for strengthening its leadership and operational performance. The company is also on track to launch the next phase of Diagnostics LaunchPad, which will result in multiyear cost savings of a similar magnitude like LaunchPad Phase I (under the drug development business).In the fourth quarter, LabCorp is expected to particularly gain from its collaboration with Walgreens. Per the company, this partnership underpins the LabCorp-Walgreens channel, which is uniquely positioned to deliver a wide range of personalized, integrated, consumer-facing services over time.We are also looking forward to the company's alliance with European provider of clinical laboratory testing, Unilabs. This collaboration has started to broaden the network of laboratories used by biopharmaceutical companies to support companion diagnostic development and commercialization. Per LabCorp, companion diagnostics is a global opportunity and the tie-up with Unilabs is the first step toward extending its companion Dx offering worldwide. | Overall, from the fourth quarter itself, the company expects to deploy more capital for near- and long-term value creation including internal capital investments and strategic acquisitions and partnerships within its Diagnostics wing. However, how much this can contribute to the company's top line in the quarter to be reported is unclear.The company currently projects to report LabCorp Diagnostics revenues for the full year in the range of 2.1-2.5%, a reduction from the earlier-provided band of3-3.5%.Within Covance Drug Development, we note that after suffering a dull phase for several quarters, the segment started to gross higher revenues exactly a year ago on the back of Chiltern acquisition and a strong organic growth profile besides a favorable foreign currency translation.The Chiltern buyout proved accretive to LabCorp's portfolio with the addition of highly complementary capabilities to the company's offerings including scale expansion in the Asia Pacific region, a broader reach in the rapidly-growing emerging and mid-tier biopharma customer segments a well as the company's expertise in the oncology drug development.Apart from Chiltern, LabCorp continues to add Covance's offerings to its portfolio through targeted tuck-in acquisitions and partnerships. The latest on this list is the comprehensive laboratory collaboration with Baptist Health, the largest not-for-profit system in Kentucky. As part of this association, the company will utilize its fully standardized laboratory solutions, operational expertise and a comprehensive test menu to support the delivery of care across eight hospital-based labs. This apart, the company's consolidation of Sciformix Corporation, a scientific process outsourcing company, is projected to cement LabCorp's position in the later phases of drug and device development, particularly for post-marketing pharmacovigilance and market access solutions.All these factors should together constantly benefit the top line at LabCorp's Covance Drug Development in the yet-to-be reported quarter.The company is also optimistic about the development regarding its multi-year project, LaunchPad. LabCorp currently remains on track to deliver $150 million of net savings from Covance LaunchPad by the end of 2020 and $30 million of cost synergies from the integration of Chiltern by the end of 2019.Overall, the company currently expects 2018 Covance Drug Development revenue growth within 24-26%.Per LabCorp's modified guidance for 2018, revenue rise is anticipated in the 9.9-10.3% band from 2017. Adjusted EPS forecast for the current year lies within the $10.95-$11.05 range.Our proven Zacks model conclusively shows that a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .LabCorp has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP.

Further, rampant M&As and the modernization of 510 (k)-clearance pathway is likely to help the dominant Medical Instruments players gain leverage in the space. Strong performance of Medical Instruments companies in emerging economies, especially in the Asia/Pacific and Western Europe markets, is likely to fuel fourth-quarter results. These companies are likely to benefit from an expanding customer base, relaxed regulations, cheap skilled labor, increasing wealth and government focus on healthcare infrastructure. Sector participants are expected to gain from the slashed tax rate to 21% from 35%, dropping the U.S. combined rate from 38.9% to 25.7%. This has aided margin growth and the trend is likely to continue in this quarter.Also, a bipartisan two-year suspension of a 2.3% excise tax on Medical Instruments and Medical Device manufacturers at the beginning of 2018 has encouraged massive investments in the Medical Instruments sector. Both the developments are expected to boost hiring and investment among U.S.-based Medical Instruments manufacturers. Last November, the FDA attempted to modernize the 510(k)-clearance pathway. For investors' knowledge, the 510(k) is a premarket submission made by MedTech companies to the FDA to validate a medical device as safe and effective. According to a December article published in Investing News, \"the changes are meant to create a safer product for patients while holding companies accountable for any safety discrepancies, all while holding on to the FDA's gold standard for safety.\" This is likely to favorably impact fourth-quarter results to some extent. Favorable consumer behavior and improving expenditure patterns are likely to benefit Medical Instruments manufacturers in the fourth quarter. It is encouraging to note that the U.S. healthcare expenditures are expected to rise from $3.3 trillion in 2016 to $5.7 trillion in 2026 (Mercer Capital), indicating average annual growth of 5.5%.This apart, America's exceptional purchasing power along with solid demand for medical products, medical instruments, medical services and lab equipment has provided the nation a leading position in the global Medical Instruments space.The U.S.-China trade war has triggered a short-term downtrend in the Medical Instruments sector.According to a survey conducted by the Medical Imaging & Technology Alliance (\"MITA\"), tariffs will cost Medical Instruments companies nearly $138 million every year. This might show on Medical Instruments companies' fourth-quarter results.For instance, Varian Medical  reported first-quarter fiscal 2019 results last month. The company's revenues were negatively impacted by $8 million due to U.S.-China trade war. Total operating earnings and earnings per share were declined by $11 million. Moreover, the core Oncology segment's operating earnings declined 10% year over year due to tariffs.Given the high degree of diversity in the Medical Instruments industry, finding the right stocks with the potential to beat estimates might be quite a daunting task.However, our proprietary Zacks methodology, makes this routine fairly simple for investors.Investors can narrow down the choices by focusing on stocks that have the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

And thanks to the launch last spring of the G6, its latest system, 2018 was a banner year for the company.Image source: Getty Images.Preliminary figures unveiled in early January show sales increased 42% year over year to $1.025 billion in 2018, including sales of $331 million in the fourth quarter, up over 50% from Q4 2017. The figures were particularly surprising given that management had said in early December it expected sales of just $975 million for 2018, implying fourth-quarter revenue of $281.4 million based on sales through the first nine months of the year.Management also outlined a goal for sales in 2019 to grow between 15% to 20% -- or between $1.175 billion and $1.225 billion. That's in keeping with its outlook for compound annual revenue growth of 15% through 2023.Typical insulin-dependent diabetics spend about 70% of their day outside their desired blood sugar range. And since inadequate control of their blood sugar can lead to life-threatening disease progression, technology that can improve insight into highs and lows is important to achieving better outcomes.In the future, DexCom aims to launch cheap, disposable sensors that could expand its market opportunity from about 3 million insulin-intensive people in the U.S. today to over 30 million type 1 and type 2 patients.

(NYSE: ABT) and  (NASDAQ: DXCM) market devices that allow for convenient monitoring of blood sugar levels without the need for daily finger sticks.The success of these companies' glucose monitors for diabetic patients has helped make Abbott Labs' and DexCom's shareholders winners, too. Last year, while many stocks languished, Abbott Labs' share price jumped nearly 27% and DexCom's share price more than doubled.But which of these stocks is the better pick for investors now? Here's how Abbott Labs and DexCom stack up against each other.Image source: Getty Images.Abbott Labs' FreeStyle Libre continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system has been one of the most successful products ever for diabetes patients. Abbott CEO Miles White  that global sales for FreeStyle Libre doubled in 2018 from the previous year to more than $1 billion.Momentum for FreeStyle Libre is picking up rather than slowing. In the fourth quarter alone, Abbott added 300,000 new users for the product -- almost as many devices as the entire user base of the No. 2 competitor in the market. The company also already launched a second version of the product in Europe that includes optional alarms for patients to warn them when glucose levels are out of range. White said that this new version \"should come to the U.S. shortly.\"But Abbott's success isn't driven just by its diabetes products. The company's Alinity line of lab diagnostics systems also continues to be a huge winner, even though its launch has been limited for the most part to Europe so far. As Abbott fully rolls out the Alinity products in the U.S. and Asia and extends the functionality to additional areas including molecular diagnostics, sales will likely skyrocket. The company's structural heart portfolio of products is also performing very well and should continue to do so.Abbott also makes around 39% of its total revenue from established pharmaceuticals and nutritional products. Both units generated solid sales growth last year and contribute significantly to the company's strong cash flow.Fast-growing new products and a broad array of other products and services have enabled Abbott Labs to deliver great value to shareholders. The company recently boosted its dividend payout by 14.3% -- its 47th consecutive year of dividend increases. With Abbott's dividend now yielding 1.8% and analysts projecting average annual earnings growth of nearly 12% over the next five years, the stock should remain a winner.Don't worry that DexCom has existed for only a fraction of the time that Abbott Labs has been around. The company's annual revenue and share price have soared thanks in large part to its G6 CGM system.Like Abbott's FreeStyle Libre, DexCom's G6 doesn't require daily finger sticks for calibration. But the G6 goes even further. The only time it requires finger sticks is when readings don't match symptoms or expectations. Other CGM systems, including FreeStyle Libre, can require finger sticks in other events, such as during the first few hours of readings and when symptoms of high or low blood sugar are present.In addition, the G6 system is integrated with insulin patch pumps, smart insulin pens, and insulin pumps from key manufacturers. Probably the most important integration is with  's insulin pump. The combination of DexCom's G6 and Tandem's X2 provides a closed-loop system that continually monitors glucose levels and automatically administers insulin when needed.The G6 isn't DexCom's first CGM, though, and it won't be its last. DexCom is already working with Verily, a subsidiary of  , on developing the G7 CGM. This device could offer a fully disposable, real-time glucose monitoring system at relatively low costs.DexCom's opportunity in diabetes is huge. Of the estimated 415 million people with diabetes, only 50% are diagnosed. And only 6% of the total number of individuals with diabetes achieve their desired outcomes.Wall Street appears to be sold on the company's potential. Analysts project that DexCom will increase its earnings by a whopping 140% annually on average over the next five years.Both Abbott Labs and DexCom have great products and track records. So which is the better stock to buy right now? I think it depends on your investing style.More conservative investors will prefer Abbott. The company is a Dividend Aristocrat that offers an attractive dividend with solid growth prospects as well. Abbott's broad scope of operations also gives the company diversification into multiple areas.Aggressive investors, on the other hand, might like DexCom better. DexCom is a pure-play bet on the growing diabetes market with arguably the best CGM product.Both Abbott and DexCom are  , with Abbott offering more than just a focus on diabetes. I don't think long-term investors will go wrong buying either stock.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Per management, overseas revenue growth was backed by strong performance by all three segments in the quarter.China saw growth of 13.3% from the year-ago quarter, reflecting strength in the Life Science and Interventional segments. The core BD Medical segment excelled in China.For fiscal 2019, BD expects growth of about 10% in emerging economies along with low double-digit growth in China.Management at BD expects a few headwinds to mar prospects in fiscal 2019.BD expects raw material pricing pressure, which increased in 2018, to accelerate into fiscal 2019, primarily due to resin price increases owing to a supply-constrained market. Although pressure from raw materials partially eased in the fiscal first quarter, management expects a 2% headwind from it in fiscal 2019.Additionally, BD expects a 1% headwind from tariffs in 2019.

Revenues from the test rose 33.3% year over year in the las  ed quarter.During the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the company announced the finalization of LCD from Noridian for EndoPredict, thereby expanding the test's coverage to around 90% of the U.S. market.Further, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom issued a revised Diagnostics Consultation Document (DCD) that covers EndoPredict as one of the three approved prognostic tests. Notably, the company projects more than 26,000 breast cancer patients in the United Kingdom annually, which would be eligible for breast cancer prognostic signature. Also, in December 2018, NICE included EndoPredict in its recommendations for guiding adjuvant chemotherapy decisions for patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative early breast cancer and are lymph node-negative. These new developments should add to the top-line in the to-be-reported quarter.Prolaris testing volumes grew 59% year over year in the last reported quarter. We are encouraged by the company's receipt positive reimbursement medical coverage decision from Blue Shield of California. Per management, with this development, another 4 million people got commercial coverage under the scope of Prolaris testing, resulting in coverage for 56% of prostate cancer patients.Furthermore, Myriad Genetics' receipt of seven new commercial coverage decisions for the Prolaris test is expected to contribute to the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.We expect Myriad Genetics to continue to see year-over-year growth in Hereditary Cancer volumes.The fiscal fourth quarter was the seventh consecutive quarter in which the company witnessed year-over-year Hereditary cancer volume growth. Further, Myriad Genetics is also witnessing impressive demand for metastatic breast cancer testing.In October, Myriad Genetics announced the receipt of FDA approval for using its BRACAnalysis CDx as a companion diagnostic with Pfizer's PARP (poly ADP ribose polymerase) inhibitor, TALZENNA (talazoparib). Fortifying its foothold internationally, the company has been receiving encouraging response for its BRACAnalysis CDx in Japan for metastatic breast cancer.All these factors are expected to maintain the momentum in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Myriad Genetics is upbeat about its consistent product diversification strategy which shows significant momentum in Vectra DA volumes. The company is optimistic about the strong clinical evidence for Vectra DA.In this regard, the company announced results from two studies confirming Vectra test's ability to significantly predict response to tofacitinib and track response to rituximab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis in October. Moreover, Myriad Genetics informed about endorsement of its Vectra testing for adults with rheumatoid arthritis by large professional organization empowering community rheumatologists - Bendcare - in the United States in the same month. All these developments are likely to boost contribution from the test in the fiscal second quarter's earnings results.Management has provided the guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The company estimates adjusted earnings per share of 36-38 cents on total revenues of $216-$218 million.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter revenues of $218.5 million reflects a rise of 12.6% from the year-ago quarter.Per our proven model, a stock needs to have a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter.

(Surgical, Sports Medicine, Foot and Ankle, Extremities and Trauma) arm, backed by a firm focus on priority areas like quality remediation, supply recovery and product launches.The company is receiving a consistent positive feedback on the already marketed products. Within Sports, Comprehensive Baseplate, Sidus Stem-Free Shoulder and jogger stitch are anticipated to see a positive response. Within Extremities and Trauma subcategories, the company is investing a lot as well. We are also optimistic about a strong customer uptake of the company's Comprehensive Augmented Baseplate. | Management keeps envisioning a better show within S.E.T. during the second half of 2018 as compared to the first half.However, the company earlier noted that, it is going to deal with a much more challenging comps in the fourth quarter as compared to the third. This apart, the sequentially last reported quarter reaped notable timing benefits with regard to both tenders and capital sales on the tender front, both in Asia-Pacific and EMEA. This benefit is seemingly not visible in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. Meanwhile, the company's S.E.T business has been of late massively hit by supply issues and a persistent pricing pressure.We expect all these factors to impact the company's fourth-quarter top line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for S.E.T. revenues of $455 million remains marginally above $454 million, recorded in fourth-quarter 2017.Looking at the focused execution of Zimmer Biomet's sales teams, we expect the global adoption rate of the flagship personalized knee system - Persona - to be impressive.The company is seeing a very good uptake of the more recently released Persona Trabecular Metal Tibia.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Knee revenues stands at $730 million as compared to $731 million in the prior-year quarter.Within Hip business, we anticipate the company to render a sturdy performance in the Asia-Pacific region. In the previously reported quarter, the company registered 8.6% sales growth at constant currency exchange rate within Hip in the aforementioned geography. Our consensus estimate for Hip revenues from Asia Pacific is pegged at $136 million, which reflects a 28.3% rise from the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $500 million for Hip revenues shows a 0.2% rise from the year-ago level.However, Zimmer Biomet was grappled with pricing pressure of approximately (2.5%) during the fourth quarter. In absence of any favorable changes along these lines, the headwinds might affect the company's impending quarterly results.Overall, fourth-quarter total revenues are projected at $2.06 billion, indicating a 0.67% decline from the year-earlier quarter.Our proven Zacks model clearly shows that a company with a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has good chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

In the las  ed quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.14%. Notably, the stock outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four reported quarters, the average being 6.37%.Let's take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.IDEXX should continue with its momentum in the fourth quarter, courtesy of a strong global rise in Companion Animal Group (CAG) Diagnostics' revenues. In the third quarter, this upside was driven by strong consistent gains from recurring CAG revenues, high premium CAG instrument placements and consistent high growth in digital business. This trend is expected to be retained further.In terms of 2018 outlook, IDEXX expects to deliver full-year organic growth trend in CAG Diagnostic recurring revenues to be around 13.2%, supported by steady strong growth in the United States and expanding international consumable revenues. | The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $474 million for CAG Diagnostics revenues represents an 9.4% improvement over the last reported quarter.For the fourth quarter, the company anticipates revenue growth in the range of 7-9%, net of an estimated 2% foreign exchange headwind. IDEXX hopes to retain high recurring CAG Diagnostic revenue gains in the quarter under review, aided by sustaining strong trends in the United States.The company is projecting moderate overall organic growth in the 9-11% band related to tough prior-year comparisons in global instrument placements and expectations for lower revenues in LPD (Livestock and Poultry Diagnostics) business. In this regard, the company forecasts mid to high single-digit revenue declines in LPD organic revenues for the fourth quarter.We pin considerable hopes on progress in the Water Business, lying on a growth trajectory of late on the back of encouraging test results in the United States and benefits drawn from the global go-direct initiatives. Moreover, the business witnessed 9% organic strength in the last reported quarter.The company earlier stated that it is perfectly on track for a continued high-single digit organic revenue boost in this business through 2018. The consensus mark for Water revenues stands at $30.98 million for the yet-to-be-reported period, translating into a 7.3% improvement from the year-ago number.IDEXX constantly expands its global footprint. It has been significantly getting advantages from bountiful opportunities in the emerging companion animal diagnostics markets. Further, management's regular share buybacks underscore the company's robust free cash flow reserve.On the flip side, adverse foreign currency movement is a major headwind. Another concern is the company's heavy reliance on third-party distributors. The purchasing dynamics of distributors leave a significant impact on the company's sales of instrument consumables and its rapid assay products. Moreover, IDEXX has been witnessing a rise in operating expenses due to increased head count along with higher investments in portfolio development as well as expansion in the United States and internationally.Additionally, a competitive landscape in the domestic and overseas markets weighs on IDEXX's performance. Thus, the struggle to gain market traction might be a drag, which in turn, can hurt fourth-quarter results.Our proven Zacks model clearly shows that a company with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has higher chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .IDEXX has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, it has an Earnings ESP of -0.28%, which leaves surprise prediction inconclusive as the company also needs a positive ESP to be confident about a likely surprise.

The company registered growth at CER across all geographical regions. However, in this quarter, device sales in France and Japan were impacted as customers completed their connected device upgrade programs.The company expects this impact to persist in the next few quarters.Overall, the company achieved high-single-digit global revenue growth in the reported quarter, led by strong sales from Software-as-a-Service businesses as well as new mask products and devices.

The segment has been seeing solid growth across all product categories.Edwards Lifesciences is also set to keep gaining from Critical Care technologies with the rollout of HemoSphere monitoring platform supported by new group purchasing organization contracts in the United States.Last December, the company announced that the HemoSphere advanced hemodynamic monitoring platform received FDA approval for the Acumen suite of intelligent decision-support solutions. | TheZacks Consensus Estimate for Critical Care product group sales of $171 million shows an increase of 4.3% from the year-ago quarter.We are also upbeat about the Surgical Structural Heart product group which should continue to see solid uptake of its new premium aortic valves along with solid aortic unit volume. Further, the company has initiated the launch of its INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve in Japan which is likely to contribute to the top line in the to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, buoyed by continued adoption of INTUITY Elite valve system, management expects it to continue to drive the top line in the fourth quarter.This apart, INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve is witnessing encouraging demand in the United States since its rollout initiated last January.TheZacks Consensus Estimate for Surgical Structural Heart product sales of $208 million reflects a rise of 1.5% from the year-ago quarter.Here are a few  that might influence Edwards Lifesciences' fourth-quarter results:Edwards Lifesciences has been seeing consistent performance by the Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy (THVT) segment. However, during the third-quarter earnings announcement, Edwards Lifesciences noted that it is expecting the 2018 underlying sales growth in THVT to remain sluggish, at around 12.5% because of limited contribution from Cardioband Tricuspid Annular Reduction System and a newly-revised controlled rollout strategy for SAPIEN 3 Ultra.Notably, in transcatheter tricuspid repair, constrained by supply, clinicians are treating a limited number of patients in Europe with Cardioband. With this, in the third quarter, sales were limited to $1 million in both mitral and tricuspid programs. Management expects this trend to continue in the fourth quarter as well.Meanwhile, last November, Edwards Lifesciences received CE mark for the SAPIEN 3 Ultra system for transcatheter aortic valve replacement in severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis patients.Accordingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total THV sales of $594 million shows an increase of 10% from the year-ago quarter.Overall, the company projects sales between $950 million and $1 billion in the to-be-reported quarter.

The company's earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the past four quarters, the average beat being 3.5%.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Hologic recently announced preliminary revenue results for first-quarter fiscal 2019. The company projects an impressive performance in the quarter and expects to surpass its expectations on the revenue front.Per the preliminary announcement, Hologic expects total revenues to increase approximately 5% (up 5.7% at constant exchange rate or CER) on a year-over-year basis to $831 million in the to-be-reported quarter, well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $818.4 million. This also exceeds the company's earlier provided revenue guidance of $800-$815 million. Solid top line is primarily expected on the back of growth across a majority of Hologic's segments. (Please read:  )Hologic is optimistic about riding on strength in the Breast Health segment in the to-be-reported quarter. There has been consistent rise in market share within Breast Health on the back of direct-to-consumer initiatives, introduction of products, and software and services along with strong mammography systems portfolio. | Management seems upbeat about the buyout of Focal Therapeutics and Faxitron Bioptics. These acquisitions are aimed to broaden the Breast Health portfolio and strengthen Hologic's position in the breast-conserving surgery market.Additionally, the company's adoption of mammography systems, 3Dimensions and 3D Performance encourages us. These products started to leverage the company's Genius brand and encouraged customers to upgrade their existing 2D systems.In this regard, the receipt of PMA from the FDA for Clarity HD high-resolution 3D imaging and Intelligent 2D imaging technology is noteworthy. These products are now available in the 3Dimensions breast tomosynthesis system.Further, global sales of interventional breast products - mainly biopsy systems and disposables - have been rising consistently. Increase in Affirm prone table sales is another positive. The company projects that Brevera, new real-time biopsy system, will continue to drive growth in fiscal 2018.Hologic also has a CE Mark for the Brevera breast biopsy system, with CorLumina imaging technology, real-time breast biopsy and verification system.As per the preliminary result, Hologic expects to report Breast Health (39.1% of total revenues) revenues of $325 million, up 12.8% on a year-over-year basis.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for interventional breast solutions revenues is pegged at $61 million, marking rise of 17.3% from the prior-year quarter. The consensus estimate for Mammography/Breast Care revenues is pegged at $319 million, which reflects an increase of 10.8% from the year-ago quarter.Other factors that are likely to influence Hologic's results in the fiscal first quarter are as follows:The company expects the Diagnostics segment to maintain a stellar performance on strength in the Molecular Diagnostics business. In the United States, it is likely to gain from increasing market share and utilization of the Panther system along with market expansion by conforming to testing guidelines.Global growth in the Molecular Diagnostics segment can be attributed to the Panther system, Hologic's fully-automated molecular diagnostics instrument. In October, Hologic boosted its portfolio of respiratory assays available for Panther Fusion, with the receipt of CE mark for its Panther Fusion Bordetella assay. Moreover, the company's receipt of FDA approval for its Group B  (GBS) assay on the Panther Fusion system encourages us.The frequent utilization of Aptima women's health assays is another catalyst.Notably, Aptima assays gained a huge customer base, with respect to testing for chlamydia and gonorrhea, HPV (human papillomavirus), and trichomonas. We are also hopeful about Hologic's expanded market for sexually transmitted disease testing.The company is seeing strong demand for virology tests as well. A similar trend is expected to be maintained in the to-be-reported quarter.As per the preliminary result, Hologic expects to report Diagnostics (35.7% of total revenues) revenues of $297 million, up 4.2% on a year-over-year basis.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $160 million for Molecular Diagnostics revenues reflects an increase of 7.4% from the year-ago quarter.Management is highly optimistic about international performance as well. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, international revenues rose 4.5%, primarily on strong contribution from the Molecular Diagnostics, Breast Health and Gyn Surgical businesses. This trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.On the flip side, Hologic has faced challenges like unfavorable foreign currency movement over the past few quarters. Escalating operating expenses and intense competition, particularly in the tomosynthesis market, are persisting headwinds.Per the proven Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has higher chances of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .Hologic currently has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +2.19%.

The year-over-year decline was largely due to a drop in gross profit margin.Net sales in the reported quarter remained flat year over year at $60.1 million.In the reported quarter, reorder sales increased 4.6% to $53.3 million on a year-over-year basis, while new order sales declined 26.1% to $6.8 million. Per the company, growing online rivalry affected new order sales.Average order value was approximately $84 in the quarter compared with $86 a year ago. The decline can be attributed to more aggressive pricing. Per the company, the seasonality in its business is mainly because of the proportion of flea, tick and heartworm medications in the product mix. Spring and summer are considered peak seasons, while fall and winter represent off-seasons. | During the quarter under review, PetMed acquired 81,000 new customers compared with 106,000 a year ago.Gross margin contracted 420 basis points (bps) year over year to 32.3% in the quarter under review. The contraction was mainly led by extra discounts provided to the consumers.General and administrative expenses remained almost flat year over year at $5.8 million. However, advertising expenses declined 12.2% to $3.6 million. Adjusted operating margin (without including depreciation expenses) declined 340 bps to 16.6% from the year-ago quarter.PetMed exited the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $93.2 million, compared with $87.1 million at the end of second-quarter fiscal 2019. The company also declared a quarterly dividend of 27 cents per share, payable to shareholders on record as of Feb 15, 2019.PetMed's fiscal third-quarter earnings were hit by growing competition which forced the company to offer additional discounts to customers. This also had a negative impact on gross margin. However, the company expects to gain momentum in the online market by opting for more aggressive pricing and promotion strategies and shelling out more on advertisements.A few top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are BioTelemetry, Inc.  , ABIOMED, Inc.  and DexCom, Inc.  .BioTelemetry is expected to release fourth-quarter 2018 results on Feb 28.

The product is already available across Canada, Australia, New Zealand and most of Europe with more launches planned in other geographies, scheduled for late 2019.This device has a top-of-head connection that keeps tubing out of the wearers' way, letting them comfortably move and sleep in any position. Its nasal cradle cushion reduces facial markings and irritation.Per the company, in comparison to other popular nasal top-of-head masks, three of four users preferred AirFit N30i over the traditional ones.Globally, over 100 million are estimated to be afflicted with sleep apnea (per an article published in The Sleep Zone).

Of course, there's always the question about whether the momentum is sustainable.Three healthcare stocks definitely enjoying strong momentum right now are  (NASDAQ: DXCM) ,  (NASDAQ: REGN) , and  (NYSE: RMD) . All three of these stocks recently hit 52-week highs, with two of the three setting all-time highs.What's the reason behind the impressive momentum for DexCom, Regeneron, and ResMed? And are these high-flying stocks still buys?Image source: Getty Images.DexCom doesn't just have one reason for its strong momentum. It  .The medical-device maker reported strong revenue and earnings growth throughout 2018. DexCom consistently beat analysts' earnings estimates. The company benefited from favorable Medicare decisions that expanded access to Medicare patients for its products. And, perhaps most important, DexCom received regulatory approvals in the U.S. and Europe for a new product that should fuel growth for a long time to come.In March 2018, the Food and Drug Administration approved DexCom's G6 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. European approval for the G6 product came three months later. Unlike previous CGM systems, DexCom's G6 doesn't require fingersticks for calibration of the device. It also included other new features including a one-touch simple insertion of the sensor applicator and predictive alert for low blood sugar levels.The convenience of the G6 CGM is proving to be very popular with diabetic patients. DexCom hasn't officially reported its 2018 financial results yet, but the company expects year-over-year revenue growth will be in the ballpark of 42%. It also thinks that sales could jump between 15% and 20% in 2019.2018 was an up-and-down year for Regeneron, but the big biotech is definitely on an upswing now. Regeneron's newfound strength appears to stem largely from investors' optimism about the biotech's prospects for winning new indications for two key drugs.Regeneron's flagship product is Eylea. The blockbuster eye-disease drug generates over 60% of Regeneron's total revenue. The company hopes to win yet another indication for Eylea in May when the FDA is scheduled to announce an approval for the drug in treating diabetic retinopathy.The biotech's No. 2 moneymaker is Dupixent. Regeneron and partner  won FDA approval for the drug in treating atopic dermatitis (eczema) in 2017, followed by approval for moderate-to-severe asthma in October 2018. The two drugmakers seek to add an expanded atopic dermatitis indication for adolescent patients between the ages of 12 and 17, as well as obtain European approval for Dupixent in treating asthma.Investors also have great expectations for Regeneron's new skin-cancer drug, Libtayo. Regeneron and Sanofi secured FDA approval for the drug in treating cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma in September 2018 and now await European approval. Despite tough competition, Libtayo could become another blockbuster in Regeneron's lineup.ResMed's success over the last year resulted from a combination of solid financial performance and several strategic acquisitions. Although the stock fell in the midst of the broader market pullback that started in October, shares have bounced back in a major way since then.It certainly didn't hurt that the medical-device company, which primarily focuses on treating sleep apnea and other respiratory diseases,  . ResMed announced on Oct. 25, 2018, that its adjusted earnings per share jumped 23% year over year.ResMed acquired HEALTHCAREfirst in May 2018. This deal bolstered ResMed's presence in the home-care software-as-a-service market. The company picked up another software provider in November with its $750 million acquisition of MatrixCare, which has over 15,000 customers in the long-term and post-acute care market.While the HEALTHCAREfirst and MatrixCare deals were outside of ResMed's core business focus, the company announced another acquisition in December that wasn't. ResMed is buying Propeller Health for $225 million. Propeller Health provides connected health solutions for people living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma.DexCom, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, and ResMed are solid companies with good growth prospects. But I think that only one of these stocks is a buy right now.Regeneron's future looks better now than it has over the last couple of years. However, the biotech is highly reliant on Eylea. My concern is that Eylea could run into serious competition in the not-too-distant future from  ' late-stage eye-disease drug brolucizumab.ResMed's sleep apnea device business should keep rocking along. But with the stock's gains in 2018, I'm not convinced that ResMed will deliver consistent market-beating growth over the next few years.That leaves DexCom. The launch of DexCom's G6 CGM is still only in its early stages. Significant growth opportunities remain, especially in the Medicare patient population and outside of the U.S. Of the estimated 415 million people worldwide with diabetes, only 50% have been diagnosed. Many of those still don't receive care.I'm also optimistic about the potential for the G7 CGM that DexCom is developing with  subsidiary Verily. This device is a fully disposable CGM that's simple and cost-effective. DexCom likes to say that the G7 is \"the future of CGM technology.\" That's probably not an exaggeration.DexCom stock looks ridiculously expensive based on earnings multiples. However, I think the stock could still provide great returns over the long run.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and DexCom wasn't one of them!

With such a large population suffering from the condition, it's clearly a disease that gets much attention and investment. We asked three of our contributors to pick a company worth watching that is addressing some aspect of the illness, and they selected  (NYSE: ABT) ,  (NASDAQ: DXCM) , and  (NYSE: NVO) .Image source: Getty Images. While the broader market floundered in 2018, Abbott Labs turned in a great performance. Shares of the medical device company soared nearly 27%. The diabetes market was key to Abbott's success.In  in October, CEO Miles White highlighted the great launch for the company's Freestyle Libre continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system that doesn't require finger sticks. White said that more than 1 million customers now use the product, an impressive number to achieve in a relatively short time. Sales for Freestyle Libre more than doubled year over year to over $300 million.Expect Freestyle Libre to continue to drive growth for Abbott in the future. The company also hopes to win U.S. approval to launch version two of the product, which includes an alarm feature that lets users know when their glucose levels are too low or too high.But Abbott Labs has a lot more going for it. The company is the global leader in minimally invasive surgical solutions for leaky heart valves. And Abbott continues to generate growth from its established pharmaceuticals, nutrition, and electrophysiology businesses.Abbott has two products to watch in addition to Freestyle Libre. The first is its MitraClip device for mitral valve repair. There's a lot of growth potential for MitraClip, especially if Abbott wins an expanded indication for the device (approval from the FDA for use in more situations). The company also has a pivotal study underway for a new product, Tendyne, that could enable the replacement of damaged mitral heart valves without open-heart surgery.Innovations like Freestyle Libre in diabetes and Tendyne in structural heart devices make Abbott Labs a stock to keep your eyes on -- in January and beyond. What does disruption look like to an investor? How about going from $40 million in annual sales to over $1 billion in annual sales in eight years? That's impressive, but it may only hint at the revenue opportunity ahead for DexCom, the leading maker of continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) for diabetes patients.In the past, patients with insulin-intensive diabetes had to rely on many finger sticks to provide point-in-time insight into blood sugar. Historically, the haphazard insight offered by finger sticks meant the average patient spent 70% of their time outside their desired blood sugar range, which put them at risk of new symptoms including cardiovascular disease, nerve damage, and blindness -- or even death.That's not the case anymore. Today, DexCom's CGMs provide real-time insight into blood sugar without the need for finger sticks, giving patients, caregivers, and doctors an  to manage disease.DexCom estimates its current addressable market of insulin-intensive type and type 2 diabetes patients is 3.2 million; however, advances that will make CGMs smarter, smaller, and cheaper could increase that market significantly. Addressing the gestational diabetes market could increase its target market by about 800,000 patients; monitoring patients in hospitals would add about 10 million patients; and serving the entire type 2 diabetes population expands the addressable population to roughly 27 million in the U.S alone.DexCom's  grew 42% year over year, in part because its newest CGM, the G6, is a part of the  device from  (NASDAQ: TNDM) . In 2019 sales are expected to grow up to 20% as the G6 launch spreads. Sales could accelerate even faster when DexCom's next CGM -- the G7 -- is launched in 2020. With double-digit growth on tap and a massive and growing market, I think DexCom's a great stock to consider adding to portfolios now. Diabetes happens either because your own body can't produce insulin (type 1) or because your body has become resistant to the insulin it does produce (type 2). For patients suffering from type 1 diabetes and many who suffer from type 2, treatment with insulin is a critical part of managing the disease. With over 100 million Americans suffering from either diabetes or prediabetes, it's clearly a huge disease -- and insulin is a huge part of fighting it.That's what makes Novo Nordisk an incredibly important company to watch. Novo Nordisk produces about half the insulin sold commercially around the world. That makes it something of a barometer when it comes to the overall state of the diabetes industry, and certainly makes it worth watching for investors interested in treating the condition.Its large market position in the fight against a huge disease gives Novo Nordisk a certain amount of pricing power. It recently increased prices on its insulin products by around 5%, showcasing its belief that it will be able to maintain its strong market position despite those higher prices.While there's talk of a  on the horizon, the unfortunate likelihood is that diabetes will be with us for a long time to come. And should a cure actually come about, chances are decent that Novo Nordisk will play a role there too. That makes Novo Nordisk a contender for consideration not just for this month, but for the long haul as well.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

We believe the company is set to gain from its flagship Impella product line.ABIOMED reported second-quarter fiscal 2019 earnings of 81 cents per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11%. Adjusted earnings skyrocketed 84.1% from the year-ago quarter's tally.Revenues came in at $181.8 million, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $175.3 million. The top line also increased 36.9% from the prior-year quarter's figure.In the trailing three quarters, ABIOMED delivered average positive earnings surprise of 18.8%. | The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ABIOMED's third-quarter earnings is pegged at 94 cents, mirroring 34.3% improvement year over year. The same for revenues stands at $200.6 million, reflecting an increase of 30.2% year over year.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings release.ABIOMED's flagship product line, Impella, has consistently provided a boost to the top line. Impella is a support system of percutaneous, catheter-based devices offering hemodynamic support to the heart. In the las  ed quarter, Impella contributed 96.4% to ABIOMED's net sales. Meanwhile, U.S. Impella revenues rose 38% to $175.3 million on a year-over-year basis.Notably, ABIOMED has been progressing well with SmartAssist, Impella Connect, IQ Impella Quality Assurance Database, cVAD and NCSI platforms. Furthermore, there is a growing physician awareness on Impella's ability to protect against acute kidney injury.ABIOMED recently announced preliminary results for third-quarter fiscal 2019. Revenues are anticipated to come in at $200.6 million, up 30% year over year.ABIOMED expects to see a solid contribution from its core Impella product line. Per management, domestic revenues from Impella products are expected to surge 27% on a year-over-year basis to $165.5 million. In the quarter under review, U.S. patient usage is anticipated to improve 24%. Outside the United States, Impella product revenues are projected to be $27.5 million, up 59% year over year.The quarter also witnessed strong sales in Germany and Japan. Moreover, ABIOMED's Impella utilization is accelerating at a remarkable pace, with an increasing number of hospitals and customer sites purchasing the same.These apart, ABIOMED raised its fiscal 2019 guidance. For the fiscal year, the company expects revenues to be approximately $780 million, up from $765-$770 million projected earlier. This shows an increase of 31% from the prior-year figure.We believe that ABIOMED will have a strong foothold in the coronary heart diseases market in the United States.

Earnings improved 11.2% year over year and were within the company's guidance.The company reported revenues of $3.24 billion, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.26 billion by a narrow margin.

Revenues in the segment came in at $1.44 billion, up 10.4% at constant currency (cc).It is encouraging to note that, for the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment's revenues stands at $1.69 billion, up 7.2% year over year.MedSurg has three subsegments - Endoscopy, Instruments and Medical.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Endoscopy revenues is pegged at $505 million, up 7.7% year over year.

The rule mentions certain price transparency requirements for the U.S. hospitals, which are now asked to post a list of 'charge prices' on thousands of services. Analysts believe this will benefit patients as they would know the cost of medical services before committing to those.Meanwhile, over the past year, the Medical Services industry has rallied 13.7% against the S&P 500 index's 6.4% decline.Let's also find out some other factors that make the Medical Services space a prospective one for investors.The Medical Services industry essentially comprises third-party service providers and care givers that are appointed by core healthcare companies. Notably, these providers offer home-based services as well which have been slowly gaining popularity, backed by the growing old population in the United States.

In 2018, retail bigwig Amazon  also acquired online pharmacy PillPack, with an aim to offer prescription coordination and home delivery to consumers.Going by a report in CNBC, each day, about 10,000 seniors turn 65 in the United States. This has boosted the demand for home-based care in the country.Zion Market Research predicts the global home healthcare market to generate revenues of $391.41 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 9.4%. The research further shows that North America has, by far, the largest share in the space and is set to continue its dominance till 2021.A significant reduction in regulatory and tax burden on U.S. healthcare companies is creating opportunities for mobile and wireless medical technology companies. DexCom's  G6 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System deserves a mention in this regard.This apart, treatments are also becoming less invasive with shorter recovery times. Accordingly, terms like 'bed less hospitals' have become trend of the future.

This forms a candlestick that resembles a hammer, and it can suggest that the market has found a low point in the stock, and that better days are ahead.Plus, earnings estimates have been rising for this company, even despite the sluggish trading lately. In just the past 60 days alone 12 estimates have gone higher, compared to none lower, while the consensus estimate has also moved in the right direction.Estimates have actually risen so much that the stock now has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) suggesting this relatively unloved stock could be due for a breakout soon.

Here's why each of them is a great buy today.Image source: Getty Images.Align is the company behind the Invisalign system. The company sells a series of clear aligners to patients with misaligned teeth, which is an attractive alternative to metal-and-wire braces.Beyond selling directly to consumers, Align also sells an intra-oral scanner called iTero to orthodontists that produces 3D images of patients' teeth.

The great news for investors is that Align's management team believes that it has still only captured about 13% of its current addressable market.

The huge reversal can be blamed on fears of  from SmileDirectClub and a  .Should investors worry about the incoming competition? I don't think so, for a few reasons. First, the two companies are targeting different types of customers: people who visit the orthodontist and those who do not. Second, Align is a direct investor in SmileDirectClub and is an exclusive supplier, meaning buying Align gives investors exposure to growth of SmileDirectClub. And third, the market opportunity is so large that I think these two businesses can coexist.Wall Street appears to agree with my assessment.

What's more, using electric fields to fight cancer is virtually free of side effects -- a highly appealing prospect for patients and providers alike.NovoCure decided to focus its initial efforts on treating a deadly form of brain cancer called glioblastoma multiforme.

The company has more than $220 million in cash, so it shouldn't need to tap investors to get there.While NovoCure is packed with potential, the recent marketwide sell-off has hit its stock hard. Shares are currently down more than 30% from their all-time high. You still can't call the share price \"cheap\" (it's currently about 14 times sales), but the potential upside is massive if NovoCure can successfully win FDA approval in new indications.

While that's a terrible trend for the health of society, it is a great backdrop for diabetes companies like DexCom.DexCom makes a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) that enables people with diabetes to track changes in their blood glucose levels in real time. That's important because diabetes can cause a person's blood glucose levels to fluctuate wildly throughout the day. If levels are too high or too low, it can cause short and long-term health problems. Being able to monitor changing glucose levels in real time allows patients to take action to avoid issues down the road.The allure of DexCom's solution has translated into mind-boggling growth.

While the triple-digit growth projection is mostly a result of starting from a small base, that's still an eye-popping number.

International revenues (24%) rocketed 93% year over year to $64.3 million.Gross Profit in the quarter totaled $168.6 million, up 32.8% year over year.DexCom generated gross margin (as a percentage of revenues) of 63.2%, which contracted 560 basis points (bps) year over year. Margins were under pressure due to an inventory change as well as shift toward OUS and Medicare.Research and development (R&D) expenses totaled $50.1 million in the quarter, up 15.7% year over year. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $104.6 million in the reported quarter, up 24.2% year over year.The company reported net operating expenses of $154.7 million, up 21% year over year.

The consensus estimate has shifted 1888.31% due to these changes.At this time, DexCom has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the fifth quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Estimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising.

Powell unequivocally stated that rates were close to neutral, a clear departure from comments made two months ago. On that occasion, his statements had sent the S&P 500 into correction mode.But now Jerome Powell has indicated that the Fed may be at the end of its three-year tightening cycle. This is in keeping with market expectations and addresses President Trump's repeated criticism of the Fed Chair's stance on rates.With trade tensions also likely to be addressed over the weekend, markets are likely to shrug the volatility which has gripped stocks in recent times. Investors would now best prepare for sunnier days ahead, which make it imperative to pick select growth stocks.Speaking at The Economic Club of New York, Powell said that interest rates are still at historical lows. At the same time, they are currently only a shade below \"the level that would be neutral for the economy.\" His closely watched speech was a clear departure from comments made around two months ago.Powell's speech was in consonance with comments made by Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida on Nov 27. Underlining the importance of a data-dependent approach to monetary policy, Clarida said interest rates were \"much closer\" to a neutral level.On that occasion, the Fed Chair had said that rates were a \"long way from neutral.\" Following his remarks, the S&P 500 entered correction mode. Subsequently, his stance on rates has come in for sharp criticism from President Trump. On Nov 27, Trump said that he was \"not even a little bit happy\" with his choice of Powell as Fed Chair.Commenting on Powell's change in stance, CNBC's Jim Cramer tweeted that the Fed Chair had \"blinked\" on rates. \"Powell sees the global slowdown and knows that it could hurt us,\" tweeted Cramer, attributing the change in stance to this factor.Meanwhile, The New York Times has reported that President Trump is concerned about the impact of lingering trade tensions with China on equity markets and the economy. This could lead to the President seeking a compromise on trade on the sidelines of the G-20 summit starting in Argentina this weekend.This is clear divergence from Trump's recent stance on trade relations with China. In fact, they are more in keeping with recent comments from U.S. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow. On Nov 27, Kudlow said the U.S. government has reopened negotiations on trade issues with China at several high-powered levels.Additionally, the economy remains robust as can be gleaned from the latest GDP numbers. The Department of Commerce's second estimate kept third-quarter GDP unrevised at a 3.5% pace. A spike in inventories and business investment has been the primary catalyst to the strong pace of growth witnessed during the quarter.Powell's change in stance comes as a welcome surprise for markets which have been weighed down by fears about a tougher rate environment. Meanwhile, a trade deal between the United States and China is likely to be worked out on the sidelines of the G-20 summit this weekend.With most lingering concerns likely to be addressed shortly, markets are all set to resume their long-standing rally.

For the full year, we have seen one estimate moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions.

Based on that performance, management told investors during its conference call that it's \"well-positioned to reach our breakeven target for adjusted EBITDA in Q4 of this year.\"The upbeat outlook and the fact that Tandem Diabetes shares have tumbled from a peak of about $50 in September to roughly $33 as of this writing appears to have been enough to convince Baird that shares offer upside. This morning, the company lifted its rating to outperform from neutral and set a price target of $46.The company estimates its market share to be about 12%, but that's likely to increase given the third-quarter results and the potential for its system to make insulin dosing easier on patients.Having said that, Medtronic's got its own similar system on the market and Insulet is developing an automated system, too, so Tandem Diabetes will still have to compete aggressively for sales in the future. The potential associated with disrupting the diabetes market shouldn't be understated, though. There are over 30 million people with diabetes, including more than 1 million with type 1 diabetes, in the U.S., and increasingly more people who could eventually benefit from automated insulin systems are being diagnosed every year.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The stock has soared 123.8%, significantly outperforming the industry's 8% growth and the S&P 500 index's 1.1% gain.Let us take a quick look at three important factors that make DexCom a solid pick for now.In a bid to fortify its foothold in the Type 2 diabetes space, DexCom recently announced a new amendment to its license deal with Verily- the life sciences unit of Alphabet  . With this deal, DexCom is expected to deliver its next generation CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitoring) platform by the end of 2020.DexCom will make an initial payment of $250 million in stock.

Reported operating expenses, excluding investments in non-intensive programs, are expected to increase 18% from the 2017 level. The projection is significantly higher than the previous forecast of 14%.Gross profit margin is projected at 64%, in line with the prior guidance.DexCom continues to focus on international markets, primarily on Germany. It is eyeing the sizeable markets of India, China and Japan as well. In the third quarter of 2018, DexCom's international revenues skyrocketed 93% year over year to $64.3 million, with all major markets nearly doubling from the prior-year quarter. Notably, the company received approvals in Japan and Korea.Management sees robust growth opportunities in some of the European Union countries as well.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 14 cents, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 40%. The same for revenues stands at $283.1 million, indicating 28.1% decline year over year.For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 12 cents.

Notably, this major project of Verily was being developed in collaboration with Novartis' eye-care division, Alcon since 2014.Notably, the project was related to the creation of a glucose-measuring contact lens for diabetic patients. This would enable the patients in managing their disease more efficiently, in turn inventing a non-invasive diabetes monitoring technology.However, the amalgamation of technology and live science in this project witnessed limitations due to correlation discrepancies between tear glucose and blood glucose concentrations.Consequently, Verily along with Alcon halted the project recently. Although the move does not bode well for the company's heavy investments in the project under review, it provides the scope of diversifying resources to other valuable projects.With the latest move, Verily's focus on other eye-related technology deepens. The company has decided to concentrate more on the proper development of the other two 'Smart Lens' projects.While one is related to the creation of contact lens for the people with presbyopia, the other one is the development of intraocular lens that would improve the eye sight post cataract surgery.We believe this shift in focus is likely to help the company in achieving optimal usage of its wealth, skill and expertise.Additionally, Alphabet will be able to reap benefits from the rapidly growing market for contact lens globally. The market is reportedly expected to witness a CAGR of 7.8% between 2018 and 2024 to reach $18 billion by 2024.Further, the company will be able to bolster footprint in the intraocular lens space which as per a report from MarketsandMarkets is projected to hit $4.56 billion by 2022 at a CAGR of 5.4% between 2017 and 2022.Coming to the price performance, shares of Alphabet have returned 1.5% on a year-to-date basis against the  's decline of 22.5%.We notice that Alphabet is not the only tech company which is trying to expand presence in the vast healthcare sector. Another tech giant, Apple  is also aggressively pursuing development of non-invasive techniques for diabetes management.The iPhone maker has a secret team comprising biomedical engineers who are engaged in developing sensors that would assist in monitoring blood sugar levels.Alphabet's recent move might seem to be in the wrong direction in the light of Apple's robust efforts. However, Verily has announced that it is continuously working on the development of non-intrusive glucose-measuring devices.The company is currently working with Dexcom  on the creation of a miniaturized glucose monitor. Further, Verily has formed a joint venture with Sanofi  called Onduo and intends to help people living with Type 2 diabetes by integrating devices, software, medicine and professional care all together.All these strong endeavors are likely to aid Alphabet's competitive position in the diabetes management space.Currently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This analysis is used to identify a profitable company from a loss-making one. In this context, it can be inferred that a profitable company generally has a high level of sales surplus, which will help it meet all its operating and non-operating costs and still offer high returns.In this context, it may be wise to invest in shares of a company with a high level of profitability as it normally ensures high returns. As a result, the simplest and most transparent way of checking a company's profitability is by using accounting ratios.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 14 different analyst targets contributing to that average for DexCom Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $125.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $170.00. The standard deviation is $14.373.But the whole reason to look at the  DXCM price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.

This compares to loss of $0.04 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 241.67%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this medical device company would post a loss of $0.20 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.10, delivering a surprise of 50%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.DexCom, which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, posted revenues of $266.70 million for the quarter ended September 2018, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.17%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $184.60 million.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for DexCom was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see  .It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is -$0.01 on $259.72 million in revenues for the coming quarter and -$0.49 on $929.31 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

While there are many healthcare stocks that growth investors can consider, I suggest looking at  (NASDAQ: ILMN) ,  (NYSE: CNC) , and  (NASDAQ: DXCM) . Read on to find out how the potential to discover new drugs, provide healthcare to more people, and transform diabetes treatment could make these must-own stocks in growth portfolios.Trying to unlock the secrets held within human DNA is leading to a rapidly expanding knowledge of what causes genetic diseases. As a result, spending on gene-targeted drug therapies is soaring.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Investing in the companies that are making these next-generation drugs can be profitable, but it might be even more rewarding to invest in Illumina, because it's the gene sequencing company behind most of these discoveries.Illumina's installed more than 11,000 of its gene sequencing systems worldwide, and those machines have performed about 90% of all genetic sequencing done to date. Sales of its systems and the consumables used in gene sequencing have it on pace to deliver over $3 billion in sales and between $5.70 and $5.75 in non-  earnings per share (EPS) this year, up from $2.75 billion in sales and $4 in non-GAAP EPS in 2017.The future, however, could be even brighter following Illumina's decision to  the long-read gene sequencing company  earlier this month.In the past, Illumina owed its success to dominating the market for short-read sequencing, which is faster and cheaper but less precise than long-read sequencing. However, demand for long-read sequencing is expected to grow significantly as prices drop and the need for more comprehensive DNA insight increases.PacBio thinks the long-read market alone could grow from $660 million to $2.5 billion by 2022. If that's the case, then acquiring PacBio's long-read sequencing expertise will pay off handsomely for Illumina investors.Traditional commercial health insurers have struggled to turn a profit with Obamacare, but that hasn't been the case for Medicaid insurers, including Centene. They know how to serve patients who have more complex and costly healthcare needs.By leveraging its low-cost experience, Centene's been able to successfully enter markets that traditional health insurers have exited. As a result, Centene's Obamacare exchange membership grew 49% in the past year, to 1.5 million.At the same time, Centene has taken advantage of Obamacare's Medicaid expansion rules, acquiring competitors and entering new markets. This has increased its Medicaid membership 22% in the past year, to 8.7 million.The membership growth because of these tailwinds resulted in Centene's revenue climbing 36% year over year, to $16.2 billion, and earnings per share climbing 33%, to $1.79 in the third quarter. However, better days could be coming because Centene's offering Obamacare plans in four new states in 2019 and it recently acquired Fidelis, a New York insurer that's expected to add $11.5 billion in revenue and $500 million in adjusted  to its financials.The big risk to this company's growth would be Obamacare's repeal, but that's become unlikely since Democrats won control of the House of Representatives earlier this week. Overall, I think Centene has become one of the most interesting health insurers investors can own following the midterm elections.There are 30.3 million Americans with diabetes in America, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), including over 1 million people with type 1 diabetes who require the administration of insulin multiple times daily. In the past, diabetics requiring insulin had to rely on finger sticks and glucose monitors to measure their blood sugar four to 10 times a day, but DexCom's continuous glucose monitors (CGMs)  .DexCom's CGM is a wearable sensor that measures blood sugar and reports it to devices, including smartphones, and allows patients to have real-time insight into their glucose levels, including blood sugar trends. Importantly, its CGM can alert patients to dangerous glucose readings that can be life-threatening, and because these devices can keep patients within their desired blood sugar range more effectively, patients may experience healthier outcomes.These advantages have translated into significant growth, including a 45% year-over-year increase in sales, to $267 million, and a year-over-year improvement in earnings per share, to $0.17 from a loss of $0.25 in the third quarter.The company's sales and profit could accelerate from here, though, because of next-generation automated insulin-delivery systems that rely upon DexCom's technology. For example,  (NASDAQ: TNDM) , a leading maker of wearable insulin pumps, recently launched a system that integrates its pump with DexCom's CGM to automatically dose insulin based on real-time blood sugar levels. Systems like Tandem's could revolutionize treatment for diabetics, and since the diabetes population is expected to exceed 50 million in the U.S. by 2030, there should be plenty of growth opportunity ahead for DexCom.It's anyone's guess what the future may have in store for these companies, but I think the potential to help develop new gene therapies, serve more people with health insurance, and eliminate finger sticks forever make Illumina, Centene, and DexCom compelling stocks to buy now.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Notably, Notably, this smart app is a cloud-based diabetes management software that simplifies CGM (Continuous Glucose Monitoring) data reporting and facilitates confidential sharing of data between physicians and their patients. In fact, patients can now view the same on their phones.Clearly, this latest development is likely to fortify DexCom's foothold in the CGM space.Based in California, this medical device company is known for designing, developing and commercializing CGM systems.Currently, DexCom's FDA-cleared CGM system - the DexCom G4 Platinum - is driving its top line significantly. Its inbuilt features like the G4 Platinum make the DexCom G4 Platinum the most innovative CGM system in the market. Last year, DexCom announced the FDA approval of the Dexcom G5 mobile app for Android devices.Smart apps have made self-management and continuous monitoring of diabetes affordable through the use of cloud-based applications. These applications can show real-time data on patients' blood glucose levels on these apps.For instance, consumer fitness brand Fitbit  entered the space by a $6-million investment in Sano.Moreover, MedTech giant Medtronic  collaborated with IBM to develop Sugar.IQ - a cognitive mobile personal assistant app. This application intends to provide real-time actionable glucose insights and predictions for patients with diabetes.Also, MedTech behemoth Abbott  is dedicated to developing innovative products that make glucose testing easier and more accurate. Abbott's products like Freestyle Libre, Freestyle Navigator II, Freestyle Lite, FreestyleInsulinx can be used by patients for personal glucose monitoring.In the United States, about 1.4 million new cases of diabetes are diagnosed every year.Going by an article of Allied Market Research, the global CGM systems market is expected to see a CAGR of 22.9% between 2018 and 2024.It also predicts that, the  for artificial intelligence in diabetes management is expected to witness a CAGR of 50.7% between 2017 and 2023. Thus, DexCom's latest move has been a well-timed one.Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

After a decent run through the third quarter, the markets decided it was time to re-evaluate valuations across the board. This happens sometimes. But it doesn't mean that the markets are heading toward a bear market or a significant reckoning. There are still good stocks to buy.As you have seen in the first couple of days in November, there is a lot of talk from politicians to get the market back in the headlines for good reasons. And the economy is also delivering good numbers on employment and wage growth.The latter has been a sticking point up to now, as low-end service jobs have been growing but employers haven't been raising their wages. That is starting to change now.The seven straight-A stocks to buy to build a portfolio around that are featured below have come down in price but not possibilities. They are less expensive now, yet promise outsized long-term growth. What's more, each stock here has received A ratings across three categories (quantitative, sales growth and earnings growth) by  .Source: Shutterstock (NASDAQ:  ) can't be ignored for an article like this. It is about as disruptive a company as is out there today. That's true not only for its ever-growing expansion into new markets, but it's true for its sheer size and impact on everything it does.For example, after getting sustained criticism for its low-wage warehouse jobs, AMZN announced that it was raising minimum wages to $15 an hour. This was as much good business as good press.It now pays more than top retailers like Walmart and Target for its warehouse workers. That makes it a bigger draw for the best talent. And it pressures its competitors to raise their wages without hurting their margins.AMZN is just getting started. This is a long-term foundation play that is a bit cheaper now.Source: Shutterstock (NASDAQ:  ) is another one of those disruptive companies spawned from simple beginnings that is now developing into a global force that is challenging legacy entertainment companies at every turn.Just five years ago, NFLX launched its first original series,  . Later that year, it launched its second,  and then  . Today, just five years later, NFLX is looking at 700 original TV series and 80 movies, just in 2018.From a mail-delivery DVD movie rental company to one of the largest and most powerful global entertainment companies in the world is some serious growth. And the fact is, NFLX has yet to tap into two of the most significant entertainment markets around - India and China.Even when NFLX missed its subscriber numbers in Q2 analysts stayed bullish. And that paid off in Q3 when the numbers came in well above estimates yet again.Source:  (NASDAQ:  ) is one of the top internet and media services companies around. While its name doesn't usually ring many bells, its subsidiaries usually do: Match.com, Tinder, PlentyOfFish, OKCupid, as well as Home Advisor and Angie's List. It also has a video division that features Vimeo and a publications sector that runs The Daily Beast, Dictionary.com and CityGrid, to name a few.This is a vertically integrated media services company built especially for Gen Xers and millennials. There are few companies that have diversified their holding like IAC, which makes it a unique and compelling investment.Plus, the way it is structured, it can cross-sell to its subscribers and derives revenue from a variety of sources, not just advertising. For example,  (NASDAQ:  ) is a separately traded company that specializes in dating apps and online educational services of which IAC owns a controlling share.MTCH is up 73% year to date and its parent is up 68% year to date.Source: Shutterstock (NASDAQ:  ) is a medical equipment company with a $17 billion market cap. It's not usually put into articles that talk about stocks to build your portfolio around.However, there are two important things about ABMD that make it different. First is the sector. The medical equipment sector is going through the kind of tech revolution that is going on in every other sector of the economy.And as the US healthcare system (as well as others around the globe) looks to bring down costs without raising problems for patients, better equipment is becoming an of great interest from healthcare providers and insurance companies.Second, ABMD is fundamentally a 1-product company. It makes heart pumps to help an ailing or failing heart. This kind of equipment will be in greater demand as baby boomers begin to age and average ages rise across the developed world.This is a one-trick pony that has a very unique and important trick that has a decade of growth ahead of it.Source:  (NASDAQ:  ) is a medical device maker that specializes in continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) equipment. As increasing numbers of Americans test positive for diabetes, there has been a boom in the cottage industry of glucose monitoring. Part of the reason for this is the new drugs on the market, while generally effective, are not available as generics yet and are very expensive.While losing weight and getting exercise can help manage diabetes, diet is important. And as diabetics continue to live with the disease, glucose levels can become increasingly erratic. CGM is very helpful in allowing diabetics to keep an eye on their levels using a smartwatch or smartphone.What's more, even non-diabetics are starting to track their glucose levels to see if there are any correlations to their energy levels, athletic performance, etc. App-based health information is transformative to allowing people to manage their conditions on a regular basis, so they don't have to spend so much time at the doctor or hospital.Up 136% year to date, DXCM has plenty of headroom.Source: Shutterstock (NASDAQ:  ) is part of the decentralization that going on in small and medium-sized businesses. It used to be that someone with a skill set and a good idea would start a business, hire people to grow the business and hire staff to manage the business.Generally speaking, most business owners are skilled in the building or managing a product or project, but don't have much experience running payroll, managing hiring and keeping up with taxes, personnel balancing receivables with liabilities.And until recently, that meant having to hire more than couple people to pull all this together. But now, this whole part of the operation can be outsourced to a company like PAYC.This allows the principal to do what she or he does best - grow the business. PAYC has a $7 billion market cap, so it's big enough to be a player in the new HR space, but it is small enough to be flexible and see real benefits from its growth.Up 57% year to date, PAYC has plenty of opportunities to grow and is also the ideal size for a bigger firm to snap it up a healthy premium.Source:  (NYSE:  ) is a weight loss diet company that was founded by a physician in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1980. Initially, the meal plans were sold through doctors' offices to patients that needed special diets for chronic diseases or to lose weight. To this day, Medifast is sold directly by physicians.But it is also now part of the huge dietetic meal industry and people can buy products off the website or join its wholly owned subsidiary  . Optavia is the new face of the program Take Shape for Life, which offers specialized programs, counseling and support for customers looking for a more intensive experience on their road to healthy eating.And the Optavia division has been the big growth engine for MED in recent quarters.

For the SPDR Portfolio Large Cap ETF (Symbol: SPLG), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $37.31 per unit.With SPLG trading at a recent price near $33.84 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.26% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of SPLG's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are CyrusOne Inc (Symbol: CONE), DexCom Inc (Symbol: DXCM), and BOK Financial Corp (Symbol: BOKF). Although CONE has traded at a recent price of $62.37/share, the average analyst target is 13.41% higher at $70.73/share. Similarly, DXCM has 13.27% upside from the recent share price of $125.07 if the average analyst target price of $141.67/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting BOKF to reach a target price of $108.78/share, which is 12.69% above the recent price of $96.53.

Another 84 million Americans have prediabetes, which means they are dangerously close to developing diabetes.The numbers get even more mind-boggling when you zoom out to include the rest of the world. The World Health Organization estimated that more than 422 million people had diabetes in 2014. Millions more are diagnosed every year. These numbers show why many healthcare experts consider diabetes to be an epidemic.Image source: Getty Images.Treating diabetes is enormously expensive. A study published in the medical journal  in 2016 estimated the global cost of diabetes is more than  per year.Given these numbers, it should come as no surprise to see that treating diabetes has turned into a big business. Below, we'll take a look at everything that investors need to know about how to put money to work in the disease state.Diabetes occurs when the body loses its ability to properly regulate glucose levels in the blood. That's a big problem because glucose is the body's main source of fuel.Maintaining healthy glucose levels is a delicate balancing act that is normally managed by the liver and the pancreas. Too little glucose in the blood -- which is called hypoglycemia -- can lead to dizziness, fainting, and even death in extreme cases. On the flip side, too much glucose in the blood -- which is known as hyperglycemia -- isn't good either. Excess glucose can damage major organs, such as the kidneys, heart, and eyes.Normally, the pancreas combats rising glucose levels by releasing insulin into the bloodstream. Insulin is a hormone that enables cells to convert glucose into energy. However, people with diabetes either no longer make enough insulin to satisfy their needs or they have lost the ability to use the insulin their bodies produce effectively.Broadly speaking, there are three main types of diabetes:All people who have Type 1 diabetes and gestational diabetes require treatment. Most patients with Type 2 diabetes receive regular care as well.Here's an overview of the tools and methods that are used in modern-day diabetes management:A multitude of private and public companies make products that are used to treat diabetes.Here's are some of the biggest and best-know publicly traded diabetes companies:\n  \nDATA SOURCE: YAHOO! FINANCE. MARKET CAP DATA AS OF 9/25/2018.You've likely noticed that several of these are massive healthcare companies. Johnson & Johnson, Sanofi, and Medtronic all boast market capitalization in excess of $100 billion and sell products in a multitude of disease states, including diabetes. That's why many of them are not great options for investors who want to buy pure-play diabetes companies. For example, Medtronic's diabetes division should pull in about $2 billion in annual revenue in fiscal 2018 from the sale of insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors. While that's a big number in absolute terms, it makes up only about 6% of the company's total sales. Investors who are looking for direct exposure to the diabetes market are probably better served by looking elsewhere.So which diabetes companies are  for investors? Here's a closer look at three companies that I believe are worthy of consideration.You'd be forgiven if you assumed that Novo Nordisk, with a market cap of $116 billion, is a giant drugmaker that has its hands in several different disease states. In fact, the overwhelming majority of Novo's revenue comes from selling drugs that treat diabetes. In 2017, diabetes products sales comprised 81% of Novo's top line, which makes it as close to a pure play on diabetes as it gets in big pharma.Novo sells a number of popular drugs that are used to treat all three types of diabetes. Its insulin business sells brand-name products such as NovoLog, Tresiba, Levemir, Xultophy, and Fiasp. While all of the company's insulins lower glucose levels, they differ in how quickly they reduce glucose levels, their maximum impact, and how long they remain active in the body. Novo also markets a number of branded medicines that are used to treat Type 2 diabetes, such as NovoNorm, Ozempic, and Victoza.Novo's focus on diabetes has made it  for many years. However, the last few years have been a challenging time for the business. U.S. insurers have put a tremendous amount of pressure on the company to reduce prices on its insulin products in order to maintain favorable formulary coverage. That pricing pressure became so great that management eventually dialed back its  in 2016.More recently, Novo's business has been on an upswing thanks to several successful drug launches. Expense control and label expansion claims have also helped the company to move its  .Novo's profits should continue to lurch forward at a modest rate as next-generation drugs from its pipeline are steadily introduced to the market. While this company probably won't be posting fast growth anytime soon, it remains a low-risk way for investors to beef up their diabetes exposure. Income investor will also like that Novo pays out a dividend yield of about 2.8%.Insulin pumps are a great tool for insulin-dependent diabetes patients to control their glucose levels. Insulin pumps have been around for decades, and they work by delivering  into a patient's body 24 hours a day. Modern pumps can be programmed to deliver different amounts of insulin at different times of the day to more closely match a patient's needs. At mealtime, patients can give themselves additional insulin to control their blood sugar spikes.While insulin pumps can greatly help a patient to manage their diabetes, only a minority of patients use them. One reason for the disconnect is that the majority of insulin pumps require patients to wear tubing. That's an unappealing prospect for many patients because tubing can easily get snagged or tangled with everyday activities.Insulet's solution to this lifestyle problem was to launch a patch pump that is worn directly on the body. This unique device is called  , and it has been a huge hit with patients ever since it was launched for sale in 2005.For investors, the beauty of Insulet's Omnipod System is that the patch portion of the pump needs to be replaced every three days. This  -- which is a strategy that involves first selling a durable product (razor) to help drive sales of a consumable product (blades) -- makes the company's revenue  as new users adopt the system.Insulet has also innovated new uses for its drug delivery technology. The company has a partnership in place with  in which the Omnipod is used to deliver the cancer drug Neulasta to patients. The company also continues to explore other drugs that may benefit from its tubing-free delivery system.Between its diabetes and other drug business, Insulet's CEO is calling for the company's revenue to exceed $1 billion by 2021. That's more than double what the company produced in 2017. If Insulet can deliver on its ambitious growth targets, then it is likely that its share price will  .DexCom has been a red-hot  ever since it won approval for its first continuous glucose-monitoring system  . This innovative device allowed patients with diabetes to track their blood sugar levels in near real time, making it much easier for them to stay within a healthy range.DexCom has made several important improvements to its product over the years, including the recent FDA approval of  . This newest product enables patients to make therapy decisions without having to prick their finger, and it's the first DexCom product to win such a claim. This innovative product should allow the company's  to continue.Another potential positive for investors is that DexCom has struck up numerous partnership agreements with insulin pump manufacturers such as Insulet and  . The aim of these agreements is to eventually introduce an  to market. An artificial pancreas would continuously sense a patient's blood glucose level and automatically dose insulin into the body. This would keep a patient's glucose levels in a healthy range at all times without any input at all from the patient. If achieved, this technology promises to revolutionize diabetes care.Like Insulet, DexCom operates using a razor-and-blade business model. This helps to ensure that the company's revenue will continue to grow over time as more users make the switch.DexCom estimates that 6 million patients in the U.S. and EU alone are on intensive insulin therapy. However, less than 10% of them are currently using a continuous glucose-monitoring system. That provides the company with a tremendous runway for growth even as competition in the space  .It's an unfortunate truth that diabetes is one of the  . The number of patients with diabetes has increased by nearly  since 1980. If current trends persist, the number of people with diabetes is expected to exceed 640 million by 2040 with 150 million of them living in China alone.While the opportunity ahead is huge, there are risks for investors to consider. Regulators have to give the thumbs-up to devices and drugs before they can be marketed, but approvals aren't always guaranteed. Pharmaceutical sales can also evaporate when a drug loses patent protection and a cheaper generic version of the drug is launched. That risk now exists for biologic drugs, too, now that  -- copycat drugs that are made inside a living organism -- have been  Also, competition has been heating up in the disease state, which gives governments and insurers firepower to  .Given these risks, diabetes investors shouldn't place all of their chips on a single stock. Instead, taking a basket approach makes sense. A long-term time horizon is also required since many of these stocks  .Until a cure is finally invented, the best option for many patients with diabetes is to manage their disease by using the most effective diabetes products and treatments. That puts innovative companies like Novo Nordisk, Insulet, and DexCom in a great position to continue delivering for shareholders and patients alike.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It has amassed assets over $254.74 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Growth segment of the US equity market.Compared to large and small cap companies, mid cap businesses tend to have higher growth prospects and are less volatile, respectively, with market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion. These types of companies, then, have a good balance of stability and growth potential.Growth stocks have higher than average sales and earnings growth rates. While these are expected to grow faster than the broader market, they also have higher valuations. Also, growth stocks are a type of equity that carries more risk compared to others. Compared to value stocks, growth stocks are a safer bet in a strong bull market, but don't perform as strongly in almost all other financial environments.When considering an ETF's total return, expense ratios are an important factor, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts in the long term if all other factors remain equal.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.70%, making it one of the most expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.11%.ETFs offer a diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing.

The average 12-month price target for DXCM - averaging the work of 15 analysts - reveals an average price target of $140.00/share. That's a whopping -2.12%  where DXCM has been trading recently at $143.03/share. With this kind of downside potential (should DXCM fall to that price target), one might expect to see a high concentration of \"hold\" or even \"sell\" ratings on the stock. Yet, take a look at the bullishness:\n  \nThe average rating presented in the last row of the table above is from 1 to 5, where 1 would be a consensus Strong Buy and 5 would be a consensus Strong Sell. In the middle, 3 would be a Hold. So anything below 3 leans toward Buy as the average analyst sentiment. The average rating of 1.39 for DXCM leans strongly towards the bullish end of the spectrum, yet the DXCM price target paints a different picture. Clearly, there is something more to the story here that is worth investigating for investors looking at DexCom Inc. Of course, the average price target is just that - a mathematical average, and is only one metric. There are analysts with higher targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $170.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as low as $100.00. The standard deviation is $18.224.But the whole reason to look at the  in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes - much like with guessing the number of jelly beans in a jar, where the  guess tends to be very close. And so with DXCM trading so far above that average target price of $140.00/share, the -2.12% downside to that average target does seem to be a paradox against the bullish analyst ratings. Might analysts be behind the curve with their targets and upward adjustments are forthcoming? Or, is it time for some of these analysts to turn bearish and downgrade on valuation? One thing is for sure: this apparent paradox makes for a good \"signal\" to investors in DXCM to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding whether analysts have it right with their sentiment, or have it right with their price target for DexCom Inc.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $130.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $129.80 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of DXCM, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $138.42/share today.Because the $130.00 strike represents an approximate 6% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

Is this stock worth adding to your portfolio? Here's what management's saying about its business today and its potential in the future.Normally, beta cells in the pancreas produce insulin that turns glucose in the blood into energy; however, people with type 1 diabetes don't produce insulin, and type 2 patients have developed a resistance to insulin. There are an estimated 30 million people with diabetes in the U.S. alone, including about 1.5 million people with type 1 diabetes.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.In the past, patients with type 1 disease and many patients with type 2 diabetes have relied upon finger sticks to draw blood, blood glucose monitors to measure blood sugar levels, and insulin injections to bring blood glucose readings down to a normal range.More recently, patients requiring multiple insulin doses per day have been reducing their need for finger sticks by using CGMs, including those made by DexCom, to track and report blood glucose levels in real time. These devices include the use of wearable sensors that record the data and a receiver, or in the case of DexCom, an app, that communicates with the sensors, tracks the data, and reports it to patients and caregivers.Until competitor  (NYSE: ABT) won  of its Freestyle Libre CGM last year, patients still had to use fingersticks to calibrate their CGMs. The approval of the Freestyle Libre did away with that requirement, significantly reducing patient burden and, in the process, giving Abbott Labs an edge in the CGM market.However, Abbott's advantage didn't last very long. In March, the FDA approved DexCom's G6, which similarly does away with finger sticks for calibration. Importantly, the G6 packs features the Freestyle Libre doesn't, which could tilt market share back in DexCom's favor. Specifically, the G6 doesn't require a stand-alone receiver, and its sensors automatically communicate data to a user's app or another compatible device. Abbott requires a receiver (there's no app yet), and it has to be held within 1.5 inches of its sensors to transfer data. The G6 also has an alarm to alert patients of dangerous glucose readings that the Freestyle Libre doesn't.Those advantages appear to be resonating with patients. Although the G6 was only available for part of the quarter, DexCom's sales jumped 42% year over year to $242.5 million in Q2 2018. As a result, after backing out gains associated with DexCom's equity investments, the company's adjusted loss improved to $0.10, which was $0.08 better than industry watchers were expecting.There was plenty to like about the company's second-quarter performance, including a 78% year-over-year increase in international sales, but what's really moving the needle for investors is the company's potential to profit from its inclusion in next-generation, closed-loop, automated-insulin delivery systems that pair its CGMs with insulin pumps.Last year,  (NYSE: MDT) won FDA approval for the first closed-loop monitoring and insulin pump solution, the MiniMed 670G. A DexCom competitor, Medtronic built its system using its own Guardian CGM and pump. The system has been a success, with Medtronic reporting 70,000 users at the end of March, up from 20,000 exiting December.Soon, though, the MiniMed 670G is going to face stiff competition from  (NASDAQ: TNDM) t:slim X2 system, which relies on DexCom's G6 and Tandem's own insulin pump. The FDA gave Tandem Diabetes the OK to market its automated solution in June when it  Basal-IQ, an algorithm that shuts off insulin delivery from Tandem's pump when blood glucose levels are predicted to get too low in the future.Tandem says it's on track to launch its system with the G6 this month. The availability of Tandem's automated-insulin system could benefit DexCom in two ways: It could increase G6 demand in the coming year, and since DexCom has a $55 million equity stake in Tandem Diabetes, a successful launch could increase the value of its investment. For consideration, DexCom's cost basis in Tandem is only $5 million.Tandem isn't the only manufacturer using DexCom's G6, though. DexCom's CGMs are also being evaluated as part of automated insulin systems being developed at  (NASDAQ: PODD) and  (NYSE: LLY) .DexCom's profitability has been a question mark, but that's due in part to the company's international expansion plans and research and development efforts. If those investments pay off, then earnings should follow. Because international revenue grew more quickly than U.S. revenue last quarter, overseas sales now represent 22% of revenue, up from 17% of revenue in Q2 2017.Due to greater global demand for its CGMs, management now thinks its full year 2018 sales will be approximately $925 million, and that's significantly higher than its prior range of between $850 million to $860 million.Given that reports suggest CGMs have only penetrated about 20% of the addressable market for type 1 patients, and even less in type 2 patients, there's good reason to think DexCom's future is bright enough for it to warrant being included in investors' portfolios.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ith a market capitalization of approximately $12.05 billion,  is expected to benefit from lucrative prospects in the diabetes market, strong product portfolio, collaborative agreements with several companies and focus on international markets. However, the company's margins were under pressure in the last reported quarter.For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 10 cents per share, reflecting a decline of 150% on a year-over-year basis. The same for the revenues is pegged at $239.5 million, reflecting an increase of 29.7% year over year.For 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $929.1million, reflecting growth of 29.3%.The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Here we take a quick look at the primary factors that have been plaguing DexCom and henceforth discuss the prospects that ensure near-term recovery of the stock. | DexCom reported loss in second-quarter 2018, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The company's second-quarter gross profit totaled $154 million generating a gross margin of 63.3%, down 320 basis points (bps) year over year on an adjusted basis. Escalating non-recurring expenses, as the company ramped production volumes faster than anticipated, resulted in lackluster margin trends.Further, earlier-than-anticipated G6 launch resulted in unexpected excess and obsolete charges related to DexCom's G5 hardware.Owing to the lackluster trends, DexCom lowered margin guidance for 2018. Gross profit margin is projected to be just 64% of net revenues in 2018, lower than the previous guidance of 65-68%.In 2017, DexCom announced the receipt of FDA approval of the Dexcom G5 mobile app for Android devices.Coming to the G6 CGM System, in June, the company announced that it has received CE Mark for its DexCom G6 System for people with diabetes aged two years and above. The company is optimistic about its G6 sensor.By the end of the second quarter of 2018, management announced that DexCom G6 represents the most important and complex launch in the company's history. DexCom G6 is highly exclusive in the market because it functions without finger-stick calibrations.DexCom's shares have outperformed the  in a year's time. Notably, the company's shares have surged 86.9%, against the industry's decline of 4%. The current level is also higher than the S&P 500 index's rise of 19%.A few better-ranked stocks in the MedTech space are Penumbra, Inc.  , Integer Holdings Corporation  and Illumina, Inc.  .

The huge jump is attributable to the release of second-quarter results that smashed expectations and featured a huge boost to guidance.Here's a review of the key figures from Dexcom's second quarter:Image source: Getty Images.The better-than-expected results also allowed management to significantly boost its guidance for the year. The company now expects full-year revenue of about $925 million. That's much higher than its prior range of $850 million to $860 million.Given the significant beat-and-raise, it isn't hard to figure out why shares are flying high today.Dexcom's second-quarter results should go a long way to silence the doubters who believed that  ' (NYSE: ABT)  glucose monitoring system was going to put a stop to the company's huge growth.

Also, the figure improved from a loss of 16 cents in the year-ago quarter.The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Total revenues rallied 42.1% to $242.5 million from $170.6 million in the year-ago quarter. Revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $205 million.Revenues in the Sensor segment (74% of total revenues) surged 47% on a year-over-year basis to $179.4 million. Transmitter revenues (18%) increased 26% year over year to $43.9 million. Receiver revenues (8%) rallied 36% year over year to $19.1 million. | DexCom generated gross margin (as a percentage of revenues) of 63.3%, which contracted 560 basis points (bps) year over year. Margins were under pressure due to an inventory change and shift toward OUS and Medicare.International business displayed consistent growth in the quarter, up 78% on a year-over-year basis to $52.9 million.Research and development (R&D) expenses totaled $47.2 million in the quarter, up4.2% year over year.Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $111.3 million in the reported quarter, increasing 29.7% year over year.DexCom raised 2018 guidance.The company expects revenues of $925 million, up from the previous range of $850-$860 million. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $861.2 million, which is significantly lower than the guidance.Reported operating expenses, excluding investments in non-intensive programs, are expected to increase 14% from 2017 level, significantly higher than the previous forecast of 10%.However, gross profit margin is projected to be 64%, lower than the previous guidance of 65-68%.DexCom reported loss in second-quarter2018, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss. Solid contributions from the Sensor, Transmitter and Receiver segments are key catalysts. The glucose monitoring market presents significant commercial opportunity for DexCom. The company's opportunities in alternative markets such as the non-intensive diabetes management space, the hospital, gestational, pre-diabetes and obesity are likely to provide the company a competitive edge in the MedTech space. Further, the company's next-generation fully-disposable CGM systems are also in progress.On the flip side, cutthroat competition in the market for blood & glucose monitoring devices is a headwind for DexCom at the moment. We believe that the company's margins will continue to be under pressure in the coming quarters, thanksto high product development costs and rising expenditures on the R&D front. Lower expected margins on transmitter sales are also a cause of concern.A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space, which reported solid earnings this season are Stryker Corporation  , Intuitive Surgical, Inc  and Illumina, Inc  .While Intuitive Surgical and Illumina sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Stryker carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see Intuitive Surgical reported adjusted earnings of $2.76 per share in the second quarter of 2018, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.48. Adjusted earnings improved 38% year over year.Stryker reported second-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share of $1.76, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.7%. Earnings improved 15% year over year and also exceeded the high end of the company's guidance.Illumina reported adjusted earnings of $1.43 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.11.Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

At least not all of them.Three stocks, in particular, soared at least 20% this week.  (NASDAQ: HIIQ) ,  (NASDAQ: DXCM) , and  (NYSE: MOH) enjoyed huge runs over the last few days. What lit a fire beneath these stocks -- and are any of them still smart picks for investors to buy now?Image source: Getty Images.Shares of Health Insurance Innovations skyrocketed nearly 43% this week due to two positive news stories. One related to the cloud-based health insurance platform company's better-than-expected Q2 earnings results. The other came from the Trump administration's new rule that could shake up the individual health insurance market.Let's start with Health Insurance Innovations' Q2 results. The company reported record revenue of $71.7 million, up 16% from the prior-year period. Adjusted earnings per share jumped 32.6% year over year to $0.61, handily beating analysts' estimates. The company also boosted its full-year 2018 revenue and adjusted earnings guidance.As good as Health Insurance Innovations' second-quarter news was, the latest regulatory update from the White House should be even better for the company over the long run. Beginning Oct. 1, short-term health insurance plans with durations less than 12 months will be allowed in the U.S. In the past, the duration of short-term plans was limited to less than three months. In addition, insurers will be able to renew these short-term plans for up to 36 months.Because these short-term plans don't have to meet all of the criteria imposed by the Affordable Care Act (popularly called Obamacare), their costs should be significantly lower than other individual health insurance. This should present a great market opportunity for Health Insurance Innovations.DexCom stock jumped 29% this week after the medical-device maker  on Wednesday. As you might expect, those results looked pretty good.The company's revenue increased 42% year over year to $242.5 million in Q2. This reflected 35% growth in the U.S. and 78% growth in international markets over the prior-year period. DexCom CEO Kevin Sayer attributed this success to increased adoption of the company's continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) products.What's especially encouraging is that DexCom's newest CGM system -- its G6 product -- didn't launch until late in the second quarter. That bodes well for the company's fortunes in the rest of 2018 and into next year. It was no surprise that DexCom raised its full-year 2018 revenue guidance to $925 million from its previous outlook of between $850 million and $860 million. DexCom isn't profitable yet, however.One of the biggest opportunities for DexCom is integrating its CGM systems with automated insulin pumps in what's called a closed-loop solution.  plans to launch its new automated insulin pump that integrates with DexCom's G6 CGM this month.Shares of Molina Healthcare rose nearly 21% this week. The reason behind the managed care company's nice gain is a familiar one: Molina  on Tuesday.The company's revenue declined 2.3% year over year to $4.88 billion. So why did the stock perform so well? Molina's bottom line improved dramatically. The company went from a loss of $4.10 per share in the prior-year period to positive earnings of $3.02 per share in the second quarter. Wall Street expected earnings per share of $1.08. I'd call that a pleasant surprise.Even better, Molina revised its full-year 2018 earnings guidance -- by a lot. The midpoint of the company's previous guidance in February projected 2018 earnings of $219 million at the midpoint. Molina now expects earnings this year will be between $471 million and $484 million. The low end of that range is still more than double Molina's previous guidance.In many cases, big spikes like Health Insurance Innovations, DexCom, and Molina enjoyed this week quickly fade away. Investors hoping to ride the momentum end up being disappointed. I don't think chasing momentum is a smart strategy, but I actually like all three of these stocks over the long term.Americans with incomes low enough to receive federal subsidies have been helped by Obamacare. However, for many in the middle class, the higher premiums resulting from Obamacare have been hard to handle. I think Health Insurance Innovations will benefit tremendously from the individual health insurance market changes that are being implemented.DexCom's G6 CGM is providing the boost that the company needed. Diabetes currently ranks as the No. 7 leading cause of death in the U.S. It's also the fastest-growing chronic disease in the world. I think the diabetes market will continue to be large enough to support multiple winners -- and I think DexCom will be one of those winners.As for Molina, my view is that managed care is here to stay and that it will become even more critical for Medicaid programs. Despite its big run in 2018, Molina's earnings growth prospects still make the stock's valuation attractive. I wouldn't be surprised if the company is acquired by a larger player within the next few years.Are there even better stocks to buy right now? Yes. However, my prediction is that Health Insurance Innovations, DexCom, and Molina will generate solid returns for investors over the next several years.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the March 2019 put at the $85 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $7.80. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 9.2% return against the $85 commitment, or a 14.8% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to DXCM's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $85 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless DexCom Inc sees its shares decline 10.4% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $77.20 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $7.80 from $85), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 14.8% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for DexCom Inc, and highlighting in green where the $85 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the March 2019 put at the $85 strike for the 14.8% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks.

Management's forecasting that revenue will be between $140 million to $148 million this year, up 30% to 38% from 2017.Tandem Diabetes recently won a  to begin marketing a closed-loop insulin system that combines its T:slim X2 pump and its Basal-IQ algorithm with  's (NASDAQ: DXCM) new G6 continuous glucose monitor (CGM). The Basal-IQ algorithm can predict blood sugar levels 30 minutes in advance and shut off insulin if a patient is at risk of hypoglycemia (blood glucose levels that are too low). In trials, Basal-IQ reduced the amount of time patients spend with dangerously low blood glucose readings by 31%, compared to the use of an insulin pump and CGM alone.The Basal-IQ feature, which is expected to be available in August, will make Tandem Diabetes only the  to offer such an automated insulin solution. Previously, the market was owned by Medtronic's MiniMed 670G, a system that launched early in 2017. The MiniMed 670G has been a success, with the number of people using it climbing to 70,000 at the end of March, from 20,000 at the end of 2017. However, Tandem Diabetes' solution might be a better than Medtronic's, because it virtually eliminates the need for finger sticks to check blood sugar for calibration, and its blood glucose sensors can be worn for 10 days rather than seven.It remains to be seen if Tandem Diabetes' system can elbow away market share from the MiniMed 670G, but management appears confident. It expects to reach cash flow breakeven next year, and that could mean that profitability is around the corner.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Why? Because these Motley Fool investors think the launch of a new game-changing device for diabetes will send Tandem's sales soaring; increased spending on drug development will be a boon to IQVIA; and pipeline data could cure Gilead Sciences' ailing share price. Read on to see if these stocks are right for your portfolio. One of the most intriguing healthcare stocks I'm interested in adding to my portfolio this month is Tandem Diabetes, an insulin pump maker that  its automated insulin delivery system in August.Image source: Getty Images.Tandem currently markets the t:slim X2, an insulin pump that patients can use instead of multiple daily insulin injections. Usually, patients pair up these pumps with  's (NASDAQ: DXCM)  (CGM), but until now, the two couldn't automatically monitor and dose insulin as necessary.That will change in August when Tandem Diabetes launches Basal-IQ, a feature that automatically pauses insulin delivery when CGM readings predict blood sugar levels could become too low. The ability to prevent hypoglycemia, a life-threatening condition, clears the way for patients to use these devices to automatically treat diabetes and, perhaps, delay its progression.Tandem's insulin system will be the second such automated system to become available. The first system,  's (NYSE: MDT) MiniMed 670G, has been a big success with 70,000 people who were using it as of March, up from 20,000 people in December. Because over 1 million people have type 1 diabetes and could benefit from these systems, there's reason to think that Tandem's sales could head materially higher following its debut -- especially because the t:slim X2 is smaller than the MiniMed 670G and, when paired up with DexCom's newest CGMs, it offers patients the ability to change sensors and check their blood sugar with finger sticks less often than with the MiniMed 670G.Tandem's a lot smaller company than Medtronic, but it's a pure play on this next-generation solution. And because the addressable market is so big, I can't help but think it makes sense to stash some Tandem shares away in growth portfolios. Developing a new drug from scratch is an extremely difficult and expensive process that is fraught with risk. That's why many biotech companies choose to partner up with a contract research organization (CRO) when they think they have found a potential winner. Doing so gives the compound the best chance of success.IQVIA Holdings is the go-to CRO partner for many biotech companies. The reason is that IQVIA employs a worldwide army of researchers who specialize in running clinical trials and compiling data. That deep experience is highly prized by biotech executives, who want to make sure that the clinical development process goes as smoothly as possible.For investors, what's great about IQVIA's business is that the company gets paid no matter how the drug in development fares during the trial. Better yet, since the drug development process takes years to complete, IQVIA's revenue becomes highly predictable as new compounds are added to its pipeline. For example, last quarter the company reported that it had more than  in its research and development backlog.Another fact to applaud is that IQVIA also helps its customers to commercialize drugs that do find their way to market. The company does this by selling access to its one-of-a-kind database of patient records and prescriptions that help biotech and pharma companies with targeting.All told, IQVIA boasts a highly attractive business model that should enable double-digit revenue growth for the foreseeable future. With shares currently trading for less than 17 times next year's earnings estimates, I think this is a great company for healthcare investors to get to know. Once upon a time, Gilead Sciences was a high-flying biotech stock with the wind at its back. That hasn't been the case for a while, though. Plunging sales for its hepatitis C virus (HCV) franchise has dragged down Gilead's revenue, earnings, and share price. But good news should be on the way for Gilead.The biotech  The HCV market has boiled down to a one-on-one matchup between Gilead and  (NYSE: ABBV) . Price cuts were a common theme over the past couple of years, but that shouldn't be a major factor anymore. It will just be Gilead versus AbbVie competing for a smaller number of hepatitis C patients. That's actually a much-improved scenario than Gilead has faced in recent years.If HCV doesn't weigh on total revenue and earnings nearly as much, that means investors will focus more on Gilead's HIV drugs. They should like what they see with Biktarvy, Gilead's latest HIV drug, launched in the first quarter. Biktarvy's sales should ramp up quickly and eventually reach $6 billion or more annually.Then there's the pipeline. Gilead should soon announce late-stage results for filgotinib in treating rheumatoid arthritis. Filgotinib could become the company's first immunology blockbuster drug. Gilead also has selonsertib, a strong candidate for treating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and is pursuing additional indications for cancer therapy Yescarta.Like I said, good news should be on the way. That makes Gilead a great stock to buy in July, in my view.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

You've probably had one such device around for your whole life - a telephone.But with the emergence of megatrends like mobile, cloud and big data, there has been a major transformation. Connected devices are becoming ubiquitous, appearing throughout our homes, cars, hospitals and factories. Essentially, any device can be tethered with sensors, WiFi or cellular systems.And the growth is enormous. According to a report from  (NASDAQ:  ), the  of connected devices is forecast to hit 29 billion by 2022.So how can investors capitalize on this? Well, the good news is that there are many companies that are pushing innovation in this market - and should be long-term winners.Here's a look at five that stand out:While there are many benefits to connected devices, there are also some downsides. Perhaps the biggest is the threat of hacks.This is where a company like  (NASDAQ:  ) comes in.Yes, it's a cybersecurity operator that focuses on managing the risks of connected devices in an organizations networks. But to do this, FSCT takes a much different approach. Note that during the past decade the company has developed so-called agentless technology that discovers intrusions in real-time. The system also can handle complex environments, such as wired/wireless networks and virtual/cloud infrastructures.As a testament to the technology, the U.S. Department of Defense recently awarded the company with an enterprise-wide blanket purchase agreement.In terms of the growth, it has certainly been robust for FSCT. In the  , revenues jumped by 42% to $59.7 million and operating cash flows came to a hefty $24.5 million, up 41%. (NASDAQ:  ) has gone through quite a bit of drama lately. Of course,  (NASDAQ:  ) dropped its acquisition of the company because it could not get approval with Chinese authorities.The result is that NXPI stock has taken a hit, going from $125.50 in February to $95. But then again, this does look like a good opportunity to pick up shares in a company that is likely to benefit from the trend of connected devices.Note that the company develops a broad array of chips, such as for power management, security, digital processing and mixed signal solutions for RF (radio frequency). All these have proven quite effective for autos, mobile phones and consumer applications. For example, the company has the No. 1 positions in bank card identification, auto safety and mobile NFC (which is for payments).While the failed QCOM acquisition was a distraction, it is important to keep in mind that NXPI got a $2 billion break-up fee. Besides, QCOM's interest was a big-time validation of NXPI's technology.Something else to consider: NXPI stock is fairly cheap, at 12.5X. The company also recently  a $5 billion buyback. (NYSE:  ), which was founded in the early 1970.s, is one of largest players in the enterprise application market. At the core of the company is its ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system, which handles critical areas like HR, inventory and financials. Consider that the customer base is more than 404,000 and there are over 150 million users of its cloud applications.But the market is fairly mature. So to find growth, SAP has been investing in other markets like databases. There have also been a spate of acquisitions, such as for Ariba, Concur, Sybase, Business Objects and SuccessFactors.Now with this massive platform, SAP has been building out its IoT (Internet of Things) business as well - which is essentially another way of describing connected devices. Part of this has been retooling the existing technology. But SAP has also introduced is own standalone system, called Leonardo.These initiatives are in the early stages - but they are quickly gaining traction. A notable example of this is  (NASDAQ:  ). By using Leonard, the company has been able to identify a whopping $1 billion in new business opportunities.In a sense, the home and business security industry is an early example of connected devices. But next-generation technologies have definitely been supercharging things.One of the standouts in the category is  (NASDAQ:  ), which has created a platform for intelligently connected properties. Some of the functions include video monitoring, energy management and intelligent automation. Last year, Alarm.com's system processed more than 100 billion data points from over 80 million connected devices.Growth has also been solid. In the latest quarter, revenues rose by 25% to $92.8 million and adjusted EBITDA came to $23 million, up from $14.1 million on a year-over-year basis.Granted, the market is intensely competitive. After all, mega tech operators like  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  , NASDAQ:  ) have been making a play for the opportunity.However, ALRM is really more focused on the higher-end of the market - that is, the company uses more advanced systems and cameras. There is also a network of 7,000 service providers.And besides, the market opportunity is massive. According to  , the spending on connected homes - on a global basis - is expected to go from $45 billion in 2017 to $146 billion by 2021.When it comes to connected devices, there is significant opportunity in the healthcare industry. Real-time monitoring can certainly be a key driver in improving the outcomes for patients.Just look at  (NASDAQ:  ), which is the pioneer of continuous glucose monitors that do not require finger sticks for calibration. For example, its G5 Mobile system is seamlessly connected to a person's iPhone, iPad or Android device. There is also a cloud platform that provides reporting and personalized advice.Diabetes is definitely a terrible problem across the globe. According to the  , there are over 425 million people with the disease. It's actually the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S.Now as for DXCM, the company has been able to continue to innovate and get approvals from the FDA. The growth has also been strong.

Solid performance by the Pharmacy Benefit Management segment (\"PBM\") is likely to drive the company's top line. However, the company is getting acquired by Cigna Corporation by the end of 2018.Express Scripts delivered an average positive earnings surprise of almost 1.3% in the trailing four quarters. In the last reported quarter, Express Scripts posted adjusted earnings of $1.77 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Further, adjusted earnings improved 33% year over year. Revenues of $24.78 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $24.76 billion and inched up 0.5% year over year.For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $25.34 billion, reflecting a nominal fall of 0.01%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.20, indicating an increase of 27.2%.Let's delve into the factors that are likely to have an impact on second-quarter 2018 results. | Express Scripts is the largest PBM in North America. The company has been consistently trying to expand the core PBM business. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PBM revenues is pegged at $23.63 billion, indicating a rise of2% sequentially.We believe that the company's unique offerings of home-delivery pharmacy care, specialty pharmacy care, specialty benefit management and medical as well as drug data analysis services buoy optimism. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for  is pegged at $11.26 billion, showing a rise of6.3% sequentially.Express Scripts also distributes a full range of biopharmaceutical products and provides extensive cost-management and patient-care services. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for these  is pegged at $342 million, indicating a rise of11.4% on a sequential basis.Coming to the suite of developments in the PBM unite, on Apr 12, Express Scripts announced the launch of a new, innovative 12-month pilot for a performance-based retail pharmacy network for commercial plans designed to optimize medication therapy.In 2018, Accredo specialty pharmacy, a subsidiary of Express Scripts, has earned URAC's accreditation at its primary dispensing locations like, Warrendale, New Castle and Indianapolis. This is likely to enhance the company's customer base.Buoyed by strong results in the last reported quarter, Express Scripts' enterprise value initiative is estimated to cost $600-$650 million as of now.Notably, management expects cumulative savings of nearly $1.2 billion by 2021. Further, the company's targeted compounded annual adjusted EBITDA growth rate for the core business from 2017-2020 of 2-4% is a tailwind. Thus, Express Scripts is confident about improving growth trajectory, which is likely to drive second-quarter results.Recently, the company launched the most innovative approach to value-based contracting in the industry, a system that made hepatitis C treatments cheaper and ensured patient access and superior clinical outcomes. Also, in the case of inflammatory conditions and multiple sclerosis the system will ensure that payers can get their money back when drugs are ineffective.In this regard, Express Scripts and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. announced that they are expanding group purchasing efforts to include the procurement of specialty brand drugs in February. This collaboration is a strategic one and the yield will be reflected in the quarter to be reported,owing to the massive savings potential by biosimilars.After declaring that Express Scripts is losing its biggest customer - the leading health insurer Anthem Inc - the company recently announced that it is getting acquired by Cigna, a global health insurance company.The acquisition is expected to be completed by Dec 31, 2018.Per the definitive agreement, Cigna will take over Express Scripts in a cash and stock transaction worth $67 billion. Notably, this includes Cigna's assumption of approximately $15 billion debt of Express Scripts.In fact, Moody's Investors Service, the rating services arm of Moody's Corporation, is worried about the company's high customer concentration and pricing pressure. Per Moody's, Express Scripts is likely to experience declining script volume and higher-than-typical customer losses in the days to come. Other challenges include fewer generic drug introductions, softening mail order growth trends, client focus on cost savings and transparency.Per our proven model, a stock needs to have a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter.

Here's what you need to know about  (NASDAQ: TXRH) ,  (NASDAQ: KLIC) , and  (NASDAQ: DXCM) .Image source: Getty Images. The restaurant industry is a challenging one. Consumers have plenty of choices, and keeping diners loyal to a brand can be a tough task. To make matters worse, the industry has had to cope with  the past few years as over-expansion has caused foot traffic at the average store to decline the last few years.Bucking the trend is casual steakhouse chain Texas Roadhouse. The restaurant has avoided the struggle most of its peers have experienced by staying true to its primary market: underserved suburban America. Providing big portions at fair prices to working-class families is still only part of the story, though. While many chains out there have put together aggressive expansion plans, Roadhouse has stayed disciplined and opened new locations at a more modest rate. Only 30 new stores will be opened this year, only about a 5% increase in total count -- which includes a new sports bar brand called Bubba's 33 that is being tested in select markets.The stock has also been a slow-and-steady story for over a decade now, but the results have been impressive nonetheless. Shares have doubled nearly five times over at this point, but there's reason to believe they're still a good buy even close to an all-time high. When management reported on progress a couple months ago, same-store sales growth was accelerating. This metric, which measures a combination of average guest ticket and foot traffic, is one of the most important factors driving a restaurant's profit margins. A month into the second quarter of 2018, and same-store sales were up an impressive 8.5% compared to a 4.9% increase in the  . With Texas Roadhouse keeping tight control over expenses and getting the most out of its existing stores, this stock is one of the best restaurant buys out there right now.  Kulicke & Soffa manufactures equipment used by the semiconductor industry to package semiconductor components. It's a small company, with annual revenue of about $800 million.The semiconductor equipment industry is cyclical, so Kulicke & Soffa's results can swing up and down along with demand. But the long-term growth of the semiconductor industry, as well as the company's efforts to diversify into advanced packaging, should keep the numbers moving in the right direction in the long run.Kulicke & Soffa sees its available market growing from $2.2 billion in 2017 to $2.7 billion in 2021. Its core business will drive some of this growth, but demand for advanced packaging and equipment used for automotive products like sensors and cameras will be the key drivers. Kulicke & Soffa also has plenty of cash at its disposal to make strategic acquisitions. The company's balance sheet featured over $600 million of net cash at the end of its latest quarter.Kulicke & Soffa  . Backing out the net cash, the stock trades for less than 8 times the average analyst estimate for 2018 earnings. Since earnings tend to fluctuate, this earnings multiple makes the stock look a bit cheaper than it truly is. Average earnings over the next few years could be lower if the current boom in sales dissipates. But even so, with plenty of long-term growth potential, Kulicke & Soffa is a solid growth stock pick. The diabetes market is getting bigger, and technology that helps patients better track blood sugar levels and dose their insulin is going to play a big role in the future. According to the Institute for Alternative Futures, the number of Americans with diabetes will increase from about 30 million today to nearly 55 million in 2030, and as a result, spending on diabetes is expected to soar.A good piece of that spending could find its way to DexCom's top line. DexCom's a leading manufacturer of continuous glucose monitors (CGM) that track real-time changes in blood sugar to help patients avoid dangerous highs and lows that can accelerate diabetes progression.CGMs use sensors, software, and hardware to record, analyze, and report blood sugar levels in real time, and they're already winning over patients who require frequent insulin injections. In 2017, DexCom's sales grew 25% to $718 million.Last year's performance was solid, but I think sales could increase by more this year following the launch of DexCom's newest CGM, the G6. In 2017, DexCom's sales were held back by the launch of  ' (NYSE: ABT) Freestyle Libre, the first CGM to remove the need for diabetes patients to stick their fingers to confirm readings or to calibrate the system.Abbott's advantage disappeared earlier this year when the  the G6. Importantly, the G6 is arguably a better system. The G6's sensors can be worn longer than those used with the Freestyle Libre, it includes alarms for blood sugar highs and lows that the Freestyle Libre doesn't, it has a shorter warm up time than the Freestyle Libre, and unlike the Freestyle Libre, it automatically sends data to a device for display.Those advantages could spark sales growth, but the use of CGMs in new automated insulin delivery systems is what really excites me about DexCom's CGM opportunity. Recently, Tandem Diabetes won an FDA green light for a system that combines DexCom's CGM with its insulin pump to administer insulin automatically, and DexCom's CGMs are also being evaluated in a similar system that's being developed by  (NASDAQ: PODD) . If these systems win widespread use, and I think they will, then it could be a boon to DexCom investors.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But it's a much different story for medical device companies that focus on monitoring and treating diabetes. Several of these stocks soared in the first half of the year.Which were the biggest winners?  (NASDAQ: TNDM) ,  (NASDAQ: DXCM) , and  (NYSEMKT: SENS) stocks enjoyed tremendous success during the first six months of 2018. Here's why these are the three best diabetes stocks of 2018 so far -- and if they're still smart picks for investors.Image source: Getty Images.Tandem Diabetes Care focuses on developing and marketing insulin pumps. Its stock has skyrocketed close to 790% so far this year.There have been two key catalysts for Tandem in 2018. One is the company's continued financial improvement. Tandem reported a 42% year-over-year jump in sales  announced in April. The company's t:slim X2 insulin pump was the star performer. Tandem's sales have been boosted by the exit of Animas from the insulin pump market in Oct. 2017.The other big catalyst for Tandem was  for the company's t:slim X2 insulin pump with Basal-IQ technology. This Basal-IQ technology uses algorithms to predict 30 minutes into the future where insulin levels will be. It then adjusts insulin delivery based on the predictions.Tandem anticipates launching the new product in August. Integration with DexCom's G6 continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system should especially help make the new t:slim X2 insulin pump a success. With both sales and gross margins growing, Tandem hopes to reach breakeven cash flow by the second half of 2019.While Tandem Diabetes Care handles delivering insulin into patients' bloodstreams, DexCom makes the CGM systems that monitor blood sugar levels for determining when insulin is needed. DexCom stock is up close to 70% year to date.The reasons behind DexCom's tremendous stock performance are similar to those of Tandem. DexCom announced FDA approval of its new G6 CGM on March 27. Shares had already been rising in the weeks leading up to the announcement in anticipation of the approval decision.On May 3, DexCom stock soared again after the company  that were better than analysts expected. DexCom also increased its full-year 2018 revenue guidance by $20 million.DexCom has been a leader in continuous glucose measurement, but its G6 system should greatly improve the company's competitive position. Unlike previous CGMs, the G6 requires no finger sticks and no calibration. Its integration with other leading devices, including Tandem's insulin pump, should add to its appeal.Senseonics is much smaller than DexCom, but the company hopes to be just as successful with its own CGM system. Its stock has jumped nearly 60% higher so far this year.Like both Tandem and DexCom, regulatory approvals have been the keys for Senseonics stock's success thus far in 2018. In February, Senseonics announced European approval and a launch in European markets for its Eversense CGM system. The system includes a sensor implanted beneath the skin with a transmitter worn over the sensor that sends data to an app on a smartphone.The company also announced in June that the FDA had approved the Eversense CGM system. This followed an advisory committee's unanimous vote in March recommending approval for the system. That vote played a role in prompting Guggenheim analyst Christopher Pasquale to hike his price target for Senseonics to $6 per share in early April -- resulting in  .Senseonics thinks that Eversense CGM will be attractive to customers for a couple of key reasons. The company claims that its CGM has a higher accuracy than other systems. Senseonics also believes that individuals with diabetes will prefer an implanted sensor that lasts up to 80 days instead of having weekly sensor insertions required by other CGM systems.I wouldn't necessarily count on these three stocks producing gains in the second half of 2018 as they have in the first half. However, I think that Tandem, DexCom, and Senseonics could continue to be winners over the long run.The diabetes market is enormous. Each of these companies provides innovative products that should achieve solid commercial success. I think Tandem could give medical device giant  a run for its money. In my view, the CGM market is large enough for several companies to succeed, including both DexCom and Senseonics.Senseonics is the riskiest of the three, since it's just getting started with commercialization of Eversense. Still, I like the prospects for all three of these stocks.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Volatility has become the norm as big moves take the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 on a roller coaster ride.Yet in 2018, there are two stocks that would have taken a $1,000 investment on Jan. 1 and turned it into more than $8,000 in less than six months. Let's see why  (NASDAQ: NIHD) and  (NASDAQ: TNDM) have rocketed higher this year. data by It would have taken a big leap of faith to invest in Latin America's Nextel wireless service provider NII Holdings at the start of the year. For one thing, it was trading as a penny stock at the end of 2017, going for less than $0.50 per share, burning through its cash, and with significant debt.Its business was a mess for years as the world moved on to 3G and 4G networks and it was still offering only 2G service. In 2014, it filed for bankruptcy, and emerged the following year, having shed over $4 billion worth of debt. The devaluation of Brazil's real weighed heavily on its finances, though, as it sold off operations in Argentina, Mexico, Chile, and Peru leaving Brazil as its only market. The company only launched a 4G network in 2017, but by then it faced a lot of competitors.Its finances were once again a disaster and it was also in danger of losing its Nasdaq market listing, though that risk is now seemingly past.So what caused its stock to suddenly reverse course and zoom to such outrageous gains? It seems Brazil's National Telecommunications Agency will consider raising the cap on how much spectrum that telecoms can own, which might allow NII Holdings to sell off assets or be acquired. It's hired an advisor to sell its remaining 70% stake in Nextel Brazil, having previously sold a 30% position in order to raise $50 million. There was an option by the buyer to increase its stake to 60% for an additional $150 million, but the owner chose not to exercise it, and instead sold its 30% stake to another buyer for $70 million.During the company's conference call with analysts to discuss NII's earnings, CFO Dan Freiman said: \"When enacted, these changes and our better operational performance may open up new opportunities for us to unlock the value of our assets. We will proactively explore alternatives as the process evolves.\" The company expects the regulatory process to be completed by the third or fourth quarter of 2018.While there's been some financial improvement following a restructuring of its debt, there's no real reason to invest in NII Holdings. It was a precariously positioned company beforehand. And whatever benefits it may enjoy should this regulatory change come through have likely already been priced into the stock.Just because a stock has done well doesn't mean you should feel like you've missed out. A blind squirrel can still stumble on an acorn.  like NII Holdings would have been exactly that: gambling. And that's not the way you should invest your money.Investors would have done much better keeping an eye on Tandem Diabetes Care, a small, promising -- yet still risky -- medical products company that is growing sales, but also losing money. In the first quarter, it sold a few thousand of its next-generation insulin pump, the t:slim X2, and says it needs  of 80,000 pumps to break even on a cash flow basis, though it believes it can hit that milestone some time next year.Because diabetes is a huge growth market, with the incidence of the disease expected to grow 165% in the U.S. by 2050, Tandem has a promising technology that analysts believe, if successful, could challenge  (NYSE: MDT) for industry leadership. Medtronic offers a competing technology called a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) that tracks a patient's blood sugar over time to let them better manage their disease.As diabetics seek alternatives to insulin injections to regulate their condition, Tandem has partnered with  to bring its insulin pump system (that works with DexCom's monitoring system) to market early next year. The artificial pancreas monitors patients' blood glucose levels and uses an algorithm to know when to deliver an appropriate dose of insulin. At least one analyst thinks highly of Tandem's prospects for being able to grab market share when its system is commercialized. He  , which sent shares soaring.Although Medtronic is many times larger than Tandem, its CGM device is also much larger than Tandem's t:slim X2, and thus more cumbersome. And DexCom's monitors, which work with both systems, can be used for longer periods of time with Tandem's pump, making them more convenient. Also, the need for finger pricks for dosing decisions isn't needed with the t:slim X2 whereas they're still necessary with Medtronic's MiniMed system.While the potential for Tandem Diabetes Care may be more promising than for NII Holdings, it also is a risky proposition. Even though the FDA just approved Tandem's pump with its newest technology that predicts where insulin level needs and adjusts production accordingly, Medtronic also received regulatory approval for its own enhanced CGM system that now allows for treating patients between ages seven and 13.It removes a competitive advantage Tandem had with its pump being able to be used on those as young as six. Tandem's finances are probably not going to look pretty either for awhile yet. Still, by the t:slim X2 getting approved for use with DexCom's more feature-rich monitoring technology, a development that wasn't expected, there's good reason why Tandem Diabetes Care shares are soaring.While the run-up experienced by both companies this year has been extraordinary, it's becoming more clear that only one of them is really worth considering. That's what happens when you take risks with your investments, especially with  .Although both NII Holdings and Tandem Diabetes Care have destroyed shareholder value over the past three years, each losing around 80% of their value, which actually includes their amazing gains this year, only Tandem has the potential to become a profitable long-term investment.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

While this might prove to be a major driver, let's take a quick look at the other factors which will drive the upcoming results.In the first quarter of 2018, the company reported adjusted earnings of 63 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.3%. PerkinElmer reported adjusted revenues of approximately $644 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $616 million. Revenues also improved 25.3% from the year-ago quarter's tally.Notably, for the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 86 cents, reflecting year-over-year growth of 28.4%. The same for revenues is pinned at $693.8 million, indicating 26.8% growth. PerkinElmer delivered an average positive earnings surprise of almost 2% in the trailing four quarters.Let's delve into the factors that are likely to have an impact on second-quarter results. | Diagnostic revenues have been fortifying the company's market position in terms of exclusiveness of services in the respective markets. The segment accounted for 38.4% of total revenues in the last reported quarter. Adjusted operating income in the segment came in at $52.7 million, up from $44.7 million in the first quarter of 2017.Revenues were $247.5 million compared with $156.8 million a year ago, up 62% on a year-over-year basis. This indicates an improvement of 7% organically.For the Diagnostics market, the company offers products that are used to detect genetic disorders. PerkinElmer also provides digital x-ray flat panel detectors and infectious disease testing solutions in its Diagnostics portfolio.The second-quarter results are likely to reflect strong growth in the Diagnostic segment, particularly in the infectious disease business and reproductive health business. However, the applied genomics business, which was down on a year-over-year basis due to lesser-than-expected micro fluidic sales in the first quarter, may continue to be soft in the second quarter as well.It is also encouraging to note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Diagnostics segment is pegged at $274 million, up 10.9% sequentially.PerkinElmer has formulated a 'DAS Growth Strategy' that focuses on finalizing the organizational changes associated with the life sciences business under Discovery & Analytical Solutions (\"DAS\") segment. The company continues to leverage on its informatics and OneSource service offerings to improve the pharmaceutical customer's lab productivity in the DAS unit. Another important component of the DAS growth strategy is to accelerate growth in China and other emerging markets with increased investments.In the last reported quarter, Discovery and Analytical Solutions represented 61.2% of the company's total sales. Revenues from DAS totaled $247.5 million, up 62% year over year.Recently, the company collaborated with Helix to develop and commercialize exome sequencing-based tests that will help consumers make proactive health management decisions.Buoyed by the solid prospects, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $418 million, reflecting an improvement of 21.2% sequentially.PerkinElmer's gross and operating margin continues to improve primarily on the back of productivity initiatives and volume leverage. The new product introductions are expected to improve product mix and enhance gross margin. This along with stringent cost control will continue to drive operating margin in the second quarter.In the first quarter of 2018, adjusted gross profit in the quarter came in at $313.3 million, up 25.8% year over year. Adjusted gross margin, as a percentage of revenues, was 48.6% in the quarter, up 20 basis points (bps) year over year. The company expects significant gross margin expansion over the next three years.For 2018, PerkinElmer expects adjusted earnings of $3.60 per share, which is significantly higher than the previous guidance of $3.50. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is also pegged at $3.60. The company expects revenues of $2.8 billion in 2018, up from the earlier range of $2.72-$2.74 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $2.8 billion.Thus, PerkinElmer is confident about improving growth trajectory, which is likely to drive the second-quarter results.Per our proven model, a stock needs to have a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the fiscal third quarter. This is exactly the case here as you will see below. PerkinElmer has an Earnings ESP of +1.03. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . PerkinElmer carries a Zacks Rank #3.Please note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revision.Here are a few other medical stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Bio-Rad Laboratories  has an Earnings ESP of +7.41% and a Zacks Rank of 2.Baxter International Inc  has an Earnings ESP of +0.90% and a Zacks Rank of 2.DexCom, Inc  has an Earnings ESP of +12.84% and a Zacks Rank of 3.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

The use of these systems together can conceivably automate insulin dosing. However, software that can predict future blood sugar levels to avoid the risk of hypoglycemia, or ultra-low levels of blood sugar that can be life-threatening, is necessary for that to happen.For this reason, the approval of Tandem Diabetes Care's latest upgrade to its insulin pumps is important. In trials, using Tandem's Basal-IQ algorithm to predict blood sugar levels 30 minutes into the future resulted in a 31% relative reduction in time spent by patients with blood glucose levels below 70 mg/dL when compared to a CGM and an insulin pump alone.Tandem Diabetes Care's suspend feature works by automatically stopping insulin delivery when low blood sugar is expected and then automatically restarting it when blood glucose levels trend back upward.Until now,  's (NYSE: MDT) MiniMed 670G was the only approved  available to patients, but when Tandem Diabetes Care launches its new feature in August, it will provide stiff competition.Medtronic doesn't break out MiniMed 670G sales specifically, but the revenue opportunity associated with this advance in treatment is significant. The number of users of the MiniMed 670G increased from about 20,000 people in December 2017 to 70,000 exiting March 2018 and Medtronic cites the MiniMed 670G as major reason behind its low 20% year-over-year growth in its diabetes segment. Medtronic's diabetes sales totaled $2.1 billion in fiscal 2018.Unexpectedly, Tandem Diabetes Care's FDA approval includes the use of its new feature alongside  , the G6. A more feature-rich CGM than its predecessor, the G6 removes the need for finger sticks for calibration and its sensors can be worn for 10 days rather than seven days. Pairing the G6 with Tandem Diabetes Care's t:slim insulin pump out of the gate could make Tandem's solution even more attractive, and investors should therefore seriously consider adding this stock to their growth portfolios.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Thanks to a hefty amount of growth, high demand, fat margins and plenty of cash flow generation, both tech and healthcare stocks have surged since the end of the recession. And those growth trajectories seem assured. The question for investors is: which sector has the upper hand and should we choose for our portfolios?How about both?There's a whole ecosystem of tech stocks in the healthcare sector. Dubbed MedTech stocks, these firms feature plenty of innovative muscle. More importantly, they have plenty of growth backing them up. Investors don't have to sacrifice one sector for the other.Which MedTech stocks have the goods to power your portfolio? Here are five to buy today.When it comes to MedTech stocks,  (NASDAQ:  ) could be the poster child. The firm was one of the first to dive head-first in robotic-assisted surgery and that head start position is paying great benefits to ISRG shareholders.Today, more than  are located in hospitals across the world. And sales continue to grow as patient recovery times and surgeon errors decrease significantly when using one of Intuitive's systems. ISRG shipped more than 185 systems to hospitals during the first quarter of 2018 - a 39.1% year-over-year gain. At roughly $1.5 million per unit, that's a lot of coin flowing into ISRG's pockets.But Intuitive isn't done. It's taking a page out of the traditional tech stocks playbook: grab all the reoccurring revenue opportunities you can. After it's done selling a da Vinci, doctors need to keep calling-up sales staff for ISRG for instruments. Thanks to Intuitive's already sizable base of operating robots, recurring sales have turned into a very steady stream of revenues for the MedTech stock - about 71% of Intuitive Surgical's total revenues. For investors looking for a steady stream of growth, ISRG is a great choice.It's no secret that diabetes is becoming a serious pandemic and we're going to need new solutions to manage the disorder. Leading the way could be mid-cap  (NASDAQ:  ).A decade ago, DXCM created the first continuous glucose monitor. It was revolutionary at the time and allowed patients to monitor their levels in real time throughout the day. Dexcom has continued to improve on their systems and their latest version - the G6 - doesn't require finger sticks for calibration. Moreover, the device can be used with any insulin pump and can be viewed via an app on a variety of smartphone and smartwatches.That approach and first-mover status have allowed Dexcom to see some impressive sales.  , DXCM saw year-over-year growth of 30%. Management is expecting to produce more than $850 million in sales this year.Shares of MedTech stock have more than doubled since November. But given its growth, the size of the diabetes market and immense buyout potential, Dexcom could rise even further throughout the year.Looking for a more traditional technology pick in the healthcare sector? Then  (NASDAQ:  ) is your go-to choice. VEEV is an enterprise software company that uses cloud computing to deliver applications to the life sciences and drug producers. This includes everything from collecting trial data to applications for customer management for pharmaceutical companies.VEEV is basically  (NASDAQ:  ) for science.And that's a great position to be in. Firms have flocked to the MedTech stocks portfolio of applications. Sales remain swift and revenue  Those revenues are expected to keep growing like weeds as demand for real-time healthcare industry data continues to surge. Even better, is VEEV's fat margins allow it to be profitable. Net income jumped 20% last quarter as well.All in all, VEEV could be the next big thing in the technology sector. That is, if it doesn't get bought out first.Thanks to its leadership position, strong profits and continued growth, Veeva has long been considered a buyout candidate. Several major cloud players have their eye on the firm. Because of that, VEEV shares do trade at a slight premium to the market. But given the growth, that premium is well worth it.Like diabetes, heart disease is quickly becoming a huge issue as well. Detecting Arrhythmias and other problems as early as possible leads to better patient outcomes.  (NASDAQ:  ) is leading that charge.The firm makes a device called the Zio that is placed on your chest and provides 14 days' worth of cardiac monitoring. The beauty is that its roughly the size of an iPod shuffle, waterproof and transmits data wirelessly. By using the device, doctors are able to pick-up faint signs of strokes and other cardiovascular problems very early in the process. And thanks to its data collection and analyzation, IRTC is accumulating a huge pool of information to build even better studies and solutions.To be sure, IRTC is a one-trick pony at this point. But the pony is a very good one.  to climb as more doctors realize the benefits of the Zio in their practice. Patients like the device over competitors as it allows people to live normal lives while wearing it. With that, sales are expected to grow further over time.And let's not forget IRTC's market cap remains small at $2 billion. That's easily swallowable for a larger device marker.iRhythm is an up-and-comer, but the potential is very big.Health insurers, benefit managers and consumers are looking for ways to save on healthcare costs. Telemedicine is seen as the next big thing. Patients can fire-up their tablets, PCs or smartphones and speak to a physician in real time. (NASDAQ:  ) is the largest player in this growing field - and growing it is.Thanks to an acquisition of the #2 biggest telemedicine firm - Best Doctors - TDOC saw its revenues more than double during Q1. Organically,  . These jumps allowed TDOC to post narrower losses per share and beat analyst estimates by a wide margin. TDOC is quickly inching its way towards profitability.That could help explain why shares are up by more than 87% this year.But there is more potential ahead. More employers are adding the service to their benefits packages and TDOC has recently made moves to expand into mental health services. Offering the ability to see a psychiatrist from your own couch has huge appeal and could send growth into overdrive. Meanwhile, smart acquisitions of smaller telemedicine players continue to strengthen TDOCs position. All in all, this MedTech stock is quickly becoming the only player in the sector. And a strong one at that.Louis Navellier - the investor the  called an \"icon\" - just helped investors make 487% in the booming Chinese stock market \u2026 408% in the medical device sector \u2026 150% in Netflix \u2026 all in less than 2 years!

The company's acquisition-driven strategy is expected to boost growth by expanding existing product offerings across all business segments in the quarter. Strong prospects in the HeRO product line are a positive.In the last reported quarter, Merit Medical's adjusted earnings came in at 31 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.9%. Earnings rose 10.7% from the prior-year quarter's tally. In the quarter, worldwide revenues totaled $203 million on a reported basis, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.6%. The company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 10.2% in the trailing four quarters.For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $214.5 million, reflecting a rise of 15%. The same for adjusted earnings is at 40 cents, mirroring a 11.1% increase. | Let's delve into the factors that are likely to impact Merit Medical's upcoming quarterly results.Merit Medical has been leveraging on bolt-on buyouts to drive inorganic growth. On May 2, the company announced a worldwide distribution agreement with NinePoint Medical, Inc and the development of a strategic alliance between the Merit Endotek division and NinePoint Medical.The alliance is likely to combine the highly exclusive gastrointestinal and pulmonary medical devices from Merit Endotek with the ground-breaking Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) platform from NinePoint Medical.Merit Medical witnessed a major change in its leadership in the second quarter. On May 31, the company announced that Bernard Birkett has resigned as the chief financial officer. In his replacement, Raul Parra, a veteran who has already served the company for more than eight years, has been appointed as the new interim chief financial officer. The company's shares have significantly improved since then.Of the major approvals, the company's recently-approved Prelude Ideal product by the FDA deserves a mention. It is a unique vascular sheath. Strong demand for this product has bolstered the company's prominence in the MedTech markets. Apart from Prelude Ideal, the company recently received a 510(k) for a distal access SYNC and the Merit Pursue Microcatheter.Positive feedbacks and approvals from the top-notch regulatory bodies is likely to boost the top line in the second quarter with an expanded customer base. Notably, by the end of the first quarter of 2018, Merit Medical confirmed that it has almost 50 active R&D products in its portfolio.Merit Medical's HeRO product line has been a key contributor to growth. HeRO Graft, Super HeRO Adapter and HeRO Ally Revision Kit are the three platforms within the HeRO family of dialysis devices. Considering the solid global prospects of hemodialysis solutions, the HeRO product line is likely to provide Merit Medical with a competitive edge in the MedTech markets in the quarter to be reported.Per our proven model, a stock needs to have a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the fiscal third quarter.

Meanwhile, the upbeat reviews for the company's new Versa smartwatch should cause more people to give the Fitbit product a chance- enabling them to see how it is superior to Apple Watch. The company has also released Ace, the first and - as far as I know - so far the only smartwatch geared for kids.Here's a look at three different scenarios - bear, base and bull - for Fitbit stock to enable investors to get an idea of the risk/reward outlooks going forward:Revenue from the Versa ends up being only 20% to 30% higher than those of the Ionic as Apple's higher marketing dollars and great reputation, along with cheaper imports from Chinese companies, keep a lid on sales of Fitbit's new device. However, enough diabetic patients, women who want to utilize Fitbit's new female health tracking system, Android users, and smartwatch enthusiasts who like its lower price, long battery life and Coach app buy the Versa to keep sales of the product from crashing. Revenue from the company's Coach app also rises around 20% annually, and FIT sells around 300,000 Ace devices per year. A few more health insurers and major companies incentivize their customers/employees to use Fitbit products. The collaboration with Google doesn't result in any major innovations. And additional wearables released by Fitbit are not nearly as popular as the Versa.In this scenario, rising revenue from slightly higher sales of Versa, Ace, and the Coach app, along with increased revenue from employee and insurer incentivization programs, will be largely, although not completely, offset by lower tracker sales. Fitbit's revenue will increase around 10% per year. Investors will realize the company is not going to thrive - but isn't going bankrupt anytime soon. In this scenario, Fitbit stock will reach around $10 per share in early 2019. FIT could be acquired for around 20% more than in 2019 or 2020.Versa gathers a great deal of buzz and becomes quite popular among the groups mentioned previously. Revenue from the Versa is about four times that of the Ionic in 2018 and rises to six times its level during the holiday season of 2018 and in early 2019 as the device takes a great deal of market share from Apple Watch and other rivals.About 20% of U.S. health insurers and 5% of major U.S. employers incentivize their customers/employees to use FIT devices. Revenue from apps quadruple year-over-year, becoming significant. Ace sells at an annualized pace of 1 million. Due to incentives offered by employers and insurers, and the buzz around Fitbit, tracker sales remain little changed. Innovations created by Fitbit in tandem with Google and Dexcom cause 10% of doctors to start advocating some of their patients use the device. Fitbit's revenue doubles in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019, enabling it to become significantly profitable. Fitbit stock reaches around $25 by April 2019.Versa becomes by far the world's best-selling smartwatch by the holiday season, obtaining market share of around 70%. It is one of the five \"must-have\" products of the holiday season.About 50% of health insurers and 15% of major U.S. employers incentivize their customers/employees to use Fitbit devices as the products' diagnostic capabilities and their ability to promote people's health become much more widely accepted. Contributing to the latter sentiment are blockbuster innovations made by Fitbit and its partners. In the wake of these innovations, about 25% of U.S. doctors recommend that at least some of their patients use a Fitbit device. Ace sells at an annual rate of 4 million. New wearables released by Fitbit also generate strong sales.In this scenario, Fitbit revenue would quadruple and its annualized net income would reach about $1.5 billion. Fitbit stock would jump to at least $45 by April 2019. The company could be acquired by the end of 2019 for as much as $80 per share.As you can see from these scenarios, the risk/reward ratio for Fitbit stock is quite positive.

Net sales fell almost 2% year over year to $83.9 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $86 million. The company delivered a average positive earnings surprise of 9.79% in the trailing four quarters.For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 21 cents, reflecting a rise of10.5% year over year. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales isat $89 million, showing an increase of 2.4% year over yearLet's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. | AngioDynamics' expanding product pipeline, international market expansion and cost saving initiatives will provide considerable growth opportunities in the fourth quarter.AngioDynamics is a leading provider of minimally invasive medical devices used for vascular access, surgery, peripheral vascular disease and oncology. The company's product lines include ablation systems, fluid management systems, vascular access products, angiographic products and accessories, angioplasty products, drainage products, thrombolytic products and venous products. These are expected to boost the company's sales in the quarter to be reported.Further, the company continues to witness healthy demand for its coveted NanoKnife system for treating tumors. Increased penetration of the device contributed to revenues in the company's Oncology division. In fact, the recent regulatory approval of VOLTA, a radiofrequency ablation device in Japan, is also a significant positive for the quarter to be reported.The company is already looking to broaden its commercial opportunities. Along with Germany and Denmark, the company is also looking forward to achieve the same in Europe and the United Kingdom.However, in the third quarter, growth in the Fluid and Thrombus Management product lines was offset by declines in the Venous Insufficiency and Angiographic Catheter businesses. Further, declines in PICCs product line and lower sales related to the discontinued RFA product line dampened sales growth. We believe that these headwinds will persist in the fourth quarter.However, our quantitative model does not conclusively show earnings beat for AngioDynamics in this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. This is not the case here, as you will see below.

Transmitter revenues (20%) increased 28% from the prior-year quarter's tally to $37.7 million. Receiver revenues (8%) grew 26% year over year to $14.8 million.DexCom generated gross margin (as a percentage of revenues) of 64.5%, which contracted 160 basis points (bps) year over year. Margins were under pressure due to an inventory change and shift toward OUS and Medicare.International business displayed continued growth in the quarter, up 49% on a year-over-year basis.Research and development (R&D) expenses totaled $44.8 million in the quarter, down 6.9% year over year.Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $104.8 million in the reported quarter, increasing 21.3% year over year.DexCom raised the full-year 2018 guidance.The company expects 2018 revenues in the range of $850-$860 million, up from the previous range of $830-$850 million.Gross profit margin is projected in the band of 65% to 68%.Operating expenses, excluding investments in non-intensive programs, are expected to increase 10% from 2017.It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month.

Is Tandem Diabetes stock a buy?Produced by beta cells in the pancreas, insulin is necessary for removing glucose from the bloodstream so it can be stored in the liver and muscles for energy.Image source: Getty Images.With diabetes, patients either don't produce insulin (type 1) or they develop a resistance to the insulin they do produce (type 2).Type 1 diabetes is normally diagnosed in childhood and is thought to be caused by genetics or environmental factors that result in the immune system attacking beta cells. Occurring later in life, diet and smoking is thought to contribute to the onset of type 2 diabetes.Although type 1 diabetes is less common than type 2 diabetes, it still represents a 1.5 million addressable patient population in the United States. Currently, there are about 30 million Americans with type 2 diabetes and by 2030, the number of Americans with diabetes is expected to reach 55 million.Because type 1 diabetics don't produce insulin, they require more intensive insulin treatment. Historically, managing type 1 diabetes has involved multiple finger sticks per day to measure blood sugar levels, followed by insulin injections when necessary. Although type 2 diabetics don't always require insulin at first, most patients will need insulin injections eventually.Increasingly, type 1 patients are turning away from traditional finger sticks and insulin injections. Instead, they're  continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), such as those made by  (NASDAQ: DXCM) , and insulin pumps, such as those made by Tandem Diabetes Care.CGMs track blood sugar over time, providing diabetics with greater insight into changing trends in their blood glucose levels. Insulin pumps can be affixed to the body to provide insulin at regular intervals based upon glucose readings.The two devices have been used by patients separately to manage their disease for years, but technology is advancing that's allowing these devices to work together in a system that automates glucose measurement and insulin dosing.In 2016, Medtronic's MiniMed 670G became the first of these coordinated, closed-loop systems to secure an FDA go ahead. The MiniMed 670G, which includes a Medtronic CGM, insulin pump, and software, can suspend insulin if predicted blood sugar levels appear too low.The MiniMed 670G was officially launched in the summer of 2017 and demand for it is accelerating. Exiting the most recent quarter, there were over 70,000 people using the MiniMed 670G, up from 20,000 people in the prior quarter.Medtronic's monopoly of the closed-loop system market is quickly coming to an end.In August, Tandem Diabetes plans to make a new feature called Basal-IQ available to users of its t:slim X2 insulin pump that will stop the pump from delivering insulin when CGM readings predict insulin levels in the future will be too low. Once this feature is available, users will be able to create a system like the MiniMed 670G that combines DexCom's  , the G6, with the t:slim X2 to eliminate finger sticks and automate monitoring and insulin dosing.It remains to be seen if Tandem Diabetes can outsell Medtronic, but Tandem's system does have some advantages. Tandem Diabetes t:slim X2 pump is 38% smaller than the MiniMed 670G and the sensors for DexCom's G6 can be worn for 10 days, rather than seven days for Medtronic's CGM. Also, Tandem Diabetes solution essentially does away with fingers sticks, while finger sticks are still necessary to calibrate the MiniMed 670G.Medtronic doesn't reveal exactly how much money it's making on the MiniMed 670G, but the system costs thousands of dollars and growing demand for it is one reason why Medtronic's expects double-digit diabetes revenue growth this fiscal year. For perspective, that division contributed $2.1 billion to Medtronic's top-line last fiscal year.Tandem Diabetes Care is a much smaller company. In Q1 2018, it shipped 4,444 insulin pumps, up 58% year over year, and its sales totaled $27.3 million, up 44% year over year. Over the past 12 months, Tandem Diabetes sales were $116 million. . Data source: Since Medtronic exited last quarter with 70,000 MiniMed 670G users, winning away even a little market share could be financially significant to Tandem Diabetes; especially because it's still losing money. Despite its sales growth, Tandem Diabetes reported a net loss of $32.7 million in the first quarter of 2018.Tandem Diabetes is guiding for sales of between $132 million to $140 million, up 23% to 30% from 2017, but I suspect that forecast will increase now that the FDA's given its automated insulin system the OK.In the past, management has said it can break even on a cash flow basis once it reaches 80,000 installed pumps, which is something it hopes to achieve in the second half of next year. A good launch of its new system this summer could allow it to pull that timeline forward and if so, investors could be rewarded with profits sooner than previously expected.Overall, Tandem Diabetes' opportunity is big enough to have me thinking it's a stock worth buying, however, it and Medtronic won't have this market all to themselves forever. New closed-loop systems from  and Bigfoot Biomedical could be available in a year or two, so investors will want to pay close attention to their progress.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That makes it tough for Wall Street to stay on top of every stock, especially when so many investors focus on short-term returns, rather than the long-term opportunity for a company.

Are these stocks savvy buys for your portfolio? Read on to learn more about what makes them compelling investments. The number of Wall Street analysts with a \"hold\" rating on this diabetes medtech stock has increased from three to seven since February. And given analysts' reluctance toward \"sell\" ratings, that's a pretty pessimistic -- and I'd argue incorrect -- assessment of DexCom's opportunity.Image source: Getty Images.Yes, DexCom's shares have rallied significantly since FDA approval of its latest continuous glucose monitor (CGM) for diabetes, but long-term investors might be better off focusing on the fact that the addressable market for CGMs is massive, and likely to get even bigger in the coming decade.In the U.S. alone, over 30 million people are living with diabetes. And because 84 million Americans have prediabetes, or elevated blood sugar levels, the addressable patient population is expected to skyrocket to nearly 55 million by 2030.Currently, most of the demand for CGMs is coming from type 1 diabetes patients, who are at the greatest risk of life-threatening complications. However, a much bigger opportunity for DexCom is emerging in type 2 patients, who represent about 95% of diabetics in the United States.In Q1 2018, DexCom's  year over year to $184 million. And as the company's monitors gain more-widespread adoption by payers and patients in type 1  type 2 diabetes, management expects its full-year sales to exceed $850 million, up from $719 million in 2017. There are about 40,000 new type 1 diagnoses and 1.5 million total diabetes patients diagnosed annually in the U.S. So there's a very long runway ahead of this company that can support its future sales growth and, eventually, profitability.Overall, given an increasing diabetes market and the likelihood of DexCom delivering advances that give patients even greater control over their disease, I believe this is a great stock to add to growth portfolios. Chinese video streaming company  (NASDAQ: YY) recently spun off its game-streaming unit, Huya, in an IPO that raised $180 million.

Its average monthly active users (MAUs) rose 30% annually to 83.4 million last year, as its mobile MAUs jumped 75% to 36.2 million. Huya's total number of paying users rose 63% annually to 2.9 million during the fourth quarter, as its monthly active broadcasters climbed 11% to 610,000.Huya's revenue rose 174% annually to 2.18 billion yuan ($355.8 million) last year, with 107% sales growth in the fourth quarter. Its net loss narrowed from 625.6 million yuan in 2016 to 81 million yuan ($12.4 million) in 2017. It posted a net profit of 4.98 billion yuan ($765 million) during the fourth quarter, compared to a loss of 137.6 million yuan a year earlier.China's esports market reached 229 million gamers last year, according to market research firm Frost & Sullivan, and that figure is expected to hit 537 million by 2022.

It takes time to get noticed by Wall Street, and with a market capitalization of only $630 million, it'll be a bit before Control 4 is a household name. And becoming a household name is precisely the company's business.Control 4 provides a plethora of products and services for the high-end smart-home market. We're talking professionally installed systems that can cost upward of $50,000 all told. These solutions include anything and everything: smart lighting, audio, multiroom video, remote controls, doors, thermostats, as well as platform products to make everything work seamlessly. The company's future is intriguing for two reasons: its balance sheet and growth prospects.Starting with its balance sheet, consider that Control 4 ended the second quarter with more than $76 million in cash and no debt. The pristine balance sheet is even more impressive considering its history of acquisitions. Among other smart-home suppliers, it acquired CardAccess in 2014, Leaf in 2015, Pakedge in 2016, and ihiji in 2018. It has successfully integrated these, and with no debt can pounce on any opportunity that appears to be a good fit and can drive its top line higher.Control 4's growth prospects are tantalizing as well. Management estimates a 1.5% penetration of the U.S. market, with even more potential internationally. In 2011, international authorized dealers (a fancy way of saying dealers that sell the full Control 4 lineup) accounted for only 17% of total authorized dealers. At the end of 2017, international authorized dealers accounted for almost 30% of the total.With a balance sheet that enables Control 4 to pounce on more acquisitions, juicy international growth prospects,  , it won't be long before Wall Street's radar detects this smart-home company.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

However, in patients with diabetes, the pancreas either doesn't produce any or enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or the body has developed a resistance to the insulin it produces (type 2 diabetes).Resulting from genetic or environmental factors, type 1 diabetes is typically diagnosed in childhood or in adolescence. A lifelong disease, type 1 diabetes requires chronic blood glucose monitoring and regular insulin dosing to prevent the buildup of blood sugar that can lead to a series of health problems.Type 2 diabetes is usually diagnosed later in life than type 1 and while the cause of type 2 diabetes isn't fully understood, a person's genetics and lifestyle are considered contributing factors to developing insulin resistance. The most common type of diabetes, type 2 diabetes accounts for about 95% of diabetes patients. While type 2 patients don't have as intensive of a regimen for monitoring their blood sugar, these patients often progress to requiring insulin and ongoing analysis of blood sugar levels is critical.Absent adequate monitoring and the correct use of insulin, diabetes patients are at risk of developing a variety of health problems, including nerve damage that can lead to amputation, vision loss that can lead to blindness, and life-threatening kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), adults with diabetes have a two- to threefold higher risk of heart attack and stroke than their nondiabetic peers.Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death and overall, the average life expectancy of someone with diabetes at age 50 is reduced by nearly nine years.There are 30.3 million Americans living with diabetes in America, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and globally, the addressable patient population eclipses 422 million, up from 108 million in 1980, according to WHO.The number of people with diabetes is expected to increase substantially over the coming decade, and as a result, the total costs associated with treating it is forecast to skyrocket. Research from the Institute for Alternative Futures (IAF) concludes that the number of people with diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes in the U.S. will reach 54.9 million by 2030 and that spending on diabetes will increase to $622 billion in 2030 from $408 billion in 2015.Medications, including metformin, are widely used to help keep blood glucose levels from causing life-threatening problems in type 2 patients, but the most critical component of keeping diabetes in check for type 1 patients is accurate monitoring and insulin dosing to avoid dangerously high (hyperglycemia) or low (hypoglycemia) levels of blood sugar.Usually, type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients evaluate their blood sugar levels by using finger sticks to collect a small blood sample that can be analyzed by a glucose meter. Because type 1 diabetics produce very little or no insulin, they undergo this routine four to 10 times per day, including prior to eating, before and after exercising, and before falling asleep. Regular checks of blood sugar during the night aren't uncommon, either. Type 2 diabetics don't require as intensive of monitoring but they still check their blood sugar levels often, including around mealtimes.Despite regularly checking blood sugar with finger sticks, studies show most diabetes patients spend 70% of every day outside of the healthy range for blood sugar, and as a result, are at a greater risk of diabetes causing life-threatening problems.Recognizing that finger sticks and glucose metering fall short for many people, DexCom was founded in 1999 with a singular mission: to develop medical devices that continuously monitor blood glucose levels so that patients can better determine when they should be taking their insulin.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Until 2003, DexCom's research focused primarily on developing implantable sensors that could remain in the body for an extended time. But in 2004, growing concern that the company would face challenges gaining approval for a long-term implant solution that was more invasive and costly than traditional finger sticks, led to the development of short-term, temporary sensors that can be attached to the skin.In 2005, DexCom raised $56.4 million in an IPO on the Nasdaq to fund clinical trials of its short- and long-term system.The short-term sensor and CGM solution -- the STS continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system -- won FDA approval in 2006 after trials demonstrated patients spent less time outside a normal healthy blood sugar range while using it.The long-term implant solution, however, was halted after the company \"evaluated several months of data from feasibility studies\" and determined the product \"didn't warrant investing in a large pivotal trial.\" In short, creating a reliable long-term device that would pass muster with regulators, payers, and patients was too difficult a challenge to overcome, particularly given the successful launch of the short-term sensor solution, which was a revolutionary advance in its own right.The short-term STS system used tiny wire-like sensors that were inserted by the patient just under the skin that could be worn for three days. Data collected by these sensors was reported wirelessly to the STS receiver, where it was charted and displayed in a graph to patients. To help patients know when their blood glucose levels were too high or too low, the STS system also included a feature that triggered alerts.The company's second-generation product, the seven-day STS CGM system, got the FDA's nod in 2007. That system increased the time sensors could be worn by diabetics from three to seven days and it included a feature that allowed patients to download their glucose level data to a computer for review.These early systems provided revolutionary insight to patients but didn't begin to gain widespread adoption until 2008, when results from a Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation trial were unveiled. In its 322-person trial, CGMs significantly improved glucose control without hypoglycemia. The study was important because it reduced worry that the use of CGM's could cause patients to take too much insulin.Thanks in part to a growing body of evidence supporting the use of CGMs, DexCom's sales began to accelerate. In 2008, sales climbed 76% to $8.1 million and by 2011, sales were topping $40 million. The rapid run-up in sales allowed DexCom to plow more money into research and development, and that spending led to the development of its next generation of CGMs, the G-series.The company's first G-series CGM was the G4 Platinum, which won FDA approval in 2012. The G4 was smaller than the STS systems preceding it, and it improved hypoglycemic accuracy by 30%. The improvement in accuracy is important because CGM's don't measure glucose levels through the bloodstream. Instead, they do so through the interstitium, a fluid-filled space just under the skin. Because CGM sensors are inserted into the interstitium, the CGM's software contains code that deduces actual blood sugar levels from the sensor readings at points in time. Absent greater accuracy, patients were still at risk of taking too much insulin, which can cause hypoglycemia.The G4 also offered a longer transmission range between its sensors and the receiver and a more user-friendly color LCD display than previous devices.In 2015, DexCom followed up the G4 with the G5. The G5 allowed patients to see real-time data on either a DexCom receiver or on any compatible device, including smartphones, via an app. The G5 also included an option to securely share real-time data with a caregiver, such as a parent, and it provided access to a cloud-based repository where data could be stored for review. Importantly, the G5 was the first DexCom CGM to do away with the need to confirm CGM readings with finger sticks prior to taking insulin. Although finger sticks were still necessary every 12 hours to calibrate the system, the advance significantly reduced the burden of finger sticks on patients.Ongoing technological advances, such as the G4 and G5, alongside growing acceptance of CGMs generally, has been a boon to the company's top line. Since 2008, DexCom's annual sales have increased from less than $10 million to $718.5 million in 2017 -- a compounded annual growth of nearly 57%. data by  .DexCom isn't the only company profiting from continuous glucose monitoring systems.Medtronic and Abbott Labs are deep-pocketed foes and each has recently launched compelling new devices for diabetes that challenge DexCom.After  in 2016, Medtronic launched its MiniMed 670G in 2017. The MiniMed 670G is the world's first closed-loop monitoring and insulin dosing system to win the regulatory green light. It combines Medtronic's Guardian CGM and Medtronic's insulin pump in a system that automatically measures blood glucose levels every five minutes and then, automatically doses insulin when it's necessary.The MiniMed 670G marks a major advance in treating diabetics requiring extensive monitoring and so far, it's a hit. In Medtronic's 2018 fiscal fourth quarter, diabetes revenue rose 26% to $645 million because of the system.Abbott Labs is also riding a wave of growing demand following the  , the Freestyle Libre. When the Freestyle Libre won FDA approval in 2017, it became the first CGM approved that didn't require daily finger sticks for calibration. The device's sensors do have a 12-hour warm-up period in which data isn't recorded, however, so finger sticks are necessary during that period.The Freestyle Libre launched at a lower price point than DexCom's G5 and since it eliminated the need for finger sticks for calibration, it's become a commercial success. As of March 2018, 650,000 patients were using the Freestyle Libre and 50,000 new patients were being added monthly. Abbott hasn't said specifically how much money the Freestyle Libre's contributing to its top-line, but it has said that it was responsible for a 30% increase in its diabetes revenue in Q1 2018. Abbott Labs reports its diabetes sales in its \"other\" category and in Q1 2018, \"other\" revenue accounted for $430 million of Abbott Labs $7.4 billion in total sales.As you can see in the following chart, the 2017 approval of Abbott's Freestyle Libre took a toll on DexCom's share price. However, the sell-off proved temporary as the company's shares rallied sharply following the FDA approval of DexCom's latest CGM, the G6, in March 2018. data by  .The G6 is arguably more feature-rich than the Freestyle Libre. Like the Freestyle Libre, DexCom's G6 eliminates the need for finger sticks, but unlike Abbott Labs' CGM, the G6's sensors only have a two-hour warm-up period.The G6 automatically communicates data between its sensors and a receiver and the receiver can be a smartphone or similar device, too. Alternatively, Abbott's receiver has to be held within 1.5 inches of its sensors to transfer data and there's no app yet that allows patients to use a smartphone or tablet as the receiver.Furthermore, the G6 warns patients of dangerous glucose readings with an alarm, while the Freestyle Libre doesn't.The G6 system uses smaller sensors than DexCom's G5 and its sensors can be applied to the skin with a new one-touch applicator that's easier to use. Additionally, the G6's sensors can be worn for 10 days while the G5 sensors are only approved for seven days of use.IMAGE SOURCE: DEXCOM.G6's features could help DexCom outcompete the Freestyle Libre, but what's most exciting about the G6 is that it's the first CGM to win FDA approval as a stand-alone system or as a CGM for use in automated insulin dosing systems.Currently, Medtronic is the only company marketing a closed-loop monitoring and insulin dosing system (the aforementioned MiniMed 670G), but insulin pump makers  (NASDAQ: PODD) and  (NASDAQ: TNDM) are working on their own closed-loop systems and those systems are being designed for use with DexCom's CGMs.Studies for a system that pairs up the G5 with Insulet's Omnipod insulin pump are underway, and according to management, its closed-loop system could reach the market as soon as late 2019.Meanwhile, Tandem Diabetes is even closer to the finish line. Its t:slim X2 insulin pump is the only pump approved for use with DexCom's G5 that doesn't require finger sticks prior to dosing insulin, and Tandem says an FDA approval of a closed-loop system using the G5 could come as soon as the summer of 2018. An OK for a system that incorporates the G6 could be available by the end of 2018 or early 2019, too.The potential associated with DexCom's G6 isn't limited to those two solutions, though. DexCom is looking at pairing it up with other solutions, such as smart insulin pens or apps, too.DexCom's innovation isn't going to stop with the G6, either. The company's  with  (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) healthcare spinoff Verily on disposable CGM solutions that could find their way to the market in 2020.DexCom is at the forefront of CGM technology and its strategy of working with any insulin delivery system could help it win more market share over time.The company isn't profitable yet, though, and there's no guarantee its sales will reach the levels necessary to produce consistent earnings. Nevertheless, the sheer size of the addressable market for diabetes medical devices and a single-digit penetration rate for CGMs in that market suggest there's plenty of potential for revenue to climb high enough for DexCom to eventually reward shareholders with profits.Undeniably, DexCom's got heavyweight competition from Medtronic and Abbott Labs, but unlike those companies, it's a pure player in this market. If CGMs become a standard used alongside insulin delivery to treat diabetes patients, then its investors could benefit substantially. For that reason, I think it's worth owning.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks!The author(s) may have a position in any stocks mentioned. I already started to intro our next company as the first company to get a CGM approved. This one is Dexcom, their ticker is DXCM. They're a much smaller company, around a $7.5 billion market cap. About a decade ago, they were able to achieve this distinction of being the first FDA-approved maker of a continuous glucose monitor, which was pretty revolutionary. We mentioned  's system, and how that was very disruptive. Where does that leave Dexcom? Are they old news now, or are they still able to compete? A lot of people were very concerned about what this would mean for Dexcom. Now, Dexcom is 100% exposed to the diabetes marketplace, so this would be a pure-play within the area. They were pioneers and remain, I think, pioneers in CGM technology. They have taken an agnostic approach to developing CGMs, meaning that they want their CGM to be able to be used with whatever insulin pump or insulin delivery device a patient chooses. That could be an advantage for Dexcom longer-term.They closed the gap to the FreeStyle Libre earlier this year when the FDA approved their latest generation CGM, that's the G6. The G6 also doesn't require finger sticks for calibration. It does have one advantage in that the FDA approved it to be interoperable with other devices. That's the first time the FDA has given that kind of a nod in its language to one of these CGMs. That means that this CGM can be used, again, agnostically, with other insulin pumps made by other companies we're going to talk about in a second, or even with apps that are developed for smartphones, etc. Right. I'll add one other distinction that Dexcom has going for it. In a head-to-head study of the G5, which was its previous system, vs. the FreeStyle, which was Abbott's system, it showed that the G5 actually outperformed in terms of time required to detect hypoglycemia. That study just came out earlier this year and should be a little bit of a tailwind for them in trying to compete with Abbott. But, I also truly don't think that the winner that comes out on top is necessarily going to be the only winner. This is an enormous market, as we led off with at the very beginning of the episode, so I can see room for multiple winners. That's an awesome point. On the FreeStyle Libre, Abbott is saying that they're adding, I think, 50,000 patients a month. This is a huge market. And two-thirds of those patients, I think, are type 1, and one-third is type 2. We're barely scratching the surface in type 2 diabetes for CGMs.I think, as these machines get more savvy, smaller, more efficient, more easily used, and potentially cheaper, payers are going to begin to reimburse them more widely. Just to put it in context, too, with the FreeStyle Libre being on the market, Dexcom still delivered year over year growth in the first quarter of 30%. That was $184 million in revenue. This year, they're guiding for sales of $850-860 million. So, despite the threat from Abbott, it's not like this company is seeing a deceleration in its sales. Those are your CGM makers. Let's move on and talk a little bit about the insulin pump makers themselves. One of them that we want to highlight is called Insulet, ticker PODD. They're a $5 billion market cap company, and they make something that's called the Omnipod Insulin Management System. These are really cool devices. They look a little bit like the old AirPort that was made by  , they're kind of a saucer-like device. They're relatively small, though, and you can stick them on your skin to deliver insulin directly into your body. You can wear them for up to three days. It's a very freeing device. I happen to know someone, a neighbor who's a young 15-year-old, very active, and he wears one and absolutely loves it. It's paired up, typically, with a CGM. Oftentimes, it's being paired up with CGMs that are made by Dexcom. Its sales last year, in 2017, grew 26% to $460 million. And, thanks to some new Medicare reimbursement coverage, sales should grow to between $565-580 million this year. That's up 22-25%.So, again, a pure-play insulin pump maker that also, intriguingly, wants to challenge  . They're developing their own closed-loop system. We talked a little bit about Medtronic and their 670G, which is their artificial pancreas system. Well, Insulet is developing its own. That system will be pairing up its pods with Dexcom's CGM. And according to management, they plan on incorporating, over time, the latest Dexcom that just got approved, the G6. There are several different intriguing partnerships and overlaps between some of these businesses. It's actually difficult to pick apart who's going to head-to-head as a competitor and who's playing nice with interoperability and working together to develop things, because all of these companies are fairly closely tied together.You mentioned reimbursement. I do want to stress that that's actually a really important point to look into for each of these companies. When a new device is approved, that doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to be covered, particularly by Medicare and Medicaid, which cover an enormous amount of patients. So, you'll see in some of the earnings reports and press releases for these companies that they will highlight, \"Our newest device just got approved for coverage by Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit program.\" That's always really good news to see. So, another key development to look out for with all of these companies. Right, because otherwise you're paying for this stuff out of pocket and it can get pretty costly. It's been one of the things that's held back the penetration of the CGMs, especially, is showing and convincing payers that better control of your blood sugar levels over time will reduce their costs, it's a long-term money-saving thing. We've talked on the show about this in the past, Kristine, how difficult it is, because most people change their insurance within a few years. So, the company may be paying for something now that has a long-term benefit may actually not benefit from that long-term benefit, and maybe it's Medicare or someone else who actually gets the benefit from it. And these are largely razor-and-blade model businesses, which, from the business perspective, is really great. You have the initial sale of the device and then you have disposable consumable elements of it that produce recurring revenue. But, if you look at that from the payer side, maybe that's not quite as good, because that means that you're going to be on the hook for paying for not just the device, but also all of the consumables that go along with it.The last company that we want to talk about today is somewhat similar to Insulet in that they are an insulin pump maker. They're called Tandem Diabetes Care, ticker TNDM. Pretty small company here. Actually, I think they're the smallest we've talked about today. They're only a $660 million market cap company. They've been extremely volatile, they have been extremely dilutive of their shareholders. But, they have some partnerships with Dexcom, and they're doing some interesting things. They make the touchscreen t:slim X2 insulin pump. It's the only pump, they claim, that can allow for remote feature updates from a computer. That could be advantageous to people who want to be able to buy it once and be able to get some updates on it. It is, like Dexcom and Insulate, 100% exposed to the diabetes market, so theoretically its demand and sales are going to grow right alongside diabetes growth.It is also working, like Insulate is, on its own closed-loop artificial pancreas system that could theoretically someday challenge Medtronic. But, we're still probably at least a year away from starting to see that product come on the market, maybe two years, depending on how these trials play out. On that artificial pancreas system, it's also working with Dexcom. It's pairing up Dexcom's CGM with its pump.You mentioned that it's the smallest of the bunch that we're talking about today, absolutely. Its revenue in the first quarter was much smaller than these other companies. It was about $27 million in the first quarter. In 2017, they only did $108 million in sales. First quarter sales, though, were up 44%. That's good. We'll have to see whether or not they continue to win market share away from these other pump makers.I think one of the things, though, that we have to remember, Kristine, to tell all of our investors is that these pure-plays that we're talking about? They're all losing money. That's true. It makes them kind of hard to value on traditional metrics. And even when you use stuff like price-to-sales, they actually still look very expensive. I think that's a question worth exploring a little bit. Most of these companies do look like they're extremely expensive. Are there any bargains to be found in this space? Well, bargains are always relative. Right, Kristine? We talk about this when we talk about investing all the time. I think, yeah, it's great if you can buy a stock on sale. But what's more important over a ten or 20 or 30-year long-term time horizon is, how big is the market opportunity, and is there a competitive advantage that could allow one of these companies to win vs. another company.So, yes, the price-to-sales ratios are elevated on these stocks. You're running anywhere between 5-10X for the pure-plays. But you can justify that if you say to yourself, \"Yeah, but, we're only scratching the surface on the tens of millions of patients, theoretically, that could begin to use CGMs and pumps over the course of the next ten to 20 years.\"My advice to investors would be, yeah, recognize that if you're a value investor, you're not going to be buying these three pure-plays. You might want to look at Medtronic and Abbott instead. But, if you're a growth investor, stay focused on the big picture, which is that the patient population, the addressable market, is going to climb significantly over the course of the next decade. And if, by chance, you're looking at Tandem specifically because it's so small, and saying, \"Why shouldn't they be just as large as Insulet? Let me buy them now,\" I do want to make sure that I mention, this is a company that, as you mentioned, Todd, is losing money. But, that alone is not a terribly bad thing. That's OK for the place that they are right now in their business cycle.But, they have a large amount of debt. They have $72 million in cash. Most of that came from an equity offering in February. They have been extremely dilutive. Shares outstanding have risen 900% over the last one year, 400% since just January. This is a company that is fairly early stage relative to a company like Insulet, so they need financing, and they need to take these sorts of actions in order to keep their business running.So, when you're comparing your stocks, I wouldn't necessarily say, \"Hey, these two have the same addressable market, but Tandem is so much cheaper on a market cap basis, let me immediately go for that.\" I mean, I think it's an interesting company, but it's a lot riskier than the more developed, more mature Insulet, which is, by its own accord, also not going to be as mature and as developed as something like Medtronic. Yeah. Maybe, of the three pure-plays, Dexcom is the more mature. I don't want to say it's less risky, because it's a plenty risky stock, Kristine. [laughs] Just look at its stock price chart over the course of the last three years, right? But, the fact that it's agnostic and it has exposure to both Tandem and to Insulet, maybe that makes it a little bit less risky, because it doesn't matter which one of Insulet or Tandem gets to market first with a competitor to Medtronic's closed-loop system.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shares of  (NYSE:  ) have been on fire, with Fitbit stock rising roughly 40% in June alone. It's obviously been a massive rally and has led to an overbought condition in the stock. But there's reason for some investors to believe that it could have more room to run.So what's sparking this run? Stocks don't just rally 40% in two weeks and 65% from the April lows without a catalyst.In late April, Fitbit  with  (NASDAQ:  )(NASDAQ:  ) for healthcare purposes. With Google's help, Fitbit can leverage the cloud, machine learning and other technologies to bolster its technology offering. The company's focus on healthcare is what's helping drive it higher.The company reported its quarterly results in May and they were better than expected, but certainly not great. Revenue fell 17% year-over-year and FIT reported a loss-per-share rather than earnings-per-share. But overall, the outlook for Fitbit was mixed, to be honest.But the company's conference call played an important role, especially when it came to its healthcare potential. Co-founder, chairman and CEO James Park said:\"We continue to make progress on deepening our reach into health care and see ongoing evidence that payers are embracing wearable devices and beginning to provide financial incentives to consumers that change their behaviors.\"\"We believe that technology in wearable devices had flipped the traditional narrative in health care, empowering consumers with real information about their health. We believe this presents an opportunity to leverage our brand, engage consumers and change their behaviors.\"They talked about partnerships with  (NYSE:  ) and emphasized how its partnership with Google would allow for increased efficiency. They also talked about how valuable their healthcare data will become as their devices and software gains in usage.Indeed partnering with Google, insurance companies and  (NASDAQ:  ) - one of the largest glucose monitoring companies - leaves the door wide open for Fitbit.So what does all this mean for Fitbit stock? In May, several analysts slapped an $8 price target on the stock. That leaves about 10% upside from current levels on the table. Right before earnings, another analyst slapped a $10 price target on Fitbit stock. That was Alex Fuhrman of Craig-Hallum and even after the big rally, it still implies more than 30% upside from here.The one that really got Fitbit stock moving came from Citron Research. Andrew Left argues that Fitbit stock is going to $15 this year. That is, unless another company swoops in and snatches it up.Can Fitbit stock do it? He argues that Fitbit is transitioning from a \"dead\" step-counting fitness tracker to a high-potential med-tech device company. If so, its $1.5 billion market cap (plus a premium) is a relatively low price to pay for an acquirer - especially considering the market-leading Apple Watch from  (NASDAQ:  ) isn't something M&A buyers will ever pry away from Apple.Could it be Google? Perhaps, as it's shown to not be afraid of acquisitions in the past. We'll have to see how Fitbit's progress goes with its current initiatives.Click to EnlargeFitbit stock has been on a massive rally, but it needs to rest in my mind. Sporting an RSI (blue circle) north of 80 doesn't mean it will pullback. But it makes adding to the current gains that much harder.This month alone, Fitbit stock has pushed through the $6 and $7 level, the latter of which is quite significant. From a bulls' perspective, it would be great to see FIT stock consolidate between $7 and $7.50. That will give it time to work off its overbought condition and recharge for another leg higher.The key, though, is $7. Should it fail, there's no definitive level of support below. If that happens, we'll need to see how it shakes out and if Fitbit stock can reclaim $7 again. But for now, let's go one step at a time and first see if support holds and Fitbit stock can cool off.With a short interest of almost 15% - although likely lower now - FIT could have more upside if bulls can get a short-squeeze going again.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" smart beta exchange traded fund, the SPDR S&P Health Care Equipment ETF (XHE) debuted on 01/26/2011, and offers broad exposure to the Health Care ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.The ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on market capitalization weighted indexes that are designed to represent the market or a particular segment of the market.A good option for investors who believe in market efficiency, market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns.There are some investors, though, who think it's possible to beat the market with great stock selection; this group likely invests in another class of funds known as smart beta, which track non-cap weighted strategies.These indexes attempt to select stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance, based on certain fundamental characteristics or a combination of such characteristics.Methodologies like equal-weighting, one of the simplest options out there, fundamental weighting, and volatility/momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space, but not all of them can deliver superior returns.Because the fund has amassed over $259.84 M, this makes it the largest ETF in the Health Care ETFs. XHE is managed by State Street Global Advisors. This particular fund, before fees and expenses, seeks to match the performance of the S&P Health Care Equipment Select Industry Index.This Index represents the health care equipment and supplies sector of the S&P Total Market Index. The Index is one of nineteen S&P Select Industry Indices, each designed to measure the performance of a narrow sub-industry or group of sub-industries as defined by the GICS.The Health Care Index is a modified equal weight index.Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.With the least expensive product in the space, this ETF has annual operating expenses of 0.35%.XHE's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 0.02%.ETFs offer diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk, but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation in the Healthcare sector - about 100% of the portfolio.Looking at individual holdings, Inogen Inc. (INGN) accounts for about 2.29% of total assets, followed by Dexcom Inc. (DXCM) and Quidel Corporation (QDEL).Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 18.93% of XHE's total assets under management.XHE has added roughly 15.28% so far this year, and as of 05/16/2018, is up about 29.47% in the last one year. In the past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $56.42 and $74.71.The fund has a beta of 0.87 and standard deviation of 16.53% for the trailing three-year period, which makes XHE a medium choice in this particular space. With about 71 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.SPDR S&P Health Care Equipment ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Health Care ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.IShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF (IHI) tracks Dow Jones U.S. Select Medical Equipment Index. The fund has $1.80 B in assets. IHI has an expense ratio of 0.44%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Health Care ETFs.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit  .Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Solid contribution from Sensor revenues, Transmitter revenues and Receiver revenues are key catalysts at the moment. The glucose monitoring market represents significant commercial opportunity for DexCom. DexCom's opportunities in alternative markets such as the non-intensive diabetes management space, the hospital, gestational, pre-diabetes and obesity are likely to provide the company a competitive edge in the MedTech space. Further, the company's next-generation fully-disposable CGM systems is also in progressOn the flip side, cutthroat competition in the market for blood & glucose monitoring devices is a headwind for DexCom at the moment. We believe the company's margins will continue to be under pressure in the coming quarters, owing to high product development costs and rising expenditures on research & development. Lower expected margins on transmitter sales are also a cause of concern.A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space, which reported solid earnings this season, are Baxter International Inc.  , Varian Medical Systems, Inc.  and Intuitive Surgical, Inc.  .While Intuitive Surgical and Varian sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Baxter carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Calling in to Fool HQ in Alexandria, Virginia is  healthcare contributor Todd Campbell. Todd, what's the latest? I'm excited! I'm excited to talk today about what I think could be one of the most important investing themes in healthcare over the course of the next ten to 20 years. Absolutely. Today, just to dive right in, we're talking about the diabetes space, specifically some medical device makers within the diabetes space. We got a listener email from Brian B, thanks for writing in, who noticed that we tend to cover a lot of pharma companies and drug makers. It's true, we do. They have a lot of growth potential, I think they're very exciting. They have clinical updates all the time.But, Brian suggested that we spend a little bit more time of our coverage talking about medical devices and their makers. So, today, we thought we would do just that, specifically regarding the diabetes market. The impact of this disease, as you already alluded to, Todd, is staggering, and the number of patients is growing very quickly. Can you kick us off with some more background? Sure. I think it might be helpful to begin with, what is diabetes? I think we've all heard of diabetes, but we may not fully understand what the disease is. In healthy people, when we consume food and we get glucose into our bloodstream, the pancreas releases insulin, and that insulin allows our body to store the glucose for energy later on. In fact, glucose is the primary source of energy for the brain.In type 1 diabetes, because of either genetic or environmental factors, patients don't produce insulin, so they can't store the glucose. As a result, they end up with too much glucose in their bloodstream. That's called high blood sugar. In type 2 patients, basically, what happens is, they develop a resistance to the insulin that they produce, so they're not able to store the glucose.In both of those situations, Kristine, we're talking about a potentially life-threatening situation. You have consequences associated with diabetes that include everything from nerve loss to an increased risk of cardiovascular death. There are 30 million Americans alone with diabetes. Kristine, any guess as to how many people with prediabetes in the United States? Probably at least double the number of diabetics. 84 million! 84 million with elevated blood sugar levels that put them at the risk of diabetes. It's no wonder that there are 1.5 million new diabetes diagnoses in the U.S. alone every year. Yeah. And treatment on diabetes is going to continue to eat up more and more of our overall healthcare costs. From $408 billion to $622 billion, the levels of spending will rise between the years of 2015 and 2030, according to one study. It's a disease where it really does need to be managed for life. It's a chronic condition, and it is, as you mentioned, a life-threatening one, particularly if it's inadequately controlled.Traditionally, diabetics have had to prick their fingers for blood to measure their glucose levels throughout the day, and take action when necessary. So, while there are companies that are focused on making insulin or other non-insulin drugs to help regulate levels of insulin and glucose in the blood, there are also companies who are focused on the monitoring and trying to get the most practical information about the action that diabetics should then take. So, that's where you have your medical device makers come in. We oftentimes talk about, Kristine, the different drugs that are being brought to market by biopharma to try and help our bodies deal with these elevated levels of blood sugar. We don't oftentimes talk about the medical device companies, the med tech companies, that are out there trying to improve upon our understanding of our disease -- so, if we are a diabetic, helping us be able to have greater insight into our blood sugar levels so that we can treat ourselves better than we have in the past.If you were a diabetic in the 70s or 80s or 90s, I don't want to say it was a guessing game on insulin, but you were really depending on these finger sticks that you would do four to ten times a day to try to figure out, should I be taking insulin or not; or, you were relying on, basically, how your body was feeling. Like, am I starting to get a little woozy, or whatever. And unfortunately, if you wait for those symptoms to arrive, you're already having a problem. The idea would be to control the disease better so that you don't run the risk of either hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, which are two very dangerous conditions that can occur in diabetics. Yep, absolutely. There have been a couple of advances that are really exciting for diabetics to get more information more continuously and be better able to react in real-time when the levels are getting a little bit out of whack, as opposed to having to wait for the symptoms to show -- which, of course, at that point, that's later than necessary. At that point, ideally, you already would have adjusted.I think our best approach here is to go company by company that's working in the space, talking a little bit about what they've done. Let's start with the goliath of today's discussion, which is Medtronic. The ticker is MDT. They're a huge company, a $115 billion market cap. To be clear, they are not a pure-play in diabetes. They're also working in cardiovascular and pain and surgery and a bunch of other areas. But, they do have a diabetes segment. Right, and that diabetes segment doesn't represent a huge amount of the company's revenue, but there is some pretty exciting stuff going on at Medtronic in diabetes that's making that segment a bigger driver of the company's quarter-to-quarter performance.Medtronic has long participated in what's called the continuous glucose monitor market, the CGM market. You mentioned there were two ways, two medical devices, that were getting more increasingly used by patients to evaluate and control their disease. One of those two is the continuous glucose monitors. They've always been a participant within that marketplace.But, what happened in 2017 is that they won FDA approval for something called the MiniMed 670G. The 670G is the first \"closed-loop\" artificial pancreas system that the FDA has signed off on. Essentially, what we're talking about there is a system that will automatically evaluate your blood sugar levels by testing every five minutes, and then, as necessary, automatically administer insulin to help to keep that blood sugar in check. Which is really a pretty cool development. You think about going from the single point-in-time finger pricks, and then evolving the care to a CGM. Picture a sine curve, for my math nerds out there, where you can actually see that your levels are rising and falling, and watch that trend over time. That's even more complete information. Then, with this what they're calling artificial pancreas, that's a step even beyond the information of the CGM. Now, it's actually taking action on it, too, and adjusting insulin in response to that information. That is a huge step forward for convenience and timeliness of reacting to the data.Right now, there are about 20,000 patients that are using this device, which was approved back in September 2016. And it should probably begin to gather even more use. Yeah. I've polled some of my friends who are diabetics -- this is a type 1 diabetes solution, primarily, because those are the people who are going to need to be managing the disease most intensely -- and they tend to prefer some of the other options we're going to talk about right now over this. But I think, over time, as the technology evolves and these systems get easier on the patient to use, etc, I think you'll see more and more patients using this.You have 1.5 million Americans alone with type 1 diabetes. So, 20,000 patients worldwide using it, you don't have a huge amount of penetration. Nevertheless, it was still responsible for Medtronic's diabetes revenue growing by double digits year over year in Q1. Now, they didn't break out the exact sales of the MiniMed 670G. But what they did say is that diabetes segment sales in Q1 were $584 million. Which is pretty good. But, remember, Medtronic's sales in Q1 were $7.4 billion. So, if you're looking for a pure-play in diabetes, this isn't going to be it. Right. Another stock that's also not going to be your pure-play but is interesting to talk about in this space is Abbott. Their ticker is ABT. It's another huge company. They're over $100 billion. Again, they have a diabetes segment that's just one part of the larger company. Abbott, I believe, doesn't even break out their diabetes revenue, it just falls into the Other bucket for them. That Other bucket, for context, was a total of $430 million in revenue out of a total of $7.4 billion in the last quarter. So, again, they're only dealing with this market a little bit relative to the entire business, but they're still doing some interesting things.They have their FreeStyle Libre, which was the first CGM that was approved that didn't require additional finger pricks for calibration of the system. When this came out, it was pretty revolutionary. We're going a little bit out of order here, because the next stock that we want to talk about is the stock that created the first CGM. But, I will leave you in suspense for which company that was, if you don't already know. When Abbott came out with its system, the stock that made the original CGM took a beating. Yeah. One of the big knocks against CGMs, these continuous glucose monitors, has been that they still require the finger sticks for calibrating them regularly. That's why, when the FDA approved the FreeStyle Libre from Abbott last year, it was such a big and intense and wonderful development for patients. As a result, that's turned into quite a commercial opportunity for Abbott.Most of our listeners would probably be familiar with Abbott if they're income investors, because Abbott has a very long track record of -- as a matter of fact, it's a dividend aristocrat -- increasing its dividend every year. They don't necessarily think about Abbott for the diabetes business. But maybe that will change, because since they launched the FreeStyle Libre, in Q1 alone, their diabetes revenue grew 30% year over year. That's remarkable growth for a medical device segment of this size. Now, granted, again, like Medtronic, a very small proportion of the overall pie here at Abbott. But still an intriguing stock to keep an eye on. For sure. I already started to intro our next company as the first company to get a CGM approved. This one is Dexcom, their ticker is DXCM. They're a much smaller company, around a $7.5 billion market cap. About a decade ago, they were able to achieve this distinction of being the first FDA-approved maker of a continuous glucose monitor, which was pretty revolutionary. We mentioned Abbott's system, and how that was very disruptive. Where does that leave Dexcom? Are they old news now, or are they still able to compete? A lot of people were very concerned about what this would mean for Dexcom. Now, Dexcom is 100% exposed to the diabetes marketplace, so this would be a pure-play within the area. They were pioneers and remain, I think, pioneers in CGM technology. They have taken an agnostic approach to developing CGMs, meaning that they want their CGM to be able to be used with whatever insulin pump or insulin delivery device a patient chooses. That could be an advantage for Dexcom longer-term.They closed the gap to the FreeStyle Libre earlier this year when the FDA approved their latest generation CGM, that's the G6. The G6 also doesn't require finger sticks for calibration. It does have one advantage in that the FDA approved it to be interoperable with other devices. That's the first time the FDA has given that kind of a nod in its language to one of these CGMs. That means that this CGM can be used, again, agnostically, with other insulin pumps made by other companies we're going to talk about in a second, or even with apps that are developed for smartphones, etc. Right. I'll add one other distinction that Dexcom has going for it. In a head-to-head study of the G5, which was its previous system, vs. the FreeStyle, which was Abbott's system, it showed that the G5 actually outperformed in terms of time required to detect hypoglycemia. That study just came out earlier this year and should be a little bit of a tailwind for them in trying to compete with Abbott. But, I also truly don't think that the winner that comes out on top is necessarily going to be the only winner. This is an enormous market, as we led off with at the very beginning of the episode, so I can see room for multiple winners. That's an awesome point. On the FreeStyle Libre, Abbott is saying that they're adding, I think, 50,000 patients a month. This is a huge market. And two-thirds of those patients, I think, are type 1, and one-third is type 2. We're barely scratching the surface in type 2 diabetes for CGMs.I think, as these machines get more savvy, smaller, more efficient, more easily used, and potentially cheaper, payers are going to begin to reimburse them more widely. Just to put it in context, too, with the FreeStyle Libre being on the market, Dexcom still delivered year over year growth in the first quarter of 30%. That was $184 million in revenue. This year, they're guiding for sales of $850-860 million. So, despite the threat from Abbott, it's not like this company is seeing a deceleration in its sales. Those are your CGM makers. Let's move on and talk a little bit about the insulin pump makers themselves. One of them that we want to highlight is called Insulet, ticker PODD. They're a $5 billion market cap company, and they make something that's called the Omnipod Insulin Management System. These are really cool devices. They look a little bit like the old AirPort that was made by  , they're kind of a saucer-like device. They're relatively small, though, and you can stick them on your skin to deliver insulin directly into your body. You can wear them for up to three days. It's a very freeing device. I happen to know someone, a neighbor who's a young 15-year-old, very active, and he wears one and absolutely loves it. It's paired up, typically, with a CGM. Oftentimes, it's being paired up with CGMs that are made by Dexcom. Its sales last year, in 2017, grew 26% to $460 million. And, thanks to some new Medicare reimbursement coverage, sales should grow to between $565-580 million this year. That's up 22-25%.So, again, a pure-play insulin pump maker that also, intriguingly, wants to challenge Medtronic. They're developing their own closed-loop system. We talked a little bit about Medtronic and their 670G, which is their artificial pancreas system. Well, Insulet is developing its own. That system will be pairing up its pods with Dexcom's CGM. And according to management, they plan on incorporating, over time, the latest Dexcom that just got approved, the G6. There are several different intriguing partnerships and overlaps between some of these businesses. It's actually difficult to pick apart who's going to head-to-head as a competitor and who's playing nice with interoperability and working together to develop things, because all of these companies are fairly closely tied together.You mentioned reimbursement. I do want to stress that that's actually a really important point to look into for each of these companies. When a new device is approved, that doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to be covered, particularly by Medicare and Medicaid, which cover an enormous amount of patients. So, you'll see in some of the earnings reports and press releases for these companies that they will highlight, \"Our newest device just got approved for coverage by Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit program.\" That's always really good news to see. So, another key development to look out for with all of these companies. Right, because otherwise you're paying for this stuff out of pocket and it can get pretty costly. It's been one of the things that's held back the penetration of the CGMs, especially, is showing and convincing payers that better control of your blood sugar levels over time will reduce their costs, it's a long-term money-saving thing. We've talked on the show about this in the past, Kristine, how difficult it is, because most people change their insurance within a few years. So, the company may be paying for something now that has a long-term benefit may actually not benefit from that long-term benefit, and maybe it's Medicare or someone else who actually gets the benefit from it. And these are largely razor-and-blade model businesses, which, from the business perspective, is really great. You have the initial sale of the device and then you have disposable consumable elements of it that produce recurring revenue. But, if you look at that from the payer side, maybe that's not quite as good, because that means that you're going to be on the hook for paying for not just the device, but also all of the consumables that go along with it.The last company that we want to talk about today is somewhat similar to Insulet in that they are an insulin pump maker. They're called Tandem Diabetes Care, ticker TNDM. Pretty small company here. Actually, I think they're the smallest we've talked about today. They're only a $660 million market cap company. They've been extremely volatile, they have been extremely dilutive of their shareholders. But, they have some partnerships with Dexcom, and they're doing some interesting things. They make the touchscreen t:slim X2 insulin pump. It's the only pump, they claim, that can allow for remote feature updates from a computer. That could be advantageous to people who want to be able to buy it once and be able to get some updates on it. It is, like Dexcom and Insulate, 100% exposed to the diabetes market, so theoretically its demand and sales are going to grow right alongside diabetes growth.It is also working, like Insulate is, on its own closed-loop artificial pancreas system that could theoretically someday challenge Medtronic. But, we're still probably at least a year away from starting to see that product come on the market, maybe two years, depending on how these trials play out. On that artificial pancreas system, it's also working with Dexcom. It's pairing up Dexcom's CGM with its pump.You mentioned that it's the smallest of the bunch that we're talking about today, absolutely. Its revenue in the first quarter was much smaller than these other companies. It was about $27 million in the first quarter. In 2017, they only did $108 million in sales. First quarter sales, though, were up 44%. That's good. We'll have to see whether or not they continue to win market share away from these other pump makers.I think one of the things, though, that we have to remember, Kristine, to tell all of our investors is that these pure-plays that we're talking about? They're all losing money. That's true. It makes them kind of hard to value on traditional metrics. And even when you use stuff like price-to-sales, they actually still look very expensive. I think that's a question worth exploring a little bit. Most of these companies do look like they're extremely expensive. Are there any bargains to be found in this space? Well, bargains are always relative. Right, Kristine? We talk about this when we talk about investing all the time. I think, yeah, it's great if you can buy a stock on sale. But what's more important over a ten or 20 or 30-year long-term time horizon is, how big is the market opportunity, and is there a competitive advantage that could allow one of these companies to win vs. another company.So, yes, the price-to-sales ratios are elevated on these stocks. You're running anywhere between 5-10X for the pure-plays. But you can justify that if you say to yourself, \"Yeah, but, we're only scratching the surface on the tens of millions of patients, theoretically, that could begin to use CGMs and pumps over the course of the next ten to 20 years.\"My advice to investors would be, yeah, recognize that if you're a value investor, you're not going to be buying these three pure-plays. You might want to look at Medtronic and Abbott instead. But, if you're a growth investor, stay focused on the big picture, which is that the patient population, the addressable market, is going to climb significantly over the course of the next decade. And if, by chance, you're looking at Tandem specifically because it's so small, and saying, \"Why shouldn't they be just as large as Insulet? Let me buy them now,\" I do want to make sure that I mention, this is a company that, as you mentioned, Todd, is losing money. But, that alone is not a terribly bad thing. That's OK for the place that they are right now in their business cycle.But, they have a large amount of debt. They have $72 million in cash. Most of that came from an equity offering in February. They have been extremely dilutive. Shares outstanding have risen 900% over the last one year, 400% since just January. This is a company that is fairly early stage relative to a company like Insulet, so they need financing, and they need to take these sorts of actions in order to keep their business running.So, when you're comparing your stocks, I wouldn't necessarily say, \"Hey, these two have the same addressable market, but Tandem is so much cheaper on a market cap basis, let me immediately go for that.\" I mean, I think it's an interesting company, but it's a lot riskier than the more developed, more mature Insulet, which is, by its own accord, also not going to be as mature and as developed as something like Medtronic. Yeah. Maybe, of the three pure-plays, Dexcom is the more mature. I don't want to say it's less risky, because it's a plenty risky stock, Kristine. [laughs] Just look at its stock price chart over the course of the last three years, right? But, the fact that it's agnostic and it has exposure to both Tandem and to Insulet, maybe that makes it a little bit less risky, because it doesn't matter which one of Insulet or Tandem gets to market first with a competitor to Medtronic's closed-loop system. Yep, I agree. Thank you so much, Todd! That'll do it for today's show. I hope everyone enjoyed the break from our normal drug maker coverage.

XHE is managed by State Street Global Advisors. Before fees and expenses, XHE seeks to match the performance of the S&P Health Care Equipment Select Industry Index.This Index represents the health care equipment and supplies sector of the S&P Total Market Index. The Index is one of nineteen S&P Select Industry Indices, each designed to measure the performance of a narrow sub-industry or group of sub-industries as defined by the GICS.The Health Care Index is a modified equal weight index.Since cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.With the least expensive product in the space, this ETF has annual operating expenses of 0.35%.XHE's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 0.02%.ETFs offer diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk, but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.XHE's heaviest allocation is in the Healthcare sector, which is about 100% of the portfolio.Taking into account individual holdings, Dexcom Inc. (DXCM) accounts for about 1.82% of the fund's total assets, followed by Glaukos Corp (GKOS) and Insulet Corporation (PODD).The top 10 holdings account for about 17.55% of total assets under management.XHE has gained about 10.84% so far this year, and as of 04/21/2018, it's up approximately 27.13% in the last one year. In the past 52-week period, the fund has traded between $56.42 and $72.27.The fund has a beta of 0.90 and standard deviation of 16.59% for the trailing three-year period, which makes XHE a medium choice in this particular space. With about 71 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.SPDR S&P Health Care Equipment ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Health Care ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.IShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF (IHI) tracks Dow Jones U.S. Select Medical Equipment Index. The fund has $1.71 B in assets. IHI has an expense ratio of 0.44%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Health Care ETFs.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit  .Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Tandem has been working with its partner  (NASDAQ: DXCM) for many years to bring such a device to market.Traders are bidding up the share price today based on McKim's bullish statements.Tandem's stock has been on a massive tear since it bottomed out earlier this year. It's up more than 346% since January, which is a remarkable move in a short period of time. The optimism has been fueled in part by a  .The huge run in recent months might make you conclude that this has been a great stock to own. However, if you zoom out to include the company's entire history on the public markets, you'd get a different story: data by  .McKim may be correct when he says that Tandem will be a leader in the race to get the first truly closed-loop system to market. If that happens and the company can maintain its edge for several years, then the stock could be poised for a big run. However, the company faces steep competition from the likes of  and  , both of which are gunning to introduce artificial pancreases of their own to market as soon as possible. I'm not quite as confident as McKim that Tandem will be able to get there first and maintain its edge for long.In the meantime, Tandem's financial statements are likely to remain ugly for quite some time. Last year, it lost $73 million, and it's guiding for another considerable loss in 2018 as well. That likely means that it won't be long before the company taps shareholders yet again to keep the business afloat.Overall, I think that Tandem has a great product, and I admit that the company could be poised to continue growing rapidly from here. However, it's been an awful long-term investment and its financial situation remains extremely dicey. For that reason, I'll be keeping this stock far away from my portfolio for the foreseeable future.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The fund's quarterly buys and sells are therefore must-read material for any serious investor.What was the fund buying in the fourth quarter of 2017? In the high-growth biotech space, the fund initiated new, albeit modest, positions in both the diabetes device maker  (NASDAQ: DXCM) and the clinical-stage drugmaker  (NASDAQ: ANAB) , according to the latest 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Image source: Getty Images.Should investors take a cue from this elite money management firm and buy these two biotech stocks? Let's dig deeper to find out.DexCom is a top player in the relatively new field of continuous blood glucose sensing devices. Its once high-flying shares, however, have been in a tailspin over the last few months -- thanks to the  of  ' (NYSE: ABT) competing FreeStyle Libre System and its subsequent coverage by Medicare and Medicaid.As Abbott's continuous glucose monitoring device is both  than the G5 Mobile and doesn't need to be calibrated, DexCom's G5 Mobile system is clearly at a competitive disadvantage at this point. So it's not entirely surprising that investors are growing more and more concerned about DexCom's future growth prospects.Despite this new competitive threat, however, DexCom's sales are still expected to climb by an impressive 18.7% to $846 million this year. The company is also on track to reportedly launch its own \"no-calibration\" G6 continuous glucose monitoring device later this year, and its G5 system did reportedly outperform Abbott's FreeStyle Libre System in terms of the time required to detect hypoglycemia in people with type 1 diabetes in a head-to-head study earlier this year.The downside is that DexCom's shares remain on the expensive side even after this latest pullback. The company's trailing price-to-sales ratio, for example, currently stands at a sky-high 7.32. So you have to be willing to pay a fairly sizable premium if you want to buy into DexCom's supercharged growth story.AnaptysBio's shares have quadrupled in value in the just the past 12 months. The catalyst? data by  .Investors are apparently excited about AnaptysBio's experimental atopic dermatitis (eczema) candidate ANB020. This clinical-stage drug works by inhibiting the cell signaling molecule interleukin-33, which is known to play a key role in numerous inflammatory disorders.Recently, the company reported overwhelmingly  for ANBO20 in a small mid-stage study in adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. And based on this encouraging outcome, AnaptysBio is planning to evaluate the drug's safety and efficacy in a much larger mid-stage study for atopic dermatitis later this year. The company is also currently assessing ANBO20 in adult patients with peanut allergies and eosinophilic asthma.The big idea, if you will, is that ANBO20 may be able to grab the lion's share of the  if it proves to be as potent as advertised. That's a tall order for any experimental anti-inflammatory drug, but the initial results do appear to back this claim thus far.DexCom and AnaptysBio both have incredibly enticing long-term growth trajectories, but they also come with a hefty dose of risk. After all, there's no guarantee that DexCom can continue to grab market share in an increasingly competitive space, and the company will also have to constantly innovate to stay ahead of the field.AnaptysBio, for its part, still has a lot to prove in terms of the efficacy and safety of ANBO20 -- its most valuable product candidate. No matter how profound, small mid-stage trial results should always be taken with a rather large grain of salt.What's the verdict? These two mid-cap biotech stocks might be appealing to risk-tolerant investors on the hunt for unusual growth opportunities. But conservative investors should probably keep their distance because of their highly uncertain outlooks.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The company anticipates a decline in the Dental Supply segment - one of its major revenue components. While this can majorly dampen earnings, an expected improvement in Animal Segment operating income should drive results.Notably, Patterson Companies reported adjusted earnings of 51 cents per share in second-quarter fiscal 2018, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents. Net sales fell 2.3% from the year-ago quarter to $1.39 billion and lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.42 billion.Let us take a look at how things are shaping up before the release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Dental Supply segment is $592 million for third-quarter fiscal 2018. This reflects a decline of almost 5.4% year over year.The loss of exclusive distribution rights with Dentsply Sirona  forced the company to shift to a new enterprise resource planning system to efficiently manage inventory. However, the system is creating short-term challenges. Undoubtedly, the termination of the contract presents new opportunities for Patterson Companies to expand distribution platform to a wider range of product offerings. However, the company continues to witness heavy initial impact from the loss of this deal. | The company's decision to end exclusive distribution will affect results through fiscal 2018. In fact, dental segment sales have been sluggish over the last couple of quarters. Management has provided a dull guidance for the coming quarters as well.In the last quarter, dental sales (40% of total sales) fell 8.4% at constant currency (cc) year over year to approximately $553.6 million. The downside was caused by lower sales of CEREC and digital technology products. Management expects headwinds in the technology-based equipment business to persist through fiscal 2018, adding to the company's woes.For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for adjusted earnings is pegged at 51 cents, reflecting a decline of 12.1% year over year. Management anticipates headwinds in its technology equipment business to persist through fiscal 2018. This is primarily because of Patterson Companies' initiatives to transit its sales model to an expanded technology product portfolio.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.38 billion, showing a decline of 1.1% year over year.In the last quarter, the company estimated adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2018 in the range of $2.00-$2.10, way below the previous band of $2.25-$2.40. Patterson Companies expects deal amortization expenses of $25.3 million or 27 cents per share. The company projects integration and business restructuring expenses at $5.3 million or 6 cents per share.Animal Health is the second important contributor to revenues for Patterson Companies after the dental unit.Steady growth in this unit is expected to be a long-term growth driver. Management expects solid margin improvement in the segment on the back of enhanced partnerships with product manufacturers and strong sales execution. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for operating income from the Animal Health unit is pegged at $30.9 million, reflecting an improvement of 33.1% from the last quarter.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales is $786 million, reflecting a decline of 4.6% year over year.Our quantitative model does not show an earnings beat for Patterson Companies this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. This is not the case here, as you will see below.

Notably, the segments have also been continuously witnessing a rise in admissions, licensed beds and patient days, leading to higher revenues in turn. Moreover, the fourth quarter is likely to have experienced this favorable trend.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $2.6 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 6%. Our consensus estimate for revenues from Acute Care and Behavioral Health segments stands at $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion, up 6% and 6.7% respectively, year over year.The average number of licensed beds in the Acute Care hospitals and Behavioral Health centers kept increasing since 2012. Our consensus estimate for Average Licensed Beds in Acute Care and Behavioral Health is pegged at 6.1 billion and 23.1 billion, up 0.5% and 5.7% year over year, respectively.An increase in number of beds at both the facilities will likely drive up admission volumes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Admissions in Acute Care and Behavioral Health is pegged at 73.2 billion and 116.3 billion respectively, up 5.4% and 4.7% year over year, respectively.In addition, the company's continuous focus to enhance shareholders' value through share repurchases might have boosted its bottom line by limiting share count in the fourth quarter.However, rising costs related to interest payment, reserves for settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits plus impairments of long-lived assets are likely to have weighed on margins.Here are some other stocks also worth considering from the medical sector with the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this time around:Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 28.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the September put at the $45 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $2.20. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 4.9% return against the $45 commitment, or a 8.2% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to DXCM's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $45 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless DexCom Inc sees its shares decline 21.5% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $42.80 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $2.20 from $45), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 8.2% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for DexCom Inc, and highlighting in green where the $45 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the September put at the $45 strike for the 8.2% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for DexCom Inc (considering the last 253 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $57.11) to be 53%.

The revenue figure is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $211.9 million, which reflects an improvement of 28% from the fourth quarter of 2016.For fiscal 2017, total preliminary, unaudited revenues are expected to total $715 million, up 25% over 2016 levels. The full-year figure is well above the Zacks Consensus estimate of $710.63 million.Meanwhile, the estimate revision trend has been favorable as one estimate moved south over the past two months, with two movements in the opposite direction. In fact, the current year estimates narrowed down 2 cents to a loss of 63 cents per share. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). | For 2018, DexCom estimates total revenues in the range of $830-$850 million, courtesy of strong sensor volumes, international revenues and the expansion of DexCom's worldwide patient base. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 revenues is pegged at $856 million at the moment.Dexcom's launch of G6 sensor platform and expansionary moves in the Medicare and international markets are likely to boost revenues in 2018. However, cutthroat competition in the niche space is likely to mar the top line.However, the market is not really happy with DexCom's preliminary results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017. Following the announcement, the stock tumbled 1.5% in the last trading session to close at $54.60. The company is likely to report full financial results on Feb 27, 2018,  .DexCom's price movement in the past year has been unimpressive. The company reported a negative return of 20.9%, comparing unfavorably with the  's rally of 26%. The current level is also lower than the S&P 500's gain of 23.7% over the same time frame. DexCom's glucose monitoring devices are more invasive and better than other self-monitored glucose testing systems. Moreover, reports suggest that patients are unwilling to realize the benefits of continuous glucose monitoring at the moment.

A recent study by data scientists at the Fed revealed that positive news stories increase stock returns quickly. Specifically, positive news affects stock prices within a week. The Nasdaq Smart Portfolio aims to let investors capitalize on this by enabling individual investors to pinpoint stocks with a specific news sentiment.Investors can combine this with other types of data sources to bring an edge to their strategy. Here, for example, we used the  to scan for mega/ large cap stocks with substantial Street support and Very Bullish news sentiment signal. The analyst consensus is based on the last three months of ratings by over 4,700 analysts tracked by the screener.From the results this search generated we set out to find the most compelling stocks with soaring shares and a strong outlook. Now with this in mind let\u2019s dig down into three of the market\u2019s hottest stocks:Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba is buzzing right now. The media is busy digesting the fact that BABA shares almost doubled in 2017. For example, a recent report by the Nikkei Asian Review states that Tencent and Alibaba topped Asia\u2019s market cap ranking in 2017. And BABA isn\u2019t about to give up this leadership position anytime soon. As many articles point out, the company has multiple strategies up its sleeve to keep growth soaring.For instance, BABA plans to speed up the roll out of its Hema online-offline supermarkets. On January 9, the news broke that BABA will open 30 new Hema stores in Beijing in 2018. Consumers can shop, order groceries for home delivery and eat in-store, all via a Hema app connected to BABA\u2019s Alipay. At the same time, Quartz reported on January 5 that BABA has a new goal: to deliver its cloud computing tech to China\u2019s 6 million convenience stores. Using its Ling Shou Tong retail platform, BABA can advise independent retails how to optimize their stores to achieve maximum sales.The Street certainly approves of BABA\u2019s impressive tactics and execution. Only a couple of days ago, on January 9, top Nomura analyst  reiterated his BABA buy rating with a $219 price target. This indicates 15.4% upside from the current share price. According to Shi, BABA\u2019s e-commerce business stands to benefit from the increasingly powerful force of younger Chinese consumers. He expects BABA revenue to grow 50% year-over-year in the fiscal third quarter, with a 45% year-over-year gain for specifically Chinese retail. As for BABA\u2019s Hema roll out, Shi has this to say:\u201cAs we can see from the chart below, BABA has a \u2018Strong Buy\u2019 analyst consensus rating with 17 consecutive buy ratings in the last three months.Healthcare behemoth UNH is the sixth largest company in the US on the Fortune 500. The company offers both health care products and insurance services. Indeed, UNH has just launched a very innovative diabetes management system with the help of glucose specialist DexCom, Inc (). On January 10, at the massive Las Vegas electronics show CES, UnitedHealth revealed a new initiative that uses wearable technology and personalized support to help members manage Type 2 diabetes.\u201cContinuous glucose monitoring can be a game changer for people enrolled in our Medicare Advantage plans, as the data can be translated into personalized information that can be acted upon in real time\u201d stated UNH CEO Brian Thompson. The company wants to use computers, smartphones and wearables to simplify the \u2018healthcare experience\u2019 for consumers.Note that UNH also scores 100% Street support with 10 back-to-back buy ratings in three months. Meanwhile the average analyst price target of $249 suggests 11% upside potential from the current share price. Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs\u2019  initiated coverage of UNH with a bullish Buy rating and $269 price target (20% upside potential). He likes the stock because of its: 1) significant lead in national scale 2) favorable business mix, and 3) impressive adjusted earnings at 20% from 2017-2020.The world\u2019s largest express transportation company is already up 42% from this time last year. And following strong fiscal second-quarter results in late December the outlook continues to appear promising. \"Boy we had it right this year so far, knock on wood\u201d is one quote from the company\u2019s post-earning results call. In particular, F2Q18 (November-end) revenue grew 9.3% year-over-year with adjusted EPS of $3.18 (up 15% y/y) significantly topping consensus of $2.88.Given these figures, perhaps it\u2019s not surprising that FedEx has just announced that it is opening a new Shanghai hub to cope with increased express demand. \u201cThe Asia Pacific region remains the growth driver of the world,\u201d says David Cunningham, CEO of FedEx Express.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  ,  ,  ,  and  .The medical devices industry, which was once acclaimed for its high-paying jobs and research and development opportunities, has been subject to the much controversial 2.3% medical device excise tax. The MedTech fraternity is leaving no stone unturned to permanently do away with the dreadful tax - but has not been able to.Interestingly, the year 2017 has been quite an eventful one, courtesy of a series of socio-political occurrences that favored the space. The year witnessed the much talked-about election wherein Donald Trump took over the nation's charge as President. Not only were the new administration's health schemes thoroughly criticized but the reforms that were brought in taxation schemes became a much talked-about subject. Needless to say, these developments kept investors on their toes.Standing at the threshold of 2018 it is imperative for the investors thus to find the means which can dilute the macroeconomic woes and help them gain more. But before guiding you to make prudent investments for the year let's take a look at the various developments that have taken place within the space and see what awaits the investors in the coming year. : It has already been a year since trump became the President. However, his policies continue to be the most debated issue in the space. The new administration's Obamacare 'repeal & replacement' effort through Congress and the latest 'Executive Order', which apparently has been designed to provide quality healthcare to the nation at affordable rate, has already posed a serious threat to the healthcare community.Per critics, this order, forsaking the consideration of pre-existing health conditions has been designed to push people into \"junk\" insurance plans. The American Hospital Association has put forward an extremely bearish view on the executive order related to promote health care choice and competition. The association apprehends that the executive order will solely allow health insurance plans that cover fewer benefits and give lesser consumer protections. : According a report by Business Insider, the Republican tax plan repeals an itemized deduction that applies to healthcare expenses. If the new bill gets implemented, families with high healthcare expenditure will be impacted as these expenses will no longer be deducted from their taxes. Hence, people will no longer be interested in expensive healthcare or MedTech procedures.A report by The Hill says that the Section 4303 of the Republican tax bill plan imposes a 20% excise tax on goods manufactured overseas by subsidiaries of U.S. companies. Under the U.S. tax code, Puerto Rico is considered a foreign land which implies that U.S. parent companies will have to pay excise taxes if they purchase from their subsidiaries in the island. In this regard, the FDA recently found that around 30% of Puerto Rico's gross domestic product was driven by pharmaceuticals and medical devices in 2016. Undoubtedly, the latest tax plan has created an uproar among MedTech players who might witness a huge reduction in their turnover with the approval of the bill. : The medical community was extremely hopeful about Trump's regulatory agenda as it promised to abolish the infamous 2.3% medical device tax that was first was included in the 2010 health care reform law.The dreaded tax, imposed on the selling price instead of net profit and amounting to a stupendous sum, wiped out almost a quarter of the profit of medical technology companies. Realizing this, the U.S. House and Senate temporarily suspended it for two years at the beginning of 2015.Going by the available data, it is quite evident that this partial two-year repeal of the medical device tax has benefited the sector's development. Per data provided by the medical device trade group (in a Ken Blackwell article published by The Daily Caller), within this period, there was roughly an 83% rise in research and development (R&D) investments by MedTech players.The Republicans however have tightlipped on this tax raising the probability of its return in 2018. Undoubtedly, its comeback will be an additional burden for the MedTech fraternity, largely discouraging R&D activities. Per an article by Matt Murphy in wbur, sectors which are going to be hampered most by reimposition of this levy are X-ray and MRI machines, surgical instruments and pacemakers. : The Center for Devices and Radiological Health's (CDRH) strategic priorities have been recently published where it has elaborately discussed the Value and Use of Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) in Assessing Effects of Medical Devices. According to a Medcitynews article by John Speer, CDRH, the umbrella organization at the FDA, talked about a plan that would entitle patients to have access to high-quality, safe and effective medical devices. PRO basically means a patient's assessment of their own health status or quality of life.This is especially impactful because the majority of medical devices in the United States are cleared by FDA via the 510(k) premarket submission where patients have no voice as such. With the new PRO concept, this is no longer going to be valid. Per the report, \"given the expected behavior of the FDA by industry, it might increase the time taken to get through the regulatory process and increase costs to produce Class II devices.\" This is because, now they will have to conduct some sort of PRO study if this becomes a requirement. Also they will need additional funding to support the study activities. : Per an Emergo Group report, the FDA's 2018 user fees, established by the Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2017 (MDUFA IV), will increase for all registration-related categories, including a sizeable fee increase for 510(k) premarket notification submissions by larger companies. In addition, FDA Establishment Registration fees will jump 37% to $4,642 for the 2018 fiscal from $3,382 in 2017. This implementation may pose a huge burden for the digital health industry and small companies in the medical device space.In such a tumultuous scenario, to save investors from the time-taking process of identifying the powerful MedTech stocks who may brave the industry threats in 2018, we have taken the help of the  .Here we have highlighted four MedTech stocks with market cap of $500 million or more with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and positive estimate revision trend of more than 5% for fiscal 2018.

Additionally, the company has a strong cash balance that enables it to carry out share repurchases and provide solid returns to investors. The expansion in gross and operating margin also buoys optimism. The company is also constantly investing in R&D for product innovation.Based on this bullish sentiment, over the past four weeks the company's EPS estimate for the upcoming fiscal has improved 6.08%. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1. You can see  : Market is particularly upbeat about the company's CE Mark approval for its Mazor X Surgical Assurance platform. The approval will allow Mazor Robotics and its partner Medtronic to commercialize, co-promote and market the Mazor X platformin countries that recognize CE Mark. This development should get reflected in Mazor's 2018 performance. This $1384 billon stock has a Zacks Rank #2.

Per the agreement, DexCom's flagship continuous glucose monitoring system will be added to Lilly's Connected Diabetes Ecosystem.This Zacks Rank #2 stock with a market cap of $4.93 billion is a valuable pick for 2018.

Source: ShutterstockA recent report claims that the company has been working for months to develop a version of Fitbit for kids. Several unnamed sources spoke about the matter, but didn't provide details on how the devices would differ from current ones.The idea of developing a version of Fitbit for kids makes sense. There's already been parents using wearables as a way to track their children and that behavior is only expected to increase over time. A Fitbit device with kids in mind could make this easier for parents to do while still letting the kids get their own advantages from it.While we still don't know much about a possible version of Fitbit for kids,  claims that it may have the ability to track glucose levels. The company has been working to expand its fitness tracker into a health-monitoring device and has been working with glucose monitoring company  (NASDAQ:  ).There's a large market that a version of Fitbit for kids could tap into. This is due to the current age recommendations for Fitbit. The company currently only suggests users of its wearable devices to be  . However, the release of a device for kids could help it grow its users well beyond its current level. Either way, the product is still in early development and won't likely come out for some time yet.FIT stock was up slightly as of Thursday afternoon.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 28 after market close.Last quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of $1.64 per share, having missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.5%. The bottom line, however, grew 2.5% year over year on higher revenues.Let's see, how things are shaping up for this announcement.Our proven model shows that Universal Health has the right combination of two key ingredients to beat estimates this quarter. : Universal Health has an  of +0.39%. A stock's positive ESP raises confidence about an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . |  : Universal Health carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP as stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have significantly higher chances of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Both segments of Universal Health namely Acute Care and Behavioral Health, have been delivering strong results over the past many quarters. Notably, the segments have also been continuously witnessing a rise in admissions, licensed beds and patient days, leading to higher revenues in turn. Moreover, the fourth quarter is likely to have experienced this favorable trend.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues in the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $2.6 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 6%. Our consensus estimate for revenues from Acute Care and Behavioral Health segments stands at $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion, up 6% and 6.7% respectively, year over year.The average number of licensed beds in the Acute Care hospitals and Behavioral Health centers kept increasing since 2012. Our consensus estimate for Average Licensed Beds in Acute Care and Behavioral Health is pegged at 6.1 billion and 23.1 billion, up 0.5% and 5.7% year over year, respectively.An increase in number of beds at both the facilities will likely drive up admission volumes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Admissions in Acute Care and Behavioral Health is pegged at 73.2 billion and 116.3 billion respectively, up 5.4% and 4.7% year over year, respectively.In addition, the company's continuous focus to enhance shareholders' value through share repurchases might have boosted its bottom line by limiting share count in the fourth quarter.However, rising costs related to interest payment, reserves for settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits plus impairments of long-lived assets are likely to have weighed on margins.Here are some other stocks worth considering from the medical sector with the right combination of elements to also come up with an earnings beat this time around:Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 28. The company has an Earnings ESP of +41.20% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see  .Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.  , which is set to release fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 27, has an Earnings ESP of +2.61% and a Zacks Rank of 2 .DexCom, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +126.47% and is a Zacks #3 Ranked player. The company is set to announce fourth-quarter earnings on Feb 27.Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The company has been trading above the broader  over the past month. The stock has gained 5.5%, higher than the broader industry's gain of 0.8%.We believe the glucose monitoring market represents significant opportunity for DexCom. The diabetes market is large and growing. In the third quarter of 2017, management at Dexcom confirmed that the company is well poised to meet the unmet demand in the global diabetic space, especially when it comes to the continuous glucose monitoring facility.DexCom has collaborative agreements with several companies, which should not only bring in cash in the form of milestone payments and royalties but should also help expand its product portfolio. In this regard, DexCom announced its collaboration in September 2017 with leading wearables brand Fitbit to develop and market products for better management of diabetes and get a clearer picture of overall health with easy-to-use mobile tools.DexCom continues to focus on international markets, especially Germany. The company is also eyeing the sizeable markets of India, China and Japan. Given the demographic trends and lifestyle in countries outside the United States and Europe, we believe that DexCom has bountiful opportunities in the international market.However, the company faces reimbursement risks owing to efforts to control healthcare expenses. Further, with an increasing demand for its offerings, DexCom might face supply constraints in the near term.The market for blood glucose monitoring devices is highly competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by product launches. With respect to the G4 Platinum system, DexCom competes directly with Roche Diabetes Care - a division of Roche Diagnostics; LifeScan, Inc. - a division of Johnson & Johnson; the MediSense and TheraSense divisions of Abbott Laboratories; and Bayer Corporation.DexCom carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked medical stocks are athenahealth, Inc.  , Align Technology, Inc.  and Luminex Corporation  . Notably, athenahealth, and Align Technology sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while Luminex carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see athenahealth has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 22.3%. The stock has rallied roughly 17.1% over a year.Align Technology has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 28.9%. The stock has gained 134.5% in a year.Luminex has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 16.3%.

The Fitbit investment is in a company called Sano, which aims to develop a wearable, coin-sized blood sugar monitor for diabetics. The Sano patch would feed this data into a wearable for display - presumably the Fitbit Ionic smartwatch (or its successor).FIT stock popped on the news on Friday morning, but is now down 2.5% shortly after the bell Monday morning. broke the news on Friday that Fitbit was  , a startup focused on developing a blood glucose monitoring patch.Speaking about the Fitbit investment, CEO James Park told  :\"This fits into our strategy of looking beyond the device and thinking more about (health) solutions. I think the complete solution comes in the form of having some monitoring solution that is coupled with a display, and a wearable that can give you the interventions at the right moment.\"According to the report, the Sano patch won't be ready to ship for about a year. It's  non-invasive tech - it uses needles that penetrate the skin. Sano claims, however, that their needles don't penetrate as far as current solutions,  The Sano patch will also be less expensive and much smaller than currently available blood glucose monitoring technology.This Fitbit investment is driven by the current trend toward health and fitness for smartwatch sales. With the first wave of early smartwatch adopters in the rear view mirror, people concerned with health and fitness tracking are the next big market. Apple noted this, then switched the focus of its smartwatch and was rewarded with surging  .Apple's move hit Fitbit, which was focused on wearables but lacked a true smartwatch. Since the Apple Watch was released, Fitbit has been in a slump - FIT stock is down nearly 88% since its 2015 heights.Apple sees the health market as the key to drive Apple Watch sales to an entirely new level. And diabetes monitoring is a potential gold mine. Hundreds of millions of people worldwide suffer from diabetes. The World Health Organization (WHO) says that in 2015, 8.5% of adults 18 or older were diabetic. WHO is also predicting that globally, the disease will be the  .Effective blood glucose monitoring is key to managing diabetes. Currently, this means frequent and painful pricks with a needle to draw and then test blood.It's no secret that  that would feed into the Apple Watch. If consumers turn to Apple to monitor their diabetes, that could drive massive Apple Watch sales, with health insurance companies potentially footing the bill.The Fitbit investment in Sano is an attempt to take advantage of that massive market for diabetes management. And while the Sano patch does involve needles - as opposed to the optical sensor solution Apple is reportedly working toward - it appears to be further along in development than anything Apple has.Fitbit recently announced its trackers had been chosen for use in the  . And both Fitbit and Apple already partner with a number of existing companies offering blood glucose monitoring technology, including  (NASDAQ:  ). But these existing monitors are relatively bulky and expensive.If the Fitbit investment in Sano pays off, Fitbit would have a coin-sized, wearable blood sugar monitor that feeds data to the Fitbit Ionic smartwatch. And the impact of beating Apple to such a huge potential market is going to have a significant upside for FIT stock.That explains the pop, but why the drop in FIT stock?The Sano patch is still a year out, and a lot can happen in that time. Realization that the patch still requires needles may also have scared off some investors.With their investment in Sano, however, Fitbit has made it clear it has no intention of letting the Apple Watch take over the developing market for health wearables the same way it steamrolled the smartwatch market. s.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he medical devices industry, which was once acclaimed for its high-paying jobs and research and development opportunities, has been subject to the much controversial 2.3% medical device excise tax.

But before guiding you to make prudent investments for the year let's take a look at the various developments that have taken place within the space and see what awaits the investors in the coming year. : It has already been a year since trump became the President. However, his policies continue to be the most debated issue in the space. The new administration's Obamacare 'repeal & replacement' effort through Congress and the latest 'Executive Order', which apparently has been designed to provide quality healthcare to the nation at affordable rate, has already posed a serious threat to the healthcare community.Per critics, this order, forsaking the consideration of pre-existing health conditions has been designed to push people into \"junk\" insurance plans. The American Hospital Association has put forward an extremely bearish view on the executive order related to promote health care choice and competition. The association apprehends that the executive order will solely allow health insurance plans that cover fewer benefits and give lesser consumer protections. : According a report by Business Insider, the Republican tax plan repeals an itemized deduction that applies to healthcare expenses. If the new bill gets implemented, families with high healthcare expenditure will be impacted as these expenses will no longer be deducted from their taxes. Hence, people will no longer be interested in expensive healthcare or MedTech procedures.A report by The Hill says that the Section 4303 of the Republican tax bill plan imposes a 20% excise tax on goods manufactured overseas by subsidiaries of U.S. companies. Under the U.S. tax code, Puerto Rico is considered a foreign land which implies that U.S. parent companies will have to pay excise taxes if they purchase from their subsidiaries in the island. In this regard, the FDA recently found that around 30% of Puerto Rico's gross domestic product was driven by pharmaceuticals and medical devices in 2016. Undoubtedly, the latest tax plan has created an uproar among MedTech players who might witness a huge reduction in their turnover with the approval of the bill. : The medical community was extremely hopeful about Trump's regulatory agenda as it promised to abolish the infamous 2.3% medical device tax that was first was included in the 2010 health care reform law.The dreaded tax, imposed on the selling price instead of net profit and amounting to a stupendous sum, wiped out almost a quarter of the profit of medical technology companies. Realizing this, the U.S. House and Senate temporarily suspended it for two years at the beginning of 2015.Going by the available data, it is quite evident that this partial two-year repeal of the medical device tax has benefited the sector's development. Per data provided by the medical device trade group (in a Ken Blackwell article published by The Daily Caller), within this period, there was roughly an 83% rise in research and development (R&D) investments by MedTech players.The Republicans however have tightlipped on this tax raising the probability of its return in 2018. Undoubtedly, its comeback will be an additional burden for the MedTech fraternity, largely discouraging R&D activities. Per an article by Matt Murphy in wbur, sectors which are going to be hampered most by reimposition of this levy are X-ray and MRI machines, surgical instruments and pacemakers. : The Center for Devices and Radiological Health's (CDRH) strategic priorities have been recently published where it has elaborately discussed the Value and Use of Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) in Assessing Effects of Medical Devices. According to a Medcitynews article by John Speer, CDRH, the umbrella organization at the FDA, talked about a plan that would entitle patients to have access to high-quality, safe and effective medical devices. PRO basically means a patient's assessment of their own health status or quality of life.This is especially impactful because the majority of medical devices in the United States are cleared by FDA via the 510(k) premarket submission where patients have no voice as such. With the new PRO concept, this is no longer going to be valid. Per the report, \"given the expected behavior of the FDA by industry, it might increase the time taken to get through the regulatory process and increase costs to produce Class II devices.\" This is because, now they will have to conduct some sort of PRO study if this becomes a requirement. Also they will need additional funding to support the study activities. : Per an Emergo Group report, the FDA's 2018 user fees, established by the Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2017 (MDUFA IV), will increase for all registration-related categories, including a sizeable fee increase for 510(k) premarket notification submissions by larger companies. In addition, FDA Establishment Registration fees will jump 37% to $4,642 for the 2018 fiscal from $3,382 in 2017. This implementation may pose a huge burden for the digital health industry and small companies in the medical device space.In such a tumultuous scenario, to save investors from the time-taking process of identifying the powerful MedTech stocks who may brave the industry threats in 2018, we have taken the help of the  .Here we have highlighted four MedTech stocks with market cap of $500 million or more with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and positive estimate revision trend of more than 5% for fiscal 2018.

In fact, devices such as CGM, smart-pens and insulin pumps, drugs, apps and other analytical tools can link patients and their care teams to deal with the disease in a better way. The Connected Diabetes Ecosystem will depend on Lilly's core diabetes expertise along with the devices and tools provided by Dexcom.Per Lilly, the agreement with Dexcom will enable the company to reduce the daily burden for people with diabetes. Studies are expected to begin by the end of 2017.So far this year, shares of Lilly have increased 13.5% compared with the  's gain of 14.8%.Lilly has a strong portfolio of diabetes treatments including Trulicity (GLP-1), Jardiance (SGLT-2), Trajenta, Humulin, Basaglar, Humalog, and Glyxambi.

Between 1990 and 2010, the number of U.S. residents with diabetes tripled, and the number of new cases annually doubled. Both prevalence and costs associated with diabetes are projected to increase by more than 50% by 2030.But where there's a problem, there's also an opportunity. Healthcare companies continue to develop innovative new approaches to treating and managing diabetes. This innovation in turn creates value for investors.At least 15 publicly traded companies have current products addressing diabetes either on the market or in development. A few of these stocks hold the potential to generate market-beating returns for investors. I think that  (NYSE: ABT) ,  (NYSE: BDX) , and  (NYSE: JNJ) will especially stand out over the next few years. Here's why these are three top diabetes stocks to buy now.Image source: Getty Images.Abbott Labs claims a market cap of close to $98 billion. The company's primary focus in the past has been on branded generic drugs, diagnostic systems and tests, nutritional products, and cardiovascular and neuromodulation medical devices. Abbott's diabetes care unit revenue wasn't even listed separately in the company's financial statements.However, diabetes should be much more important to Abbott in the future. In September, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the company's FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System. It's the first continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system approved by the FDA that doesn't require a finger-stick blood sample.As you might imagine, the potential for the FreeStyle Libre system is huge.  (NASDAQ: DXCM) has been the leader in of the fast-growing CGM market so far. FDA approval for Abbott's FreeStyle Libre system caused  because of the threat from Abbott. Although DexCom is developing its own no-finger-stick device, it's about a year away from being able to market the product. That gives Abbott a nice head start.Abbott was already enjoying a fantastic year even before the FDA decision. The stock is up more than 40% year to date, driven in large part by the company's acquisition earlier this year of St. Jude Medical. This acquisition made Abbott an even more formidable force in the medical device market.There's also a lot for investors to like about Abbott's dividend. Its yield currently stands at 1.91%. Abbott has increased its dividend for 45 consecutive years and has paid a dividend every quarter since 1924.Becton, Dickinson and Company's market cap of nearly $52 billion makes it the smallest of these three top diabetes stocks. However, the company will grow close in size to the other two on the list once it finalizes a planned $24 billion acquisition of  (NYSE: BCR) .Around 13% of Becton, Dickinson and Company's total revenue stems from its diabetes care segment. BD's diabetes products include insulin pumps, insulin syringes, pen needles, and sharps containment. Sales for its diabetes care segment is growing by low-single-digit percentages, held back in part because of austerity measures in some European countries.The addition of C. R. Bard will provide a big boost to BD's revenue and earnings. However, Bard focuses on vascular, urology, and oncology products. BD's diabetes care unit won't be impacted much, if any, by the deal.BD stock has been a big winner so far in 2017, with shares jumping close to 40% year to date. In addition, the company pays a dividend, which currently yields 1.33%. Like Abbott, both BD and C. R. Bard are  , with BD increasing its dividend every year since 1972.Johnson & Johnson is the giant of the group, with a market cap of over $370 billion. J&J's diabetes care unit is a big business on track to generate sales of around $1.6 billion in 2017, but that's only a small sliver of the company's total revenue. However, the company's pharmaceutical segment markets diabetes drug Invokana, which should add another $1.1 billion or so to J&J's total diabetes-related revenue this year.There's an asterisk needed with Johnson & Johnson, though. Were it not for Invokana, J&J might not be classified as a diabetes stock for much longer. The company announced that it was exiting the insulin pump business. J&J is also evaluating strategic options for its other diabetes care businesses. These options include selling the units and forming partnerships or joint ventures with other companies.Still, J&J certainly qualifies as a diabetes stock now. And it should be a good one to own over the long run, albeit more because of its pharmaceutical lineup than its diabetes care products. Cancer drugs Darzalex and Imbruvica combined with autoimmune-disease drug Stelara are enjoying strong sales growth. The acquisition of Swiss drugmaker Actelion earlier this year has added a successful pulmonary hypertension franchise to the company's roster. J&J also has  , with promising candidates including prostate cancer drug apalutamide.Don't forget Johnson & Johnson's dividend, either. Its dividend yields 2.37% right now. J&J is also a Dividend Aristocrat and has raised its dividend for an impressive 55 years in a row.Image source: Getty Images.I don't think investors would go wrong by buying any or all of these diabetes stocks. All three pay great dividends, and all three have decent growth prospects. If I could only pick one of them, though, I'd go with Abbott.Wall Street analysts project higher earnings growth over the next five years for Abbott than they do for BD or J&J. I suspect they're right. The acquisition of St. Jude Medical was a smart move for Abbott, in my view. I'm also excited about the potential for the FreeStyle Libre CGM system. If you're looking for a growth stock with a solid dividend that's also going to significantly impact how diabetes is managed, I think Abbott Labs is the best option.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Investors are reacting harshly to the news that  ' (NYSE: ABT)  has gained coverage by Medicare and Medicaid.Dexcom's stock has been under a lot of selling pressure ever since Abbott won FDA approval for the FreeStyle Libre System in late 2017. The reason is that the Libre system does not need to be calibrated and is significantly cheaper than Dexcom's system.

Per the agreement, DexCom's flagship continuous glucose monitoring system (CGM) will be added to Lilly's Connected Diabetes Ecosystem.Through the integration of CGM with Lily's smart insulin delivery devices, DexCom aims to provide a holistic approach to diabetes management for its customers. Notably,clinical trials are expected to begin by the end of 2017.DexCom's FDA-cleared CGM system - the DexCom G4 Platinum - is contributing significantly to the top line. DexCom G4 Platinum is the most innovative CGM system in the market. In June, DexCom had announced the FDA approval of the DexCom G5 mobile app for Android devices.Moreover, DexCom has collaborative agreements with several companies, which should not only bring in cash in the form of milestone payments and royalties but should also help expand its product use. In September 2017, DexCom announced a tie-up with leading wearables brand Fitbit to develop and market products to help people better manage diabetes and get a clearer picture of their overall health. The first planned initiative is to bring DexCom CGM data to Fitbit's new smartwatch, Fitbit Ionic. The companies aim to make the smartwatch available in 2018 and will continue to explore ways to develop tools to improve diabetes management.We believe the glucose monitoring market represents significant commercial opportunity for DexCom. Per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the  for diabetes care devices is projected to reach a value of $30.25 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 5.93%. Also, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimates that by 2035, the worldwide incidence of people suffering from diabetes will reach 592 million.Recently, management at DexCom confirmed that the company is well poised to congregate the unmet demand in the global diabetic space, especially when it comes to CGM. DexCom's increased patient convenience, enhanced connectivity, data analytics, and lower cost platforms fortify the company's foothold in the global diabetic space.However, the diabetes market is dominated by many well-established players, Abbott  being the most prominent one. In this space, Abbott recently announced the receipt of FDA approval for the FreeStyle Libre Flash glucose monitoring system in the United States.DexCom has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results.

Despite major advancements across several medical fields, though, this innovation bonanza is, quite literally, showing no signs of slowing down.Armed with this insight, we asked three of our Motley Fool investors which companies they think are on the cusp of changing healthcare as we know it. They suggested  (NASDAQ: BLCM) ,  (NASDAQ: AAPL) , and  (NASDAQ: NVCR) . Read on to find out why.Image source: Getty Images. Genetically modified cell-based cancer therapies are now a reality following the back-to-back approval of both  ' Yescarta and  ' Kymriah earlier this year. But while Gilead and Novartis' respective CAR-T therapies did show unprecedented abilities to treat hard-to-treat forms of blood cancers in clinical trials, they also both produced some serious -- even potentially deadly -- side effects that may keep them from becoming frontline anti-cancer therapies.The small-cap clinical-stage biotech Bellicum Pharmceuticals, however, may have a way to circumvent these problematic side effects. Bellicum has developed a molecular switch mechanism that can induce either apoptosis (programmed cell death), or proliferation (to enhance potency) of their genetically modified cell therapies following infusion. Gilead and Novartis, by contrast, are limited to treating patients experiencing life-threatening side effects -- such as cytokine release syndrome -- with standard immunosuppressants, and this ad hoc approach hasn't always worked unfortunately.The one glaring problem with Bellicum's value proposition, though, is that the company is a  away from grabbing a major regulatory approval capable of making it a cash flow positive operation. And that fact almost certainly means that Bellicum will eventually tap the public markets for funds at least a few more times in the years ahead.That being said, Bellicum is developing a well-differentiated anti-cancer technology that could become the gold standard in cell-based therapies down the road. So while the biotech does need to shore up its long-term financial outlook, Bellicum's novel cell therapy platform also gives it a real shot at reshaping the entire field in the not-so-distant future. There are a number of companies doing wonders in the healthcare field. For instance, cancer immunotherapy drug developers are giving advanced cancer patients a new lease on life, while medical device makers are improving the quality of life for diabetes patients. But one company with deep pockets that could change the game is  : Apple.Apple, which is best known for its iPhone, iPad, and Macbook, announced its entrance in to the health space in 2014 when it introduced the Health app with its launch of iOS. The Health app allows users to keep track of their wellness in four key areas: activity, sleep, mindfulness, and nutrition. While the Health app is continually a work in progress, it's a step toward increasing wellness awareness with the public, and shuffling consumers toward that next step: cloud-based sharing.The advent of the Apple Watch and other wearable technology may one day allow your doctor to collect real-time data that could improve your personalized wellness plan. CNBC pointed out in April of this year that Apple's been working on a blood-glucose measurement device for diabetics that'll work without the need for a needle. Considering how often patients have to test their blood sugar, this would be a major quality of life advancement. A proprietary model appears to have been tested out by Apple CEO Tim Cook.In June, Apple forged a partnership with blood glucose monitoring device maker  (NASDAQ: DXCM) that'll link Dexcom's device with the Apple Watch. Apple's Bluetooth technology that allows devices to link to its Watch isn't unique to Dexcom (it'll potentially work with other devices), but it's just another example of how Apple can use wearables, technology, and/or the cloud to personalize the treatment process.While it could be a nascent revenue generator for years, look for healthcare to slowly grow into a notable portion of Apple's revenue stream in the decades to come. While we've made  progress in the war against cancer, more than half a million Americans still die each year as a result of their diagnosis. Clearly, there's still plenty of work left to do.Novocure is one company that's blazing new trails in the fight. The company figured out a few years ago that cancerous tumors can't replicate themselves as easily when an electric field is nearby. That unique insight lead the company to create a product called Optune, which is a FDA-approved medical device that treats brain cancer.Optune looks like a swimmers cap that has a cord coming out of the back. To use it, a patient simply puts the device on their head and hooks it up to a portable electronics kit. Once turned on, Optune creates a series of electric fields that go to work on the brain cancer while leaving the rest of the body unscathed.It might sound like Optune is too good to be true, but the company has the data to prove that the device is the real deal. The company published data from a long-term study that showed that adding Optune to standard-of-care therapy chemotherapy  survival rates at five years. That's an impressive result for an incredibly hard to treat cancer.While Optune's appeal has allowed Novocure  , there's reason to believe that the party is just getting started. Novocure is currently running trials to prove that Optune works in lung, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers, too. If they succeed then the sky is the truly the limit for this company's growth potential.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (NYSE: FIT) shares fell 3% on Nov. 1 after the wearables maker reported its third quarter earnings. Its revenue fell 22% annually to $393 million, marking its fourth straight quarter of double-digit sales declines, and it posted a non-GAAP net loss of $0.01 per share, versus a profit of $0.19 per share a year ago. However, those headline numbers beat analyst expectations for $392 million in revenues and a loss of $0.04 per share.For the fourth quarter, Fitbit forecasts -1% to 5% sales growth, and for its non-GAAP earnings to come in between a loss of $0.03 and a profit of $0.01. For the full year, Fitbit expects a 24%-26% sales decline, and a net loss between $0.23-$0.27 per share compared to a loss of $0.12 per share in 2016.A woman wears a Fitbit Charge 2. Image source: Fitbit.Those estimates all either matched or beat analyst expectations, but investors clearly weren't impressed with Fitbit's overall performance. As a result, the stock remains down about 15% for the year, and more than 50% over the past 12 months -- making 2017 a year to forget for the struggling wearables maker. Let's take a look at why Fitbit fell off a cliff, and whether or not it could ever rebound.Fitbit's fitness trackers made it one of the hottest brands on Wall Street when it launched its IPO over two years ago. Sales were up 255% in 2013, 175% in 2014, and 149% in 2015. Analysts gushed over the rosy future of wearable devices, and the stock surged from its IPO price of $20 to nearly $30 on its first day of trading.Today, the stock is worth about $6. Three big problems torpedoed Fitbit's high-flying stock. First,  like  and  commoditized the fitness tracker market with cheaper devices. Second, companies like  and  (NASDAQ: AAPL) launched pricier smartwatches with built-in fitness tracking capabilities.Fitbit, once the largest wearables maker in the world by market share, slipped to third place behind Xiaomi and Apple, according to IDC's second quarter numbers. Between the second quarters of 2016 and 2017, Fitbit's market share plunged from 24.1% to 12.9%.Lastly, wearables remained a niche market that didn't come anywhere close to matching smartphones or tablets as a new product category. As a result, Fitbit's revenue rose just 17% last year, and is now headed for its first annual decline this year. To lift sales, Fitbit cut prices and invested more in the development and marketing of new products. That caused its margins to contract and resulted in four straight quarters without a profit.Source: Things look bleak for Fitbit, but the company still has other  . The first big effort is Ionic, its first full-featured smartwatch. The Ionic faces fierce competition from the Apple Watch 3, but the Ionic's lengthy battery life of about four days crushes the Apple Watch's single-day battery life, and it's slightly cheaper at $300.During last quarter's conference call, Fitbit CEO James Park claimed that the Ionic and the older \"smartwatch-like\" Blaze were respectively the first and second best-selling smartwatches on  in the US.The Ionic is also intended to become the foundation of a new ecosystem for Fitbit. The device supports its new mobile payments platform Fitbit Pay. It also recently partnered with medical device maker  (NASDAQ: DXCM) to sync its glucose monitoring devices to the Ionic's display, which could encourage other medical device makers to share their data with Fitbit.Fitbit's Ionic smartwatches. Image source: Fitbit.Fitbit is also expanding its app ecosystem. It already reaches millions of users with its flagship app, but it's also developing a full app store for the Ionic, which could lock in users and become a new stream of revenue for the company. It also purchased smartwatch maker Pebble's assets and high-end smartwatch maker Vector to expand its hardware and software capabilities.Fitbit is also diversifying away from standard wearable devices with new products like the Fitbit Flyer wireless headphones and the Aria 2 smart scale, but revenue from those products should remain low compared to best-selling wearable products like the Charge 2.Fitbit faces a tough uphill battle, and it's unclear when its sales and earnings will start growing again. But for now, the stock looks fairly cheap at 0.8 times sales, and about 20% of shares were still being shorted as of Oct. 24. This means that expectations are currently so low that any good news could cause this beaten-down stock to jump.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That's a shame, because the medical device industry has some wonderful traits that make it a great hunting ground.For example, some medical devices require users to go through an extensive training period. While that can slow adoption, once they are comfortable with a certain device, those same users tend to become highly resistant to trying a competitor's product. That creates brand loyalty, which smart companies can use to drive big profit growth.I spent a decade working in the medical device industry, so I saw the power of that brand loyalty firsthand.

This chronic condition causes breathing to become shallow or even stop for a few seconds, which leads to poor sleep quality. Left untreated, sleep apnea can greatly increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, diabetes, and many other comorbidities.One way to treat sleep apnea -- and a number of other sleep-disorder breathing conditions -- is to use a continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, machine. These devices use a pump, tubing, and mask to ensure that a patient's airway remains open all night long.ResMed has been championing the use of CPAP machines since it invented the treatment a few decades ago. Fast-forward to today: ResMed now sells a range of products and services that help to diagnose or treat a number of sleep disorders. All told, the company generates more than $2 billion in sales each year.Image source: Getty Images.While ResMed's industry-leading products have propelled its top line higher for years, the company firmly believes that it is still in the very early innings of its growth phase. That confidence stems from the fact that only about 15% of potential patients in developed markets like the U.S. and Europe currently utilize a CPAP machine. That number falls to well under 1% in emerging markets like China, India, and Brazil. These figures suggest that the opportunity ahead is still huge.While I think the company's future looks bright, what attracts me most to ResMed's stock is that its CPAP machines require users to constantly purchase new masks, tubes, and other accessories that require frequent changing. This fact provides the company with a predictable stream of recurring revenue that can be used to fund research and development,  , and enrich shareholders.While ResMed isn't the fastest-growing medical device company that I follow, I think this is a dependable business that should be able to post above-average revenue and profit growth for years to come. Adding in a dividend that currently yields 1.6% and consumes about half of profits is icing on the cake.Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs when the body loses its ability to effectively utilize glucose. Left untreated, sufferers' glucose can rise to unhealthy levels, which can lead to comorbidities like hypertension, heart disease, kidney disease, and more.Image source: DexCom.Treating diabetes requires patients to constantly track their glucose levels and take action when necessary. For decades that meant endless finger-pricking to obtain readings through a point-in-time monitor. However, since glucose levels change rapidly throughout the day and finger pricks can cause pain, this solution was far from ideal.More than a decade ago DexCom launched an innovative continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system that allows patients to see their glucose levels changing in real time, allowing them to take action  their numbers get out of whack.

That number speaks volumes about the need for new therapies.One company that is championing the use of a brand-new technology in this fight is NovoCure, which discovered a few years ago that highly tuned electric fields could be used to disrupt cell division in tumors. The company called this new modality of treatment \"tumor treating fields\" (TTFields), and spent more than a decade developing it. In 2011, the company's hard work paid off when the FDA cleared its device -- called Optune -- for sale in the U.S. as a treatment for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a deadly form of brain cancer.To use Optune, patients place a series of transducer arrays on their heads near where their tumors reside. When a user then flips on the device, Optune creates a series of electric fields that go to work on the tumor. (There's a  that shows Optune in action.)What's so attractive about TTFields is that the electric fields have almost no effect on other cells in the body. As a result, Optune users experience very little in the way of side effects. That's a highly attractive advantage when compared to other cancer treatments like chemotherapy and radiation. When combined with  showing that TTFields actually works, it isn't hard to figure out why Optune has grown like wildfire over the last few years:Image source: NovoCure.While NovoCure's growth has been strong since launch, there are plenty of reasons to believe that the story is just getting started. Management believes that less than 10% of eligible patients are currently utilizing TTFields therapy in GBM, providing the company with ample running room. What's more, NovoCure believes that Optune could eventually be used to treat a range of other cancer types, such as mesothelioma, and lung, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers. If true, then this company's upside potential is truly massive, especially considering that NovoCure is currently  focusing on TTFields therapy.With no competition in sight and a game-changing therapy in its bag, NovoCure might just be the  .

For the PowerShares Russell Midcap Equal Weight Portfolio ETF (Symbol: EQWM), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $51.70 per unit.With EQWM trading at a recent price near $45.82 per unit, that means that analysts see 12.83% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of EQWM's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are DexCom Inc (Symbol: DXCM), NCR Corp (Symbol: NCR), and HanesBrands Inc (Symbol: HBI). Although DXCM has traded at a recent price of $47.72/share, the average analyst target is 47.81% higher at $70.53/share.

The jump in the company's share price can mostly be attributed to optimism surrounding the unveiling and launch of its Ionic smartwatch line.Fitbit unveiled the Ionic smartwatch on Aug. 28, highlighting features including a four-day battery life, new health-tracking technologies, and contactless payments. Fitbit also announced a partnership with  to bring  to the Ionic line of watches. The Ionic is an important step for the company as it attempts to expand beyond activity trackers and get a bigger foothold in the broader wearables market.Fitbit stock also got a lift following a Sept. 26 announcement that the company was one of nine that had been approved for a Food and Drug Administration program that will ease the regulatory approval measures for health and wellness apps, thereby speeding development processes. Faster development timelines could be significant as the company looks to build on the health and wellness functionality of its devices and develop an app ecosystem for its smartwatches.Image source: Fitbit.The Ionic smartwatch went on sale Oct. 1 at a retail price of $300. Rather than opt to use a third-party operating system such as  's Android, Fitbit has developed its own operating system for its smartwatches. This move gives the company greater control over the hardware platform, however it also means that there will be fewer apps available for the devices, which could ultimately impact consumer adoption.Fitbit's sales have slipped by double digits in each of the last three quarters, and the company expects that revenue for the year will be down between 22% and 29% despite Ionic's fourth-quarter launch. The smartwatch will likely be the deciding factor in whether Fitbit can return to growth next year, so investors should keep a close eye on its performance.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

FIT stock is currently down roughly 3% in early morning trading after reporting earnings yesterday, but it's important for investors to remember something before they jump the gun. The company has been innovating its product roadmap with increased discipline in its cost structure.Despite the early morning fall, I still think there is a value opportunity here for patient investors.The adjusted loss was 1-cent-per-share and revenues came to $392.5 million. By comparison, the consensus estimate was for a 3 cent loss on FIT stock and revenues of $392 million.As for the outlook for the full-year, the company is forecasting a loss of 27 cents to 23 cents-per-share and revenues of $1.62 billion and $1.65 billion. The Street, on the other hand, was looking for a loss of 31 cents and revenues $1.62 billion.But again, the key is the progress with the product line. And the latest quarter does provide some encouraging metrics. For example, on a sequential basis, there was a 7% increase in device shipments to 3.6 million. This is an indication that FIT is finding ways to deal with the competitive threats from mega operators like  (NASDAQ:  ),  and Xiaomi Inc.During the quarter, FIT launched its Ionic smartwatch. It includes features like GPS tracking, heart-rate tracking, water resistance (up to 50 meters), a SpO2 sensor, contactless payments and battery life of over four days.And in terms of customer traction, there are certainly positive signs for FIT stock. Note that the Ionic device has an average of 4.2 stars on  (NASDAQ:  ) website. This actually represents the best reception for any Fitbit product in its history.The Ionic device is also attracting interest from third-party developers; 1,400 have already signed on to build apps for the platform.Something else: The Fitbit Flyer wireless headset is also seeing robust demand. In the quarter, there was a 14% attach rate with Ionic purchases (this is from FIT's website sales).One of FIT stock's biggest  . There are 90 billion hours of heart rate data, 167 billion minutes of exercise information and 85 trillion steps. In other words, the FIT platform has the potential to allow for detecting health issues.To this end, the company recently  with  (NASDAQ:  ), which is the leader in continuous glucose monitoring. The partnership will involve developing products to help people manage their diabetes, which is a disease that affects over 400 million people across the globe.Next, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA)  FIT as one of nine companies to be a part of a precertification pilot. By doing this, the company is likely to benefit from faster approvals.In terms of valuation, the FIT stock price is fairly cheap. Consider that the price-to-sales ratio is 0.8X. In fact, when you strip out the $659 million in cash, the multiple is a mere 0.45X.But more importantly, the company looks poised to get a lift from its Ionic device, which could mean a strong holiday season for FIT stock. What's more, in the meantime, there should be growth from the healthcare business.Again, a rapid turnaround is probably not in the cards.

This tumble stemmed from the FDA's approval of  (NYSE: ABT) FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System, which is the first continuous glucose monitoring device to not require a finger-stick blood sample for calibration. Patients using DexCom's G5 Mobile device, on the other hand, need to perform up to two finger-sticks per day for the purposes of calibration. Abbott's shares were up by more than 4% on the back of this positive regulatory development.Image Source: Getty Images.DexCom's stock has skyrocketed in the last few years because of its dominant position in the rapidly growing glucose-monitoring market. In fact, sales of its G5 mobile CGM were forecast to grow by another 25% to 30% this year after the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ruled that the device was indeed \"  ,\" and could therefore be covered under Medicare Part B. With the entry of Abbott's more user-friendly device, though, DexCom's blistering levels of growth may start to taper off.Can Abbott's newly approved CGM device truly disrupt the market and steal a significant chunk of the market share away from DexCom? Based on the performance of DexCom's shares Thursday, the overwhelming sentiment among investors appears to be \"yes,\" and I happen to agree with the market's initial assessment.Unfortunately, DexCom is about a year away from bringing a similar no-calibration (and hence, no finger-stick) device to market, and that lag could spell disaster for the CGM specialist. A first-mover advantage, after all, should translate into a formidable economic moat against follow-on devices -- putting DexCom in a bad position.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100.

By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 62.8.

Abbott's stock rose 2.9% on the news.Abbott's device, called FreeStyle Libre, uses a sensor about the size of two stacked quarters that attaches to the back of the arm and passes blood glucose data wirelessly to a receiver that tracks glucose levels minute by minute. DexCom sells a similar system, but it requires two finger pricks per day for calibration. The freedom from needing to take blood samples could be a game changer for the 30 million people with diabetes in America. Abbott plans to sell the device at all major retail pharmacies before the end of the year, and likely at a lower price than the DexCom system.DexCom has had a head start in the CGM market in the U.S., with an 18% jump in domestic revenue in the most recent quarter. It also won a positive reimbursement decision from Medicare, which will start augmenting sales in the current quarter. What's more, DexCom has already been competing against FreeStyle Libre outside the U.S., where the device is being sold in 40 countries. DexCom's international sales rose 69% last quarter, and in the last conference call, a DexCom executive said that when the devices are reimbursed and therefore the lower cost of Abbott's product is not a factor, patients have been switching from the Libre to DexCom's device because of higher accuracy. But investors are clearly concerned that Abbott's marketing clout and the convenience of FreeStyle Libre will ultimately trump any other advantages DexCom may have.Struggling pharmacy chain Rite Aid reported its fiscal second-quarter  today, and investors did not like what they heard, sending the stock down 11%. While the company has recently  to sell 1,932 of its 4,507 stores to  (NASDAQ: WBA) , the company is already shrinking on its own, reporting a revenue decline of 4.4% to $7.7 billion, and an adjusted net loss of $0.01 per share, compared with a per-share profit of $0.03 in the period a year earlier.Same-store sales decreased 3.4%, reflecting a 4.6% decline in pharmacy sales and a 0.9% drop in front-end sales. The contraction in pharmacy sales was blamed on the negative impact of generic drug introductions and a 1.8% fall in the number of prescriptions filled, due in part to exclusion from pharmacy networks that the company had participated in previously.It's hard to imagine things getting much worse for Rite Aid's shareholders, who have seen the stock lose 75% of its value in 2017. The store sale to Walgreens for $4.375 billion in cash will allow the company to pay off a good chunk of its $7 billion in debt and help it get back to profitability. But given that Walgreens will be picking up stores with the least competitive exposure to its existing store base, leaving Rite Aid with stores most threatened by the now-stronger competitor, there are still more questions than answers about the future of the company.

But I'm now reconsidering this view - at least for the short run.One reason is that, well, the sentiment probably cannot get any worse. During the past few years, the company has gone from a tech darling to a has-been. Keep in mind that - back in the summer of 2015 - the shares were fetching nearly $50. Right now, they are at about $6. Source: As a result, the valuation metrics are starting to look attractive, especially for a value investor. Consider that the price-to-sales multiple is a mere .84X. Hey, it is actually 0.45 when you strip out the $675 million in cash.But valuation is not the only factor. FIT stock also should benefit from year-over-year comparisons. The reason is the last year's holiday season was an absolute disaster. Revenue plunged by 19% to $573.8 million and the net loss came to 56 cents a share. Note that the Street consensus was calling for the top-line to hit $736.4 million.So yes, the bar is set fairly low for the upcoming Q4. It is also encouraging that there are already signs of an improvement in the business. During Q2, the company reported revenues of $587 million, up from $400 million in the same period a year ago, and the earnings came to 12 cents a share. Analysts were forecasting revenues of $578 million and earnings of 11 cents a share.But going forward, the main driver for FIT stock will be the rollout of its smartwatch, which is called Ionic. This is the result of three acquisitions - such as for Coin, Pebble and Vector - and heavy investments in R&D.Granted, FIT has been late to the game and the competitive environment is intense. Just some of the rivals include  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and Xiaomi.But for FIT, the company has been smart to focus on its core competencies in the fitness category. Some the Ionic smartwatch features include: An SpO2 sensor that allows for in-depth tracking, GPS tracking, water resistance of up to 50 meters, wireless headphones, a virtual personal trainer (which provides workouts that are personalized to your activities and health condition), mobile payments and a battery life of over 4 days.True, the Ionic device is not without its issues and flaws. For example, while you can receive texts, you cannot send them! Also the overall design could probably be sleeker and the app store is no where near the depth of iTunes or  (NASDAQ:  ) Play.But then again, for a first version, the Ionic is still impressive and is likely to get attention in the marketplace.Keep in mind that the Ionic smartwatch is not just about the consumer market. FIT is also leveraging the device into the healthcare category. To this end, the company has struck a  with  (NASDAQ:  ), that will allow for the monitoring of a person's glucose levels. No doubt, there is a great need for such a product, as there are over 400 million people across the world who suffer from diabetes.And finally, FIT stock may benefit from the lackluster buzz from the new Apple Watch 3. According to various reviews, it appears that the device is having issues with its cellular features, such as connection with LTE networks as well as problems with the draining of the battery.But again, even with some of the recent positive news for Fitbit stock, the sentiment is still fairly dour. Yet the Ionic smartwatch has a good chance of getting traction, which is likely to gin up much more interest in the shares.The post ) Stock Looks Good for the Very Short Term appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (NYSE:  ) got a nice boost when it finally announced its Ionic smartwatch at the end of August.

And while the fitness market is big, the health market is  .Last week,  , the leading manufacturing of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices. The partnership will mean people suffering from diabetes who use one of Dexcom's CGM sensors, will be able to view that data on their Fitbit Ionic smartwatch starting in 2018.It's important to note that this doesn't mean that Fitbit has mastered the technology needed for an optical blood glucose sensor.  (NASDAQ:  ) has reportedly assembled a team that is  , but it has not yet succeeded in cracking that very difficult problem.Instead, the Dexcom CGM has a sensor that is inserted under the wearer's skin to take blood glucose readings. It's attached to a wireless transmitter. The transmitter sends data to a receiver. In the case of the Fitbit Ionic, the CGM sensor would send data wirelessly to the smartwatch, so the wearer could see results on their wrist, along with their other health and fitness data, including heart rate and blood oxygen level.That's not as convenient or unobtrusive as an optical CGM would be, but it's the current state of technology. And besides, incorporating an optical CGM on a smartwatch would likely mean having to deal with an onerous Food and Drug Administration approval process that would wreak havoc with Fitbit's product release schedule.Fitbit is a leader - although  - when it comes to wearables. The company's growth has been driven by consumers who are obsessed with tracking their fitness and activity, but that market is a relatively small subset of the population. In the last quarter, Fitbit sold 3.4 million activity trackers.The Fitbit Ionic is expected to expand the target demographic by adding smartwatch fans to the mix. Fitbit stock got a bump on the Ionic announcement based on the possibility that some potential Apple Watch buyers might be tempted by a FIT smartwatch.Health monitoring -and in particular diabetes- is a whole other story. Worldwide, it's estimated that over 400 million people are diabetic. The key to maintaining their health is managing blood sugar levels and the way to do that is through blood glucose monitoring. Turning the Fitbit Ionic into a handy display for a Dexcom CGM is a quick way to turn the Fitbit smartwatch into an attractive accessory for a huge market. That's why Fitbit stock popped 7% on the announcement of the partnership.The Dexcom CGM partnership  big news for Fitbit. However, the arrangement isn't exclusive. In fact, Dexcom has  \u2026 Apple CEO Tim Cook has been spotted  , and if it isn't a Dexcom model he's using, it's something similar.FIT does have an advantage, though, in the Ionic's superior battery battery life. That would support wearing the Fitbit Ionic at night, while most Apple Watch users will have to skip the Dexcom connection to recharge their smartwatch.The wildcard here is the Apple Watch Series 3, which is expected to be unveiled today at Apple's big iPhone event.Apple hasn't said a whole lot publicly about its own capabilities in this area, but given the fact that Tim Cook has been wearing a CGM and Fitbit has gone ahead and made this announcement, it's possible that Apple might just feature that CGM support when it shows off the new Apple Watch Series 3. Just to knock FIT back down a peg.With that new Apple Watch expected to make an appearance today to counter the Fitbit Ionic, keep a watch on Fitbit stock.

Further collaboration between the two companies is possible, although nothing concrete has been announced.The 10% move in Fitbit stock seems like a major overreaction. This deal puts data already available on smartphones on Fitbit's Ionic. DexCom's mobile app is already integrated with the Apple Watch and Android Wear devices, meaning that this partnership is nothing more than Fitbit playing catch-up, trying to make its smartwatch platform a viable alternative.Whether Fitbit's Ionic succeeds will depend on the willingness of consumers to buy a smartwatch with a nascent app ecosystem.

The problem, though, is that investors made the news out to be a little  big, and pushed Fitbit's share price up about 11% after the news. If the DexCom partnership were an exclusive deal between Fitbit and the glucose-monitor company, then that stock-price surge would have been warranted. But Fitbit investors need to realize that the  (NASDAQ: AAPL) Watch -- the Ionic's key competitor -- has had the same feature for more than a year.What should have been simply good news for Fitbit turned into its investors getting overly optimistic about just one feature on the company's upcoming smartwatch. Of course, the stock-price surge speaks more to peculiarities of investors than it does to Fitbit's business. But I can't help but wonder why they're getting so excited about the partnership.Perhaps it's because Fitbit investors have had a few bouts of bad news lately. Competition is heating up between Apple and Fitbit in the wearable tech space, and China-based Xiaomi just  to become the No. 1 wearable-tech maker in the world. Take a look:\n  \nData source:  .Fibit's monumental 40% drop in shipments in the second quarter is a clear indicator that the company needs a smash-hit device, and soon. The Ionic could help put the company back on track, and it appears that investors are banking a lot on it already.I can't help but think that Fitbit is still in some serious trouble right now. The company has done a great job building out its brand and selling good devices, and it is trying to keep pace with Apple and other competitors by entering new product categories. But the problem is that Fitbit is sandwiched between Xiaomi's low-end fitness trackers and Apple's high-end Watch.You could make the argument that when the $299 Ionic hits store shelves next month, it'll put Fitbit squarely in the higher-end market as well. But with Apple about to launch a new version of its already-popular Watch on Sept. 12, it's doubtful that Fitbit's device will be able to hold its own against the No. 1 smartwatch. The Apple Watch has a vastly larger app ecosystem, and the first-generation device sells for a price similar to the Ionic. The DexCom data integration is good news for Fitbit's upcoming device, but it's not, by any standard, a game-changer.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It has already become an integral part of everyday life, thanks to an ever-increasing number of connected products.    At the consumer level, the IoT market is dominated by techs such as  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  , NASDAQ:  ) whose Echo and Home, respectively, are ruling the market. Also, activity-tracking products and advanced in-car technology are other products already available. On the commercial side, a number of industrial manufacturers have started installing sensors inside machines to track performance and efficiency.Market observers recognize IoT as a booming space. According to a recent report by research firm Gartner, worldwide spending on endpoints and services of connected objects is expected to reach nearly $2 trillion in 2017 from $737 billion in 2016.There will be about 8.4 billion connected objects (IoT objects) in use globally by the end of this year, a rise of 31% from the year ago. This figure is likely to reach around 20.4 million by 2020. Notably, North America, Western Europe and Greater China region will dominate 67% of total globally IoT-installed bases in 2017.As per a Gartner report, Businesses will represent 57% of total IoT spending this year to $964 billion. Consumer applications will amount to $725 billion in 2017. The research firm has estimated that hardware spending from both segments will reach almost $3 trillion by 2020.According to another research firm IDC, the IoT market could nearly triple in the coming years. In 2014, the global IoT market was worth $655.8 billion. However, it has the potential to reach up to $1.7 trillion by 2020.Given such impressive projected numbers in the IoT space, investors should definitely consider adding IoT stocks to their portfolios.Let's take a closer look at the three IoT stocks that have the right combination to outperform. (NASDAQ:  ) manufactures embedded system solutions for automotive, industrial, home automation and appliances, consumer electronics and medical products.Last year, the company acquired Broadcom's Wireless Internet of Things business to gain leadership in the IoT segment. Also, the company laid off 8% of its global workforce to focus on the growth areas like the IoT segment.Recently, Cypress' IoT connectivity platform teamed up with Arrow Electronics to deliver pioneering solutions to facilitate new, inventive business models for the IoT market.The company has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 10.0%.Although CY has returned only 17.7% on a year-to-date basis compared to the  's gain of 18.2%, we believe that strong growth potential of its IoT initiatives will help the stock rebound going forward.Semiconductor giant  (NASDAQ:  ) has substantial opportunities stemming from the increasing demand for its microcontrollers - low cost, low power, embedded chips that have programming, and data memory.Its focus on gaining share in the infotainment and advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) segments of the automotive market are likely to spur growth in 2017.The company's IoT profile falls under its Embedded Processors division, which includes the Connectivity, Microcontrollers, and Processors categories. Its Embedded Processors segment witnessed growth of 8.1% sequentially and 15% year over year in its last reported second-quarter results.We believe that increasing number of connected devices is expected to drive demand for these chips in 2017 and beyond that will boost top-line growth.The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 9.6%. You can see  .However, Texas Instruments has also underperformed the  it belongs to on a year-to-date basis. The stock has returned approximately 11.5% compared with the industry's growth of roughly 15.0%. FIT - Although the company's growth has been slowed by massive competition in the wearables space, this is one of the few IoT pureplays that should perform well in the near future. Fitbit has devices at varying prices for individual and corporate uses. The company pursues corporate healthcare plans and has registered some major wins in the area.Recently, the company introduced its sleek tech-filled wristwatch, the Ionic, which could help the company gain some share in the IoT market. Moreover, Fitbit has partnered with glucose monitoring device company, Dexcom Inc. (), to help users monitor their glucose levels on its new wristwatch Ionic. The deal will definitely help Fitbit to counter some competition in the IoT market.It has also undergone significant executive shakeup and cost structuring recently.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The stock has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 22.5%.However, Fitbit has also underperformed the  it belongs to on a year-to-date basis. The stock has lost approximately 14.1% compared with the industry's growth of roughly 8.7%.The above mentioned stocks have made great progress in the segment and will play a big role in shaping the market going forward.

You get to know the cultures and values as a leader. I realized there wasn\u2019t really an opportunity in the investment world to invest with your values in mind. For me, there was a personal standpoint: I\u2019ve been a Type 1 diabetic since I was 9, and my family has had a battle with cancer.I was working at Pacific Life in the M&A space when I came up with the idea, and they eventually provided the capital behind this. We\u2019re a fully owned subsidiary of Pacific Life, and they have incubated the idea here. They got behind the mission of the business and the value that\u2019s in this space. I\u2019ve worked there since 2008 and I\u2019ve gotten to know the senior leadership quite well.As we\u2019ve gone through, they\u2019ve provided great support from both a regulatory and legal standpoint, but also, as you can imagine, Pacific Life has 150 years of experience in financial services, and that helps us to offer institutional-quality portfolio management. In their history, they\u2019ve also incubated other asset managers. One of their other well-known ones was PIMCO.That\u2019s one of the most critical parts of the entire process. We\u2019re unapologetically selective when it comes to choosing companies. Roughly 300 companies make the cut. If you think about all the publicly traded securities, that\u2019s quite stringent.When we look at impact, we take a very different approach from others in the space.We want to see that the companies first have a minimum threshold for an environmental social governance rating. It can range from a CCC all the way to an AAA. We select companies from BB and above. Volkswagen is a CCC. On the other hand, an AAA would be a (). These ratings are conducted by third parties.We also want to make sure you\u2019re making revenue within this sustainable scene. We want to see that you\u2019re a company like  () that actually produces a product and service. We want to make sure you\u2019re earning revenue in your business in line with the theme.Finally, we want to make sure your target goals and your corporate social responsibility are aligned with the U.N. sustainable development goals. You\u2019ve got to make it through each of those steps from an impact perspective, and then we look at it from the portfolio management side of things.Certainly we\u2019ve seen in a lot of our own consumer research and studies that there\u2019s been a strong interest by consumers for impacting investing.

It's not necessary to delve into  or other such risky endeavors -- just choose companies that possess the right qualities.We asked three top Motley Fool contributors to identify a stock that an ambitious investor might appreciate, and they came up with  (NASDAQ: DXCM) ,  (NASDAQ: ADSK) , and  (NYSE: VSTO) . Read on to find out why they hold such promise.Image source: Getty Images. The American Diabetes Association estimates that more than 29 million Americans have diabetes and another 86 million are at risk of developing the disease. Given the prevalence, perhaps it isn't a big surprise to learn that dozens of companies have  aimed at treating this condition. One of my favorites is Dexcom, a leading provider of continuous glucose monitors. Dexcom's stock has been a Wall Street favorite for years as demand for the company's product continuous to soar.So what is a continuous glucose monitor? Traditionally, if a person with diabetes wanted to know what their blood sugar level was, they would have to prick their finger and apply a drop of blood to a meter. While this data was useful, it was also burdensome to gather. In addition, the number didn't tell the user anything about which direction their blood sugar was heading.Dexcom's solution to this problem was to insert a small sensor under the skin that continuously measured glucose levels. Those readings would then be constantly uploaded to a monitor, which provided people with diabetes with a real-time view of their glucose levels. What's more, Dexcom's sensors need to be changed out every few days, which provides the company with a recurring revenue stream.Since the product's launch, the diabetes community has welcomed Dexcom's device with open arms. Better yet, Dexcom's razor-and-blade business model has allowed its top line to soar, taking long-term shareholders on a very profitable ride. data by  .While Dexcom's growth is impressive, the company's system is currently being used by about 200,000 patients. That number is still quite small when compared to the 29 million Americans with the disease.The only knock against Dexcom is that Wall Street values its stock at nearly 10 times sales. While that's expensive, if you count yourself as an ambitious investor, I certainly wouldn't fault you for taking a small position in Dexcom today.Image source: Autodesk. Autodesk might not look like a growth stock given that both its top and bottom lines are heading in the wrong direction right now. The design software specialist's sales fell slightly in 2015 before diving 19% last year. Its annual losses ballooned to $582 million from $330 million over the same time.Both of those figures were heavily impacted by Autodesk's choice to abandon its one-time purchase model and replace it with subscription offerings. Yet while these new cloud-based purchases carry much smaller initial contract prices, they make up for that weakness by delivering higher-margin recurring revenue.The business model shift has made subscriber figures the key number to watch lately. And by that metric, Autodesk is doing a great job. The company grew its customer base by 21% last year and the solid momentum  on the strength of new cloud-based offerings that helped subscription plan recurring revenue double to $692 million.Ambitious investors should consider investing in this business ahead of what could be a significant operating rebound. Management is targeting a 20% subscription gain this year as recurring revenue expands by as much as 26% to account for a growing proportion of the total sales base. Yes, sales and profits are both likely to show just minor improvements over last year, but surging subscription sales are laying the groundwork for much better growth down the road.Image source: Vista Outdoor. Although its stock sits nearly 60% below its 52-week high, an ambitious investor might just find Vista Outdoor a company to train their sights on. The shooting sports and outdoor gear retailer has been hit by twin forces that it had not prepared for: the election of Donald Trump as president and a wave of retail bankruptcies.The outcome of the presidential election surprised most everyone and sucked the wind out of the sails of the gun industry. In part driven by the fear of greater gun control legislation getting introduced, gun sales had soared in recent years, but the election of a purported gun-friendly president and Congress helped deflate such worries. Vista called it an \"unprecedented\" drop in demand.At the same time, the bankruptcy of sporting goods retailers like Sports Authority and Gander Mountain hurt sales of recreational outdoors gear, as the stores were big sellers of its products. In Vista's most recent earnings report, it said a write-off of $17 million worth of receivables from a bankrupt retail customer lopped off $0.18 from Vista's per-share earnings. That was likely Gander Mountain, as its March bankruptcy filing listed it as owing Vista nearly $15.2 million.But the gun market is booming and the FBI just reported the month of May was its busiest May ever for background checks of potential gun buyers, with some 1.9 million investigations conducted. All year long it has shown the big drop off in demand following the election was more of a one-off event than a trend. Vista still expects it to take time for demand to recover to where it was, but everything points to greater growth again.While the retail landscape remains dicey,  (NYSE: DKS) scooped up a bunch of Gander Mountain stores and the retailer's new owner  has said it is rebranding the chain as Gander Outdoor. Guns won't be  as they were previously, but it's a hopeful sign Vista will have a new outlet once more.Trading at just 13 times next year's estimated earnings and a fraction of its sales, Vista Outdoor's depressed stock appears ripe to grow. An investor willing to bide his time during some likely short-term turbulence could enjoy some ambitious returns in the future.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks! Welcome to  , the podcast that dives into a different sector of the stock market every day. Today is May 10, and I'm your  show host, Kristine Harjes. I'm here at Fool HQ just outside of Washington D.C., and I have Motley Fool healthcare contributor Todd Campbell calling in from New Hampshire. Todd, welcome. What is the most interesting thing you've written since the last time we talked?Todd Campbell: I don't know what the most interesting thing I have written is. I like to think all of what I write is interesting, and all of what you can find on The Motley Fool is fascinating. [laughs] But I think today's show is going to be absolutely interesting.Harjes: Yeah, I hope so. We've talked on the show before about the intersection between technology and healthcare. One show that comes to mind in particular was when I had Motley Fool analyst Simon Erickson come on while he was at South by Southwest, which is a tech conference, but with each passing year it seems like there's more more interest in healthcare from the tech world. So today, we wanted to dive in to one particular area where tech companies are working in the healthcare space, and that is diabetes.Campbell: This is going to be a very interesting show, because we're going to be talking about the future, or what the future could look like, in treating diseases like diabetes using wearables, things that we have on our wrists every day already.Harjes: Exactly. This is an enormous opportunity, which is why the tech world is so interested in it. If you look at America, one-third of people in the United States are obese, and 9.3% of them have diabetes already. And this is a problem that's only getting bigger.Campbell: No pun intended, right?Harjes: Yeah, that was no pun intended at all.Campbell: One-point-nine billion adults over 18 are overweight. Six hundred million adults obese. Thirteen percent of the adult population, obese. The prevalence of obesity has more than doubled between 1980 and 2014. Clearly, there's a need for things that help us get moving and help us monitor how good of a job we're doing in getting the exercise we need every day to prevent diseases. That's really why we're talking about it on a  show. We're not talking about companies like Fitbit because we're interested, necessarily, from the technology standpoint. We're also interested in how these devices can be used to change clinical outcomes. Diabetes and obesity, there is a link.Harjes: The way that I see it, there are two different sides to this story. You have the obesity side, where if you can get yourself living a more healthy lifestyle, you lower your risk of diabetes, or you can better manage your disease. Then, there's also the blood sugar level monitoring, which, if you already have diabetes, is absolutely key. So you see a lot of partnerships and a lot of work being done between healthcare companies and tech companies that are trying to combine data from both of those different sides of this puzzle, to see what is the relationship between activity levels and glucose levels and management of disease.Campbell: What's interesting is that the sensors we're developing now, we have a much better understanding how the body works. The body is such an amazing, incredibly sophisticated system, and we can actually determine how our bodies are doing, as far as their normal processes, by evaluating things like blood sugar in the blood, or evaluating changes in what we excrete through our sweat. Sensors are becoming more and more sensitive, and as a result, they're being able to be used in increasingly more helpful ways. But taking that one step further, these sensors are now getting to a point where they're getting smaller, less intrusive, more easily used by patients. So we're not talking about this big, bulky thing you have to lug around with us anymore.Harjes: Right, and that's important not just because it makes patients' lives easier, but because in theory, that could boost compliance.Campbell: Compliance, let's admit it, it's a big deal. Let's just look at Fitbit. Fitbit has been around for 10 years, and they've sold 63 million devices. There's so many of these devices around, and maybe many of our listeners are wearing them right now. But what's intriguing to me is, as I was researching for today's show, only one in 10 are wearing them on a daily basis,Harjes: Yeah, I believe it. I think Fitbit in general is struggling with not so much initial adoption, but actually sticking with their product. But if they want to really dive into being able to integrate their wearables tracker with something like a continuous glucose monitor, which is something they're working on with Medtronic  regularly. You can just tell the people who were just sitting there shaking up and down all day long and counting that as steps. And that's fine if you're doing something like a step competition with your friends -- well, it's not fine, it's not great, but it doesn't have the consequences that it would if somebody is using it in a medical way. And that's not to say that people are trying to cheat their medical data. But even something as simple as brushing your teeth, people sometimes log that as steps, and that's problematic when your doctor is looking at that data.Campbell: Yeah. I was reading one study, Kristine, where a care provider, a hospital system provided a bunch of older patients, I think they were in their 80s, with devices that could be used to measure how much activity they were doing and their heart rate and all of this stuff, and frankly, most of them forgot that they were even wearing them within a few days of wearing them, and forgot to put them on. We have to, obviously, be able to develop systems that are sensitive and give us new insights into, for example, blood sugar levels, so that people can stay within their desired range more frequently throughout the day. But we also have to make it so it becomes something like your watch, where you're actually looking at it every once in awhile. Again, I suppose watches aren't being worn as much as they used to be anyway, because now we have smartphones. How often are you checking your watch? It's going to be like a text message; you're going to have to actually pick up the phone and look at your texts and say, \"I moved this many feet, and my heart rate is this, but what do I do with this information?\" I think that's part of what Medtronic is trying to accomplish in its push here, is to take all the information it has, from being a huge player in medical devices, especially in diabetes, and be able to marry that with the information that's being collected by the user who's wearing the device, and then being able to take that one step further and actually provide actionable insight that either the caregiver, be it the primary physician or the patient, can use to actually improve their lifestyle, or something.Harjes: Yeah, you're absolutely correct. Medtronic right now is staring down a mountain of data and looking at it and saying, \"We have so much information; how do we derive useful conclusions out of it?\" They have a partnership with  that was announced in April of 2015 that will leverage the artificial-intelligence powers of Watson, which is the supercomputer that won  With Watson, they're going to analyze all these electronic medical record data, I think it's 10,000 EMRs, and they're going to use this population information to develop a real-time personalized care. Todd, as you were saying, it's going to need to come from an app or your phone or something telling you, \"You're showing abnormal patterns,\" or, \"We've noticed this.\" That's exactly what they're trying to develop. They created something called Sugar IQ, which is a personalized assistant that can detect patterns of behavior, and it can protect diabetic events hours before they happen, which is really pretty incredible. And it seems to me like they're only getting started with this.Campbell: You know what's interesting, too, is that Massachusetts General Hospital did something where they gave pedometers to patients, and they linked that up with a text-messaging system that would basically say, \"Here's how you're doing; here's some tips.\" They actually look at the weather, all sorts of things that they put together to try to figure out the best way to make it relevant to the patients. Sure enough, the patients who are receiving these daily tips did better overall in achieving whatever their goal was for their blood sugar levels. So yes, we have all of this information out there, all of this data. On the healthcare side of things, we have companies like Medtronic that have tons of experience in creating medical devices. Then we have the consumer-electronics companies, who have tons of experience generating devices that people want to use. Then, we have healthcare providers who are trying to figure out how can they take all of this, marry it together, and make it into something they can actually use to reduce these rates of obesity, to keep people who are pre-diabetic -- because there are over 80 million Americans who are pre-diabetic -- to keep those from becoming full-blown cases of diabetes and ultimately make it to the cardiovascular disease is no longer the No. 1 killer worldwide. This is a multi-faceted problem, which is why it's so interesting to see different types of companies coming at it from all of their angles of expertise.All right, let's turn to a company that I don't think we've mentioned yet on the show but is working in the space, and that's Apple. Campbell: Apple is obviously on the cutting edge when it comes to developing easy-to-use consumer electronics that resonate with people. That's the whole thing, the whole experience. So we were talking before the break, being able to figure out, we want to marry healthcare outcomes with technology with the information we've collected -- how do we do that in a way that really resonates with consumers? And one of the ways that Apple is trying to do that is through its Apple Watch.Harjes: Right. The Apple Watch is a really interesting product, but right now it's kind of a luxury product. And I think if they're able to find a way to make it a must-have for diabetics, that's going to be a game-changer for this product.Campbell: You have apps that tie into both your Apple phone, your Watch. Some of those are healthcare related. You have access to things like heart rate through these devices, being able to track those things. But wouldn't it be great, Kristine, if you could be wearing your Apple Watch and, at the same time that you're wearing it, it's measuring your blood glucose level?Harjes: Absolutely, yeah. One of the big step changes with this project -- which, by the way, Apple is working on this. Despite Apple being shrouded in secrecy about what's next sometimes, a very credible journalist from CNBC reports that they are working in this area. So the step change that I see in this project is that they're looking at a non-invasive continuous glucose monitor sensor. When you talk about reading your glucose levels, it always involves some sort of prick to the finger, or something that is invasive to the body, What they're trying to do is figure out how the Apple Watch could incorporate an optical sensor to read glucose levels just by shining light through the skins, and integrating that with the data that you have on your Apple Watch.Campbell: Which is pretty amazing. I guess the question would be, will that be shining continuously and measuring it continuously? Or will that only be shining at specific intervals? And how often will those intervals be? And that's going to create all sorts of design problems, because you're going to have to figure out, how do you make the battery lights last long enough to be able to do that, potentially?Harjes: What happens when you're charging?Campbell: Yeah. If we go back in time for a second, we've already made huge advances in doing this, as far as, you have companies like Medtronic that now have an artificial pancreas where you have continuous glucose monitoring occurring from a small sensor that is inserted underneath the skin, that you wear in a pump that's delivering blood glucose on demand as it needs to. You have other companies like  (NASDAQ: DXCM)  that are out there that are making huge advances in sensor technology, that are providing real-time, truly continuous readings that people are able to use to chart up and down their blood glucose levels to help them better figure out when they might be crashing, when they might need insulin or not need insulin, or whatever.So Apple, I think you're right, it's a fascinating concept to be able to just use light, and be able to evaluate blood glucose. But it's not as simple as just saying, \"Yeah, we're going to do this.\" I suppose that's why they haven't rolled it out yet, and why they're being so secretive. Supposedly, they're in the initial test phases of this to try to see whether or not this makes sense. They went out a couple years ago and bought a company that was working on sensors for healthcare to try and give them a little bit more experience in that area. It's hard for me to imagine, honestly, Kristine, that we get, 10, 20 years from now, and it's almost like going to be like we're having our doctor with us on demand. We're going to have so much information, so much data, that we're going to be able to collect just from the clothes we're wearing -- you can buy compression shirts and sleeves now that do a lot of these evaluations, too. They're looking at various different disease indications, being able to measure levels of certain proteins in your sweat to be able to see how your kidneys are performing, all sorts of interesting things that theoretically we could discover and be able to track over the course of the next 10 or 20 years. I think what Apple is saying is, \"We want to make sure we don't get left behind in that movement.\"Harjes: Exactly. Here's another crazy one:  is working with Alphabet's Google's Verily, which was formerly Google Life Sciences, on a smart contact lens that you put in your eye like a normal contact, and it measures blood sugar levels from your tears. So what they're hoping to do is have it change color if the levels aren't within normal range. That's straight sci-fi right there.Campbell: That is crazy. That is fascinating. And then, of course, you have Verily, which is part of Alphabet/Google, however you want to refer to them. Verily is working on a program with Dexcom to create sensors that peel off like little Band-Aids. Obviously, this is going to become a much, like you said, less invasive way of being able to track a disease and provide more information, and then hopefully that information can be used by the patient to at least delay disease progression so that they're not ending up with cardiac risk and risk of death later on in life.Harjes: Right. This is another example of a tech specialist, Google, working with a healthcare-device specialist, which is Dexcom. Dexcom, in case you're not familiar with them, are a continuous glucose monitor, CGM, specialist. Dexcom has all these awesome CGMs that they've already developed, and now they see this tremendous advantage in being able to harness Google's analytic capabilities to make this better. They're working with Verily on developing a CGM that's no bigger than a Band-Aid. There would still be some insertion, because their system is based on a wire, but they're looking at ways other than a needle to insert it, which would not just be a better experience, but hopefully take the cost down.Campbell: You know what's fascinating to me, Google is always on the cutting edge, in the way that they're doing research and discovering new ways a new approaches. They're not just a search engine. A few years ago, they came out with Google Glass. I don't know if our listeners remember Google Glass. Maybe some of them still have them kicking around. It's a head-up display that you attach to your glasses that allows you to access the internet, access information, and communicate with, say, your computer or PC. There are companies out there today that are still using Google Glass to improve healthcare. For example, there's a small company out in California called Augmentix. Augmentix works with physicians. Physicians will walk in to a primary care appointment wearing Google Glass; they'll be able to, through a scribe back at Augmentix HQ, be able to communicate and spend more time with the patient and spend less time on the paperwork. So basically, the scribe is writing down what's occurring, or taking care of the EHR, or electronic [health] medical record component of a physician's job, via the use of Google Glass. There's all sorts of ways that we're not even contemplating that wearables, be it from Google or Fitbit or Apple, or even [  ], could impact and change healthcare over the course of the coming decades. Right. It does feel incredibly nascent right now. One company that I want to mention, because you just reminded me that we haven't mentioned them yet, is Amazon. They, right now, have this diabetes challenge, which is specifically the name of the Echo woman, the voice, I've been told by our listeners that we shouldn't say that during the podcast, because saying her voice will trigger her, and it'll stop what you're doing and wait for a new command. So hopefully you know the girl's name that's I'm talking about. The Echo woman. Anyway, Amazon is partnered with  , and they have challenged developers to create an Echo-powered solution to help type 2 diabetics. They are, in July of this year, going to announce the five finalists, then throw them into this virtual accelerator to try to develop the best thing that they can. The winner will end up with $125,000, and that will be announced in September. So, definitely looking forward to seeing what they come up with.Campbell: The Innovation that's going on in these contests, who knows how we'll use our Echo, how Echo and some of these other consumer devices that we wouldn't think of as healthcare devices are going to reshape. The things that we're going to have to remember, remind all of our listeners, because obviously we're coming across as pretty excited about the future of this space, right, Kristine, is that there are some concerns. We have the accuracy of the data. There are some concerns that some of these devices, the information they're collecting, isn't healthcare-quality accurate. We have security and privacy concerns, the sharing of information, who gets to see it, who doesn't get to see it. And then, of course, as we touched on previously, that whole patient adherence component of it, are they going to have that wearable on them all the time or enough of the time to be able to come to good conclusions?Harjes: Yes, and even patient willingness, particularly as it concerns their security and their privacy. There's a whole 'nother level of attachment to your healthcare information that you don't have to, say, how many steps you took in a day. You might be willing to share that across your friend network on the Fitbit app. But do you really want to share it as it pertains to your medical status?Campbell: Kristine, forget about pre-existing conditions. We're talking about previous to existing conditions.Harjes: Yeah, exactly. It'll be interesting. It's definitely a very early stage market. Looking at this from an investing standpoint, it seems to me like all these tech companies that we talked about, most of them are great stocks, but I wouldn't necessarily invest money in them because of their healthcare initiatives, because they're too small at this point. They could be huge opportunities downstream, but I think it's going to be a long time before, say, Apple's healthcare initiatives end up being a meaningful contributor to the business.Campbell: We don't know who the winners or losers will be. It's just way too early, as you said. We know who, so far, the market share leaders are in some of these wearables, Fitbit and Apple being No. 1 and No. 3.Harjes: Yeah, there's actually a pretty big Chinese company that's in the mix, too.Campbell: Yeah, No. 2. Funny thing is, and this shows you -- I'm up in New Hampshire and I don't get out very often -- I had never even heard of the company prior to doing the research on this.Harjes: Actually, I hadn't, either, but I think that's just because they don't really have a big lodging in the U.S. But they're huge in Asia, and they're actually really cheap devices.Campbell: Yeah, they're a private Chinese company called Xiaomi.Harjes: Yeah. So it'll be interesting to keep an eye on. Todd, any final thoughts before I close out?Campbell: No. I think, like you said, we're an investing show, and I think the investing takeaway is, stay tuned. I don't think you can go out and buy any of these stocks based on what we just discussed today. But I think it's definitely worth tracking how this industry is progressing, paying attention to the news flow on it, because at some point, this is going to become very big business for somebody.Harjes: Yeah. And it is really interesting to me to see how these different sectors overlap. Even just in a portfolio allocation sense, if I have my money in, say, Alphabet, and all of a sudden healthcare becomes half of their business, does that change how I think about that investment? I don't know. Remains to be seen. But like I said, we are just in the early stages, so stay tuned. That will just about do it for today's show.

Shares have lost about 9.6% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.DexCom Inc. DXCM reported a loss of $0.49 per share in the first quarter of 2017, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.55. However, the figure was wider than the loss of $0.23 reported in the year-ago quarter.Interestingly, Dexcom posted a positive earnings surprise in the last quarter as well.Getting back to the quarter, total revenue grew to $142 million, reflecting an increase of 22.4% from $116 million in the year-ago quarter. However, the figure lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $144 million.DexCom generated a gross margin (as a percentage of revenues) of 66%, compared with 65% for the same quarter in the prior year. Notably, gross margin was slightly below management's anticipated range for the quarter, thanks to a drop in first-quarter sales.International business showed continued year-over-year growth in the quarter, generating $26 million in revenues, up 37% on a year-over-year basis. Notably, international business represented 18% of total revenue in the first quarter. Particularly, Germany fueled almost 37% growth outside the U.S. in the quarter.Research and development (R&D) expenses totaled $48 million in the quarter, compared with $32 million a year ago. The company's R&D investments include the G6 pivotal study and related submissions with the FDA.Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $86 million in the reported quarter, compared with $62 million in the same quarter of 2016. The rise was primarily due to year-over-year increases in head count in customer support organizations, higher marketing expenses and escalating IT costs.As of Mar 31, 2017, DexCom had $181.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities.The company projects global revenues in the band of $710 million to $740 million, reflecting growth of approximately 25% to 30%.For the full year, DexCom anticipates gross margin at the low end of the 67% to 70% guidance.Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There has been one revision higher for the current quarter compared to eight lower. While looking back an additional 30 days, we can see even more downward momentum. There have been nine moves down in the last two months. In the past month, the consensus estimate has shifted downward by 49.4% due to these changes. | Currently, DexCom's stock has an average Growth Score of 'C', though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with an 'F'. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of 'D' on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of 'F'. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.The company's stock is suitable solely for growth based on our styles scores.Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock. The magnitude of this revision also indicates a downward shift. Notably, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

At least, that's what it seems like sometimes.Both  (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Google parent  (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) are working on technology to help manage diabetes and address other healthcare issues. Could Alphabet and Apple now be considered two of the best healthcare stocks around? Maybe so.Image source: Getty Images.Alphabet has a couple of companies focusing on healthcare -- Calico and Verily. And these companies have forged partnerships with some big established healthcare companies along the way.Calico was formed in 2013 to develop technologies that increase the human lifespan. The following year,  teamed up with Calico, investing $750 million to try to bring new therapies to market for patients with age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer.In late 2015, Google Life Sciences changed its name to Verily Life Sciences. Verily is working with  (NASDAQ: DXCM) to develop miniaturized continuous glucose monitors for type 2 diabetic patients. It formed a joint venture with  to create bioelectronic medicines that use tiny implanted devices to treat disease. The Alphabet business unit also formed other joint ventures with  to develop robotic surgical systems and with  to create technology that helps diabetic patients better manage their health.Perhaps the most intriguing project that Verily is working on is its effort with  to develop a smart contact lens that senses glucose level in tears. The goal is to have contact lenses that change color if diabetic patients' glucose levels aren't where they need to be.CNBC  that Apple has a secret initiative underway that's trying a different approach in monitoring glucose levels. Currently, patients must use finger sticks that pierce their skin four times per day to monitor their glucose levels. Apple's team is trying to develop a solution that uses optical sensors instead.The ultimate goal is to fulfill Apple founder Steve Jobs' vision of wearable devices that could continually monitor important vital signs. Apple Watch already enables monitoring of heart rates. Apple has applied for a patent to send alerts to family or emergency staff if an Apple Watch wearer has heart problems, such as arrhythmia. However, monitoring glucose in a completely non-invasive way has been impossible so far.Dexcom does have a continuous glucose monitoring system that interfaces with Apple Watch. However, the system uses a sensor that is placed underneath the skin. It also requires a minimum of two finger sticks each day for calibration. Apple's hope appears to be to eliminate the need for finger sticks entirely.Apple is looking at other healthcare opportunities as well.  that the company intends to transform its HealthKit app that runs on iPhones and Apple Watches from a primarily fitness application to a tool that helps improve diagnoses. Apple also bought a small company in early 2016, Gliimpse, which is developing software that stores electronic health records from multiple sources in one place.There's no question that both Alphabet and Apple are trying to solve some of the most challenging problems in healthcare. But are the stocks good choices for investors wanting to profit from the growth in the healthcare industry? Yes and no.The negative response isn't because Alphabet and Apple aren't solid stock picks. They are. However, in the near term, neither company will generate enough revenue from healthcare to rank the stocks among the best ways to ride the healthcare wave.On the other hand, investors should look at the long run. If Alphabet and Apple are successful in achieving their goals, the financial opportunities in healthcare for both companies are enormous. The diabetes testing market could reach $17 billion by 2021.

The smartwatch has changed the market and absolutely dominated a growing industry. The company doesn't release sales figures, but industry experts have highlighted just how big of a lead it has for smartwatches. New reports on Apple getting into the glucose monitoring market via the Apple Watch could boost sales of the watch even further. If it can win here, it would make the Apple Watch and AAPL stock both must-owns for many. Source: AppleIn April, the Apple Watch celebrated its two year  as one of many innovative Apple products that have become must-haves for technology lovers and users who like the easy to use items from the company.Once considered a horrible idea or a flop, the Apple Watch has actually  Rolex over the last 12 months. To find out just how popular the watch is and what impact it has on the finances of AAPL stock, you have to dig a little deeper.Apple does not break out the individual performance of the Apple Watch, rather placing it in a category called Other Products with the iPod, Airpods and Beats headphones.In AAPL's first fiscal quarter, the company saw record sales of the iPhone, Mac and Apple Watch. Company CEO Tim Cook  , \"It was also our best quarter ever for Apple Watch, both units and revenues, with holiday demand so strong that we couldn't make enough.\" Research firm Strategy Analytics estimates that AAPL shipped 5.2 million Apple Watch units and had 63% market share for smartwatches during the important holiday quarter.Apple reported second-quarter earnings last week and showed the dominance of the Apple Watch in its category again. Sales of the watch nearly doubled from the prior year and helped boost the performance of the Other Products category once again. Apple CEO Tim Cook called the performance \"phenomenal growth\" and said, \"We couldn't be more satisfied with it\". Interestingly enough, if AAPL's Other Products category was its own company, sales of the Apple Watch, Airpods and Beats would be enough to make it a Fortune 500 company.The Other Products category saw quarterly revenue of $2.9 billion. While that was a far cry from the $33.2 billion seen in sales from the iPhone in the quarter, the Other Products led the way in terms of growth. The category, which includes the Apple Watch, saw a year-over-year increase of 31%, compared to gains of 18% for Services and 14% for Mac. Revenue from iPhones grew only 1% and sales of the iPad fell 12%.Recently, the Apple Watch gained more attention as  Apple's secret plans on making the device a potential entrant in the glucose monitoring market. AAPL has a small team of engineers developing glucose sensors over the last five years. The glucose sensor market was a long-term vision of former Apple founder Steve Jobs. The former CEO saw wearables as a possible way for the company to be involved in the life sciences market. Jobs thought wearables could eventually track oxygen levels, heart rates and blood glucose levels.Apple entering the diabetes market shouldn't come as a big surprise to the industry or investors. Large technology companies continue to diversify and invest where there is money to be made as technology evolves. Rival  (NASDAQ:  , NASDAQ:  ) is working on a diabetes project of its own, which I  here recently.Alphabet's Verily Life Sciences division is working with  (NYSE:  ) on a smart lenses project that would help diabetics track their blood glucose levels.  (NYSE:  ),  (OTCMKTS:  ) and other companies are also working on their own versions of smart lenses.The diabetes market continues to be one of the largest in terms of revenue possibilities for companies. With limited treatment options, it is also one of several holy grails for the industry. In my Alphabet article, I pointed out that diabetes is one of the leading causes of deaths with more than 70,000 a year in the U.S. In 2015, around 50% of the U.S. adult population was diabetic or pre-diabetic, representing a huge market. The global diabetic care device market was worth $18.5 billion in 2015 and is seen rising to $26 billion, according to  .Investors have already recognized how valuable the glucose monitoring market is. Small cap  (NASDAQ:  ) has watched its stock soar 636% in the last five years. The device maker company now sports a market capitalization of $6.5 billion and is up 28% in 2017.DexCom saw its DexCom G5 device approved as the only mobile CGM (constant glucose monitor) on the market. The device places a small sensor underneath the skin and then sends constant glucose readings to the person's device, cutting out the need to prick a finger every hour or monitor gaps in testing due to work or school.In the most recent first quarter, DexCom saw revenue grow 22% to $142.3 million. International sales increased 37%. The DexCom G5 is covered by Medicare and picking up coverage as a leading option for diabetic patients. Imagine if Apple can get a product similar to this to the masses with its huge distribution network, retail stores and brand appeal.DexCom stock may not be done running either. The company has ambitious  and a partnership with Alphabet's Verily division. The goal is to bring a mini glucose monitor to the market and by 2021 has an even smaller disposable glucose monitor the size of a band-aid. With the company's strong relationship with Verily, DexCom is likely more of an acquisition by Alphabet than Apple, but keep a close watch here.While analysts and investors may think The Apple Watch having relevance in the diabetes testing market may be a long ways off, it could be much closer than thought. AAPL is currently doing feasibility studies and has hired consultants to help with the regulatory path for the Apple Watch being approved as a testing device. Apple has hired biotechnology experts from other companies to help in this process.An Apple Watch device that can monitor blood glucose levels with a good degree of accuracy will make the product a possible must own for diabetics. This should be music to the ears of owners of APPL stock. While the iPhone is the company's bread and butter, other areas like services, Apple TV and the Apple Watch are helping the company diversify and provide a better glimpse into the future of one of the world's most valuable companies.The post ) Stock Can Count on the Apple Watch appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself.

The system is being heralded as a major advance in treating diabetes, because it significantly reduces the need for finger sticks and insulin shots. Will this new device be a hit?There are about 1.25 million Americans with Type 1 diabetes, and for these patients, managing their blood sugar levels can seem like a full-time job.Image source: Getty Images.Type 1 diabetes patients must regularly check their blood sugar levels with finger sticks, and then dose themselves with insulin when blood sugar levels require it. Unfortunately, this scattershot approach to managing the disease results in many patients failing to maintain appropriate blood glucose levels, especially at night, or when exercising. Because time spent outside of desired blood sugar ranges can accelerate disease progression and lead to life-threatening conditions, inadequately controlled diabetes remains a big problem.Fortunately, medical device makers have developed new technology like insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors that help patients better control their disease, however, until now, there wasn't a FDA-approved closed-loop system for the monitoring and dosing of insulin available.The FDA gave Medtronics MiniMed 670G a green light after trial results showed that it helped patients remain within their desired blood sugar range over a three-month period. The trial included both adults and children with Type 1 diabetes, and A1C levels fell from 7.7% to 7.1% in children and from 7.3% to 6.8% in adults. There also was a 44% decline in time spent with blood glucose below 70 mg/dL and a 40% decline in time spent with dangerous hypoglycemia, or levels below 50 mg/dL.Image source: Medtronic.The MiniMed 670G uses sensors to automatically monitor blood glucose levels every five minutes and it uses a pump to automatically administer insulin as it's needed. A daily finger-stick is still required to calibrate the system, and the insulin pump needs to be refilled every few days, but the system still significantly reduces the treatment burden on patients.The MiniMed 670G system includes a sensor that's attached to the body and that must be changed weekly, an insulin pump that's worn on the waist, and an infusion patch that connects to the pump to administer insulin via a catheter.Medtronic's device is an important advance in automating diabetes treatment, but it's not approved for use in Type 1 diabetes patients who are younger than 14 (yet), it still requires some patient involvement, and it's arguably a bit bulkier of a solution for active patients, who may prefer wireless pumps, such as  's(NASDAQ: PODD) Omnipod.Omnipod is a tubeless insulin management system that delivers insulin for up to three days using a wireless programming device. Oftentimes, patients pair Omnipod up with a continuous glucose monitor, such as those made by  (NASDAQ: DXCM) , to provide even better control of their disease.Medtronic only began shipping the MiniMed 670G to patients recently, so the verdict isn't in on whether it will win away consumers from these other solutions. If it does, then it could be an important new source of revenue for Medtronic. However, that tailwind could only be temporary, because the MiniMed 670G may face stiff competition soon. Insulet, for example, is working on its own closed-loop system that incorporates DexCom's sensors, and if trials are successful, its system could be available as soon as next year.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Tuesday, shares of DexCom Inc (Symbol: DXCM) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 28.7, after changing hands as low as $73.44 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 43.3. A bullish investor could look at DXCM's 28.7 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. The chart below shows the one year performance of DXCM shares:    Looking at the chart above, DXCM's low point in its 52 week range is $57.68 per share, with $96.38 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $73.85.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, DXCM makes up 1.71% of the SPDR S&P Health Care Equipment ETF (Symbol: XHE) which is trading relatively unchanged on the day Tuesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["After the company reported first-quarter results that missed the mark, shares of  (NASDAQ: DXCM) , a medical device maker focused on diabetes, fell 10% as of 11:55 p.m. EDT on Wednesday.Here's a look at the headline numbers that are driving today's price action:Since DexCom isn't profitable and trades at a  , Wall Street typically places an emphasis on revenue growth above all else. Thus, even though DexCom managed to beat expectations on the bottom line, it makes sense that investors are selling off shares today due to the revenue miss.Image source: Getty Images.CEO Kevin Sayer likely knew that Wall Street was going to react negatively to the headline numbers and decided to open the company's investor call with a review of recent events. He stated that he was particularly excited about Medicare's decision to  for the company's continuous glucose monitoring device for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In fact, he noted that the company's pipeline of prospective Medicare patients already exceeds 10,000 even though the company hasn't even started promoting to that audience.Later in the call, Steven Pacelli, DexCom's executive VP of strategy and corporate development, stated that the Medicare reimbursement news prohibited the company from balance billing its existing cash pay Medicare patients. As a result, the company lost approximately $2 million to $3 million of sales during the quarter. In addition, the company noted that its two pump partners --  and  's Animas division -- \"encountered difficulties\" in their recent quarters. When combined, these two developments caused DexCom's revenue to come in below expectations.Turning to the full year, DexCom stated that it was maintaining its 2017 revenue guidance range of $710 million to $740 million. However, the company stated that its gross margin will be \"at the low end\" of its guidance range of 67% to 70%.Short-term difficulties aside, DexCom continues to offer investors reasons to believe that its long-term growth trajectory remains intact.

However, sometimes a stock takes off because of thesis-changing news. When that happens, it can sometimes make sense to buy, even after a stock has gone on a big run. (NASDAQ: DXCM) ,  (NYSE: SHOP) , and  (NASDAQ: PTLA) are three stocks that have all soared at least 40% since the start of the year. Here's why investors can believe that the good times will continue from here.Image source: Getty Images.Shareholders of the diabetes-focused medical-device company can thank two big announcements for the stock's big year-to-date rally.First, Dexcom provided investors with a sneak peek at its fourth-quarter results during the  . Management said revenue would be about $168 million, representing 28% growth over the year-ago period. The company also guided for revenue to grow another 25% to 30% in 2017. Those figures compared favorably with what Wall Street had expected, sending shares screaming higher.A few months later, Dexcom shared the wonderful news that people with diabetes who have Medicare can finally obtain reimbursement for the company's continuous glucose-monitoring system. In addition, Dexcom's G5 Mobile is currently the only system that fits the FDA's criteria to justify coverage. That fact should provide Dexcom with a near monopoly among this patient population.It's worth pointing out that Dexcom's management team gave 2017 revenue guidance  the Medicare news hit the wire. That could mean management didn't bake that information into its forecast, so revenue might sail past that already lofty projection. If true, it wouldn't surprise me to see shares continue their upward trajectory.While the brick-and-mortar retail landscape is currently in a funk, the e-commerce retail space continues to be red hot. One company greatly benefiting from the shifting consumer landscape is Shopify, a leading provider of cloud-based e-commerce software for small- and medium-sized businesses.Shopify helps hundreds of thousands of businesses conduct business online. The company's software makes it easy for these businesses to create a website, process payments, manage inventory, track shipping, and more. Accessing these services requires a monthly fee that starts at $29, which is a low enough price point to attract even price-sensitive customers.When Shopify reported its fourth-quarter results, investors were blown away to learn that the company's customer count soared to 375,000 businesses. That's up sharply from the 243,000 it recorded in the fourth quarter last year, which helped drive total revenue up 86% year over year.Despite its success, Shopify believes it has still only scratched the surface of what's possible. The company estimates that 11 million businesses could use its product just in the areas it currently operates in. Zoom out to the entire world, and that number jumps to 46 million.If the company can continue to produce outstanding quarterly reports, I wouldn't be shocked at all to see shares continue to rise.2016 was a rough year for Portola Pharmaceuticals. Shares nosedived after the FDA  to AndexXa, the company's antidote to Factor Xa inhibitors such as  's Xarelto and  and  's Eliquis.  from a phase 3 trial involving Portola's own Factor Xa inhibitor betrixaban only added to the worries. When added together, shares plunged by more than 50%.Since then, a handful of upbeat announcements from 2017 has reversed the stock's decline.First, management told investors it expects to resubmit AndexXa to the FDA in the second quarter. That could put it on pace for an approval by late 2017 or early 2018.Next, Portola got some good news from the FDA related to its pending approval of betrixaban. The agency told Portola that it didn't identify any issues that would require an advisory committee meeting. Given that betrixaban has been granted both fast-track designation and priority review, investors took this news to mean that the drug stands a good chance of winning the thumbs-up by its PDUFA date of June 24.Finally, investors cheered the company's decision to raise $150 million through a non-dilutive royalty agreement. The terms provided Portola with a $50 million upfront payment and an additional $100 million if the FDA approves AndexXa. In exchange, the company agreed to pay a tiered, mid-single-digit royalty based on worldwide sales. When coupled with the company's $319 million in cash at year's end, Portola looks to have plenty of financing lined up.These events set up Portola to potentially announce the approval and launch of both AndexXa and betrixaban over the next 12 months. If everything goes according to plan, then I could easily see more gains ahead.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Left untreated, that sugar builds up in the bloodstream and the body, which can lead to a number of serious additional health problems such as cardiovascular disease, kidney disease and eye disease.Treating diabetes is expensive, costing America alone some $322 billion each year. Naturally, a market that big has attracted plenty of companies to focus on the disease state.  (NYSE: NVO) ,  (NASDAQ: PODD) , and  (NASDAQ: DXCM) are three such businesses, and I think that they all could be great choices for investors.Image Source: Getty Images.Many people who have diabetes take drugs to help keep their blood sugar levels in check. One of the long-term leaders in the industry is Novo Nordisk, a Danish drugmaker that has been selling insulin for nearly a century.Novo's top line has charged upward for years as it brought new treatments to market. Recent hits include Tresiba, a long-acting insulin that has been taking share from  's megahit Lantus, and Victoza, a GLP-1 inhibitor that lowers blood sugar levels and tends to help some patients lose weight. Novo also boasts a number of new drugs that should be coming to market soon, such as the recently FDA-approved Xultophy, which combines Victoza and Tresiba, and Fiasp, an ultra-fast rapid-acting mealtime insulin.And yet, despite its long history of successful drug development and its leadership position in treating an increasingly common disease, Novo's share price and valuation have been crushed over the past year. data by What gives? You can blame the decline on increasing  from insurers on the company's legacy products. To maintain its market share, Novo has been offering discounts. As a result, management dropped its long-term profit growth target from 10% to 5%.While the waning profit growth is disappointing, I can't help but think that the markets have overreacted. Novo's still  and it has a huge tailwind at its back, so I can't help but like its long-term prospects. With shares trading at a discount and offering up a dividend yield approaching 4%, I think this is a top stock for conservative investors to consider.Not every person who has diabetes requires insulin injections to stay healthy, but millions of them do. Those daily injections can be a pain, and dosing with precision can be difficult, which is why many insulin-dependent patients prefer instead to use an insulin pump.However, wearing a pump presents its own issues. Traditional insulin pumps require tubing, which can easily get snagged or tangled during everyday living. To solve that problem, Insulet launched a patch pump called  that is worn directly on the body and disposed of after three days of use. The device is also waterproof and features automatic cannula insertion, which makes it far easier for patients to place it in tough to reach spots.Insulet's unique tube-free system has allowed it to gobble up market share over the last decade. Better yet, the company's \"razor-and-blade\" business model creates a lot of recurring revenue. When combined, the company's top-line -- and share price -- have soared. data by While Insulet is still losing money, there's reason to believe that profits could finally be on the horizon. Revenue from the company's core OmniPod business is still growing by  both stateside and abroad. Meanwhile, the other drug delivery business is growing nicely, powered mostly by the company's partnership with  . Margins are also on the rise and are expected to continue to push higher. Longer term, CEO Patrick Sullivan expects the company to pump out more than $1 billion in revenue. If the company can hit that ambitious target, its top line would nearly triple.Of course, Wall Street is aware of the company's potential and has priced shares at more than seven times sales. While that's a pricey valuation, if the company can deliver on its growth targets, I could easily see shares continuing to outperform from here.Many people with diabetes are required to measure their blood sugar levels at various times during the day in order to ensure it is within a healthy range. For most, this requires a finger prick to obtain a small blood sample that is tested on a monitor. As you may guess, this isn't a process that many people like.In an effort to ease this burden, Dexcom launched  a decade ago that is worn on the body for up to seven days and  measures blood glucose levels. This information is then uploaded directly to a smartphone or other receiver, making it far easier for users to track their blood sugar, and allowing them to do it in real time.This product -- now called the Dexcom G5 Mobile Continuous Glucose Monitoring System -- has been wildly successful. Like Insulet, Dexcom also benefits from a razor-and-blade business model, which has allowed the company's revenue to soar. In turn, long-term shareholders have been extremely well rewarded. data by Despite its history of success, there's reason to believe that DexCom's growth engine is just getting warmed up. The company only counts 200,000 patients as active users, just a small fraction of the 415 million people with diabetes worldwide.While Dexcom is still losing money, that's expected to change in 2017. However, Wall Street has caught on to this growth story and is valuing the company at 11 times sales. Despite that nose-bleed valuation, I still think shares could be worth owning since the company is closing in on profitability and staring down a massive growth opportunity. Share prices are likely to remain volatile for the foreseeable future, but if you are a growth investor at heart, I think that DexCom is certainly worthy of a closer look.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

While this has been the standard of care treatment for generations, many patients do not like to give themselves injections. MannKind's big idea was to make insulin inhalable, thereby providing patients with a needle-free way to meet their fast-acting insulin needs. After years of research, the FDA finally gave the green light to the company's product -- called Afrezza -- in 2014.Unfortunately, MannKind has faced numerous obstacles in commercializing the drug.  -- Mannkind's former partner -- priced Afrezza at a big premium to other insulins, which caused many insurers to place restrictions on its use. That made it quite difficult for patients to access the drug. The situation got so bad thatSanofi threw in the towel less than a year into the launch. Predictably, that caused MannKind's stock to tank. data by  .The terrible launch and loss of a deep-pocketed partner put MannKind in a tough position. Over the last year, the company has been scrambling to cut costs, raise capital, and relaunch the product.Thankfully, MannKind has made a number of moves that have greatly enhanced its financial position. The company recently received a $30 million cash injection from Sanofi. It also sold one of its buildings for $16 million. When adding in other ways to access capital, MannKind has given itself a little bit of breathing room. The company also  a reverse stock split earlier this month that should alleviate the threat of being delisted from the Nasdaq for having a share price under $1.00.Of course, the only thing that matters from here is how fast MannKind can ramp sales of Afrezza. Third-quarter sales of the drug were only $573,000, which is a still just a pittance. Only time will tell if MannKind will be successful with its attempts to relaunch the product.Unlike MannKind, Dexcom has been a market darling for years. This company's success can be traced to the rapid uptake by the diabetes community of its innovative continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. This disposable device is worn on the body for up to seven days and constantly uploads a patient's blood sugar levels to a receiver or phone. This provides patients with a convenient way for them to track their glucose levels in real time, enabling them to better manage their disease.What's wonderful about this business is that Dexcom operates a razor-and-blades business model. Each consumer that signs up gets locked into buying the company's high-margin consumables for years. With more patients signing up every day, Dexcom's revenue growth has been extraordinary. In turn, the stock price has soared. data by  .Thankfully, even today Dexcom believes that it has still only scratched the surface of what's possible. While roughly 200,000 patients are active Dexcom users, that's still just a tiny fraction of the 29 million Americans that have diabetes. The opportunity looks even bigger when you zoom out to include the rest of the world.On the downside, Wall Street has caught on to Dexcom's growth potential and has priced its shares accordingly. The company is currently trading at 13 times  , which is an unbelievably expensive premium. With medical device giant  gearing up to launch the first  , it is possible that Dexcom's growth rate could start to slow. If true, then traders might find Dexcom's nose-bleed valuation to be too rich, and shares could take a tumble.While some investors might find MannKind's tiny share price to be attractive, I for one think its stock is too risky to touch. That's why I'd vastly prefer to buy Dexcom instead, even though the company's stretched valuation makes it a risky stock, too. Still, Dexcom is rapidly expanding, nearing profitability, and has a debt-free balance sheet.

The company's stock price rallied 4.8% to close at $82.62 yesterday following its announcement, that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) published an article clarifying the criteria for coverage of its DexCom G5 Mobile CGM (continuous glucose monitoring) system for patients with diabetes and on intensive insulin therapy.DexCom G5 Mobile is the only FDA approved glucose measurement device for therapeutic decision making. Per management, CMS has mentioned four criteria for patients to be covered by the G5 Mobile therapeutic system. Eligible patients must have either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes and require daily injections of insulin or the use of a continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump. Furthermore, patients should have been using a home blood glucose monitor and performing frequent blood glucose monitoring testing for a long time.The DexCom G5 Mobile CGM has been significantly boosting the company's top line over the recent past. Interestingly, the platform has a number of FDA submissions on track that include a reliable touch screen receiver, a new insertion system and corresponding smaller transmitter and an Android platform, which is expected to be launched in the U.S. by mid-2017. | A glimpse at the share price trend over the past three months reveals a promising scenario. DexCom gained a stellar 35.5%, outshining the Zacks classified Medical Instruments sub-industry's return of 8.03%. Furthermore, the current return of the stock is well ahead of the S&P 500's return of 16.4% over the same time frame.On the flip side, the estimate revision trend looks dismal. For the full year, 12 analysts moved south over the last two months compared to no movement in the opposite direction. As a result, the current year estimates are pegged at a loss of 57 cents per share, 128% wider than a loss of 25 cents estimated two months ago.Despite the bullish price trend, the disappointing analyst sentiments indicate looming concerns ahead. Notably, DexCom has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).We believe the glucose monitoring market represents significant commercial opportunity for DexCom. Furthermore, the diabetes market is booming at the moment, courtesy of the ageing population, inappropriate dietary habits and increasingly sedentary lifestyles. To substantiate the sentiment, a research report by the Allied Market Research reveals that the global markets for Continuous Glucose Monitoring is expected to reach a worth of $568.5 million by 2020, multiplying at a CAGR of 14.8%, with North America being a key market segment.However, cut-throat competition in the market for blood glucose monitoring devices is a major headwind.

The Soros Fund Management, after all, has been one of world's most active and profitable investing firms over its 47-year history.The secret to the Soros fund's success is its core philosophy, which centers around identifying emerging trends early on and subsequently exploiting them to the fullest. So it's fairly common to see the fund buy small chunks of a company in one quarter, and then either ratchet up its position or sell it off entirely in the next quarter.Keeping this theme squarely in mind, the most recent 13-F filings revealed that the Soros fund bought shares of both  (NASDAQ: CELG) and  (NASDAQ: DXCM) in the fourth quarter of 2016. Do these two buys indicate that these stocks are about to heat up? Let's dig deeper to find out.Image Source: Getty Images.Celgene is known mostly for Revlimid, Abraxane, and Pomalyst, its trio of top flight blood cancer drugs. However, the company has successfully used its core expertise in blood cancer to delve into other lucrative disease markets of late, such as chronic inflammatory diseases. Celgene's relatively new plaque psoriasis medicine Otezla, for instance, was able to achieve blockbuster status in less than two years after its original approval, and is set to generate upwards of $1.7 billion in sales this year.This stunning level of revenue growth for both Otezla and its flagship hematology products has enabled the biotech to form numerous external partnerships, and aggressively pursue M&A opportunities to vastly broaden its clinical portfolio over the last few years. As a direct result, Celgene is on track to announce a jaw-dropping 19 Phase 3 data readouts over the next two years. The best part, though, is that this onslaught of pivotal data readouts also contains some extremely high-value disease targets.Image Source: Getty Images.The experimental drug ozanimod, for instance, sports megablockbuster potential as a treatment for relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS), ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease. And so far, the drug is performing as expected in trials.Earlier this month, Celgene reported that ozanimod met both its primary and secondary endpoints in its first late-stage trial as an oral therapy for RMS. The drug's second late-stage readout is forecast to hit the Street sometime in the second quarter of this year.If warranted, the company plans on filing ozanimod's regulatory application with the FDA before year's end, perhaps giving Celgene its next franchise-level drug as soon as mid to late 2018.In all, Celgene is an ultra high-growth biotech that's nearing several major clinical milestones. So there's definitely good reason to keep a close eye on this blue-chip biotech in 2017, and perhaps even pick up some shares ahead of these upcoming catalysts.Dexcom is a medical device company with enormous aspirations. The short story is that this mid-cap company wants to completely displace finger sticks with its continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems as the gold standard for glucose monitoring in diabetes patients.The basic idea is that more accurate glucose monitoring should lead to better overall diabetes management, and hence lower incidence rates of serious complications from the disease such as kidney failure, heart attacks, and strokes.And with over 422 million adults already living with diabetes across the globe and incidence rates only continuing to rise, Dexcom is unquestionably pursuing a monstrous commercial opportunity.The really exciting part about this biotech's growth story, though, is that the company isn't just targeting a sizable commercial opportunity, but actually making major strides at capturing the lion's share of the CGM market. Dexcom's revenues over the past couple years, for example, have grown by leaps and bounds: data by Adding fuel to the fire, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently  CGM systems as \"therapeutic\" under Medicare Part B, allowing them to be covered by Medicaid and Medicare. This favorable regulatory decision, combined with growing demand for CGM systems in general, is expected to drive Dexcom's sales up by another 25% to 30% this year to around $710 to $740 million.The drawback is that Dexcom's rocket-like growth hasn't gone unnoticed, with its shares trading at a price to sales ratio in excess of 12.5 right now. But with the diabetes market growing hand-in-hand with the rising global population, this biotech's hefty premium may be worth the price of admission.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In the last reported quarter, it recorded a negative earnings surprise of 57.14%, bringing the four-quarter average to a negative 59.96%. However, in the past three months, DexCom gained almost 7.95%, outperforming the Zacks categorized  sub-industry's gain of roughly 6.74%. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.We believe the glucose monitoring and diabetes market represents significant commercial opportunity for DexCom, and are likely to be the key catalysts for the company in the fourth quarter. The medical device company expects preliminary, unaudited revenue of approximately $168 million for the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2016. This reflects an increase of 28% over the fourth quarter of 2015. The upside expected in revenues was due to an estimated 80,000 to 90,000 new patients adopting DexCom Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) worldwide.The company continues to witness flat pricing, owing to price discounting in larger accounts, limited product offerings and international price cuts. Further, DexCom derives a significant part of total revenue from international operations, which is adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.Moreover, overall activities of DexCom during the fourth quarter were inadequate to win analysts' confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported fell two cents to a loss of nine cents per share in the last 90 days.However, our proven model does not conclusively show that DexCom is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the June 2017 put at the $55 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $4.00. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 7.3% return against the $55 commitment, or a 11.8% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to DXCM's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $55 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless DexCom Inc sees its shares fall 11.8% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $51.00 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $4.00 from $55), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 11.8% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for DexCom Inc, and highlighting in green where the $55 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the June 2017 put at the $55 strike for the 11.8% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for DexCom Inc (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $62.78) to be 45%.

The insulin pump maker isn't set to report third-quarter earnings until the market closes on Thursday.Rather, today's plunge is likely because two other diabetes-focused medical device companies posted disappointing quarterly results.First,  -- an insulin pump manufacturer and one of Insulet's direct competitors -- reported a 22% decline in sales in the third quarter. While the company actually managed to grow its insulin pump shipments year over year, a large number of customers took advantage of its \"Technology Upgrade Program,\" which deferred $8.4 million of sales. Investors are not taking the news well, pushing shares down more than 55% in afternoon trading.Second, shares of  (NASDAQ: DXCM) are also under a lot of  today. The continuous glucose monitoring company reported strong revenue growth in the third quarter, but expenses came in much higher than the markets were expecting. To add insult to injury, it said that its full-year revenue was going to come in a bit shy of Wall Street's projections.The market appears to be taking a \"guilty by association\" approach to Insulet's stock today, hence shares are dropping.The biggest unknown for Insulet's investors heading into 2017 is how the company will be affected by  's(NYSE: MDT) recently approved \"  .\" For what it's worth, Dexcom CEO Kevin Sayer believes that the media hype surrounding the approval is overselling the capabilities of the technology, saying:Unfortunately, Insulet's investors still have some waiting to do before they learn what kind of impact Medtronic's new device could have on its business.

Fundamental concepts change slowly. Chart patterns change constantly. Usually the calls are dramatic, because no one cares about advice that says, \"all is well, keep holding.\"Traders live on stock charts, but investors also pay close attention. Everyone wants to know whether a stock is breaking down, breaking out, or stuck in a trading range. Here is the key question:We have several great charts this week. The Stock Exchange provides an expert-level debate on technical and fundamental analysis. (Important background is  ). Comments, dissent, and specific stock questions are welcome!One issue with charts is the wide difference in interpretation. Do analysts see what they want to see? Are the interpretive criteria constant and objective? This week (without telling him), I searched for other opinions on one of our expert selections, Felix's choice of The Kraft Heinz Company (  ). The same principles would apply to all the picks, but this is a convenient example. Before turning to Felix, let's look at other approaches. provides a complex chart and plenty of additional points of interest.

The time frame matters, and so does added complexity.Let's see what Felix has to say, and also check out my own conclusion to this article.I look for long-term themes, and I have a great one this week. I have a pick without an army: KHC. It is my lone soldier of the week, a strong company. The recent selloffs provide a good point of entry with the rebounds already underway. This should be good for another 5 points.this week from A Dash of Insight: Question from Fred Barone:Any opinion on CVR Energy (  ) thank you. This is a stock I won't be holding for a while; it has been going downhill since 2013. There hasn't been much upside. On the other hand, it does rank in the top 25% of my universe, so it is not terrible. I would take a guess that you have been holding this for a while? Please keep your questions coming. I could use the overtime pay. And by the way, Jeff. Are we working next Thursday? Next Thursday the market is closed and we are all taking a day off to give thanks and spend time with family. I don't have a family and I could use the overtime bonus.I hope I'm not too late to the party on this one. Teck Resources Ltd. (  ) has been on a solid rise since March. We've had the stock price quadruple since then, which is remarkable to say the least. While I don't expect to cash in on that kind of return in the next few weeks, there is still a tidy profit to be had here. This pick is not completely hopeless. The company has some earnings. There is plenty of fluctuation but excellent growth expectations. This might work. The market is sending a message that it will work. I listen, Jeff, and so should you!While I focus on sectors, sometimes ideas get as narrow as a single country ETF. My regular sports channels had a brief blurb about some guy named Abe meeting with Trump. Some of my sources suggested that I should check out the WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity ETF (  ) this week.

After a sharp decline on November 1st, this stock has proceeded to consolidate and slowly climb back up from a low of 61.00. I will put in a stop at 62.50. I bought this stock at 70.96, looking for a nice rebound to the low 80s or even higher. If we start to rally, I'll be moving up my stop aggressively. My major concern is that move is based on perceived changes in medical policies from Washington, vs. improvement in the outlook of this company. I'll be very tight on the trigger if the stock starts to drift lower day after day.[J] Do you understand that this company has no earnings, no dividend, and no real prospects for the next two years? How have I been doing? Your picks have been profitable. I also like your frequent decisions to take profits and move on. You are not overstaying your welcome. That is a very honest assessment. I like that in a human. Next you must learn to be more intuitive. Sometimes stocks rebound before the fundamentals confirm. I often spot such cases. Are you really considering policy changes from Washington? Of course not. The price and volume reflect that information!Each week Felix and Oscar host a poker game for some of their friends.

My boss, a clever fellow, became suspicious of conclusions from our technical analyst. He asked me to create some stock charts with the data inverted. He presented one group to our analyst, and got a verdict of bullish on all fronts. A bit later he presented the same charts, with the pattern inverted.

In addition, the recent change in consumer demand and market dynamics led to a dramatic transformation in the entire healthcare system.

Unfortunately, when you have enterprises continuing to debate how to store all their information, you never know if you're one hit product away from success or failure.Since launching its FlashArray product in 2012, Pure Storage has racked up more than $600 million in operating losses over 42 months. Yet, you can't help but be impressed by its revenues, which have grown tenfold in the past two years alone. In the second quarter of 2016, PSTG increased revenues  year-over-year to $163.2 million, growing its customers by 107% year-over-year to more than 2,300.The big news: It began shipping FlashBlade, its follow-up product to FlashArray. Despite the significant operating losses it's racked up, PSTG could finally deliver the promise so many believed it had coming to market last October.With the stock down 13 months after going public, now is the time for it to really break out. FlashBlade could be just the ticket to make that move happen.The serial acquirer of transportation and logistics businesses - more than a dozen acquisitions since 2011 - including Con-way Inc., which it acquired last year for  - recently sold Con-way's truckload business to Canadian trucking firm  (OTCMKTS:  ) for $558 million in a move to reduce the $5 billion in debt taken on to make all of these acquisitions.Not a pivotal piece of Con-way's business, TransForce's offer was simply too good to pass up.If you thought Pure Storage was a big revenue grower,  (NYSE:  ) is out of this world, having growing its revenues from  in 2011 to a top ten global transportation and logistics company with  in revenue through the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 and estimated full-year revenues of more than $15 billion.Most importantly, XPO generated free cash flow in Q3 2016 of  and expects to be free cash flow positive for the entire year.

The maker of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems announced its  earnings Nov. 1; it lost 22 cents per share on $148.6 million in revenue.If you're a half full kind of person, you'll view its 41% year-over-year increase in revenue and 55% reduction in its quarterly loss to $18.6 million, as real progress towards sustainable profitability. If you're a half empty person, in the red is in the red, no matter the number. Working on bringing its CGM systems to the diabetes world since 1999, DexCom has yet to make a profit, but whose revenues will likely hit $1 billion within the next five years. If hope were all you needed to make money on a stock, DexCom would be at the top of anyone's list.DexCom's argument when it comes to managing diabetes is that intermittent, finger-stick glucose monitoring isn't enough. Patients tend to spend a great deal of their day outside a healthy glycemic range between  for every deciliter of blood. So, constant monitoring is the better alternative.There are three million insulin intensive patients in the U.S. - 30 million patients if you include T2 non-insulin and non-intensive patients - and only a small percentage of those patients are using CGM. Despite intense competition from  (NYSE:  ), DexCom continues to improve its gross margins and generate free cash flow, a key ingredient to most successful and profitable businesses.Good things are just around the corner.Earlier this year,  (NASDAQ:  ) stock traded in the low $30s, a level not seen since early 2013.

Splunk included.The maker of 3D modeling software made the decision to transition to a subscription-based business model from a licensed-based one back in  . As part of that transition, it's accepted operating losses, as the price it has to pay to remain competitive.Since 2013,  (NASDAQ:  ) operating profit has disappeared going from $305 million, or $1.32 per share, in fiscal 2013 to a company projected loss of at least $608 million, or $2.74 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, it's less painful, with an estimated loss of between 55 cents and 70 cents per share. But it's a loss nonetheless.The subscription model, when done well, can lead to higher revenue and profits.  (NASDAQ:  )  to a subscription-based model starting in 2013, operating profits went from $1.2 billion in fiscal 2012 to $413 billion in fiscal 2014 - then the turnaround took hold. Adobe will likely generate operating profits of  or more in fiscal 2017, with operating margins returning to historical norms.The big problem for Autodesk: It needs to speed up the transition. Adobe's subscription revenues really took off over the past two fiscal years -  in 2013 to $3.2 billion in 2015 - while maintaining operating expenses at the same level. Over the past two years, Autodesk's subscription revenues have increased by  or about 20%. It has got to do better.Keep the faith, ADSK shareholders. A couple of figures in its Q2 2016 report provide hope.First, new model annualized recurring revenue increased  in the second quarter to $371 million. That's a sign customers are slowly getting on board. The second sign things will get better is deferred revenue - up 23% to $1.5 billion in Q2 - the subscription fees to be paid in future months in order for customers to continue to use the software.If these two keep going up on a quarterly basis and at a decent clip there's no reason why it too can't generate record profits just like Adobe.Are you starting to sense a pattern here? It seems all of these cloud companies are growing revenues at a significant pace without much hope for immediate profits or even those on the horizon.  (NYSE:  ) definitely fits into that category.The cloud-based enterprise software company was founded in 2005 and went public in October 2012 at  per share. Trading above $80, IPO investors still holding have done well although WDAY stock has traded in a fairly tight range since April 2014. What's going to get it unstuck?Continue to grow subscriptions while slowing the amounts spent on marketing and product development which accounted for about  of its Q2 2016 operating expenses. Cut both of those by 25% while increasing subscription revenues by 30-40% per quarter and presto, you've got significant operating profits, not losses.Financially, Workday's business is getting stronger. Its trailing 12-month free cash flow is $178.1 million or about  of its revenue over those same 12 months. Adobe's current trailing 12-month free cash flow is  of revenue. Clearly, WDAY has work to do (no pun intended) but it's getting there.As it continues to win  customers in both the human capital management and financial segments, many of whom are global powerhouses, WDAY should gain pricing power as its customers become attached at the hip to its cloud-based products.When that happens, and it will, and Workday continues to maintain control over its expenses, the margins will go through the roof. And so will WDAY stock.It's hard to believe but  (NASDAQ:  ) actually made a profit in the third quarter, its first in more than three years. More importantly, it generated  in free cash flow from the production of 25,185 vehicles. Its business is getting profitable just in time to begin producing the Model 3, Tesla's version of the commuter car.Orders for new Model S and Model X vehicles were up 68% in Q3 while actual production jumped 92% year-over-year. Tesla expects to deliver 50,000 new vehicles from June 2016 through the end of the year with slightly more than half that number in Q4.So, although Tesla generated its first profit in a long time and business is looking up, it's still going to lose in the order of $800 million in 2016, a substantial amount. Not to mention its profit only came after a $139 million in California zero emission credits which are almost  pure profit.CEO Elon Musk has rolled the dice merging  for  figuring the two businesses go together like peanut butter and jelly. It remains to be seen whether his vision will be correct. What we do know is they'll both require a lot of cash until the potential synergies can be effectively - and profitably - exploited.Of all the seven feast or famine stocks, Tesla is easily my favorite. Not because I think you'll make the most amount of money but because Elon Musk is an  like no other - except maybe Jeff Bezos.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Image source: Medtronic plc. (NYSE: MDT) got an FDA green-light last week to begin marketing its artificial pancreas, the MiniMed 670G, and management is planning to launch the device early next year. Will the 670G dent demand for  's(NASDAQ: DXCM) continuous glucose monitors in 2017? Read on to find out how DexCom plans to keep growing.Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas that is used to break down sugar into energy. However, in 1.25 million Americans who are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, the pancreas fails to produce insulin, forcing patients to monitor their blood sugar levels and dose themselves insulin as necessary.The burden associated with managing type 1 diabetes is heavy, and as a result, most diabetics' blood sugar levels are out of the desired range most of the time. That's worrisome because blood sugar highs and lows can lead to life-threatening illnesses, such as heart disease.To reduce the risk of blood sugar highs and lows, Medtronic developed the 670G, a system that uses a blood glucose sensor, an insulin pump, and an infusion patch to automatically keep a type 1 diabetes patient's blood sugar levels on target.Once patients program their information into the device, the 670G manages insulin levels by automatically checking blood sugar every five minutes and dosing insulin at the appropriate levels when needed. Mealtime insulin doses are automatically calculated based on each patient's programmed insulin to carbohydrate ratio and the amount of carbohydrates that will be eaten.Image source: DexCom.Until now, DexCom's continuous glucose monitors (CGM) have been the biggest advance in type 1 diabetes treatment. The company's latest-generation CGM, the G5, automatically streams blood glucose levels to a patient's device or smartphone, and by charting blood sugar peaks and valleys, patients can better control their disease.The advantages of CGMs have been a boon to DexCom and its investors. The company's sales jumped 47% year over year and 18% quarter over quarter to $137 million in Q2.However, DexCom's rapid growth could come under pressure if Medtronic's G70 hits the ground running next spring. That's because the G70 uses Medtronic's own CGM and sensors, not DexCom's.Fortunately for DexCom, the risk posed by the G70 may not last long. Sales headwinds won't be felt until after the G70 launch early next year, and until the device wins EU approval, DexCom should be able to keep growing its international sales rapidly. DexCom's international revenue was $18 million in Q2, up 45% from a year ago.If the G70 launch does go off without a hitch, DexCom's type 1 market share will only take a hit in adults. Initially, the G70 is only approved for use in patients aged 14 and up. Most type 1 patients are adults, but roughly 200,000 patients are younger than 18, and ostensibly, many of those patients are younger than 14.DexCom could begin to win back any market share lost to the G70 in relatively short order if collaborations with Medtronic's competitors pan out. DexCom is sharing its technology with various insulin pump makers that are developing their own artificial pancreases, including  , Animas (a  company),  , and the privately-held  which was founded by Jeffrey Brewer, the former CEO of JDRF International, a global type 1 diabetes advocacy group.Insulet plans to begin clinical trials for its artificial pancreas this year, and it's eyeing potential commercialization in 2018; Tandem also hopes to begin clinical trials this year, and it's targeting a launch in late 2017; and Bigfoot biomedical just enrolled its first patient in a clinical trial.In addition to those high-profile relationships, DexCom has  with  's life sciences spin-off Verily on next-generation diabetes technology. Verily is amassing a team of leaders in diabetes research, and it recently hired Insulet's Howard Zissler, who helped spearhead Insulet's artificial pancreas program.Medtronic's first-to-market advantage might be short-lived, and the impact on DexCom's growth will depend a great deal on the official launch date of the G70 and how quickly DexCom's partners get their similar systems through the FDA.Assuming that its partners are successful in developing a competing product, I think that the artificial pancreas market could support multiple players -- and that's good news for DexCom, given its system agnostic approach. Forty thousand Americans are newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes annually, and up to 5 million Americans may be living with type 1 diabetes by 2050.Overall, the coming year could be one of transition in the type 1 treatment space, and that could mean that DexCom's shares experience more than their fair share of volatility. If that volatility includes a drop in the company's share price, then I'll be looking for a chance to buy for the long haul.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Let's call it a \"stealth rotation\" from bonds to stocks and from bond substitutes to less favored stocks. If the punditry carefully watches the data, they will be asking:Last week's news was pretty good, despite the negative reaction in stocks.In my last WTWA,  special attention to the early earnings reports and questions about whether the earnings recession was ending. That was a reasonable guess, although most of the commentary seemed to focus on a couple of big earnings misses.

I avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news - The political sideshow. There were polls to determine the \"winner\" of the debate. Not so long ago debates were seen as a way for the trailing candidate to show equality of stature - same stage, same rules, etc. Many challengers have used this effectively. It is also a way to demonstrate a \"Presidential\" image. If an expert from years ago, without any context, read the transcript of this \"town hall forum\" debate s/he would not believe it. Campaigns are ever-more focused on the undecided or uncommitted voters, especially in the key states. Suppose for a moment that these voters may not have been the ones sitting at the front of the class. What do we expect the campaigns to do? The sound bite negative ads are one approach, but this is reaching a whole new level - and not a high one.The most important thing you can do as an investor is to vote your conscience while still using sound, unemotional judgement concerning your personal finances.I occasionally give the Silver Bullet award to someone who takes up an unpopular or thankless cause, doing the real work to demonstrate the facts.

That goes both ways, with some stocks trading at nosebleed values while others are ridiculously cheap. This is certainly the case with these three stocks, which run the gamut from insanely expensive to surprisingly cheap:  (NASDAQ: DXCM) ,  (NYSE: GRUB) , and  (NYSE: WPZ) . data by  .While Dexcom is a stock that I've had on my radar for some time, the company's nosebleed valuation has always kept me on the sidelines. Even today I can't help but feel that shares are far too richly priced. Right now shares are trading for more than  , and that's after dropping nearly 20% from their recent high.Granted, sales have grown so quickly over the last few years that you could easily argue that the company has earned its premium valuation. Next year analysts are projecting that sales will grow by another 40%, so the prosperity is expected to continue.While I'm hopeful that the company can maintain its rapid growth rate, I do think that caution is warranted, given that  (NYSE: MDT) just got the green light from the FDA on the first  . If demand for Medtronic's device impacts DexCom's growth even slightly, then it is possible that shares could take a tumble.We won't know the answer to that question until Medtronic officially launches the product for sale next year. In the meantime, I think that Dexcom's crazy valuation provides ample reason to remain cautious. : Within the tech space, it's not too hard to find a company that seems to be asking a lot in terms of its valuation relative to its prospects. I believe that GrubHub is overvalued: The online food-delivery service currently trades at 8.9 times sales and 90.7 times earnings.While those valuation multiples aren't as high as those of other tech companies that deliver online services, they still suggest that investors are baking in hefty growth expectations. GrubHub's trailing twelve-month sales growth over the past year has been 34% -- solid but perhaps undeserving of such optimism. None of this is to say that the business is crumbling. Active diners in the second quarter rose 24% to 7.35 million, which helped gross food sales jump 29% to $733 million. Orders have hit all-time highs despite seasonal headwinds.My problem with GrubHub is the lack of a competitive advantage or differentiator. Sure, the company's app and service are easy to use and make ordering deliveries much more convenient, but an app is not an advantage; anyone can build an intuitive app. Merchants pay more to enjoy higher rankings in search results, but rivals can also potentially undercut GrubHub with lower fees. The current valuation prices in a much more resilient business that can withstand the test of time.Keep in mind that shares have traded as high as $48 and as low as $18 over the past two years, so volatility should be expected. Volatility and lofty valuation multiples go hand in hand, after all. Shares have recovered and are marching back toward highs, but investors will want to be on the lookout ahead of third-quarter earnings, which are expected on Oct. 26. When expectations are running high, so is the risk of disappointment. : I'm going to take the contrarian approach here and propose a company that looks expensive but is actually trading at a ridiculously cheap valuation. In the following chart, pipeline company Williams Partners appears to trade at a nosebleed valuation compared to its pipeline peers: data by  .However, that seemingly expensive valuation is largely the result of recording an impairment charge associated with its Canadian operations, which it recently sold. Adjusting for that charge, Williams Partners expects to generate $4.3 billion in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) this year. Given its approximately $44 billion enterprise value (EV), this implies a valuation of slightly more than 10 times EBITDA, which is well below its pipeline rivals.Further, Williams Partners has several fee-based expansion projects currently under construction that should boost its annual EBITDA by $630 million next year alone, pushing it up to a run rate of $5 billion. Those earnings imply a forward valuation of just 8.8 times EV-to-EBITDA. That's crazy cheap compared to its peers, and one reason why Williams Partners' parent company is  its stake.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

There are many better choices. The 20 multiple is pretty rich for the stodgy recent growth rate. 3% dividend is OK.

Sure, it may not be as exciting as the MLB Division series - but it sure is pretty. Here we've got steady, sustainable growth from a major name in the broader sector of 3D printing. What's not to like? The chart is very encouraging. Breakout coming?With a PE over 40, this might be breaking hearts rather than breaking out. This makes sense only as a speculation.  I am good at speculating.I am the rebounding specialist. Here is a \"fetching\" opportunity, DexCom (  ) hit an all-time high around $97 in September of 2015; sold off to a low of 53 before rebounding back to $95; this most recent selloff gives us a nice technical entry into this name looking for a run back to $95, with a stop around the 200d MA ($75.17).Do you know what it means when you look for the multiple on a stock and see \"NMF?\"  What's a multiple? It stands for \"not meaningful.\" You see it when a stock has no earnings. It is important for determining value. I get paid nicely for stock rebounds whether there are earnings or not.

Take on big risks. So goes the inescapable calculus of investing. With so many investors focused on safety and income these days, we decided to take a contrarian approach by looking for risky companies that have the potential to deliver big payoffs.We've identified eight risky stocks that we believe are worth the risk. Several of these companies, we feel, have the potential to be game-changers in their industries--the proverbial \"next Google.\" But in exchange for the possibility of a big payoff down the road, investors must be content forgoing profits for the time being (only one of our picks pays a dividend). Others on the list are already profitable and show great potential, but come with other unusual or notable risks. Consider stashing a small portion of your play money into each of these names, then ignoring them for a few years. Chances are not all will succeed. But the one or two (or more) winners on the list could win big.Symbol: Share price: $99.62Market capitalization: $246.3 billion52-week range: $57.20 - $104.30Annual sales: $17 billionEstimated earnings for the fiscal year ending March 2017: $3.28 per shareEstimated earnings for the fiscal year ending March 2018: $4.21 per sharePrice-earnings ratio: 29Year-to-date return: 23%What does the company do? Often called \"the eBay of China,\" Alibaba is the dominant online retailer in China. Alibaba's business model is slightly different than those of the U.S. companies it's often compared to, combining elements of eBay (  ), Amazon.com (  ) and PayPal (  ). Its websites are essentially large online marketplaces, linking buyers with sellers and earning fees from advertising and payment processing. But unlike eBay, it doesn't operate auctions, and unlike Amazon, it doesn't sell products itself.Why is the stock risky? \"It's risky because we don't know where China is going,\" says Benjamin Segal, manager of the Neuberger Berman International Equity Fund, which owns the stock. Economic growth in China has been slowing, the Shanghai Composite index has fallen more than 40% since June 2015, and economists have been warning of risks in the country's \"shadow banking\" sector, in which lightly regulated financial companies have been selling trillions of dollars in risky products.Why is it worth the risk? A slowing Chinese economy is still a growing Chinese economy. The country is gradually shifting to a consumer-driven economy from one in which investment spending--including government investments in infrastructure and spending by state-sponsored and private enterprises--has been the main driver of growth. That should spell more business for retailers. Moreover, China doesn't have the vast array of brick-and-mortar stores that the U.S. does, making newly minted members of the middle class more likely to turn to online shopping first. Alibaba's profits have grown almost tenfold in the past three years, and analysts expect them to increase by a still-brisk 28% annual pace over the next three to five years. \"In an economy that will, in time, be comparable to if not bigger than the U.S., here is eBay, PayPal and Amazon all wrapped into one,\" says Segal. Compared with, say, Amazon.com's P/E ratio of 101, Alibaba, trading at 29 times estimated year-ahead profits, looks cheap.SEE ALSO: Symbol: Share price: $120.12Market capitalization: $4.7 billion52-week range: $114.59 - $170.42Annual sales: $1 billionEstimated 2016 earnings: $1.77 per shareEstimated 2017 earnings: $2.23 per sharePrice-earnings ratio: 62Year-to-date return: -25%What does the company do? Athenahealth offers web-based health care software for physicians and hospitals. The software helps health care providers track and collect reimbursements from insurers, store patients' electronic health records, and coordinate overall office-management tasks. Athenahealth earns its money by charging a percentage of collections, which aligns its incentives with clients and often works out to be cheaper for users than alternative systems.Why is the stock risky? The company is barely profitable, and the health care sector is slow-moving and fraught with bureaucracy, meaning providers may be slow to adopt a new way of doing things. Its chief executive officer, Jonathan Bush (nephew to the 41st U.S. President and cousin to the 43rd), is considered controversial because of his tendency to divulge too much information about the inner workings and struggles of his company. And the stock is hardly cheap.Why is it worth the risk? Sure, health care companies are slow to adopt change, but the slow-moving, costly existing process of health care billing is ripe for a makeover, and Athenahealth's products are the most compelling on the market. Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Investment Management, says the company's strategy is reminiscent of that of Amazon.com--forgoing near-term profits in an effort to stake out a dominant market position. \"This could be a winner-take-most situation,\" says Wood. Investors will need to be patient with the stock, but Athenahealth could be worth the wait.See Also: Symbol: Share price: $53.43Market capitalization: $2.1 billion52-week range: $35.37 - $143.08Annual sales: Not meaningfulEstimated 2016 earnings: -$6.15 per shareEstimated 2017 earnings: -$6.52 per shareYear-to-date return: -17%What does the company do? Bluebird develops gene therapies, an up-and-coming medical treatment that entails introducing \"corrected\" genes into a patient's body, in order to treat or even cure a genetic condition. Bluebird is developing gene therapies to target certain types of genetically caused anemia: severe sickle cell disease and beta thalassemia. The company also has a gene therapy in the works to treat a rare nervous-system disorder and is in the early stages of developing immunotherapies for certain types of cancer.Why is the stock risky? All of Bluebird's products are still in clinical trials, so the company does not yet earn money from selling its products, let alone generate any profits. There's always the risk that the company burns through its cash before it brings any products to market.Why is it worth the risk? Bluebird's therapies have seen some inspiring results. Although the company's drug trials have thus far included relatively small numbers of people, in a few cases patients appear to have been cured of all symptoms of a life-threatening genetic condition with just one course of treatment. \"Bluebird's treatments have the potential to be life-changing,\" says Dennis Wassung, a portfolio manager with Cabot Wealth Management who owns the stock in separately managed accounts. Results haven't been uniformly perfect for any of Bluebird's therapies, but all three of its gene therapies hold promise.It's hard to come up with an appropriate price tag for such an early-stage company. But with the stock down 73% from its May 2015 peak of $197.35--because of some unexpected setbacks in trial results and also because of overall weakness among biotech stocks--investors might one day look back at the current share price and see a screaming buying opportunity.See Also: Symbol: Share price: $92.96Market capitalization: $7.7 billion52-week range: $47.92 - $103.29Annual sales: $490 millionEstimated 2016 earnings: -$0.57 per shareEstimated 2017 earnings: $0.26 per shareYear-to-date return: 14%What does the company do? Dexcom makes continuous glucose monitoring systems for patients with diabetes. An alternative to conventional finger-prick tests, Dexcom's products essentially provide moment-by-moment tracking of glucose levels, using a sensor that is inserted under the skin. The device automatically transmits data to a small, iPod-like instrument, which allows patients to watch trends on their blood sugar and receive alerts if their glucose levels enter dangerous territory.Why is the stock risky? Dexcom has yet to turn profitable, and it's not the only company offering this type of technology. Plus, the stock has already enjoyed a large run-up--soaring by more than 13 times since November 2011. On a price-to-sales basis, Dexcom trades at a \"meaningful premium\" to its peers, says Wassung.Why is it worth the risk? Dexcom leads competitors in terms of market share and accuracy of its products, so it deserves a premium valuation. Only 15% of patients with type-1 diabetes are using continuous glucose monitoring systems, Wassung says, so an enormous untapped opportunity set remains. \"Dexcom's technology has really just started to hit the mainstream market in the last few years, and is receiving a lot of support from the medical community,\" he adds. Analysts expect the company to turn profitable in the fourth quarter of 2016, earn $0.26 per share next year and $0.98 per share in 2018.Symbol: Share price: $96.70Market capitalization: $4.0 billion52-week range: $72.05 - $103.28Annual sales: $3.2 billionActual 2015 earnings: $4.74 per shareEstimated 2016 earnings: Not availableEstimated 2017 earnings: Not availableYear to date return: 10.8%What does the company do? Elbit Systems makes drones, technology systems for aircrafts, and intelligence-gathering and military communications systems. The company, which is based in Haifa, Israel, sells its products all over the world, with no one country or geographic area dominating its revenues.Why is the stock risky? Elbit is based in a tough and volatile neighborhood. Trade with Israel is vulnerable to shifting political winds. And although the shares trade on Nasdaq, Elbit's shares are not as liquid as a typical U.S. stock.Why is it worth the risk? Elbit's growth prospects are excellent thanks to its broad geographic diversification. For example, in the first half of 2016, sales to Europe increased by 31% compared with the same period in 2015, as European members of NATO boosted spending on their militaries because of concerns about Russia's expansionist aims. The company's high-tech focus should continue to give it an edge; it recently signed contracts for delivery of thermal-imaging observation systems and tactical communication systems. The company has a backlog of orders worth $6.8 billion, equivalent to more than two years of annual revenue. First-half profits of $106 million ($2.49 per share) were up 18% from the first six months of 2015. The stock has been on a tear, more than tripling since August 2012, but we think it still has room to run. Elbit is the only company on our list that pays a dividend. The stock yields 1.7%.See Also: Symbol: Share price: $23.48Market capitalization: $3.7 billion52-week range: $22.50 - $49.58Annual sales: $3.4 billionEstimated 2016 earnings: $1.83 per shareEstimated 2017 earnings: $2.14 per sharePrice-earnings ratio: 12Year-to-date return: -22%What does the company do? Known mainly for its sneakers, Skechers also makes other casual footwear, such as boots and sandalsWhy is the stock risky? Skechers' shoes haven't been, well, cool, in a long time. The brand's heyday was in the late '90s and early aughts, arguably peaking in 2001, when Brittany Spears appeared on the cover of  in a pair of Skechers (alongside a story proclaiming that the company might be the \"next Nike\"). Since then, sales have grown at a respectable 8.9% per year, but Skechers has made missteps in its quest to regain its former trendiness. In 2012, for example, the company settled charges with the Federal Trade Commission that its Shape Up shoes (endorsed by Kim Kardashian) would help wearers lose weight and tone their backsides. The stock has sunk 27% since July 21, when the company reported second-quarter results that came in below analysts' estimates.Why is it worth the risk? Skechers may never again be the hottest must-have shoe. Instead, the company has shifted its strategy to offering a lot of inexpensive versions of popular styles, aiming to capture a portion of market share in a variety of categories rather than focusing on a single trendy shoe. In 2015, Skechers surpassed Adidas to become the second-biggest seller of athletic footwear in the U.S., behind only Nike (  ).Sales and earnings have grown robustly in recent years. Sales rose an annualized 26% from 2012 through 2015, and profits skyrocketed from $10 million to $232 million. The streak came to a halt in the second quarter, with sales expanding by only 10% from the same period in 2015 and earnings actually slipping by 7%. However, much of the slowdown was due to onetime issues. Wassung says investors have been too hard on the stock in the past month and a half, and he sees a buying opportunity.Symbol: Share price: $194.47Market capitalization: $28.9 billion52-week range: $141.05 - $271.57Annual sales: $4.6 billionEstimated 2016 earnings: -$0.95 per shareEstimated 2017 earnings: $1.71 per sharePrice-earnings ratio: Not meaningfulYear-to-date return: -19%What does the company do? Tesla is best known for its sleek electric vehicles, and almost all of its revenues come from selling cars and related products and services. But the ambitions of Elon Musk, the company's enigmatic CEO, don't stop at high-end cars. Tesla is in the process of acquiring SolarCity (  ), a maker of solar panels, and Musk has said he wants Tesla to become a one-stop shop to help consumers power their households. He plans to accomplish this by selling panels along with efficient batteries for storing generated energy (because solar panels generate a lot of energy at certain times of day, and none at others).Why is the stock risky? Tesla has yet to turn a profit, although analysts expect it to earn money in the current quarter. And lofty expectations are already baked into the stock, which trades at 185 times estimated year-ahead earnings (profits are so low, the P/E isn't especially meaningful). Moreover, Tesla's proposed acquisition of SolarCity has been criticized as a bailout of the solar company, which came close to running out of cash this year and has been unable to persuade other potential suitors to invest. Tesla has itself reported in regulatory filings that it will need to issue additional stock or debt before the end of the year, in part to bankroll the merger.Why is it worth the risk? Few companies can truly lay claim to having the potential to change the world, but Tesla is one of them. Musk has said he expects the company to be producing 1 million electric vehicles per year by 2020, as Tesla works on making its factories more efficient. That would put its output at roughly one-seventh of the annual output of Ford Motor (  ). The company is also investing heavily in its battery technology, which has the potential to serve applications far beyond vehicles and solar-powered homes. \"Lots of investors don't like the fact that they can't hang their hat on certain quarterly numbers,\" says Wood, of ARK Investment Management, a firm that runs actively managed exchange-traded funds and owns the stock. \"We don't mind because we see the big picture.\"QUIZ: Symbol: Share price: $8.99Market capitalization: $326 million52-week range: $8.75 - $14.46Annual sales: $202 millionEstimated 2016 earnings: -$0.58 per shareEstimated 2017 earnings: -$0.31 per shareYear-to-date return: -34%What does the company do? TubeMogul develops self-service advertising software that allows advertisers and advertising agencies to directly purchase TV, online and mobile ad spots. Its business model represents a dramatic shift for the advertising industry. Print, online and broadcast ads have traditionally been bought and sold through a laborious and costly process of soliciting requests for proposals, with layers of middlemen taking cuts of deals.Why is the stock risky? The company is not yet profitable. Analysts, on average, don't expect it to make money until 2018, but it could remain in the red for longer than investors expect.Why is it worth the risk? \"Disruption\" is a buzzword that gets wildly overused in the world of start-ups, but TubeMogul's business model does seem to have the potential to be a game-changer for digital advertising. It's a cheaper model for advertisers and it allows them to, with a few clicks, target the exact demographic groups they want to reach on the exact mediums they want to use. And it provides up-to-the-moment analytics on whether an ad campaign is reaching the right people. Plus, the stock looks reasonable on the basis of its price-to-sales ratio. The shares sell at 1.7 times the past 12 months' sales, matching the price-to-sales ratio for industrial companies in Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.SEE ALSO: The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Image source: Dexcom, Inc. After a Food and Drug Administration advisory committee voted to support removing the need to confirm blood glucose measures determined by  's(NASDAQ: DXCM) continuous glucose monitors (CGM) with a finger stick, the company's stock rallied 15.9% last month, according to  . Dexcom's CGMs provide diabetics with real-time insight into blood glucose trends. However, up until now, charting of blood glucose had to be confirmed by results from a blood glucose monitor prior to patients taking action to restore their levels to their desired range.The committee's recommendation to remove that requirement for Dexcom's monitor could clear the way toward approval of the device by Medicare, opening up a significant patient population that up until now has struggled to afford the device.Despite reimbursement headwinds among some payers, demand for Dexcom's monitors and the consumables required to use them has been steadily accelerating. In Q2, revenue grew to $137.3 million, up 47% from the the same quarter in 2015.Due to investments in manufacturing, research, and sales and marketing, expenses increased in the past year, resulting in a GAAP net loss of $20.2 million, or $0.24 per share for the second quarter of 2016, compared to $3.7 million, or $0.05 per share for the same quarter in 2015. The net loss of $20.2 million for the second quarter of 2016 included $31.5 million in non-cash expenses, comprised primarily of share-based compensation, depreciation, and amortization. Dexcom's monitors are used primarily by type 1 diabetics and there are an estimated 500,000 people under age 14 living with type 1 diabetes. Since Dexcom's penetration of that patient pool is in the tens of thousands of patients, there could be a long runway still for future growth.During its second-quarter , management boosted the low end of its full-year sales guidance to $550 million from prior estimates of at least $540 million. The company has $115.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities and no meaningful debt, so there's plenty of financial flexibility available to roll out product updates and execute on next-generation improvements that could eventually open up CGM technology to the type 2 diabetes market.Overall, since the type 1 patient population is growing 3% annually and international expansion, plans are still in the early stages, I think this company is one of the most intriguing growth stocks targeting diabetes and that suggests its shares might be worth picking up in long-haul portfolios.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

We note that, the SmartGuard technology acts against low blood sugar and is the only system at present to reduce the frequency of night-time low episodes by one third.We believe this system will receive huge market acceptance taking into consideration the fact that up to 75% of severe hypoglycemia occurs during night time while patients are asleep.MiniMed 630G has a user-friendly design which enables personalized diabetes management and also provides advanced clinical performance. Apart from that, this system, unlike the other members of the MiniMed family uses the Contournext Link 2.4, the blood glucose meter of Ascensia Diabetes Care which claims to provide accurate blood glucose test results.We note that, with rapidly rising incidents of diabetes across the U.S., healthcare organizations are now focused on innovating technologies that will effectively help the nation's 29.1 million diabetics manage their health conditions.

The reimbursement approval is anticipated to benefit DexCom's top-line growth beginning 2017.Gross margin contracted 850 basis points (bps) year over year to 62.3%. The gross margin was affected chiefly by increased warranty expense as well as a write-down of excess and obsolete inventory of approximately $3.5 million related to the company's receiver recall.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses surged 53.3% on a year-over-year basis to $69.3 million. Research and development (R&D) expense also jumped 48.8% year over year to $36.3 million.

The company started voluntary recall (class II) of those affected receivers that were experiencing problems with audible alarms and alerts.After an inspection in late March, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classified the recall as Class I due to the extreme importance of alerts and alarms in a CGM system. Accordingly, DexCom issued a press release on Apr 11 and also posted the class I recall notice on its website.During the second quarter, DexCom received FDA approval for a more robust speaker for the current receiver. The company is in the process of planning the production of this newly configured receiver.DexCom also filed its next generation touchscreen receiver with the FDA during the quarter. The company also submitted for a firmware update on the transmitter and a software update for its mobile app that will enhance the performance and reliability of the G5 Mobile transmitter.While recently, the Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Toxicology Devices Panel of the FDA voted in favor of the proposed non-adjunctive indication for DexCom's G5 Mobile CGM system. This indication would designate the G5 Mobile CGM system as a replacement to finger-stick glucose testing for diabetes treatment decisions.DexCom had filed a pre-market approval (PMA) supplement with the FDA for this indication, for which the review by the advisory committee was conducted on Jul 21.DexCom launched its next-generation G5 Mobile CGM system in the U.S. and Europe in 2015.

As of 2012, 29 million people had diabetes, up from 26 million in 2010. The majority were type 2 diabetics, which means their disease, which is caused by the body's inability to use insulin properly to convert sugar into energy, develops over time. Type 2 diabetics and prediabetics are often encouraged to change their eating and exercise habits to slow the progression of their disease.A much smaller percentage of the population -- 1.25 million children and adults -- have what's known as type 1 diabetes. Those with type 1 diabetes have little to no insulin production from their pancreas, and as the Mayo Clinic notes, it's often caused by genetics or perhaps exposure to specific viruses. Type 1 diabetics also, according to a recent study in Australia between 1997-2003 and 2004-2010, have a life expectancy that's 12.2 years less than the general population.Image source: Getty Images.The overwhelming number of type 2 diabetes cases compared with type 1 often seems to overshadow the seriousness of type 1 diabetes, as well as the struggles and inconveniences type 1 diabetics face in constantly monitoring their blood sugar levels. Per Reuters, more than a third of type 1 diabetics are utilizing an insulin pump to help regulate their blood sugar.Life as a type 1 diabetic isn't easy. However, that could be about to change thanks to what could be described as the biggest breakthrough ever gaining clearance well ahead of schedule from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.As announced by medical device powerhouse  (NYSE: MDT) on Wednesday, the FDA has approved the company's \"artificial pancreas\" device known as the MiniMed 670G six months ahead of schedule.

With more than 60% of the reports already out, we are optimistic of this improving trend to continue through the season. Nevertheless, growth is still unlikely and the analysts are, by now, quite certain this will be the fifth straight quarter of an earnings decline for the S&P 500 index.As per our latest  report, around 317 S&P 500 members (73.5% of the index's total market capitalization) have released their results, and the scorecard shows 3.3% year-over-year decline in the index' Q2 earnings on 0.9% lower revenues. Medical, one of the 16 broader Zacks sectors, has however exhibited a promising performance so far. Earnings growth rate stood at 5.4% year over year on account of a 1.2% rise in revenues. For the remaining the season, earnings are expected to grow 3.4%, driven by impressive top-line growth expectation of 7.7% in this sector.Medical Instrument, a specialized sub-sector within the broader Medical sector, is showing a lot of potential as of now. This is impressive given the severe economic instability, fierce competition, and increasing cost related hazards leading to regulatory complexities. The success of the medical instrument industry comes on the back of successful execution of some top strategic priorities, which include R&D and product development; strategic M&A and alliances and a focus on emerging market expansion.Needless to say that factors like the recent exemption of the Medical Device Excise tax for the next two years has also come in as a much-needed breather for these Medical instrument stocks. We believe this exemption, albeit temporary, has boosted the positive sentiment in the medical device investment world, as most analysts believe it to be sufficient for companies to address pressing issues such as a lack of opportunity for R&D, innovation, pipeline development, and to make investments needed to accelerate patient and provider access to innovative health care products.Let's take a look at the Medical Instruments stocks slated to release their quarterly reports on Aug 2:Headquartered in Delaware NJ, IDEXX is a developer, manufacturer and distributer of products and services primarily for the companion animal veterinary, livestock and poultry along with water testing and dairy markets.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 12 different analyst targets contributing to that average for DexCom Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $56.75. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $112.00. The standard deviation is $13.704.But the whole reason to look at the  DXCM price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with DXCM crossing above that average target price of $91.31/share, investors in DXCM have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $91.31 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

The Dow finished with modest gains to set another all-time record high, but the broader S&P 500 fell from its high-water mark set yesterday. Investors were somewhat nervous after some negative quarterly financial reports from major U.S. companies threw cold water on what had been an auspicious start to earnings season, and uncertainties about the future direction of the global economy were enough to cause at least a short pause in stocks' record run. However, some stocks still managed to keep up their positive momentum, and  (NYSE: MTG) ,  (NASDAQ: DXCM) , and  (NASDAQ: FFIV) were among the best performers on the day.MGIC Investment rose 7% after the mortgage insurance specialist reported solid results in its second-quarter financial report. The mortgage insurer said that mortgage policy sales rose 10% during the quarter, but more importantly, costs of claims fell by roughly half. With the housing market having supported higher prices, fewer properties have left borrowers underwater on their mortgages, and that has helped reduce the need for MGIC to pay out on policies in the event of default. In addition, favorable data from the Commerce Department showed that new-home construction rose at a nearly 5% rate in June, which was faster than expected and pointed to the continued strength of the housing market. As long as the health of housing stays strong, MGIC will be in a position to work off potentially problematic policies and write new business that stands a better chance of avoiding future losses.Dexcom gained 6% as investors speculated about the chances that the company will approve a change in intended use of one of its medical products. The company issued a press release on Tuesday saying that the Food and Drug Administration had published briefing documents in advance of this Thursday's planned meeting of a panel of its Medical Devices Advisory Committee that concentrates on clinical chemistry and toxicology devices. Dexcom hopes that the panel will recommend approval of its premarket approval application supplement, with which it proposes to allow patients to use its G5 Mobile CGM System to make diabetes treatment decisions based on reported concentrations of glucose in interstitial fluid. Investors can expect further comments from Dexcom on Friday morning at a conference call to discuss what happens at the meeting, but investors are already excited about the potential for faster growth from the San Diego-based medical device maker.Finally, F5 Networks gained 4%. The networking specialist could be the latest reported target of private equity investors at Thoma Bravo, according to reports from the  .

One promising approach that could revolutionize treatment is the use of next-generation technology to track a diabetes patient's blood sugar levels and determine the proper dosage of diabetes medicine for them. For example,  (NASDAQ: DXCM) is using technology to create systems that allow patients and care givers to better chart their glucose levels so that they can more effectively manage their disease.In this clip from The Motley Fool's  podcast, analysts Kristine Harjes and Gaby Lapera are joined by Todd Campbell to talk about how medical devices like this are harnessing technology to improve outcomes in diabetes patients.A transcript follows the video.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

To be one of them,  .{%video%} One other element, too, investing in this space from a treatment perspective that I find intriguing, is in medical devices, because convenience is super important, as this is a chronic condition. Absolutely. That really helps people manage it. Devices help people manage their diabetes a lot better than they did before. There is a new, well, I guess, a new-ish class of device that can be inserted on the body, on the skin somewhere, and it continuously monitors your blood sugar, and will administer insulin depending on what your current blood sugar level is. These are called CGMs, continuous glucose monitors. The big company that's making them right now that I know is one of your favorites, Todd, to talk about is DexCom. Right. DexCom is making these continuous monitors that are allowing you to basically chart your blood sugar over time, which is amazing. Gaby, you brought up the fact that if you put on a shirt, you feel it at first. Then you don't feel it the rest of the day. Yes, you may be able to tell when you're out of sorts or when your blood sugar is off, but DexCom has found that 70% of the time, most diabetics are outside of their desired range in blood sugar. I think the analogy makes sense to be used here, too. You just don't know sometimes what you're getting in creeping up closer to those problem zones that that's actually happening. By charting the data, being able to keep better track of it in this way, then you can better control it. If you can better control it, maybe then you can delay the progression of the disease and delay things like cardiovascular events. Another point to make here is that this is becoming a pretty high-tech space, where you get companies that are coming in and want you to be able to see your continuous glucose levels on your iPhone, and to be able to send that to your doctors, send that to your parents, send that to the people that really matter.I had a conversation earlier this year with the CEO of a company called Livongo -- they're a privately held company. You might recognize the CEO's name, Glen Tullman. He's the former CEO of  .

What their goal here is to monitor chronic conditions remotely via a connected device. Then you can send the data to your doctors for analysis. You can share it with people that matter to you, as we were just mentioning. They also have a staff of coaches that's available for support and monitoring.This is a company that has a reach in general chronic conditions, but they started off just in diabetes, mostly because it's such a humongous disease. It really, really matters. Plus, 70% of people with diabetes that are 50 years or older have one or more other chronic diseases.You get companies that are coming into this space because they recognize that there's a huge unmet need.

Specifically, we're going to do a deep dive on the most costly disease in the United States on a per-person, per-year basis. I'm your host Kristine Harjes, and I'm joined today not just by our awesome healthcare contributor Todd Campbell but also a voice that will sound equally familiar to regular listeners. This is the host of  , Gaby Lapera. Welcome to the show, guys! Hi, how are you? Doing great. We're really excited to be talking with you today. For those who missed it, Gaby did an amazing show on Monday this week about mutual funds that I highly recommend everybody to check out. If you're used to Gaby's financial sector expertise, you might be scratching your head. Why is she here to do a deep dive on the healthcare sector? This episode has actually been a long time coming. Gaby has been prodding me to have her come on the show and talk for ages about diabetes. Gaby, can you share some of your background and why exactly you're so excited to do this show? I actually got my master's degree in anthropology, specifically biological anthropology. My thesis was on how the endocrine system and metabolism and physical activity all kind of played into each other and how we have a mismatch between our evolutionary environment and our modern environment. As a result, I did a lot of research on diabetes and insulin and leptin and glucagon and all these great hormones that we're going to get to talk about today. I'm just very enthusiastic about the topic because it's so, so interesting and it's so important to the country right now as a matter of public health. Speaking of just how important it is, Todd, can you kick us off with some numbers about the scope of this disease? Absolutely. It's a monster, if you will, of a disease. It affects hundreds of millions of people. It costs hundreds of billions of dollars annually to treat. It's a global problem. People are calling it an epidemic, if you will. There are forecasts out there among industry watchers suggesting that 200 million more people are going to end up being diagnosed with this disease through 2040. That means there will be 640-ish or something like that million people worldwide who are suffering with diabetes and therefore exposed to the risk of cardiovascular disease and some of the other diseases that can result from having diabetes for a lifetime, for a long time. It's really insane how these numbers have grown. There are 415 million people worldwide. That's roughly 9% of the world's population that have this disease and that's more than doubled since 2000. Todd, as you mentioned, this is expected to grow pretty substantially within the next 20 years or so. What's really interesting is that in 2012, at least in the U.S., the CDC estimated that around 30% of people who had diabetes weren't diagnosed with diabetes yet. That's insane. Right. The pre-diabetes population is massive. Seventy-nine million pre-diabetics just within the United States. This is a disease that has pretty serious health consequences, too. It's estimated that 5 million people will die from diabetes related diseases this year. Gaby, can you go into a little bit more depth on what exactly this disease is and what it does? Yeah, absolutely. Diabetes, in its most basic sense, is the body's inability to appropriately regulate its blood sugar levels. This is called glucose homeostasis. Homeo meaning inside, and stasis meaning the same. You want to maintain a fairly even blood sugar level, because if you have too much, that's called hyperglycemia, and you end up with a whole host of issues, but basically the end result is death, unfortunately. Then the other side of that is if you have too little blood sugar, then you have hypoglycemia. That also ends in... death. It's really, really important that your body get this right.Fortunately, our body is a little bit better at tolerating hyperglycemia than hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia, that lack of blood sugar, that results in death a lot faster, unfortunately, just because your body really needs sugar in order to run everything like muscles and heart and brain and all that good stuff. Hyperglycemia is tolerated for a little bit longer but not indefinitely. That's when you see diabetes, when you have this prolonged instances of hyperglycemia. You hear about glycemia and you think glucose. You hear a lot about insulin. What is the relationship there? There are two major hormones that are involved in helping regulate your blood sugar. The first is insulin and the other one is glucagon. These guys are involved in this intricate dance that help with the regulation. Now, glucagon's main job is to make sure that there is plenty of blood sugar or plenty of sugar in your blood, so that your body can do things. Your body uses sugar to make energy, basically. Your body needs that in order to move your muscles, and have your heartbeat, and your brain work. You want some sugar in your blood. Insulin comes in and helps the body take away sugar from the blood. It does that by transporting sugar into the liver and muscles where it can be stored or into fatty tissue is the other option for it. That's a really important process as well. That suggests that a mechanism for treating this could be to directly reduce your levels of glucagon. In fact, that is exactly what a classic drug called the GLP-1 agonists do. These are drugs like Novo Nordisk's Victoza. These are surprisingly very effective, despite there being lots of other ways to go about tackling this disease. Is this the best way? How do these work? What should we look for in these drugs? I can speak to how they work. GLP-1, if you want to look it up on the Internet, it's GLP-1. It stands for glucagon-like peptide-1 because there's also a 2. Glucagon-like peptide-1 is a hormone that's actually naturally secreted by your body, by your gut. When food hits your gut, your body starts secreting GLP-1. The GLP-1 basically preps your body for receiving a big rush of sugar. That way, it can start releasing insulin from the pancreas earlier. Now, this exogenous... Exogenous means a medication or a hormone that comes outside the body. It's not one that your body naturally produces. This exogenous GLP-1, which is the drugs that Kristine is talking about, works in the exact same way.It's really interesting, because GLP-1 has been shown to, obviously, start the pancreas secreting insulin, but it also looks like it increases insulin sensitivity in the alpha cells of the pancreas, which are the ones that are responsible for producing glucagon. That means the pancreas is more sensitive to changes in blood sugar levels. It also increases sensitivity in the beta cells. Not only that, this is really wild and I don't know if they've proven this in humans yet, but it looks like GLP-1 increases the mass of the beta cells in the pancreas, which are the ones responsible for producing insulin. That means that they get bigger and that means they are... It also increases the expression of insulin. More insulin is being produced. The post-translational modification, so turning it into insulin is also increased, and the secretion of insulin is also increased. GLP-1 is working through all these different methods. Then on top of that... This is so cool. It's amazing! I love your enthusiasm, by the way. Good. GLP-1 also looks like it decreases glucagon in the body, which makes sense. Not only that, this the most mind-blowing part of GLP-1, is it also has effects on the brain. It looks like it also decreases hunger. This is huge for people with type 2 diabetes. That's something we haven't talked about yet is the relationship between obesity and diabetes, which is absolutely a factor here. They are definitely comorbidities. Just to back up a little bit, in case you don't know, there are two types... Well, there's three types of diabetes technically. The third is gestational diabetes, and we're not going to talk about that today. The type 1 and type 2 diabetes are the ones that are most widely known. Type 1 diabetes used to be called juvenile diabetes or early-onset diabetes, because it would typically start happening in kids when they are young. We're pretty sure that it's an autoimmune response, and it's T-cells attacking these beta cells in the pancreas, the ones that are responsible for producing the insulin. These people are left with little to no ability to produce insulin. They must receive all of their insulin exogenously.Then type 2 diabetes is a type of diabetes that you can basically give to yourself. It's kind of a mix between both not being able to produce enough insulin and becoming insulin resistant. Insulin resistance basically means that the receptors on your cells can't hear the signal of insulin anymore. A good way to think about this is, for example, when you got dressed this morning, you put on your shirt. You maybe felt your shirt for like the first couple of minutes and then until I brought it up again, you weren't thinking about how the shirt felt on your body. The same thing happens to your cells. They basically become exhausted from hearing the signals. They just block it out. This happens when there's too much insulin in the blood all the time from having really high blood sugar levels. With type 2 diabetics, it's a mix. It can be more of the insulin resistance and less of the inability to produce insulin or the other way around. For context, 90 to 95% of diabetics are type 2. That's by far the most common of them. Absolutely. Bringing it back around to these GLP-1 agonists. Todd, can you help us understand here what the market looks like for these drugs? Absolutely. The market for medicine in treating diabetes is big. You're talking about massive patient population. Historically speaking, diet and exercise are your first weapons against the disease. Then you get moved on to some tablets. Metformin is commonly used. Then you can be prescribed a number of other things including injectable insulins. Insulin itself, for example, is a $17 billion a year market. Just in selling injectable insulin, you're talking about $17 billion.As we said previously, the GLP-1 drugs are incredibly interesting because they may have a lot of benefits on outcomes. That's so important in treating this disease. If you're able to reduce the number of cardiovascular events, then you're saving people's lives. GLP-1 drugs may be able to do that. Of the GLP-1 drugs that are on the market, the granddaddy or the one that jumps out is Victoza, which is Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 drug.I think from an investor's standpoint, looking at the different players that are involved in treating diabetes is important. Novo Nordisk is probably the largest, we'll call it \"purist play.\" They do have some other drugs in hemophilia. For the most part, the vast majority of the revenue comes from diabetes drugs like Victoza, like NovoLog, other injectable insulins that they sell. Eli Lilly has got drugs out there that treat diabetes.  (NYSE: JNJ) sells a drug called Invokana, that's a billion-dollar drug. For investors looking to have exposure to diabetes treatment, Novo Nordisk would be the one that I think that they should spend the most of their time researching. You mentioned the cardiovascular outcomes. We actually just heard earlier this week from Novo about Victoza, that they were able to cut cardiovascular risk by 13% in a long-term outcome study. This was the first of the GLP-1s to demonstrate this sort of benefit. It's known to not be a classwide benefit which is really interesting, because we hear also about a totally different class of drugs to treat diabetes called the SGLT2 inhibitors. These drugs have a totally different mechanism that I will soon ask Gaby to explain. There is some speculation with these drugs that are newer that they could have a classwide cardiovascular benefit. See, that's really interesting. SGLT2, to begin with, stands for sodium/glucose cotransporter 2. It's a transporter protein that's dependent on sodium to basically ferry glucose wherever it's going. These guys are in the kidneys. What happens is that if you block the SGLT2, these are SGLT2 inhibitors so you inhibit their function, that means that they're not letting the glucose that's coming through the kidneys go back into the bloodstream. Basically, you're going to urinate most of your excess glucose out, which is a lot safer than having it build up in your bloodstream and do bad things. These are used alongside Metformin and insulin just to improve your control over your glucose. Right. It's Johnson & Johnson that makes the best-selling of that SGLT2 drug. That's Invokana, the one that has a $1.3 billion run rate today. I think a large part of that is they were the first to market with this sort of drug. It's already been on the market for about a year and a half. That's not even true. They've actually been on the market for almost three years. They beat everybody else to market by a year and a half. It is by far the best-selling of this class. You also have a couple of competitors. You have  with Farxiga. I might be saying that wrong as usual with these drug names. That's the second most popular in this class.The one I think is really interesting, particularly because we're talking about these cardiovascular outcomes is Eli Lilly's Jardiance, which somewhat recently they announced that it actually did have great outcomes in this long-term trial. The other two that we mentioned, Farxiga and Invokana, we're not going to have long-term data on their cardiovascular outcomes until 2019. It's perceived that this could be a classwide effect, but we don't know for sure yet. It's going to be really interesting to see how the doctors react to that news, if they're going to assume that it's a classwide effect and continue to prescribe Invokana instead of Jardiance or not. Jardiance's sales kind of trickle compared to these other drugs. I think they did about $38 million in sales last quarter. It will be interesting to watch and see how that plays out among prescribers. In case you're wondering why we're all so obsessed with the cardiovascular effects of these drugs, it's because when you have diabetes, your risk of dying from cardiovascular disease is conservatively doubled, I believe. Don't quote me on that number but it is increased by a lot. Anything that reduces that chance is huge. The majority of deaths that are caused by diabetes are caused by cardiovascular issues. It means microvascular stuff that gets affected, so that makes a lot of sense. Yup, that is insane. We've talked about a couple of different classes within the treatment space. One other element, too, investing in this space from a treatment perspective that I find intriguing, is in medical devices, because convenience is super important as this is a chronic condition. Absolutely. That really helps people manage it. Devices help people manage their diabetes a lot better than they did before. There is a new, well, I guess, a new-ish class of device that can be inserted on the body, on the skin somewhere, and it continuously monitors your blood sugar, and will administer insulin depending on what your current blood sugar level is. These are called CGMs, continuous glucose monitors. The big company that's making them right now that I know is one of your favorites, Todd, to talk about is DexCom. Right. DexCom is making these continuous monitors that are allowing you to basically chart your blood sugar over time, which is amazing. Gaby, you brought up the fact that if you put on a shirt, you feel it at first. Then you don't feel it the rest of the day. Yes, you may be able to tell when you're out of sorts or when your blood sugar is off, but DexCom has found that 70% of the time most diabetics are outside of their desired range in blood sugar. I think the analogy makes sense to be used here, too. You just don't know sometimes what you're getting in creeping up closer to those problem zones that that's actually happening. By charting the data, being able to keep better track of it in this way, then you can better control it. If you can better control it, maybe then you can delay the progression of the disease and delay things like cardiovascular events. Another point to make here is that this is becoming a pretty hi-tech space, where you get companies that are coming in and want you to be able to see your continuous glucose levels on your iPhone and to be able to send that to your doctors, send that to your parents, send that to the people that really matter.I had a conversation earlier this year with the CEO of a company called Livongo, which they're a privately held company. You might recognize the CEO's name, Glen Tullman. He's the former CEO of  . Anyway, this is also mentioned in a March interview that I did with MuleSoft, for those of you who have been listening to the podcast for a couple of months now or longer.Anyhow, Livongo is making a... What their goal here is to monitor chronic conditions remotely via a connected device. Then you can send the data to your doctors for analysis. You can share it with people that matter to you, as we were just mentioning. They also have a staff of coaches that's available for support and monitoring.This is a company that has a reach in general chronic conditions, but they started off just in diabetes, mostly because it's such a humongous disease. It really, really matters. Plus, 70% of people with diabetes that are 50 years or older have one or more other chronic diseases.You get companies that are coming into this space because they recognize that there's a huge unmet need. They're really changing the way that we treat this disease and the lives of the people that have to manage it every single day, which leads me to my final question of the day which is: what's coming next? What do you guys see coming up for the diabetes space in the next, say, 10 years or so? Will this disease be more prevalent or less prevalent? It's going to be more prevalent in my opinion. I think that from a treatment standpoint, you just touched on it. People are going to take a more holistic view of watching, tracking and treating this disease. That's going to mean that you're going to have a convergence between the medical devices such as monitors, the insulin pumps that are used with them, and the medicine that can be used to treat them. I think you're going to see a much more integrated approach. I think you're also going to see some advances in the way drugs are dosed.Injections have been the standard for insulin in some of these other medications. Companies like Novo Nordisk have fairly advanced clinical trials going on to make oral tablet formations of these that could really reduce patient burden. If they're able to do that, then you could see combination therapies. Now you don't have to take a separate insulin from a separate GLP-1 from a separate whatever. You can take one pill that combines all three. I totally agree with Todd that the incidents of diabetes is going to increase mostly because I think that the global incidents of obesity is going to increase. Since those diseases are so highly linked, and that's a controversial thing calling obesity a disease, but since those two conditions are so highly linked, especially in developing nations, I think that you're going to see an increase in diabetes.What I think would be really interesting to come out in the next two years, they started doing experiments in this, is looking at a way of mediating the autoimmune response that causes type 1 diabetes, so somehow inhibiting the T-cell response that is causing the destruction of the beta cells in the pancreas that lead to type 1 diabetes. I don't know if that's going to happen in the next 10 years, but they started doing the science for it, which is really exciting. That's a start. Yeah, that is fascinating. This has been a really, really interesting discussion today. Thank you both so much for being here!

Those that jumped on the  bandwagon at a time when Blockbuster was the big kid on the block made a boatload of money. Heck, those of us that scoffed at the idea people would pay $5.95 for a coffee on their way to work every morning missed out on  , one of the best investments over the past two decades.However, all of those investments came with equally large risks -- risks that aren't for everyone, especially retirees. For reasons you are about to learn, Blue Buffalo Pet Products(NASDAQ: BUFF) ,  (NASDAQ: DXCM) , and  (NYSE: YELP) each fit the bill for such a stock, but are they right for you? Let's dig in.Image source: Blue Buffalo's corporate website. One company I find intriguing, but likely has too many question marks for retirees, is  (NASDAQ: BUFF) . There's a wave of health-conscious consumers out there spending money, and many of them have pets they spoil rotten.Blue Buffalo is the fastest-growing major pet food company in the U.S. and makes its money selling dog and cat food made with high-quality, natural ingredients. It's a billion-dollar brand based on sales and is the market leader in the wholesome natural market segment.Blue Buffalo recently announced its first-quarter results, reporting that net sales rose 12.5% and net income jumped 24.3%. In terms of future growth, there should be plenty. A rising tide of health-conscious and animal-loving consumers is likely to lift the wholesome natural pet food segment as a whole, and as Blue Buffalo only owns 6% of the overall pet food industry and feeds only 2% to 3% of pets in the U.S., there should be a lot of room to grow.However, there are plenty of risks with such a young company. There will undoubtedly be intensifying competition as longtime brands create and distribute their own healthier version of products. While Blue Buffalo has thus far fought off competition from much larger companies, it remains a risk retirees probably shouldn't take with their investments.Another red flag for investors with Blue Buffalo is best modeled by a lawsuit from two years ago, when Nestle Purina Petcare claimed the company mislabeled products about including certain by-products. While that's since been settled, it's a risk buying into a company basing its business on providing wholesome and healthier pet food when it has previously misled consumers about what exactly is in the food.Image source: Dexcom. An estimated 29 million Americans have diabetes, a chronic disease that inhibits the body's ability to regulate blood glucose levels. In the U.S. alone, we spent about $245 billion in 2012 to treat diabetes, which is about 20% of our total spending on healthcare. That's a huge market, and any company that can create an innovative treatment option for patients with the disease is bound to prosper.That's one reason that I like  (NASDAQ: DXCM) , a fast-growing medical device company that is focused on diabetes. Dexcom sells a continuous glucose monitor, or CGM, that is worn on the body and gives patients an almost real-time look at their blood glucose levels, which enhances their ability to make therapeutic decisions.Dexcom's growth has been nothing short of astounding. Revenue is up more than 10 times since 2010, and the company is finally getting close to being profitable. Even still, Dexcom believes that it has only  of what is possible in the U.S., and when you add in the international opportunity, I think that its rapid growth will continue for years.So if everything is coming up roses for this company, why do I not like it for retirees? First, the company is competing head on against  , a deep-pocketed industry giant. Thus far Dexcom's more advanced technology has helped it run circles around Medtronic, but we shouldn't dismiss the latter's chances of catching up.Second,  is looking to enter the market soon, which is another potential competitive threat. I have my doubts about its chances of success, but if Abbott's offerings are well liked, it could potentially dent Dexcom's growth rates.Finally, Wall Street is well aware of Dexcom's growth prospects and has priced its shares accordingly. The stock trades for more than 11 times  , and that's after it has fallen over 40% over the past few months.Still, I think that Dexcom's lead is so big and that its opportunity is so massive that it's worth paying up to own shares, but I don't think this stock is a good choice for retirees. There's simply too much risk here. I highlighted  (NYSE: YELP) in a  article this past December. So with two more quarterly reports under its belt since then, I think now is the perfect opportunity to touch base and reiterate my view of the volatile local business review specialist as a stock I like -- just perhaps not as part of a retiree's portfolio.I previously expressed concerns that, as a fast-growing, yet-to-be-profitable business that doesn't  pay a dividend, Yelp \"tends to suffer significant volatility\" that could make it unappealing to investors working with shorter time frames. Sure enough, shares of Yelp have fallen 17% since that last roundtable, all but giving up the gains it had enjoyed following its solid third-quarter 2015 report one month earlier. For that, investors can largely thank the broader market's historically painful start to 2016 for pulling shares of Yelp down.But that's also not to say Yelp's actual business hasn't performed admirably over the same time period. When the market was at its worst in mid-February, Yelp shares at one point were trading more than 50% lower than when I called the company out in December. But shares have enjoyed a healthy rebound since then on the heels of Yelp's solid  and  reports in February and earlier this month, respectively. Following the latter, Yelp stock popped more than 20% in a single day after the company announced revenue jumped 33.8% year over year, to $158.6 million, driven by a 40% increase in local ad revenue, to $138.1 million.Yelp also raised its full-year guidance for both revenue (to a range of $685 million to $700 million), and adjusted EBITDA (to a range of $90 million to $105 million), and management reiterated their confidence the company enjoys a \"long runway\" for growth and will reach at least $1 billion in revenue by fiscal 2017. At the same time, Yelp remains unprofitable based on generally accepted accounting principles, and turned in a GAAP net loss of $22.2 million last quarter alone. Of course, it's not uncommon for businesses to consciously forsake near-term profitability in their quests for revenue growth and market share in the early stages. And that's especially crucial for businesses like Yelp, which face a constant barrage of competitive threats both large and small battling for the same local ad markets. But again, this often means enduring stomach-churning volatility. And with a lack of guaranteed capital coming back to shareholders in the form of dividends, in particular, I think Yelp would be most appropriate as a smaller speculative position, or for younger investors comfortable with risk and a longer-term time frame.

Research and development (R&D) expenses also increased 62.6% year over year to $32.2 million. Overall, operating expenses surged 59.3% year over year to $94.3 million.The higher expenses may be attributed to increased head count in the company's organization (including both field sales and internal sales support staff).

The company plans to spend a total of $40 million on these four initiatives through full-year 2016.DexCom reported an operating loss of $19.2 million as compared to an operating loss of $12.7 million in the year-ago quarter.On Feb 23, 2016, DexCom issued a customer notification in its website and certified mail to patients that alerted customers of a potential issue affecting the audible alarms and alerts associated with the speaker component of certain receivers. The company started voluntary recall (class II) of those affected receivers that were experiencing problems with audible alarms and alerts.After an inspection in late March, the FDA classified the recall as Class I due to the extreme importance of alerts and alarms in a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. Accordingly, DexCom issued a press release on Apr 11 and also posted the class I recall notice on its website.DexCom hopes to solve the issue by replacing the current speaker with a more efficient one and has already sought approval from the FDA. The company is also evaluating a software upgrade for the current receiver to systematically test its audio functionality on a regular basis.Depending on the timing of the FDA approval for these corrective measures, DexCom noted that it may need to write-off its currently stocked receiver inventory, which will cost approximately $5 million.DexCom launched its next-generation G5 Mobile CGM system in the U.S. and Europe in 2015. According to management, \"G5 Mobile system is the first and only CGM system approved by the FDA for both adults and children as young as two years of age that sends glucose data directly to a smartphone.\" The company plans to launch the Android version of the G5 Mobile later this year.DexCom also plans to submit and possibly launch an enhanced version of G5 Mobile app to provide additional features and functionality, such as insulin onboard data obtained from the company's pump partners in 2016. In this regard, the company noted that it expects to gain a FDA approval for the insulin dosing claim in the second half of 2016.With respect to Gen 6, DexCom expects to obtain IDE approval in the coming weeks and plans to commence a pivotal study in the late second quarter or early third quarter of 2016.For fiscal 2016, DexCom projects revenues in the range of $540 million to $565 million, reflecting growth of approximately 35% to 40% from 2015. The company expects 55%--60% of these revenues to be generated in the second half of the year.DexCom noted that gross margin will be impacted slightly in 2016 by higher costs related to manufacturing capacity expansion project.

However, the maker of medical devices that help diabetics better track their blood sugar has only begun to penetrate a big and growing market. Can DexCom expand itself from a niche maker of products for type 1 diabetes into a much larger company, or is this as good as it gets? Diabetics with type 1 disease have been using finger sticks to manage their blood sugar levels for decades, but according to DexCom, that approach isn't nearly as effective as it may seem.Despite patients being well educated on the risks associated with being out of their desired ranges, the average person with diabetes is outside of their target blood glucose range 70% of the time.Because blood sugar highs and lows can lead to diabetes progressing to a point where it can cause heart disease and other life-threatening complications, innovating new strategies that allow patients to more accurately track and manage their blood sugar levels is critical.Image source: Dexcom, Inc. Rather than evaluating blood glucose levels via random finger sticks, DexCom has developed a blood glucose monitor that uses sensors to continuously track and report levels to patients.Because DexCom's devices provide a level of clarity that has previously been lacking, increasing use by patients eager to chart their levels has led to increasingly larger sales of monitors and the disposable sensors necessary to use them.Although payer reimbursement headwinds have limited the adoption to type 1 patients and out-of-pocket purchasers, DexCom reports that sales still increased 60% to $116.2 million in the first quarter. That performance comes on top of a 55% increase in sales to $402 million last year.That growth is impressive, but it may just be the beginning. An estimated 500,000 people under age 14 are living with type 1 diabetes, and the number of people with type 1 is growing 3% annually. Since DexCom's penetration is measured in the tens of thousands of patients, it's arguably only scratching the surface of its addressable market. DexCom's weakest quarter has historically been the first quarter, and according to management, this year's results were in line with its expectations. As such, the C-suite reiterated prior guidance for revenue of at least $540 million this year.If the company can hit that target, it should help put DexCom on the path to profitability. However, headwinds that could delay profitability include an increase in investments to boost capacity and spending related to R&D. For example, the company inked a collaboration deal with Verily last year to develop next-generation, smaller, and less-burdensome sensors and transmitters.Technological innovation that improves the patient's experience will help drive customer retention and, thus, sensor sales, especially as the installed base of devices grows. However, an even bigger impact on future revenue could come from a labeling change to DexCom's devices by the FDA.As it stands today, a confirmatory finger stick is required by the label. However, DexCom believes it has a good shot at removing that requirement, and the FDA has agreed to put the matter in front of an advisory committee in July. Assuming the advisory committee agrees with the company, an eventual label change could clear the way to Medicare reimbursement. That would be a big win, because a significant number of elderly diabetics forego buying the device because of its cost.Additionally, the majority of DexCom's sales are generated within the U.S., and efforts to win reimbursement in other major markets overseas, such as Germany and France, are progressing. If those markets open up, international sales could climb far beyond their current $19 million.Overall, DexCom's sales pace demonstrates that its products resonate with consumers, and the more global payers that sign on to reimburse its products, the better it will be for investors.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

While it's tough to predict a 1,000% gainer,  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) all have the right ingredients to become 10-baggers in the next several years.The trick to catching a 10-bagger is to seek out rapid growth, a large potential market and a company with room for expansion. In the restaurant business, ZOES has all the important 10-bagger ingredients. ZOES now has 170 locations in 18 states, but it added 34 stores in 2015 alone, upping its total by more than 25%. The company plans on opening another 36 locations in 2016. Fast casual rivals like  (  ) and  (  ) already have in the neighborhood of 2,000 locations each, so there's  of room for ZOES to expand its U.S. presence.ZOES market cap is currently just $712 million, but the company has increased its sales by an average annual rate of 47.6% in the past five years, according to Finviz. In the most recent quarter, revenue jumped 31.7%.Looking ahead, EPS is expected to grow 39.8% annually through 2021. Thankfully, not all this growth is coming from opening new restaurants. ZOES reported a 7.7% increase in comparable restaurant sales in Q4 and witnessed a 2.8% increase in traffic.If ZOES keeps on this growth track, it could easily follow in CMG or PNRA's footsteps in the next decade.Medical device company DXCM is aggressively targeting one of the largest and most rapidly growing medical markets in the world: the diabetes market. DXCM's continuous glucose monitor sales skyrocketed 54% in 2015. DXCM is averaging 52.6% annual sales growth in the past five years and it projected to deliver annual EPS growth of 32.5% in the next five years.The company is aggressively pursuing growth, including plans for a new factory, a higher R&D budget and expansion into Europe in 2016. DXCM also made sure to be well-positioned as one of the first apps available on the  (  ) Watch when it began shipping in 2015.Despite the major headway the company has made and its prime diabetes market positioning, DXCM's market cap is still only $5.4 billion, and its customer base only represents a tiny fraction of the addressable . If DXCM continues to execute its rapid growth strategy, early buyers could soon be enjoying a 10-bagger.With a share price of around $140, a fair amount of media/analyst coverage and a market cap of $12.4 billion, PANW may seem like an unlikely 10-bagger from here. However, the cybersecurity market is huge and getting bigger every day, and Palo Alto is well-positioned as a market leader and has all the growth signals that investors look for in a big gainer. The company recorded staggering annual sales growth of 80.3% over the past five years and is expected to grow earnings by 43.6% annually in the five years ahead. Perhaps most importantly, the company reports that, while PANW currently only maintains about a 7% market share in the Internet security market, it is capturing about 43% of the market growth.This prime positioning is one of the reasons Bernstein declared PANW \"the most likely winner of the infrastructure security race\" in March and sees about  in the next year alone. If PANW continues to dominate the cybersecurity business, patient shareholders could see a lot more than 30% upside in coming years.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["mage source: Dexcom.The Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention estimates that more than 29 million Americans have diabetes, a chronic disease that inhibits the body's ability to produce or effectively utilize insulin. Patients with diabetes often have difficulty regulating the amount of glucose in their blood, which can lead to a variety of adverse health outcomes.Treating diabetes is both complicated and costly. The American Diabetes Association estimates that we spent $245 billion to treat diabetes in 2012 alone, which was roughly one out of every five dollars spent on healthcare.One of the most interesting diabetes-treatment technologies that has emerged in recent years is the continuous glucose monitor, or CGM. These devices are worn on the body and constantly monitor blood glucose levels, which gives patients and providers data that they need to make therapeutic decisions. (NASDAQ: DXCM), a mid-cap company that has been growing like a weed for more than a decade, is a leader in the CGM space. The company has been a  for investors, up more than fourfold since it came public and smashing the returns of the market in general.I recently sat down with Kevin Sayer, the CEO of Dexcom, to discuss where his company is today and what kind of innovations are possible in the years ahead.Following is an edited transcript of our conversation. If you could just quickly update us on some of your recent results. You said on the call, revenue up 10 times from 2010. You guys were GAAP profitable for the, I think, second time ever -- Second time ever. : -- during the quarter. Congratulations on that. You have, what, 140,000-plus patients, something like that, around the world you estimated, and for 2016, you're forecasting 35% growth? : 35% to 40%. : That's phenomenal. : A revenue range of $540 million to $565 million. : Obviously, the business is really firing on all cylinders, and personally, I've been incredibly impressed with how fast you've grown. A couple of years ago, I remember, I believe it was Terry [Gregg, Dexcom's previous CEO] who said you guys set an internal target of something like 40% annualized growth for the company. I kind of chuckled to myself, like, \"Well, all right.\" : That's still what we do, because if you grow 40% every year, you double every two years. That's how we look at it. Those 40%s, 40% of $400 million is a lot more than 40% of $250 [million] was last year, so those targets get big, but we're still so under-penetrated, even in our U.S. core market, and there's plenty of space for growth there. With the cadence of new products we have coming out combined with the cadence of products we've launched the past couple years, we'll address different patient needs, which will enable us to expand and, we believe, keep that up. : All right. That's great. Your most recent offering is called the G5 with Share? : G5 Mobile with Share. In fact, I'm wearing a sensor today. I don't know if you've seen this, but that is what a patient experiences with the G5 app.The G5 system, for example, that's the glucose value. You can see I don't move much. Here's an interesting thing you'll appreciate. This is the first medical device ever without a printed user guide. It's all right there available at your fingertips on the phone. If you have a problem, you want to call Dexcom, you touch that, you touch that, you hit \"call,\" and you've got them on the phone. : That's nice. : This makes the interaction for somebody with diabetes and the device very similar to what they have in the rest of their life, and it makes it much easier. It'll just get better and better and better as we learn.We're only on iPhone now. We will file the Android app in the first half of this year and hopefully get it approved toward the end of the year. Then, the Follow app, to be able to follow people, is available on Android and on Apple. : That's just through the cloud, correct? : That's through the cloud. Again, with this app, the data transmits to the cloud. If I turn it on, that symbol here, the triangle, is the Share app. I'm not sharing my data with anybody right now, but that's a multicolor triangle. Then, you pick up to five people you share your data with. Then, those followers and the app for the people that follow you is called Follow. They set their own alert alarm settings. For example, if you're a parent and you want to follow your kid, rather than setting the alert every time they go below 70, you can say, if they go below 70 for an hour.What's been interesting about Share is the psychological dynamic we created among families, because parents are always worried about their kids with diabetes, and some parents have been very, \"OK, I've got Share. I can know. This is good. It gives me comfort.\" Others have become micromanagers, and so kids have to make rules. My cousin's daughter has type 1 diabetes, and she's on the Dexcom system, and I got them on the Share system. When I talked to her after she got it, I said, \"So, do you let your dad follow you?\" \"Yeah.\" Her grandparents, or my aunt and uncle, I said, \"How about your grandparents?\" She said, \"Noooo.\"Her mom's a math teacher, and her mom's more numbers-driven than my cousin is. They're divorced. \"Do you let your mom follow you?\" \"Working on that one.\" It is a different dynamic, and for kids at school, at college in particular, they'll just turn the parents off for the weekend, and then the parents go, \"What's going on here?\" Married couples, the married couples have to have rules. \"You can't bug me. You could do\" -- it's a dynamic that we thought might happen but we really weren't prepared for. The anecdotal conversation's really fun, but what a valuable tool. : Sure. Obviously, you still have to calibrate the system. Can you do that right on the app? : Twice a day. That feature right there, you just enter your blood glucose value right there as it's showed. I hit the meter. Since I don't have diabetes, I'll just enter what I was going, and there it is. The calibration's factored in. You enter it right there. : OK. That's great. : Just so much easier. : That obviously creates a unique option for, say, providers. Do you guys allow providers to follow their patients as well? : We allow five followers for every patient, and providers can follow if the patients want them to and invite them to. It raises a very interesting question. Having been around diabetes yourself, there is a very divided feeling among endocrinologists, \"Do I every want to see all that data real-time?\" : That's my next question. : There are a few physicians who follow patients when they start them up on CGM. There are others I've talked to who, they don't want to be that involved in their patients' lives. They more want to teach them how to run their lives rather than get involved. It's a mix across the board. : ... because it could open up some potential legal issues. : Liability. Yeah. : Absolutely. Especially for, say, a small endocrinology practice that has one provider versus a big office that has multiple staff and can do it. : Absolutely. : Technologically, it's there ... : It's open for the patient and the care provider to decide what they want to do. : OK, that's great. That's really exciting. Obviously, it's a big hit. This product was also launched worldwide? : It was launched in our five biggest countries in Europe, yes. We launched them both at the same time. : OK. What do payers think of this? You guys have obviously had a lot of success with payers in the U.S. I know that you're still having some problems with international. : You know what? Internationally, we've achieved a good level of reimbursement in Sweden, and our business more than doubled in that geography last year, so it has been great where we have reimbursement. We're working hard on Germany, France, and the U.K., and we'd like to see something happen certainly over the next 12 months in a couple of those countries.The other places, there's some limited reimbursement in the Netherlands. There is reimbursement in Switzerland, but it's country to country, and it's one by one. They may pay for it differently and may put different restrictions around CGM. It's tough to manage. That's why we are expanding and setting up a European headquarters. : Scotland, correct? : Yeah, Scotland's going to be our choice of our headquarters. Then, we'll add bodies in some of these other countries because we really need more people on the street to hear what's going on. We can't let people determine the fate of our product without us really being involved. While our distributors have been great, we've grown our international business as fast as our U.S., and we have maybe four or five international employees total. The distributors have done a great job, but we need feet on the street for clinical studies, for reimbursement, for stuff like that so we can be involved in the process and know what's going on. : For educating providers, providing clinical support, all those kind of things that are obviously super-critical to getting the product off the ground. : We just need to do a little more. That's why we're going to do that overseas. : How is reimbursement in the U.S. going? I know that you guys enjoyed pretty wide -- : We're covered by 98% of private pay and about 15 states for Medicaid now. : Fifteen? : Fifteen, yeah. Medicare, we're working on, and we can talk more about that later if you'd like. I would say with the payers, the coverage is, by and large, good. It goes in cycles. For some period of time, one payer would we real good, and another one would give you trouble. Anytime you bill insurance directly, that's what you're going to deal with.We very publicly stated our goal is to move CGM to the pharmacy because we think it'll be much easier for a patient to go to the drugstore, order their CGM supplies, and pick them up there if they're in stock or have them delivered the next day, and have that be the reorder process. If you have any prescriptions at a pharmacy, you don't ever get the opportunity not to reorder. It just happens.We think that would be a much better reimbursement model for our patients. We've got several of the payers to flip to pharmacy benefit, but it's been slower than we'd like. We've talked about on some of our previous earnings calls there's inconsistent interpretation of pre-authorization policies. For example, one geography will say, \"OK, we don't need to do anything, and we'll approve this.\" Others will apply them strictly. It's really a question of time and training, but over time, that's where CGM needs to be purchased. People need to go be able to just pick it up. : Sure. From a cost perspective, obviously it's a higher direct cost, but one would think that given that CGM does change the patient's behavior, hopefully it prevents the highs, it prevents the lows, and you could eventually show that there's a cost savings in the long term to getting them on CGM? : That's a great point. Cost-benefit over time in our industry's going to be extremely important. The drug companies are all facing that now as you read everything going on at all the diabetes drug companies. The cost-benefit equation in the U.S. is relatively simple if you just look at hypoglycemia. If it costs X dollars a year, and let's say a patient spends between $2,500 and $5,000 a year, depending upon what equipment they buy and how long they wear their sensors, but for full-time use, if you avoid one serious hypoglycemic event and one hospitalization, that's $15,000 to $20,000.We can justify on hypoglycemia spending alone, pretty much cost justify that in the U.S. That's tougher in Europe, where hospitalization doesn't cost near as much money, but over time, the health benefits of staying within a tighter range I think will prove to have an excellent cost-benefit as well.We've got a study going on in Europe now with the Swedish investigator where he's run patients for a long time on CGM where we'll get some longer-term healthcare benefit data that should be useful for reimbursement in Europe. We've got a study going on in the U.S. that we call the Diamond Study, where we're taking 200 patients, and they're multiple-daily injection patients, putting them on CGM and comparing them to another 200-patient cohort and comparing everything about those patients for a six-month period. We'll publish the first data on that study in the second half of the year, but that'll be a series of publications over a year because there's smaller groups within the study, and it will take a while to finish it all, but we believe we can document the utility of CGM in these studies.A1C coming down is always a good benefit, and it's nice, but some people run too low. If you run too low and your A1C goes up a point or half a point, but you avoid a bunch of hypo events, that's a better outcome, too. I think we'll see a lot of good data from that study, and we see great data. A lot of drug companies use CGM in their drug trials as a secondary outcome, it's not a primary outcome yet, to watch the glucose variability in the patients that they're treating.We've seen very fascinating results with a lot of the compounds that are discussed in the investment community, all these new type 2 drugs. You run them a month on CGM without the drug, and then you run them at various times of the trial, and you see what the drugs do. Very good measure and remarkable results. That's one of the reasons we believe there's a great type 2 market for us over time as well. : Sure. To me, this is something that payers should be jumping at. I know that currently, depending on the payer, there's lots of documentation that they demand, which slows down the process, or they push higher and higher copays toward the patient. Is the goal to take a study like this, and if it shows a cost-benefit, to take that to payers and say, \"Let's remove these barriers, let's get more people on it\"? : Yes. We would love to do that with the study. I think the neatest thing, though, about this Gen 5 system and where we're headed with our technology, we're ultimately not going to need the studies. We'll have the data for every patient in the payer's database over time. One of the investments we say we're going to make this year is in an advanced data platform. When we get that advanced data platform built, one of the key legs of that platform is going to be payer data.Theoretically, we could walk into  and say, \"You have 22,312 patients on our system. Here's how they're doing, and here's your 500 problem patients, and boom, b-boom, b-boom.\" I can even see the day sometime where that'll be part of the equation in getting CGM reimbursed that we have to show those type of outcomes and have that type of interaction with the payers. : That's wonderful, and I think that's, like you said, with going to the pharmacy will also increase convenience, and ... : Accountability, because through a pharmacy system, as we have learned at the payers, through the pharmacy information systems, they track every single prescription and everything. It's not quite the same on the durable medical equipment side. For example, they can't tell whether a patient uses a  (NYSE: MDT) or a Dexcom sensor. They both have the same reimbursement code in the system, whereas in pharmacy, we'll have an individual unique identifier that can track us. We think there's a bunch of other benefits there. : That's great. On your call, you mentioned that obviously you've been working toward Medicare. It's been slow, but you guys are taking a three-pronged approach. Is one of the big barriers there that they want you to have a replacement claim where patients can dose off the CGM data? : That is the barrier that CGM established initially that since you can't dose off this, you're not replacing anything else, so it looks like -- : It's just an additional cost. : -- an additional cost to the system. Our first step on that, and that's the administrative arm of our three-pronged approach, is to try and get a non-injunctive claim. As we said on the earnings call, we've had meetings with the FDA for quite a long time on this matter, and we're going to learn a lot in the next two or three months, and in May, when we have the earnings call, we'll talk a lot more about it and give you guys, everybody, some clearer guidance as to what we think's going to happen. : You already have that claim in Europe. Is that correct? : We have that claim in Europe. : OK, so there's a precedent already for -- : There's a precedent there. : -- a regulatory body giving you the thumbs-up on that? : Yeah. : OK. Is that just based on, essentially, accuracy data when compared to finger sticks? : It's based on the accuracy data that we have filed in Europe previously. One of the reasons we're comfortable with the dosing claim is we have run... first of all, we have a huge database of all the clinical trials that we've run, so we know under various scenarios what can happen if a patient makes an error of some kind.For example, you just saw my CGM value, and I calibrated it, the 97 number that was there. What happens if you put 300 in instead of 97, because you had syrup on your finger from the pancake that you ate? We have algorithms; we can then simulate your data and say, \"OK, this is what would happen, and this would be the error. What would happen to the patient in the event that their readings were that much too high?\" We've simulated data on the low side as well.There's a lot of science behind our belief that our device is good enough for a dosing claim now. The FDA's indicated to us that the current G5 system with the current algorithm should be accurate enough, and we've had a lot of discussions about the data required to get there and post-market data that they would be interested in. We'll know more about that. Like I said, there's meetings scheduled over the next two months that are going to be critical in that process. In May, we'll say more.A lot of our patients dose now, and surveys that I've seen done by independent entities outside of us ask the question, \"Do you dose with your CGM in there?\" There's a lot of \"yeses.\" : That means they're being honest. : That means they're being honest. FDA knows this. That's why they're pushing us to get the claim and determine the limits of the system that, is it really good enough to do that? Those are the things we're working on with the agency. : OK, that's great. Do you ultimately see you guys making a push into the hospital market, if somebody came into the hospital with diabetes, they'd stick one of these on them? : Yeah. In fact, when Terry came back to the business in 2007, that's what he wanted to do. He really felt this could grow rapidly as a hospital-based technology, and it didn't turn out that way. We had a partnership with  that has gone by the wayside, but I believe with our new technologies, the Gen 6 sensor is a platform where the algorithm can be adjusted to have no calibrations, for example. We've simulated data. We've run studies and looked at it. You might be able to just put a sensor on a patient as they walk in the door.As you think about what we're doing with Verily, our first goal with them is to make a disposable, low-cost transmitter as well. If you think about the hospital market, we could put a low-cost, disposable sensor on any patient with type 2 diabetes when they came in or even any other patient, with our Bluetooth capability, track it through the system. You have a wonderful means of measuring health. In cardiovascular wards, a very large percentage of those people have type 2 diabetes, and they spend a lot of time sticking fingers.We are looking at that conversely with the 35% to 40% growth we're projecting next year and the over-50% growth we've had the past several years. We've had a hard time just taking care of all that we're doing, but I think that is a huge market for us in the future. I think gestational diabetes would be a huge market for this as well. We will look at other markets where glucose needs to be measured and have an influence on health outcomes. : Right. There's only so much that you do at one given time, so it makes sense. I know you said in your earnings call that now that you've launched Share, first off, you've seen tremendous patient demand. Second off, your phone's ringing off the hook essentially, with people having both questions about how to use it as well as probably just general iPhone questions. : Yeah. We have learned a lot about people's iPhones. While a Dexcom receiver, all of them are exactly the same. I guarantee you if we took our phone into the lab and had our guys look at them, we would find they all do something different. Your email may download once every minute. Hers may download every two seconds. Mine may be every five minutes, and we've seen phones have emails that ask for a download every second, but when you're fighting a Wi-Fi radio like that for Bluetooth signal, you can see choppy results. We've learned a lot of intricacies about the iPhone to make sure that the data's all captured properly. : Is this going to repeat itself once you guys are available on the Android, which is obviously probably even more challenging? : One of the reasons we've taken a longer time with Android is to make sure we understand it all. There are so many Android phones, we're going to have to pick some models and support them. We're not going to be able to go say, \"This works on every Android phone,\" but we'll give a reasonable number of choices. We are learning. : If we could dig in a little bit to the Verily/Google [  (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)] partnership, obviously very exciting. I particularly like that you said that Dexcom has really talked to Google about your regulatory expertise, and they're teaching you about their electronic expertise, and it seems like a nice partnership. : It's a wonderful partnership, and I'll go back to your background. Having worked in diabetes and in regulatory, you know how we always think in diabetes. Imagine being a cell phone manufacturer that throws away one model and launches a new one every six months. Those guys think really, really, really fast, and technology moves very, very fast for them. They have connections with suppliers, manufacturers, engineering talent that we don't have. As we met with them early on in the negotiations, they looked at us and said, \"Everybody with diabetes should have this. You guys, we've got to make this grow.\"They showed us their vision, and our joint vision is some day make that transmitter a Band-Aid that you throw away every time but make it cost effective to whereby we take cost out of the system, and we can still make money and everything works, but if CGM's a Band-Aid ... you've seen the size of the systems. Think how much less invasive that is in a child's life or a pregnant mom with gestational diabetes. If you're just wearing a Band-Aid on the back of your arm, nobody will even know what's going on. We think we can do that. That's the vision to make this that small and that easy to use.They attack those electronic solutions, and they've made us think differently, \"Well, yeah, we could do it that way, or we could do it this way.\" There's a lot of back-and-forth exchange of thoughts. Then, ultimately, when we get our data platform built... Dexcom, we're going to build our own platform to get the data, but there certainly will be Google Analytics capabilities and Verily analytics capabilities that can come into play with this. We'll start exploring that as well.We're now just getting to the point with all the G5 Mobile patients to whereby we have a very substantial database of patient data flowing in every day. We've never had a bunch of data scientists sit down and run through, \"OK, if we wanted to apply an algorithm to these 50,000 people, or how many, what can we learn? What is the general learning that we can learn and we can do here?\" I think there's tremendous opportunity.If you look out even a little further with it, that cloud data, when you have cloud algorithms or machine learning integrated up there talking back to patients, that's a lot easier than changing the physical form of a device from a regulatory process or running a new algorithm that you have to load on a transmitter or a phone or whatever. I think there's going to be some amazing changes and opportunities in diabetes over the next several years. It's going to be really remarkable. : I've got to ask. When you say \"Band-Aid,\" you literally mean stick it on, no insertion, and somehow ... : I mean Band-Aid. No, with our system, there will always be insertion because it's based on a wire, and right now, that wire inserts with a needle, but you can see the day where the needle goes away. We've tested needle-less sensors where maybe it's just a push-down through a form. We are working toward things like that to take costs down. I'm not sure how the Band-Aid will be inserted yet. That's a Dexcom task in the Google partnership, and that's one of our biggest variables is how are we going to do the insertion?Any way you can take cost out is good, and to make a device where you have a needle and a spring and plastic, it's always going to be pretty expensive because it has to work 100% of the time for these people, for these patients. I think you could see a day where we have an insertion system without a needle. : That would be obviously very exciting and especially from a patient and provider training perspective. : Wouldn't that be lovely? : Yeah. If you -- : One of the products that you may not be aware of, and we've talked about this on our calls, our next big launch, or our next big real physical milestone, is we have a new insertion system, a new transmitter, that we'll file in the first half of this year and we'd like to launch in the second half. Our next insertion system is a button push. Peel off the tape, put it on your skin, push the button, throw it out. That's all. It's all housed inside an egg-shaped insertion device to make it much, much easier for patients, and the transmitter profile is much lower than the current product. : Would that be your Gen 6 system? : No, we'll do it on the Gen 5 system, and then Gen 6 will incorporate the same insertion technology. It's easier to make that physical change first with Gen 5, so we're only filing 1 change. Then, when we go to the next product, we file the next change, which is the Gen 6 sensor, which is a completely new sensor, with a different glucose computation algorithm. : You guys have always gotten more and more accurate. I assume that that's going to be a big initiative. : There are two, there's really three features with Gen 6 that are very visible. Number 1, we're going to cut it down to a single calibration a day after start-up. Number 2, we are going to extend the life. Our goal is to extend the life to 10 days, because we know patients wear these longer than 10 days now anyway. We just as well have a 10-day life. The other very obvious physical feature is there's a blocking layer in the membranes that will block interference from other compounds. Our sensor now is labeled that if you take acetaminophen, there's an artificial rise. We're going to block all the drugs and eliminate that artificial noise. : That'd be great. : There's a bunch of other very sophisticated scientific tweaks in the algorithm that'll just... you're right. We always go for more accuracy. We will go for more accuracy yet again, but we also want to give the patients an easier experience, and a single calibration a day through our research is very, very important. If all you got to do is wake up in the morning, stick your finger once, and go, and then imagine that with the dosing claim, boy, that's a good life. That's a good thing. : With the 10-day sensor, correct? : Ten-day is what we're going to go for labeling. : What would that do to your revenue model? : That's an interesting question, and there are two ways to look at it. The most optimistic business case for Dexcom obviously would be is we bill it, we get paid a certain amount per day from the payers, so you get paid that for the 10 days. My belief is we'll probably pick somewhere between seven and 10 and pass some cost savings onto payers and the patients as well. That's one of the [inaudible] we look at in the future as far as moving to pharmacy. With that 10-day sensor and increased pricing, maybe there are things we could work out with payers that'd get us to pharmacy quicker if we have a more per-day, more days of revenue model in the sensor. : That happened previously, correct? You guys increased -- : We went from three to seven. : Yep, and you guys -- : We got more, yeah. : Right. You increased it, which obviously does great things for margins. : Yes, but when that happened, we were a $20 million company. Now that we're a $400 million to $600 million company, we're a little bigger deal, so I don't think the rubber stamp on going from approximately between 70 and 75 to 100 and 105, I don't think that'll be a rubber stamp. It's something we've got to run the study and get the product approved. We'll be very deliberate in our commercial strategy with respect to pricing on the product. One of the barriers is cost. It is for all these devices. To the extent we can take the cost out of the system for patients and still do well by our business, we're going to do that. : It seems like it's a win-win-win. It's a win for Dexcom, it's a win for patients, and it's a win for payers. : A win for payers because, yeah, they get better outcomes, yeah. : Right, especially if you guys get that all-important replacement claim, which they can theoretically use even less strips over time. : Fewer strips over time. : That's great. : Theoretically, you'd only use the one or two used to calibrate, and that'd be it. You can take that cost out of the model. : If we could touch on your pump partnerships really fast. You guys have launched products with  (NYSE: JNJ) as well as  (NASDAQ: TNDM). Can you just let us know how that's going? : In Europe, the Vibe [from Johnson & Johnson] has been very well accepted, and J&J has done very good with that product. I think they are growing in market share in every country where the Vibe has been launched. That's been a good European launch for us. They haven't been out in the U.S., only in '15, but I think there's pretty good traction so far, same with Tandem. They launched their Gen 4 integrated system in the fourth quarter.The issue with both those systems is what I said earlier. They're Gen 4 integrated, and now patients can share and have Gen 5 data. We've been moving at a pace a little faster than our pump partners, and we've encouraged them to keep up. I would tell you -- : You guys set the bar high. : I tell you, over the past several months, we've seen all of them step up and go faster. They've all realized, I think, the value of the phone, that there can be apps that we can possible integrate and do things with.We've also worked with some smaller pump companies. We have a partnership with Bigfoot, who's very visible in the diabetes community, the former Asante pump that's run by Bryan Mazlish and Jeffrey Brewer, who used to be the CEO over at JDRF. They're taking a very unique approach to what they want to do with the sensor-augmented system. I think the FDA's very warm to these systems. There's trials going on all over the world on this stuff, but it's all going to get back to cost and outcomes when all said and done.I believe personally there's going to be a range of solutions for type 1 and intensive type 2 treatment that will start at the high end with those systems, but we're going to be able to give patients who don't want to wear a pump an incredible experience with the sensor. Then, as we start, we see software being developed by a number of companies that tell you what to do. The guys make fun of me. I keep telling them I want a  \"Easy\" button on our app that I'm sitting here at 99, what my thing says, and I'm about to eat breakfast, I want to hit a button that tells me what to do.To the extent we can gather data from possibly an accelerometer or we can gather data from an insulin pump that computes insulin on board so we can have things similar to the bolus calculator used by the pump companies for pen patients. There are Bluetooth pens being developed. If we get every Bluetooth pen dose in our app, and we plan on filing an app later this year that would accept insulin information as well, we're going to offer a range of solutions for these people that will be very cost-effective.Certainly, the sensor-augmented pump systems will be part of the solution, but I think the solution's much broader than that, but we all believe, we believe, obviously, that Dexcom CGM should be part of it for everybody. : Sure. You need the data to make those decisions. : You need the data to make the decision. Meters have never been labeled for dosing. There is no device that's ever been labeled for dosing insulin. The reason that the authorities let meters be used in dosing is because they hold them to a very high accuracy standard. You do know, have a pretty good indication exactly what your blood sugar is to make a decision, but there's no labeling on a meter that says, \"Based on this labeling, you can dose.\" This will be the first. The FDA's being very thoughtful. We're being very thoughtful. We want to make sure we do it right. : I've heard that the \"artificial pancreas,\" it's going to be a couple of intermediate steps to get there. : It'll be done in steps. : Obviously, one of the big first ones is just the replacement claim, which is the big step for you guys. What happens, what do you see as happening after that? : The first step already happened with Medtronic's 530G pump that shut off insulin delivery if a pump was low, and as the FDA outlined the steps, that was the first step they wanted to happen. I think what you'll see then, as I look at our pump partners, you'll see things like a predictive shutoff. When we predict you're going to go low, they would shut it off. Johnson & Johnson talks about a hyper-hypo minimizer algorithm whereby if it sees you're going low, it would decrease insulin delivery. If it sees you're going high, it would increase insulin delivery based on an algorithm. I believe Tandem is doing work like that. I know  is doing work like that as well.It will happen in steps, and it will be interesting to see how far we go. I think the most useful application, in my own mind ... I'll be very simplistic. If you could just control them at night when they're sleeping, because during the day, if we're giving you a steady data feed and more information than you get now about, \"Gee, you're low, you ought to do something,\" or, \"Gee, you're high, you ought to do something,\" or, \"Hey, did you just exercise? Because you seem to be going down real fast.\" When we can have interaction like that, that'll be wonderful, but while patients are sleeping, if these algorithms can really adjust insulin dosing and take care of patients, I think that would be a wonderful advance as well.Again, where it gets interesting is going to be the cost and the benefit. You weigh the benefit of that thing that controls you at night and how much that's going to cost you versus our share system that wakes up your significant other that's there in the room with you or your parents in the room next door. You might get the same outcome. This is going to be an amazing time in diabetes. There's all these solutions coming to the front. How are the payers going to sort through it? What cases do we have to make to payers? How do we get it all approved so patients have the best outcome and a variety of choices? : Do you think that the agency's comfortable with having a device that would do as you say, minimize the basal rate or increase it, even if was just overnight? : I think they're getting there, and I think the trials they're making these companies run are very extensive. I know it's a goal of the agencies and the understand it very well. Trials have been going on in this area for a long time. It's not like they don't have a data set. They do have a data set. Practical use will be different, so it'll be interesting to watch how big ... I got to believe there's going to be pretty large post-market studies for these things to make sure that they work properly. I think the agency's open to that, and they want to. We'll just have to see how it goes. : How has the medical device tax affected you guys? : We sell directly to consumers, so the medical device tax has not had much of an effect on Dexcom. Our professional product we sell to physicians we pay medical device tax on, so we're in a nice place with respect to the medical device tax. : OK. If it was repealed, it wouldn't have much of an effect on your business, but you guys haven't been hurt on the revenue side? : We've not been hurt like the other companies. : As you think about as your business scales, how do you prioritize showing profits on the bottom line versus continually reinvesting given all the opportunities that you guys have? : As a former chief financial officer, this is the question I hope everybody always asks me because the numbers are where I'm always comfortable. Last year, we grew 55% at the top line, and our cash-based results more than doubled, but we didn't keep everything we added to the top line. We continued to reinvest. I think, given where we are as a company, that reinvestment's going to be very, very critical.We're not competing against the Sisters of the Poor here. Medtronic and  are large companies. They're going to spend, so for us to go into batten-down-the-hatches, generate-a-bunch-of-profits mode would be a horrible, horrible decision. The flip side of that is we need to show our shareholders that this business is leverage-able. We've attained 70% gross margins on our revenues -- 70% margin's pretty good.Like I said, our cash-based operating income doubled from last year. In the fourth quarter, our cash-based net income was something like 22% of sales. That's when you back out all the stock compensation and some of the, like the charge for the Google technologies. When you back out all that stuff, that shows very good leverage in a quarter where we spent heavily on direct-to-consumer advertising. We continue to spend heavily on R&D, but the product pipeline has to keep coming.If we don't continue to invest in R&D and get these new products out in studies, then the growth slows down, so it is a balancing act. Our overall goal is, other than extraordinary items, to grow the bottom line a lot faster than we grow the top while continuing to reinvest. We've been able to do that so far.Now, in 2016, aside from our regular expense growth, we have 4 key initiatives that we're going to spend, and we've told investors, we give them very specific guidance, up to $40 million on our Verily partnership, our advanced data platform, our European expansion, and a new factory in Arizona, where we're going to build sensors.We never thought we'd run out of capacity in San Diego, but as we look at the Verily partnership, we look at the pump partners all hitting their strides, we look at the type 2 operation, we look at a hospital market like you talked about, we decided it's imperative that we create some more capacity. Two years out when we might hit our max capacity in San Diego, we have another facility up and running.We have four very strategic initiatives that we're spending on outside of the norm, but we'll still grow our cash-based results over the course of the year. : That's interesting that you're going to be investing in manufacturing in the United States versus, say, overseas. Is that because the process is so automated that the cost savings if you go overseas isn't worth it? : We're looking to automate a lot of our processes, and our processes are so proprietary, we wanted to keep them here. One of the reasons we picked Arizona... we studied several geographies in the U.S. That's an hour plane ride from San Diego, so a lot of our executives can still supervise and be involved in that. As a growing company, we feel the need still to be very much in control. This isn't a cookie-cutter operation where you can go open a plant up in Mexico and it just goes. If building sensors were easy, there'd be a lot more companies in the business. It isn't, and so we need a level of control. : Funny you bring that up. On the competition front, I've personally been amazed that there hasn't been a flood of sensor companies that have come into the market, because the pump market has certainly been seeing new players, has seen very aggressive expansion. Why do you think that you guys essentially, in my mind, have the sensor market, essentially, it's been you and Medtronic, and that's it? : It's hard. Honest to goodness, you can make sensors that work in a small clinical study, and then when you've got to make millions of them, it is not an easy business. A lot of the technologies have come and gone, or companies start up, but they don't see a way to scale. It's tough. The demands of these patients, this thing's got to be good. Your life depends on it. There are a lot of start-up sensor companies now, and we look at all of them. If anything interests us, we take a look, but so far, we're very happy with our own technology.Commercializing it is different. It's like the pump companies. You come from the pump world. Our head R&D guy at MiniMed when I was there used to say something real interesting, \"It costs quite a bit to make that pump, but it costs a whole lot more to put the 1-800 number on the back of it.\" That's the learning that all these start-up companies get to. : Takes a heck of a lot of capital to get over that hump and scale the organization. Essentially, manufacturing, customer support, are essentially barriers to entry. : They are, in addition to technology, both of them. : Quickly, if we could touch on, you mentioned that you launched a direct-to-consumer campaign that was in print, and you guys seem to drive record visits to your website, record impressions. I'm sure your phone was ringing off the hook. You obviously saw a lot of success with that, and you said that you're going to continue that? : We are. : Indefinitely, or just as long as it makes sense? : Certainly for the first half of this year, and we'll continue what we did in the fourth quarter or the first half of this year with the G5 Mobile. Then, we'll re-evaluate, but I think the days of not going to consumers are over. I think we need to go directly to patients.I'll give you the perfect example. I was talking with somebody who was very close to me in their 40s just diagnosed with type 1. I showed them my CGM. Never heard of it, never seen it. Knows me very well. \"This is what you do?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Why hasn't my doctor told me about this?\" \"Don't know, but you should go talk to your physician and get on it.\" There's still awareness hurdles that we just got to overcome.I'm a patient on the caregiver side, but in most cases, when you walk into your caregiver and say, \"I want that,\" they're pretty open to it, particularly those that understand CGM. Now, why they don't offer it to everybody that walks in the door, that would be our dream. It's just not there yet with any device or any drug, but to the extent we can make more progress with awareness with patients and providers, that's where our campaigns will go this year on both fronts. : What kind of penetration rates do you think CGM has in, say, into the U.S. type 1 market? There's about 1,500,000 or so type 1s. : You look at the U.S. market as 1,500,000. We've said our total patient base is somewhere around 140,000 to 150,000 with 20%, 25% of that overseas, so you can extrapolate us. We're somewhere above 100,000 patients in the U.S. Between us and Medtronic, I think it's somewhere in the 15% to 20%, but 10% to 20% range certainly. It's come up a lot. We also said on a call we nearly doubled our patient base last year. It was a busy year, so penetration really started to spike last year.I'm not quite sure why a type 1 wouldn't want to wear a sensor, having experience. The data is just so rich and so valuable in your life. That's why we're coming at this from a variety of different solutions. With phone connectivity, with the sharing, decreasing the footprint and the size and all the things I talked about earlier will just appeal to more people. How high can penetration get? Gosh, I'd be very disappointed if we didn't get to 70% to 80% penetration in the type 1 market for CGM over time. : Theoretically, if payers see data and they see cost savings, they'll lower the barriers, they'll make it more accessible. : They'll do that. You know what? That's our job, too. I don't think we've done a perfect job of laying out the cost of CGM versus the benefit of CGM. I think, over time, particular gathering this data in the cloud from our patients, we're going to be able to gather some certainly better outcome data, and the insurance companies can track the cost data. That outcome data will become evident on the next few earnings calls. : Again, your growth is especially impressive considering that the trend over the last two or three years is really to push more of the cost of care directly to the patient. We saw deductibles rise. We've seen patients with $5,000 deductibles, so when you -- : It's awful. The phone calls are awful. The emails are awful. \"My daughter has type 1. They raised my deductible to $10,000. I can't afford CGM. What can you do for me?\" Responding back to those emails is the worst part of my day. The other bad emails, in all honesty, are the 64-year-old people who are going to turn 65 and, \"I'm not going to be eligible for your device next week. What can you do?\" We need to fix that. : Right. Hopefully, that's something that fixes itself over time as you made the case to payers. : Over time.

Although much of that interest surrounds drugs that could help delay diabetes disease progression to other life-threatening conditions, perhaps the best way to invest in the trend is to focus on medical-device maker  . Read on to find out why. According the International Diabetes Federation, the population of people with diabetes will grow to 642 million by 2040, up from 415 million today.That's a staggering figure, especially considering that roughly 5 million people will die from diabetes-related disease this year alone.The soaring prevalence of diabetes means that the cost to treat the disease is likely to skyrocket from its current $673 billion. IDF reports that diabetes accounts for between 5% and 20% of most countries' total healthcare spending, or an average 11.6% of health expenditures worldwide. Overall, IDF believes that total spending on diabetes could climb nearly 20% -- to more than $800 billion -- in 25 years.A big reason for the spike in costs is the graying of the global population. People between 50 and 79 years old account for 75% of all diabetes expenditures.The diabetes epidemic isn't limited solely to type 2 disease in older patients, either. An estimated 500,000 people under age 14 are living with type 1 diabetes, and that number is growing 3% annually. Drugs that can improve glycemic control for patients will undeniably play a big role in treatment, and studies evaluating the use of therapies in combination with one another to achieve better outcomes could significantly shift the standard of care in the coming years.But medicine isn't the only way that doctors, healthcare payers, and patients may seek to limit the blood sugar highs and lows that can lead to organ damage and other health complications.Technology that provides greater insight into patient blood sugar trends, such as DexCom's blood glucose monitors, could also make a big impact.DexCom's continuous glucose monitors (CGM) provide real-time data to patients that can better guide them on when its most effective to take their insulin. Typically, the average diabetes patient is outside of the desired blood glucose range approximately 70% of the time, so there's a significant need for devices like this. Currently, reimbursement hurdles for type 2 patients mean that DexCom's CGMs are primarily used in type 1 patients, but even in that much smaller sub-segment sales are increasing significantly.Last year, DexCom reported that sales of its monitors and the disposable sensors they require grew 55% to $402 million. That jump in sales has industry watchers thinking it's only a matter of time before DexCom turns profitable.In 2015, the company reported a net loss that after adjusting for stock issued to  's life sciences group, Verily, though it improved to $0.26 per share from $0.30 a year ago. As volume helps mix, analysts think the loss will improve to $0.05 this year.That improving sales and profit trend may only hint at the future opportunities for the company. In its fourth-quarter , management indicated that investments in R&D, such as its recent collaboration with Verily, could fuel significant product innovation that could broaden DexCom's addressable market.Last August, DexCom handed over $35 million of its stock to Verily to get its hands on intellectual property that could lead to cheap, small, and disposable sensors that could conceivably remove the need for finger sticks for most patients.Additionally, investments being made by the company on new production capacity this year could pay off in the form of lower per-unit volume costs down the road, helping profitability.DexCom also continues to argue its case to healthcare payers, including Medicare, and if DexCom can demonstrate its CGMs can improve patient outcomes and lower long-term healthcare costs, then its monitors could become widely available to type 2 patients who currently have to buy DexCom devices and sensors out-of-pocket. Today, investors focus primarily on innovation in medicine for diabetes, but that could change as medical technology gets increasingly sophisticated. If so, then the pace of growth for DexCom could accelerate, but even if the ability to target type 2 patients stays limited, the potential for DexCom in type 1 diabetes is still big -- and for that reason, it's one of my favorite diabetes-related stocks to buy.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The upside may be attributed to increased head count in the company's organization (including both field sales and internal sales support staff). Additional marketing expenses were also a major reason behind the year-over-year upside.Research and development (R&D) expenses increased 3Array.9% year over year to $28.5 million. The rise can be attributed to increased additional payroll-related costs and expenses with respect to work on near-term product pipeline as well as an advanced product suite.DexCom reported operating income of $Array.6 million, which remained flat on a year-over-year basis.DexCom launched its next-generation G5 Mobile CGM system both in the U.S. and Europe in 20Array5.

The company expects 55%--60% of these revenues to be generated in the second half of the year.DexCom noted that gross margin will be impacted slightly in 20Array6 by higher costs related to manufacturing capacity expansion project. The company expects gross margin between 67% and 70% for the full year.

Baird downgraded the stock from outperform to neutral, shares in  were down 21.5% at 2:00 p.m. ET today. Despite reporting at the J.P. Morgan healthcare conference last month that unaudited revenue from the sale of DexCom's continous glucose monitors jumped 54% to approximately $400 million in 2015, the company's shares have fallen 40.5% this year.Contributing to investors' concern is DexCom's spending plans.DexCom plans to build a new factory, expand in the EU, and funnel more money into R&D this year, and that means the company's operating margin may take a short-term hit in 2016. As a result, industry watchers have reduced their EPS forecast to a loss of $0.05 in 2016, down from a gain of $0.20 90 days ago.: Although spending may weigh down profit this year, the global diabetes market is expected to climb to 642 million people in 2040 from 415 million people today, and that should mean a healthy trajectory for future sales -- especially if DexCom can successfully negotiate Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement and make headway into the type 2 diabetes market. At the J.P. Morgan healthcare conference, DexCom forecast sales of $540 million to $565 million in 2016, up at least 35% from last year.That projection suggests a slowing in year-over-year growth, but it's still healthy enough to make this company intriguing, particularly given that Baird's new $74 price target is still nicely higher than shares are trading today.Overall, investors might want to consider stepping up and buying shares on this sell-off, because DexCom has seen a tenfold increase in revenue since 2011, yet it's only penetrated a small slice of this massive addressable market.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The transaction is now expected to close in the first half of 2016, instead of the previously planned first quarter.Earlier in Aug 2015, the company had announced plans to establish a new publicly traded hospital company, by spinning off 38 of its hospitals along with Quorum Health Resources - its hospital management and consulting business.The new independent company, with a portfolio of 38 hospitals and 3,635 licensed beds, is planned to have its headquarters in Middle Tennessee. It will operate in markets where hospitals are the solitary provider of acute care services.We believe that the postponement is a setback for Community Health, at least in the near term. However, positive share price movement following the news suggests that investors are not overly worried over the rescheduling. Meanwhile, Community Health continues to divest hospitals on a regular basis, which will in turn, help it to focus on large hospitals that operate on higher margins.Last month, the company completed the sale of Bartow Regional Medical Center, along with related outpatient services, to subsidiaries of BayCare Health System. Community Health also announced a definitive agreement to divest the assets of The Memorial Hospital of Salem County along with related outpatient services to Prime Healthcare Foundation.In conjunction with the divestures, Community Health is focused on pursuing acquisitions that will benefit its overall business model. The company recently inked a definitive agreement to buy majority stake in two reputed hospitals. Community Health, the nation's largest hospital operator (by hospital count), will be buying an 80% stake in IU Health La Porte Hospital in La Porte and IU Health Starke Hospital in northwestern Indiana.The transaction will take Community Health's Indiana hospital tally to 11. We believe the strategic buyouts will drive the company's penetration into the healthcare services market, which in turn, will enhance its competitive position as well as drive significant growth.Currently, Community Health carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Notably, the sales figure in 2015 and 2014 incorporates the Lake Region merger (completed in Oct 27, 2015) and Nuvectra spin-off (expected in 2016).Per management, adjusted EBITDA in 2015 is expected to be $312 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 1.6%. Adjusted EBITDA margin, on the other hand, is estimated to expand 70 basis points (bps) to 21.6%.For 2016, Greatbatch expects sales to be about $1.47 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is likely to be around $327 million while adjusted EBITDA margin is projected at 22.3%. In 2016, management will focus on expanding margins and also on generating significant organic growth.We are not overtly impressed with the preliminary results, given that the top line is expected to take a hit. However, the expected EBITDA margin expansion is a positive.Moreover, the recent Lake Region buyout has important long-term prospects for the company. The acquisition is also anticipated to provide significant operating synergies, which will, in turn, boost earnings. In fact, management at Greatbatch expects the acquisition to help adjusted earnings per share achieve double-digit growth rate in 2016. Post that, it is expected to be even more accretive.Additionally, net annual synergy for operating profit is projected at around $25 million in 2016 and is likely to increase to at least $60 million by 2018. The combined company is also poised to generate significant cash flow, which will strengthen the balance sheet.Again, the proposed spin-off of its neuromodulation device business (QiG Group) is expected to help Greatbatch operate more effectively by proper allocation of resources. Post spin-off, the new entity is going to be known as Nuvectra Corp, which will primarily emphasize on the development & marketization of the Algovita spinal cord stimulation system.Currently, Greatbatch sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Other well-placed stocks in the medical space are Exactech  , DexCom  and Fresenius Medical Care  .

The top line reflects growth of 7.2% on a year-over-year basis and is also higher than management's guided range of $68-$69 million.The fourth-quarter performance will be largely influenced by increased orders from commercial distributors. Meanwhile, the commercial business, per management, continues to be unpredictable owing to unfavorable timing of distributor orders.Revenues generated from the domestic market amounted to $70.6 million, which reflects year-over-year growth of almost 8%. International revenues, on the other hand, stands unchanged at $5.5 million. On a constant currency basis, international revenues increased 11% from the year-ago quarter.For full-year 2015, revenues amounted to $282.3 million and improved 7.4% on a year-over-year basis. Domestic revenues increased nearly 9% to $260.4 million, while international revenues fell 8.4% (up 4% at constant currency) to $21.9 million.The stock has seen a 13.7% fall in its price since Dec 24, 2015. The impressive top-line performance is expected to boost investor confidence on the stock. We are impressed with RTI Surgical's business in the domestic market, which is a key growth catalyst.

In the third quarter of 2015, the company acquired 12 skilled nursing operations, 20 assisted and independent living operations, one home health business and one hospice agency.As a result of these frequent acquisitions, the company now operates 185 healthcare facilities, 13 hospice agencies, 15 home health agencies, three home care businesses and 17 urgent care clinics across 14 states.However, despite frequent acquisitions, the company's balance sheet remains strong as reflected by the adjusted net-debt-to-EBITDAR ratio of 3.27x at the end of the third quarter. We believe that a strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity will help the company pursue acquisitions that will expand its customer base and market share going forward.Meanwhile, The Ensign Group provided a positive outlook for 2015 and 2016. For 2015, the company raised its revenue guidance to the range of $1.31-$1.33 billion and earnings to $2.53-$2.58 per share.

And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! To be one of them,  . You mention the word \"innovation,\" and that's at the heart of it. Oh my gosh, there are so many drugmakers and they're taking a lot of heat lately. But truly, they are revolutionizing patient care. It's amazing. I think we forget sometimes each one of these companies there's this team of scientists -- people just like everyone else -- who day in and day out are doing the hard work of digging into understanding the body's anatomy and how it will react to different medicines and creating those medicines that can truly help us live longer, healthier lives.Look what's been accomplished at Gilead Sciences in the past decade in both HIV and hepatitis C. You know, HIV is no longer the death sentence that it once was. Now people are living long, healthier lives because of treatments that have come out of Gilead Science. In hepatitis C, these have created what amounts to a functional cure for a disease that no cure had previously existed for. Yeah, indeed. I mean, and not only is it a cure, but the patient experience when you're going through hepatitis C treatment, is so, so much better than the older generation of treatments. Yeah, 90%-plus cure rates, easier-to-tolerate dosing regimens. I mean, these are things that, again, putting people first turns into a good -- it's just good business overall. Yeah. So there are so many examples that we could touch on with drugmakers, but let's not forget about medical-device makers too. I mean, there's been some really great innovations there. Todd, can you think of any particular ones that you would say you're thankful for that innovation? I know, and I'm sure you do, too, a lot of people have diabetes. And you know, one of the things that I've spent a lot of time, and we've touched upon past in the show, is a company called Dexcom. And what Dexcom is doing is they're developing new ways to better track and report sugar levels in patients so that they can control those blood sugar levels and hopefully delay the progression of their disease so that they are living longer, healthier lives.So, yeah, I mean, like you said, it's not just the drugmakers who are innovating in these ways. It's also med-tech companies like Dexcom that are improving patient lives. Yeah, Dexcom was a great example to use right there. I mean, they are making a continuous glucose monitoring device so that you're not just getting a reading here and there and trying to manage your disease in a spotty sort of way. But it really is continual. It's a way of looking at your glucose levels and being able to really understand what's going on with your body, so that hopefully you can better manage your disease.And there's so much that goes into treating diabetes, and it's awesome to see that there's so many different companies approaching the disease and trying to make the patient burden a little bit lighter. These are all chronic diseases that were, we need to make big inroads on over the next 30 years. Millions and millions of people are going to be suffering from heart disease, diabetes, various other conditions, Alzheimer's, and we need to continue to, I guess, move the ball forward and make sure that we've got that long-term focus.The article  originally appeared on Fool.com.Copyright \u00a9 1995 - 2015 The Motley Fool, LLC.

This is Industry Focus.Hi everyone, welcome to Industry Focus. I'm Kristine Harjes and I am thankful to be joined by Todd Campbell. We're recording this episode a little bit in advance, but Thanksgiving is still less than a week away. By the time you listeners are hearing this, you'll probably be practically smelling the turkey.I know, I for one am very thankful for being able to take a few days off to spend with my family, eat some great food, and hopefully come out of it with some amazing leftovers.How about you Todd? What are you feeling thankful for? Oh definitely anticipating those leftovers without a doubt. It's so funny how that's like kind of the best part. Oh, I know. There's nothing better than that big bulky sandwich the day after Thanksgiving. Yeah just oozing gravy and stuffing. Oh my, I can't wait. Yeah well in addition to the leftovers there's a few things that I'm thankful for healthcare-style. Of course one of them is the great team that we have here at the Motley Fool. You know, I've been in the business a long time and you guys, what we do here on the program is wonderful. And it's great having a wonderful teammate like you too Kristine. Aw thanks, Todd. Yeah I'm so thankful that I get to talk to you and do this show every week. And even everybody that I get to work with at this company, you know from the writers, to the tech people that put on these shows. It's a really great place and I just say, I'm also thankful to work for a place that I can really get behind the mission.I mean the Motley Fool, everybody here wants to help the world invest better. And that is such a beautiful thing that I can be in a place that believes in this wholeheartedly, and everybody is so wicked smart and applying themselves to that mission. So cool. I'm thankful for that. Absolutely. We started off today's episode by saying that we wanted to approach this with giving thanks healthcare style. In preparation for filming today and recording this episode, I started spending a lot of time thinking about what it is that's happening in healthcare that I'm really thankful for.And you know, one of the things that jumps to the top of my mind is how thankful I am that there are so many doctors and nurses and caregivers that are out there working tirelessly day in and day out to help patients understand their disease, figure out their treatment options, and you know, deal with the side effects that often can come with those treatment options.And it doesn't matter if it's a surgeon that's helping out a patient at a major hospital or if it's the nurse practitioner that's helping out people at the  ' Minute Clinics. These people are a godsend if you will. And our lives are certainly better off having them as a part of them. Yeah everybody working in the industry is a superhero and I'm certainly thankful for how hard all of our doctors work and everybody. You know, like you said, it doesn't matter if you are a surgeon or if you're the person at the CVS Minute Clinic. These people in the healthcare industry are working tirelessly and we're all so much better off for it.It goes beyond just the interaction between patients and their caregivers too. It goes all the way toward the drug developers, the people who run the insurance companies, it's a huge, huge industry and I like to think it's one where everybody can really believe in the mission of health. I mean that's something we can get behind and so I'm definitely thankful for the passion that everybody working in the industry has. Right. We mentioned CVS and Minute Clinics and just go back to what you just said about if your focus is on health first, it's like anything else, right? I suppose if you love what you do, you will succeed, right? So at CVS health, I mean not only are they making healthcare more affordable to everybody and accessible to everybody by opening up clinics in their stores right down the street, but you know, their decision to stop selling tobacco and put I guess patient health before profit. You know, they gave up $2 billion in sales in that decision. Yeah we look into it and we try to financially justify it because we're investors, but what it comes down to is just mission alignment. That's what it is. Yeah. I mean it's that kind of thoughtfulness and I guess innovation the way that they approach their businesses that make us thankful not only as patients, people, but also as investors. The Motley Fool is helping everyone come up with new ways of approaching their investment portfolios figuring out what kind of companies they want to own. And certainly if you're putting your mission first, I think you have a much better likelihood of succeeding long-term.It doesn't matter if you're talking about a company like CVS and what they're doing on affordability, accessibility, it also applies to drug makers and what they're doing as far as coming up with truly game changing new medicines. Yeah I mean you mention the word innovation and that's at the heart of it. Oh my gosh, there are so many drug makers and they're taking a lot of heat lately. But truly they are revolutionizing patient care. It's amazing. I think we forget sometimes each one of these companies there's this team of scientists -- people just like everyone else -- who day in and day out are doing the hard work of digging into understanding the body's anatomy and how it will react to different medicines and creating those medicines that can truly help us live longer, healthier lives.Look what's been accomplished at Gilead Sciences in the past decade in both HIV and Hepatitis C. You know, HIV is no longer the death sentence that it once was. Now people are living long, healthier lives because of treatments that have come out of Gilead Sciences. In Hepatitis C these have created what amounts to a functional cure for a disease that no cure had previously existed for. Yeah indeed. I mean and not only is it a cure, but the patient experience when you're going through Hepatitis C treatment, is so, so much better than the older generation of treatments. Yeah 90% plus curates, easier to tolerate dosing regimens. I mean these are things that again, putting people first turns into a good -- it's just good business overall. Yeah. So there are so many examples that we could touch on with drug makers, but let's not forget about medical device makers too. I mean there's been some really great innovations there. Todd can you think of any particular ones that you would say you're thankful for that innovation? I know, and I'm sure you do too, a lot of people have diabetes. And you know one of the things that I've spent a lot of time, and we've touched upon past in the show, is a company called Dexcom. And what Dexcom is doing is they're developing new ways to better track and report sugar levels in patients so that they can control those blood sugar levels and hopefully delay the progression of their disease so that they are living longer, healthier lives.So yeah, I mean like you said, it's not just the drug makers who are innovating in these ways. It's also med tech companies like Dexcom that are improving patient lives. Yeah Dexcom was a great example to use right there. I mean they are making a continuous glucose monitoring device so that you're not just getting a reading here and there and trying to manage your disease in a spotty sort of way. But it really is continual. It's a way of looking at your glucose levels and being able to really understand what's going on with your body. So that hopefully you can better manage your disease.And there's so much that goes into treating diabetes and it's awesome to see that there's so many different companies approaching the disease and trying to make the patient burden a little bit lighter. These are all chronic diseases that were, we need to make big inroads on over the next 30 years. Millions and millions of people are going to be suffering from heart disease, diabetes, various other conditions, Alzheimer's, and we need to continue to I guess move the ball forward and make sure that we've got that long-term focus. How are we going to address this problem in the long-term?And when you start thinking long-term it makes me think of other things that I'm thankful for in lessons that I've learned over my career or have been taught in my career not only by mentors but also by my family. I mean my father is a former banker and at an early age he taught me the value of saving, dollar-cost averaging, and now those lessons today are helping ensure my family's financial security. That's amazing. Yeah I mean family is at the heart of everything. I mean I can also look at my parents and immediately see how they've helped me become who I am today as a person and also financially.Just to keep somewhat on-topic, I mean I would give the shout-out to my father for teaching me how to have an eye for detail and how to work with numbers from a young age. And my mother is the one that got me interested in healthcare to begin with. She's always worked in healthcare and she's always been a model for me for taking care of yourself and just how important health is.So the combination there, it's pretty easy to see how I ended up doing what I'm doing right now -- applying numbers and analysis to the world of healthcare. Right, being able to take the lessons that we learned early on. I suppose this is something that I know that I'm sharing it now with my children. It's a generational thing. Earlier, and earlier, and earlier you're educating them about these things that could have a big impact on their lives. And you know, I look at it, I said, \"Yeah, if you start earlier, start investing continuously. Look what I've done, and if you even start earlier than I did, look where you could be financially when it gets to that point when you're retiring.\"My mother, she was a social scientist so she taught me a lot about how to handle and deal with emotion. And you know, one thing that I think that investors are always dealing with is, \"How do I balance the emotional reaction that I get when I see something come across my newsfeed versus my long-term investing thesis?\"So all of those skills that they taught me, I appreciate and value and I'm thankful for as well. Yeah, I think we can both say that we're so thankful for all the people in our lives who have shaped us and taught us so many amazing things.And I would be remiss if I didn't throw a shout-out to those that are working behind the scenes to put this podcast together. So thank you to Austin, just gave him a wave out there. He does all of our taping. Danny who does the behind-the-scenes on the episodes. There are so many other people that come together to make this show what it is. Todd, thank you for doing this every week with me. I have learned so much from you and we always have such a good time. It's wonderful and something I look forward to every week and hopefully so do the people who are turning in. Yeah and speaking of, thank you so much to our listeners. I mean this podcast would be all for nothing without those of you who tune in every week.Send us your questions and comments at  . You guys are the reason that we come together to put this show on.

The company received 49 orders for the system and shipped 10 during the recently concluded fourth quarter of 2015.Sequel system is a nucleic acid sequencing platform based on Single Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT) technology that was developed under the company's partnership with Roche. Sequel is a more powerful device as compared to the company's legacy PacBio RS II system.However, Pacific Biosciences noted that the new SMRT cells - provided by its prototype chip vendor - for the Sequel Systems will be in limited supply through the first half of 2016. Hence, shipment of the system will be slower during the period.Pacific Biosciences added that it is in the process of outsourcing the manufacturing of the cells to a high volume producer, which will be completed by the middle of the year. The company expects to ramp up shipments in the later half with the increase in supply of SMRT cells.However, this assurance failed to cheer investors as the share price plunged 9.4% to close at $11.42 on Jan 11. The delay in shipment will surely impact Pacific Biosciences' top-line growth in the first half of 2016.Nevertheless, we are encouraged by the growing adoption rate of the system. Pacific Biosciences noted that more than 40% of the Sequel systems ordered in the quarter were from new customers. The upcoming software and chemistry update will further improve the features of the new system.Moreover, the legacy PacBio RS II continues to win orders (three in the quarter), which is positive in our view. We believe that Pacific Biosciences has significant growth prospects in plant and animal as well as human genome sequencing. The company's leading position in microbial sequencing also presents it a significant growth opportunity in the infectious disease market.Currently, Pacific Biosciences has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the same space are Exactech  , Abiomed  and Dexcom  . While Exactech sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), both Abiomed and Dexcom carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download  .

Medtronic has been vocal that the tax is onerous, eroding its ability to create jobs and expand research. The company also leads the pack in cranking up its lobbying on Capitol Hill, with over $5 million in lobbying expenses last year.But healthcare -- and healthcare reform -- is extremely complicated. Those who are paying the most for the tax aren't necessarily suffering the most. In fact, overall net profits reported by the 102 largest U.S.-based med-tech companies increased a comfortable 7% from 2013 to 2014, and a downright off-the-hook 19% the year before that, according to a survey of company data by the Government Accountability Office. If you look deeper, however, you'll find another story. And this one isn't nearly so rosy.Unlike the pharmaceutical industry, a large number of smaller device companies with one or two products characterize the device industry. These companies don't have the pricing edge of a Medtronic or  , which are the go-to sellers of a wide range of medical supplies. Smaller companies are much more sensitive to the impact of the device tax, since they are less able to simply pass on the tax to their customers.In addition, since the tax is on  , not profit, the tariff eats up most of the profits of many of these small players, if they have any. We're not talking only pie-in-the-sky start-ups here. Because of the lengthy and somewhat unpredictable regulatory process that must be negotiated before a medical device can be sold, it can take from $70 million to $100 million in total sales before a med-tech becomes profitable.Statistics bear this out. While leading U.S. med-techs are logging record profits, smaller device companies are feeling tremendous margin pressure. In a survey done by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, nearly all of the reported increase in net profit for the 102 companies surveyed came from the 30 big caps with sales of over $1 billion per year. By contrast, the 72 smaller companies surveyed reported an overall net loss over the same years. Probably the key argument against the medical device tax is that it throttles small-company innovation. Medical device firms that are entering the market have a harder time becoming profitable with the additional cost of this excise tax. In turn, this would give an advantage to larger, more established firms, reducing the competitiveness of the industry.As Boston-based AbioMed's CEO Michael Minogue told NPR: \"I don't think taxing the innovators and taxing the group of companies that provide innovation for healthcare is a smart idea, but the biggest concern I have, and what's unprecedented, is to tax companies that are not yet profitable, and in our industry where 70% of the companies are not yet profitable, this is going to have detrimental effects in their job growth, in their survival.\"Whether it's in the realm of  or personalized medicine, it's these under-the-radar companies that are likely to solve some of the major issues healthcare faces today. Unfortunately, when the profits of an early stage medical device company are wiped out, it can also snuff out their ability to fund research and development activities that could ultimately greatly benefit those who need their devices.Mark Throdahl is the CEO of privately held OrthoPediatrics, the world's only company specializing in making orthopedic equipment for children. Throdahl said on the matter: \"This is a very burdensome tax because it is based on sales, not profits. In terms of magnitude, the tax is about the size of our entire product development budget.\"Other companies are in worse straits. \"We're actually borrowing money to pay the excise tax,\" said Tom Allen, CEO of another privately held device maker, Iconacy Orthopedic Patients. Like most of their peers, both these CEOs believe a tax on profit would be more fair -- and certainly more manageable for smaller medical device makers.Rather than seeing the glass as half empty, however, let's look at the other side. Here's who could win big if a repeal passes the finish line. In other words, while the big caps would net the highest dollar volume gain, it's the fast-growing smaller medical device stocks that should feel the greatest impact from a repeal. One such company is  , which recently nabbed FDA approval of a continuous glucose monitoring device to  .Dexcom saw revenue growth of 58.5% last quarter and earnings growth of 38.33%, on a year-over-year basis. But its profit margins were a negative 3.97% in the quarter. While that's an improvement compared to 10.20% loss for the same quarter last year, a repeal could help nudge Dexcom into the black.Another example of a small medical device company that would benefit hugely from a repeal of the tax is  , an innovator in oxygen therapy. Inogen's shares managed to float even higher in the recent sell-off and are up 61% since the beginning of the year. Inogen also saw its revenue grow 45% last quarter, over the same quarter last year.Inogen sells a portable oxygen concentrator that uses a chemical process to separate oxygen from nitrogen in the surrounding air. That means users don't have to drag along a heavy tank that only provides air for two to three hours. Inogen's device lasts nine hours and is rechargeable by plugging into a typical outlet.Like many small med-techs, however, Inogen relies heavily on domestic sales, so the medical device tax cuts deep. Inogen sells overseas, but the company experiences its strongest sales growth in the U.S., with domestic sales growing 80.5% last quarter. Of course, the larger companies in the industry would also gain from a repeal. When discussing the tax, Medtronic's CFO Gary Ellis  Medtronic would make \"trade-offs\" and that \"we won't have as much to invest going forward.\" Thus far, the trade-offs appear to have succeeded. Last fiscal year, Medtronic saw its net profit margins exceed 20%, putting it on par with many pharmaceutical giants. In the face of that, a 2.3% tax doesn't seem onerous.Still, while the company seems to have successfully passed on the cost of the tax to the hospitals that purchase its devices, hospitals are becoming more cost-conscious. While it's hard to put a dollar amount to how much of an impact a repeal could have, Bernstein Research has noted that a repeal of the tax could boost the medical device companies' profits by 1% to 5%. He also named Medtronic as a key beneficiary.The House has already voted to repeal the device tax. The next hurdle is a Senate vote before it reaches President Obama's desk.A Senate repeal seems highly likely, since last year in a non-binding Senate vote, 34 Democrats and 45 Republicans voted against it, saying it's a tax on innovation. Very much up in the air, however, is whether backers in the Senate can gain enough votes to override the expected presidential veto.President Obama has made it clear he believes the tax is necessary to pay for Obamacare. And even those most eager for repeal realize it's going to be hard to come up with a $30 billion offset to replace what the tax is projected to generate over 10 years. Despite bipartisan protests, the medical device tax survived last year. While repeal looks more likely this year, Capitol Hill is always unpredictable. Investors should also note that a possible repeal could already be priced into the major med-tech stocks. The market typically prices in political events before reality confirms them.Still, there are stocks in this group that are worth watching. In particular, while EPS estimates for 2015 are mostly mediocre for med-tech, there are a handful of smaller stocks that expect spectacular growth. If you see the repeal gaining steam and grabbing headlines, you might want to look closer at the two small caps already mentioned, or  a small cap medtech which has a While these stocks are more volatile than large, established healthcare companies, they are also where an actual repeal could have the greatest impact.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The company is set to report third-quarter results on Nov 4.DexCom expects revenues to rise an impressive 52% on a year-over-year basis to $105 million, much higher than the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $98 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is currently pegged at a breakeven for the quarter.DexCom is riding high on the back of its healthy product portfolio and innovative pipeline. We note that the company enjoys a strong market presence, thanks to G4 PLATINUM System, which is the industry's first mobile connected continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system.Meanwhile, DexCom's CGM and mobile apps - Share 2 and Follow - are approved by the FDA and allow both users and followers to view glucose data directly on Android and iOS-enabled devices.In late August, the FDA approved the G5 Mobile CGM System of the company. The fully portable product is the first and solitary CGM system permitted by the FDA for use in both adults and children above two years of age. The transmitter, with in-built Bluetooth, sends essential glucose information directly to an app on iOS-enabled devices for instantaneous diabetes supervision. The company intends to launch the app for android devices in early 2016.The company has already started shipping the device. It is also well on track to conduct a pre-pivotal study with its gen 6 sensors later this year. Following that, the company will look to commence a pivotal study. Meanwhile, DexCom expects to launch gen 6 in early 2017.Apart from innovative product launches, strategic partnerships with the likes of Apple and Google, which boast a vast global presence, are expected to boost DexCom's business scale massively. In August, the company entered into a partnership with Google's life sciences team to develop a series of CGM devices that will be compact (\"bandage-sized sensor\"), easy to use and more economic than the existing products. The devices will be disposable and can be used by all types of diabetes patients.As technology is becoming a more relevant and indispensable part of people's lives, we feel that the Google collaboration will go a long way in enhancing the brand value of DexCom's products and services. The combination of Google's miniaturized electronics platform with DexCom's superior sensor technology is expected to develop CGMs that will help patients manage diabetes better.Moreover, by expanding its range of solutions and services, DexCom improves its international presence that will enhance top-line growth.However, high product development costs, research & development as well as marketing expenses will continue to hurt margins, which is a concern for the near term. Uncertainty over reimbursement also remains a headwind in our view.Currently, DexCom carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the medical sector include Masimo  , Mazor Robotics  and Cyberonics  .

Additional marketing expenses were also a major reason behind the year-over-year increase.Research and development (R&D) expenses amounted to $64.8 million, as compared with $18.5 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase can be attributed to increased additional payroll related costs and expenses with respect to work on near-term product pipeline as well as an advanced product suite.DexCom reported operating loss of $42.4 million, much higher than the year-ago operating loss of $5.2 million, owing to escalating operating expenses.DexCom exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $85.3 million.DexCom continues to make considerable progress with advanced Sensor technologies, including Gen 6.DexCom is also working on a new insertion system, new low-cost, high-quality receiver, and several generations of transmitters, which are designed to be more suitable for patients.

What is this lesser known part of the healthcare industry? Medical devices.Unlike pharmaceuticals, medical devices are not nearly as susceptible to generic competition, and their often high learning curves can help to create high switching costs among their users, which can lead to favorable economics. Better yet, the wind is at their backs as an industry; aging populations and the growth of emerging markets factor nicely into this industry's long-term playbook.We asked our team of Motley Fool contributors to pitch a medical equipment or device stock that they believe could make a nice addition to your portfolio. Read below why we think that  ,  , and  might be worth buying. : The convergence of technology and medicine is leading to a wave of innovation designed to improve health, including the use of data analytics to track and report real-time blood-sugar levels in diabetics. At the forefront of this emerging trend is  , a maker of glucose monitoring sensors and devices.DexCom's products are used by type 1 and type 2 diabetics to better control their diseases, and sales are soaring. In Q2, DexCom reports sales jumped 59%, to $93.2 million.You're right to think that DexCom's growth is impressive, but even better days may lie ahead of it. According to the International Diabetes Federation, the number of diabetics globally is going to jump by 205 million people during the next 20 years. If they're right, there's going to be a massive need for medtech products like DexCom's that may slow the disease's progression.To address that opportunity, DexCom announced last month that it's  with Google to develop inexpensive miniaturized electronics that can be used in small, bandage-sized, disposable sensors. If that effort pans out, then it will serve as yet another reason why DexCom is one medtech company worth owning. : One of my favorite reasons that I like to invest in MedTech stocks is that they tend to offer high switching costs. After all, once a healthcare provider goes through the arduous process of learning how to use the device, they will likely be highly reluctant to switch to another device, even if there's a cost savings to doing so.One of my favorite companies in the space that offers tremendous switching costs is  , the worldwide leader in robotic surgery. Once a hospital takes on the expense of installing a machine, and one of its doctors is trained for hours on how to operate it, you can bet that they would be extremely resistant to learning another system.Intuitive Surgical produces the da Vinci surgical systems, which allow physicians to remotely control robotic arms that allow for minimally invasive surgical procedures. The system offers doctors greater access and visibility into a variety of surgical procedures, and it offers patients fewer scars, less blood loss, and a shorter stay at the hospital.Intuitive offers investors a terrific razor/razor blade business model that creates revenue from both sales of the systems themselves, as well as from consumables used in every procedure performed. In addition, the company inks a high-margin service contract along with every system sold that helps to juice the bottom line, which creates a nice one, two, three punch that should keep the dough flowing into shareholders' pockets for years.Shares in this best-of-breed medical-device maker rarely come cheap; even now, the shares are trading for a steep 38 times trailing earnings. However, Intuitive is a leader in the space, and is nicely positioned to continue to dominate the growing robotic surgery market. Investors who want in on this long-term trend might want to add some shares to their portfolios today, and add more on any weakness in the share price. :  is an under-the-radar global surgical-implant company with high-growth potential, and a manageable risk profile that investors may want to check out. The company has three core business segments, namely biologic-based allograft and xenograft implants, hardware composed of metal and synthetic-based implants, and focused products such as nanOss advanced bone graft substitute, Fortiva porcine dermis, and map3 allograft.The key reason to keep an eye on this small-cap medtech company is that management has outlined a bold plan to grow its revenue by 92%, and improve operating margins by more than 300% from 2014 levels. To achieve this goal, management believes that focused products will lead the way, along with an expanding international footprint, especially in Asia.The good news is that RTI posted a 10% increase in total revenues, to $71.6 million in the second quarter compared to a year ago, on a constant-currency basis. And its gross profits edged higher by low single digits, as well, in the first half of 2015, relative to a year ago. Management therefore appears to be delivering -- at least so far -- on its stated goal of reaching $500 million in revenue, and improving profitability, making this an intriguing stock to watch in the crowded medtech space.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The fully portable product is the first and solitary CGM system permitted by the FDA for use in both adults and children above two years of age.The transmitter, with in-built Bluetooth, sends essential glucose information directly to an app on iOS-enabled devices for instantaneous diabetes supervision. The company intends to launch the app for android devices in early 2016.Per the company's management, shipment of the G5 Mobile system will commence in late September, this year. Meanwhile, the upgrade charge will be low for systems under warranty period. However, purchasers of DexCom's G4 Platinum with Share system, from Aug 1, 2015 till the shipment of G5 Mobile system, will be able to upgrade without incurring extra cost.Like its forerunner, the G5 system allows users to choose up to five recipients or 'followers', who can distantly keep tabs on a patient's glucose information and receive alerts from anywhere.DexCom, of late, has been reasonably focused on improving diabetes management by rolling out technologies for continuous glucose monitoring devices. In January this year, the company received the FDA approval for its DexCom G4 PLATINUM Continuous Glucose Monitoring System with Share. Following that, the company launched the app for Apple  watch in April. In the month of June, the app was made available for the android community as well.We believe that the G5 system will allow DexCom to gain better market traction.

Given the recent market sell-off, companies like these three may be offering investors an opportunity to buy.Source: Masimo Corp Masimo manufactures medical devices used to monitor patient health, including pulse oximeters that are used to measure oxygen levels in patient blood. The company generates its sales directly and via royalties earned on sales of products by companies licensing its technology, including  and  .In the second quarter, Masimo's product revenue rose 10.6% to $147.6 million, leading to total revenue, including royalty payments, of $155.7 million, up 10.5% year over year.In addition to growing its top line by a double digit percentage, Masimo is leveraging growth for bottom line upside, too. Second quarter non-GAAP net income improved to $23.1 million, or $0.43, from $14.1 million, or $0.25 last year.Because sales and profit have (so far) outpaced its internal forecast this year, Masimo upped its full year outlook in August and, based on that guidance, Masimo expects to deliver top line and GAAP bottom line results of $621 million and $1.43 per share, respectively, up from prior guidance for $608 million and $1.33 per share, respectively.Since Masimo shares have retreated about 9% in the past week, it could be the perfect time to sprinkle some shares of this medtech company into portfolios.Source: Abiomed A 60% jump in U.S. sales of Abiomed's Impella line of blood pumping devices used in heart disease patients continues a string of rapid growth that has been driving shares in the company higher.The company's success is being supported this year by the recent launch of the Impella 2.5, which expands Abiomed's position in high risk heart procedures.In its most recently reported fiscal first quarter, Abiomed notched sales of $73.4 million, up 50% from last year, and delivered EPS of $0.20, which was handily north of analysts $0.08 forecast. Following that performance, Abiomed now expects its full year sales will eclipse $300 million in 2015, up from its prior estimates for sales of at least $285 million.If Abiomed delivers on that revenue goal, then it should have little trouble rewarding investors with earnings growth. In the past month, analysts have boosted their fiscal 2016 full year EPS forecast to $0.75 from $0.60 and increased their 2017 full year EPS forecast to $1.10 from $0.87. Although those increases aren't enough to make Abiomed a cheap stock, its rapid growth and debt-free balance sheet could make it worth buying; especially if it continues to drop.Source: DexComFew healthcare trends are likely to provide the tailwinds for demand for care than the rising diabetes prevalence.The International Diabetes Federation estimates that there are 387 million people with diabetes worldwide and that there will be 592 million people with diabetes by 2035. That's a shocking forecast, but if it proves to be true, then there will be exponentially greater demand in the future for devices like DexCom's, which are used by both type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients to track and chart their blood sugar levels.By tracking blood sugar continuously, patients are better able to manage when to administer insulin, which may help reduce the likelihood of diabetes related diseases, such as heart disease, that can be caused by poorly controlled blood sugar over time.The potential to better control diabetes is already resonating with doctors and patients. Last year, DexCom's sales grew 62% to $259.2 million and sales total $165.7 million through the first six months of this year, up 58% from a year ago.That's impressive, but ongoing innovation could lead to sensors that are placed on the skin like a Band-Aid, rather than inserted under the skin, and that could result in even greater growth. Earlier this month, DexCom  to develop next generation miniature electronics that could be used to create smaller and less intrusive sensors than exist today.With a strong balance sheet, a growing installed customer base, and demographics offering significant potential market growth, DexCom could also be a profit friendly long haul investment worth considering.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The American Diabetes Association estimates that about 29 million Americans had either type 1 or type 2 diabetes in 2012, and the numbers get bigger in a hurry when you include the rest of the world.Medtronic is currently the leader in selling medical devices that help patients control their blood sugar levels, as the company has long dominated the market for both insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring devices. In fiscal year 2015, which ended for the company in April, Medtronic reported preliminary net sales of more than $1.7 billion from its diabetes division, up more than 9% over the previous year on a constant currency basis, making it one of the faster-growing divisions in the company.Source: Animas.More recently, diabetes pump upstart  announced that the FDA has approved the sale of its t:slim G4 pump that works with the Dexcom's G4 system. Since its launch, Tandem has been attracting customers at a rapid pace, as its sleek insulin pump features a touchscreen interface many patients find appealing.Source: Tandem Diabetes.The company has been chipping away at market share of the pump market since its launch, and it managed to ship an impressive 3,331 pumps in the second quarter alone, up a sharp 49% over the year-ago period, and that was  having a continuous glucose monitor hooked up to it. Now that the t:slim G4 insulin pump is approved, Tandem should see sales accelerate from their already torrid pace, which could cause a flood of patients to move away from Medtronic's offerings.Another player in the space that has been a thorn in Medtronic's side for years is  , which offer patients a tubeless insulin pump. While it looks like it will still be some time before this company will incorporate a continuous glucose monitor directly into its handheld receiver, they have already announced that they are working with -- you guessed it -- Dexcom on doing just that.640G insulin pump. Source: Medtronic.Mind you, Medtronic isn't exactly sitting still as these smaller players offer unique features that set them apart from the giant. It has announced a new system it calls the 640G, which is currently being sold overseas and looks to finally bring the look of the company's pump into the 21st century. It features a brand-new layout and color screen that should appeal to its customers who have been choosing more user-friendly options, though it should be noted that it will not feature a touchscreen.However, this new pump may still help set it apart from competitors, as it will feature the ability to suspend delivery of insulin as a patient's glucose levels get low, and resume pumping once glucose levels have a chance to recover. If the company can get that approved, it would certainly be an important step in the race to create an artificial pancreas. The pump will also work with a newer version of the company's sensor, dubbed the Enhanced Enlite, that promises greater accuracy and increased patient comfort.The 640G is currently available for sale overseas, but the device has not yet been submitted to the FDA, as phase 3 clinical trials for the device are currently under way.Competition in the space continues to look fierce as these companies battle head-to-head for dominance in the space. Medtronic is still far and away the leader, and the odds look good that it will continue to hold that title for the foreseeable future, but it's by no means my favorite name for investing in the space. Medtronic investors would be wise to watch these smaller competitors closely.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

However, net loss per share was narrower than the year-ago equivalent of 9 cents.Second-quarter revenues surged nearly 58.5% year over year to $93.2 million, which handily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $85 million. The upside was driven by an impressive 59.6% jump in product revenues.Average selling price (ASP) for sensors was at the high end of the company's stated range of $70\u2212$75 per sensor while ASP for Dexcom's hardware stayed at approximately at $850 to $900 per starter kit.Gross margin expanded 290 basis points (bps) year over year to 70.8%, primarily on the back of higher revenues and a favorable product mix, comprising roughly 30% durable and 70% consumable in the quarter.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) and research and development (R&D) expenses rose 46.3% and 64.9% year over year to $45.2 million and $24.4 million, respectively, owing to increased marketing expenses, additional payroll related costs and expenses related to work on near-term product pipeline as well as an advanced product suite.DexCom reported operating loss of $3.6 million, lower than the year-ago operating loss of $5.8 million, thanks to higher revenues, offset by increasing operating expenses.DexCom had cash and cash equivalents of $67.7 million as of Jun 30, 2015, higher than $54.2 million as of Mar 31, 2015.DexCom expects to launch G5 mobile system for both pediatrics and adults in 2015. The company is well on track to conduct a pre-pivotal study with its gen 6 sensors later this year. Following that, the company will look to commence a pivotal study. DexCom expects to launch gen 6 in early 2017.The company is initiating investments in its real-time analytics platform, given that G4 PLATINUM is gaining significant market traction.DexCom raised its revenue guidance from a range of $340-$360 million to a range of $350-$375 million. The company expects to make additional investments prior to the rollout of the G5 mobile system. Hence, SG&A expenses are expected to increase 25% on a year-over-year basis in 2015.In the near term, DexCom expects gross margin to remain at about 70%, but gross margin on hardware is expected to be lower, going forward, due to the roll out of the G5 mobile transmitter. Management expects the product mix between durable and consumable products to remain steady at 30% and 70%, respectively.DexCom's healthy product pipeline is a major positive. The company plans to launch several new products in 2015. We feel the pipeline approvals and their subsequent launches will benefit DexCom's long-term prospects and drive significant top-line growth. However, higher product development costs and R&D expenses will continue to hurt margins in the near term.Currently, DexCom has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Because diabetes can lead to life-threatening conditions, such as heart disease, it is one of the most worrisome healthcare epidemics on the planet.In an attempt to reduce the risk of developing these life-threatening diseases, it's incredibly important to help keep blood sugar in check. Unfortunately, DexCom estimates that an average diabetic spends greater than 70% of his or her time outside of a healthy blood glucose range.For that reason, glucose monitors like those sold by DexCom are being increasingly more widely used by both type 1 and type 2 diabetics to get real-time insight into their blood sugar, including trending data that can be sent directly to a smartphone like handset. Using this data, diabetes patients can more accurately determine whether or not to eat or take their insulin, reducing the risks of blood sugar highs and lows.Currently, sensors used in these devices are inserted under the skin, but with the help of Google's miniature electronics research, DexCom hopes to create tiny bandage-sized sensors that are cheap and disposable. If the company can do that, then these sensors could displace the need for finger sticks for most, if not all, patients.\"This partnership has the potential to change the face of diabetes technology forever,\" said Kevin Sayer, president and chief executive officer of DexCom. \"Working together, we believe we can introduce products that will move us beyond our core Type 1 business to become the standard of care for all people living with diabetes.\" DexCom is paying Google $35 million in DexCom stock up front as well as potential milestones up to $65 million in cash or stock and single-digit royalties on any sales above $750 million. In exchange, DexCom will gain access to Google's vast expertise in miniaturizing electronics and information delivery.Google's glucose monitoring expertise comes courtesy of GoogleX, a company research lab that developed a contact lens that uses miniature electronics and a glucose sensor to monitor sugar levels in a patient's tears. The contact lens evaluates the tears using glitter-sized processing chips and then transmits the findings to a device, such as a smartphone, via an antenna that's thinner than human hair.DexCom and Google hope to leverage that expertise to build and then connect bandage-sized sensors automatically to the cloud, allowing data collected by them to be easily shared to any Internet-connected device or platform.DexCom expects the first products from this collaboration to hit the market in the coming three years with additional products coming in five years. Because developing a cloud-based sensor could conceivably make DexCom's sensors device-agnostic, it could significantly broaden the company's share of the glucose monitoring market to more type 2 diabetics, and since these sensors will be disposable, these sensors could create an important and ongoing revenue stream for the company.Given the size of the global diabetes market, tapping into the larger type 2 market could significantly grow DexCom's already fast-growing business. Last year, the company's sales grew 62% to $259.2 million and that momentum carried over into 2015 with DexCom reporting sales of $165.7 million through the first six months, up 58% year over year.Since DexCom is a much smaller company than Google and the potential market for these sensors is large, this deal could prove to be more shareholder-friendly to DexCom investors than to Google investors. For that reason, I think DexCom is worth considering for long-haul portfolios. Because Google is willing to accept shares in DexCom as payment, it would seem that the company agrees.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The goal of the partnership is to combine each of their areas of expertise to make it easier for people with diabetes to successfully manage their disease. The companies have stated their intentions to develop a range of future solutions that will allow for patients with diabetes to have easier access to viewing their data, with the ultimate goal of fully integrating mobile and wearable devices into a complete diabetes management system.For Samsung, this partnership will provide a foot in the door in the important health-related wearables market, as they are desperately trying to keep pace with  . Apple is pushing hard to be an important player in the space, as is evident from the company's recent product launches like Health Kit, Research Kit, and the Apple Watch. Establishing a direct relationship with a medical device giant like Medtronic appears to be a sound strategy for carving out a space in the market.This deal also makes a lot of sense for Medtronic, as Samsung is a huge player in the consumer electronics market, and it's likely that a huge number of patients using Medtronic's devices already have a Samsung device. Medtronic is currently a huge player in the diabetes device market -- the company rang up more than $1.6 billion in sales in 2014 from the sale of its insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring devices.In a separate but related announcement, Medtronic also stated that it received FDA approval for the MiniMed Connect. The Connect consists of a small uploader device that allows for data from Medtronic's insulin pump or continuous glucose sensor to talk directly to a mobile phone. This data can then be viewed directly on the phone itself or relayed to the cloud for viewing on a variety of Internet-enabled devices. Once in the cloud the data could then be shared with a variety of healthcare providers like family members, school nurses, or physicians.Image: MedtronicThe Minimed Connect will go on sale for $199 this fall, and will initially be rolled out on only to iOS devices like the iPhone and iPod touch in the U.S. Medtronic did mention they plan to make the device available for Android users as well, and the company is planning on taking additional steps with Samsung mobile devices specifically, which includes developing their custom own app to optimize the experience.If this idea sounds familiar, it should, as Medtronic's smaller but faster growing glucose sensor rival Dexcom recently launched a similar product. The Dexcom G4 Platinum with Share went on sale earlier this year, and the device allows for Dexcom's receiver device to communicate with Apple's iOS product directly. Dexcom's system doesn't require a separate uploader like Medtronic does, and Dexcom's system is already integrated into the Apple Watch as well.However, Medtronic's device may be more useful to providers than Dexcom's currently is, as the Connect will share insulin pump related data as well. Perhaps that extra data will be enough of an advantage to entice their users to carry yet another device on them all the time. It's hard to imagine that this device's $199 price tag will come close to directly impacting Medtronic's financial statements. Diabetes Forecast magazine noted that in 2014 only about 350,000 U.S. patients currently used an insulin pump. Even if you assume that, say, 300,000 of those use Medtronic and 100% of them get the Connect, that's only $60 million or so in revenue, which is a rounding error for the company. After all, Medtronic rang up more than $17 billion in total sales in 2014, and the diabetes division contributed $1.6 billion to that number.However, the diabetes division remains important to Medtronic, as it is one of the company's fastest growing segments, so its good to see them investing in this kind of innovation. While the Connect itself doesn't appear to be a huge money maker for the company, it could be a nice piece of technology that helps to expand Medtronic's diabetes ecosystem. Keeping users inside that ecosystem is vital to helping the diabetes division grow. Medtronic faces some serious competition on this front from the likes of  's Animas division, which recently launched a competing sensor augmented pump of their own. There are also several smaller insulin pump rivals in the space like  and  , who have been eating away market share.This partnership seems like a great deal for both Medtronic and Samsung, and if it even slightly works to help keep patients inside the Medtronic ecosystem, it sounds like a big win for the company. However, if you are interested in investing in the diabetes market, I think there are  out there for you to focus your attention on.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed. And if you act quickly, you could be among the savvy investors who enjoy the profits from this stunning change.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include the  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .Over the last couple of years, the very mention of the word \"apple\" first draws up a sleek, white, bitten-off reflection of the fruit rather than the red and juicy illustration of it. That's precisely how popular the company  (  ) has grown to be.Planted way back in 1976, Apple has revolutionized the way the world looks at computing. Today, this consumer electronics company is set to alter the face of the healthcare industry with its latest fruit - the Apple Watch - ripe to be plucked.Apple's smartwatch, announced in Sep 2014 and made available for pre-order on Apr 10, 2015, is already anticipated to be seen on more than 2.3 million wrists, once shipping begins on Apr 24. Interestingly, this translates to more sales than that recorded by all Android smartwatch manufacturers in 2014.Until now, the smartwatch was seen as a niche product appealing only to hardcore tech users and calorie-counting fitness buffs. However, thanks in large part to the positive reception of the Apple Watch, one can be sure that the company's latest device will make smartwatches mainstream.As this technology becomes more commonplace in the world of consumer electronics, it will also make inroads into the medical world, where it has a lot to offer.Healthcare, often viewed as an industry that is slow to adopt the latest technology, is actually standing on the threshold of transformative change. Currently valued at $2.9 trillion, the U.S. healthcare industry is more concerned than ever about monitoring a patient's health outside the walls of the hospital through intelligently connected devices.A number of technology companies are releasing wearable devices that can double as health trackers. From headsets that measure brainwaves to clothes that incorporate sensing devices to smartwatches that allow fitness tracking, personal health monitoring is the wave of the future.In the medical world, where pagers and landline phones are still widely used by doctors to coordinate care, an effective wrist-based communication tool allows for continuous monitoring of a patient's health. The use of smartwatches in healthcare communication, in particular, has the potential to improve the speed and quality of care delivery.While the monitoring of activity, sleep cycles, pulse rate and other physiological parameters has become state of the art in today's smartwatches, the latest devices have a dozen other applications that can not only help people to keep fit, but in extreme cases to stay alive.Specific applications designed for select groups like heart patients, diabetic patients and epileptic patients can actually be used by doctors to continuously track the patient's health vitals, flagging clinicians when signs fall below normal, thus allowing them to adjust treatments accordingly and deliver better patient outcomes.Apple Watch, which pairs with the users' iPhones via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, is being endorsed as a comprehensive health and fitness device. While it allows users to send and receive text messages, speak into the phone to search content and answer calls, health monitoring is actually believed to be a major feature of the watch.From collecting data in new ways to helping hospitals reduce costly emergency room visits, the potential of Apple's smartwatch in healthcare is something that cannot be ignored.Although reception to smart watches from device makers like Samsung and Sony has been tepid, healthcare companies are not the ones to dismiss a new offering from Apple as it brings with it a new level of technological power, not to mention brand appeal.To tap the power of Apple's latest device, a number of healthcare companies are seen developing and announcing a plethora of medical apps for the Apple Watch platform. We believe that Apple will, in fact, need the support of these app developers, health care companies and medical technology companies to create the functions to give people a reason to want to wear a computer around their wrist all the time.By way of this rationale, as the Apple Watch begins to shine on people's wrists, it will throw some spotlight on the healthcare industry as a whole.As healthcare stands to greatly benefit from the adoption of smartwatches, we feel the time is ripe for investors to enter the arena and ride the approaching wave of growth.Several health and health care companies came out to show off their new Apple Watch apps at the 2015 Healthcare Information Management Systems Society (HIMSS) conference held at Chicago this month. While all the apps need to prove their worth in order to reserve a spot on the tiny wrist-based screen, we believe that the Apple Watch apps of the following three companies stand a good chance to do so.A favorable Zacks Rank and an impressive Growth Score (for explanation, please see our  ) lend additional credence to the growth prospects of these companies: (  )Developer of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, DexCom has made its G4 PLATINUM CGM System with Share app available on the Apple Watch.Being among the first in the category to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, DexCom's app will allow diabetic patients to track their blood glucose statistics right from their wrist. The app will also allow them to share this information with caregivers, parents, doctors, or other authorized individuals and send an alert when the glucose levels are beyond the normal range.Flaunting a Growth Score of 'A,' DexCom has seen solid activity on the earnings estimate revision front as well, suggesting that analysts are gaining more confidence on its prospects in both the short and the long term. Over the past 60 days, estimates for the current year have doubled from a penny to 2 cents a share, while for the next year it has improved 9.5% to 46 cents a share.Currently, DexCom carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). (  )One of the leading providers of cloud-based services and electronic health records (EHR) for hospitals and clinics, athenahealth introduced a new care coordination and communication Apple Watch app - AthenaText.The app is designed to help providers quickly locate and communicate with other members of a patient's care team and support staff. The AthenaText app can sync care coordination activities and information across multiple devices so that the patient record is always up to date. Providers will also be able to refer a patient across town, request a peer consult, or ask for a specialist's recommendation. While the initial version of the app will provide read-only capabilities, athenahealth is expected to add interactive capabilities in June.Currently, athenahealth sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Growth Score of 'B'. Moreover, the firm has also been enjoying positive estimate revisions over the past month which has caused the Zacks Consensus Estimate to climb 4.5% to its current level of 23 cents a share for the current year and 2.2% to its current level of 46 cents per share for fiscal 2016. (  )Healthcare information technology company Cerner launched its patient engagement app - HealtheLife - on the Apple Watch.The app, designed with push notification reminders to track health data and a display dashboard for tracked metrics, will help patients manage their own health, thus building a healthier community. With patients' consent, the data will be sent directly to the Cerner Millennium EHR which will help providers focus on personalized patient care and population health management.Cerner's population health management and care coordination offerings are important growth catalysts for the company. We believe that an expansion of such services will enhance the company's visibility, which, in turn, will drive top-line growth.Moreover, it is worth mentioning that Cerner, holding a Zacks Rank #3 and a Growth Score of 'B,' has an expected long-term earnings growth of 17.3%, higher than the industry growth of 16.8%.Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .Zacks Equity Research provides the best of quantitative and qualitative analysis to help investors know what stocks to buy and which to sell for the long-term.Continuous coverage is provided for a universe of 1,150 publicly traded stocks.

Technology giant Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) much anticipated device, Apple Watch, is set to hit the stores on Apr 24.Following the announcement, shares of DexCom climbed as much as 5.4% to touch an intra-day high of $68.49 on Apr 10, pulling back to close the day at $67.89. We note that shares of this San Diego, CA-based company have gained nearly 23% so far this year.Notably, DexCom CGM and its mobile apps - Share 2 and Follow - are already approved by the FDA and allow both users and followers to view glucose data directly on their Apple iPhone or iPod Touch.The \"Share\" and \"Follower\" apps, which are currently available on the Apple App Store at no additional charge will also be available for free download from the Apple Watch App Store starting Apr 24.With the availability of CGM apps on the Apple Watch, caregivers and people with diabetes will have the opportunity to track their glucose levels and trends in a convenient and discreet manner right from their wrist. Additionally, patients or \"Sharers\" will be allowed to invite up to five people to view their glucose information and send an alert when the sharer's glucose levels are outside the normal range.We feel that DexCom is making significant efforts to provide its patients with access to the most current technology to better manage diabetes. As technology is becoming a more relevant and indispensable part of people's lives, we feel that such business opportunities will go a long way in enhancing the visibility of DexCom's products and services.Moreover, strategic deals with companies like Apple, which have a vast global presence, will boost DexCom's business scale massively. By expanding its range of solutions and services, DexCom will not only improve its international presence but will also enhance its top-line growth opportunities.Currently, DexCom carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the medical instruments industry include Inogen  , Abiomed  and Fluidigm Corp  . While Inogen sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), both Abiomed and Fluidigm carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

One interesting put contract in particular, is the September put at the $50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $2.85. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 5.7% return against the $50 commitment, or a 10.8% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to DXCM's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $50 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless DexCom Inc sees its shares decline 14.3% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $47.15 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $2.85 from $50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 10.8% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for DexCom Inc, and highlighting in green where the $50 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the September put at the $50 strike for the 10.8% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for DexCom Inc (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $58.38) to be 42%. For other put options contract ideas at the various different available expirations, visit the  page of StockOptionsChannel.com.In mid-afternoon trading on Tuesday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 754,604 contracts, with call volume at 967,913, for a put:call ratio of 0.78 so far for the day, which is unusually high compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65. In other words, there are lots more put buyers out there in  so far today than would normally be seen, as compared to call buyers.  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) reported fourth-quarter 2014 EPS of 2 cents per share, which compares favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 3 cents and year-ago loss of 4 cents per share.The impressive result was driven by a 64.3% surge in revenues, which totaled $84.3 million, much ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $79 million. The upside was driven by an impressive 63.1% jump in product revenues.Gross margin expanded 400 basis points (bps) year over year to 70.5%, primarily on the back of improving product mix, which was roughly 30% durable and 70% consumable in the quarter.Average selling price (ASP) for sensors remained constant at approximately $73 per sensor and the ASP for Dexcom's hardware stayed at approximately at $850 to $900 per starter kit.Both selling, general and administrative (SG&A) and research and development (R&D) expenses rose 52.1% and 71.4% year over year, respectively, owing to increased marketing expenses, higher sales commissions, additional payroll related costs and expenses related to work on near-term product pipeline as well as advanced product suite.Despite the increase in both R&D and SG&A expenses, DexCom reported operating income of $1.6 million compared with the year-ago loss of $2.3 million, riding on strong revenue growth and higher gross margin base.DexCom had cash and cash equivalents of $71.8 million as of Dec 31, 2014, higher than $63.2 million as of Sep 30, 2014. Total long-term debt went down to $4.6 million from $5.2 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2013.DexCom launched a total of five new products in 2014, compared to three worldwide product launches in the previous two years combined. Management plans at least five more launches in 2015. Depending upon execution and regulatory time frame, DexCom expects the count to increase to as many as ten products in 2015.In January, DexCom received the FDA approval for its G4 PLATINUM Continuous Glucose Monitoring System with Share. The Dexcom Share receiver uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to connect patient's receiver and an app on the patient's smartphone. With this, the receiver will be able to transfer glucose information to apps on the mobile devices of up to five recipients.The recipients, or followers, can then supervise a patient's glucose information and receive alert notifications from anywhere via their Apple (  ) iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. The company plans to extend this service to the Android platform as well.DexCom also announced that the Share Receiver will be compatible with the G5 mobile system. Most recently, the company submitted its G5 mobile PMA supplement to the FDA. The company expects an approval by the end of 2015.DexCom expects product revenues to be in the range of $340 million to $360 million. Approximately 40% to 45% of this revenue is expected to be generated in the first half, while the remaining is likely to come in the back half, much similar to the 2014 trend.First-quarter 2015 revenues are expected to be approximately 20% of full-year revenues. However, first-quarter results are expected to be negatively impacted by seasonality as well as the financial impact of the launch of Share Receiver upgrade program. DexCom expects product gross margin to be down sequentially in the first quarter, but margins are likely to return to normal over the course of 2015.For 2015, R&D expenses are expected to jump almost 25% on a reported basis, owing to higher overhead and share-based compensation expenses.DexCom reported profits for the first time in its history in the fourth quarter. The company's revenue beat is also encouraging. The company boasts a robust product pipeline with the recent launch of DexCom SHARE - the first FDA-approved mobile remote monitoring system - and the new software for its G4 Platinum CGM System.DexCom is riding high on the back of a number of FDA approvals received over the past few months. In Nov 2014, the FDA approved a new algorithm designed for DexCom's G4 Platinum Continuous Glucose Monitoring system.We feel these approvals will benefit DexCom's long-term prospects. Once the approved products are launched in the market, these will help drive significant top-line growth. However, intensifying competition and a tepid first-quarter outlook will remain overhangs on the stock.Currently, DexCom carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the medical instruments industry include Abiomed (  ) and Luminex (  ). Both the companies sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because DXCM is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings-with the most up-to-date information possible-is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for DXCM in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at a loss of 1 cent per share for DXCM, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate, which is at a loss of 3 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for DXCM, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 66.67% heading into earnings season.A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that DXCM has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for DexCom, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Healthcare providers are expected to spend more on the backdrop of an improving U.S. economy, which will eventually drive top-line growth. Additionally, the recent legislation to repeal a much debated 2.3% federal excise tax under Obamacare is good news for these companies, as it will improve their bottom line.However, to date, the Oct-Dec quarter results failed to show any significant improvement for these companies. Meanwhile, the overall earnings trend shows that a strong dollar is negatively impacting profitability. Most of the companies (particularly with International exposure) are expected to revise down their 2015 guidance due to unfavourable foreign exchange.Also, capital spending from hospitals and other medical centers are yet to show significant improvement that will offset this currency headwind. In fact, the revenue trend reflects that healthcare providers are pretty reluctant in making big ticket instrument purchases, primarily owing to reimbursement uncertainties.Despite the uncertainty currently looming over the medical instrument space, it might be a good idea to bet on a handful of stocks that are likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. An earnings beat will naturally translate into rapid price appreciation for these stocks.With the existence of a number of industry players, finding the right stocks that have the potential to beat earnings estimates could pose a difficult task. Our proprietary methodology, however, makes it fairly simple for you. You could narrow down the list of choices by looking at stocks that have the combination of a favourable Zacks Rank - Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) - and a positive  .Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for determining which stocks have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Our research shows that for stocks with this combination, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%.Given below are three medical instrument providers that have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: (  ) - The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an earnings ESP of +100%. This developer of continuous glucose monitoring systems recently reported preliminary product revenues for fourth-quarter 2014, which stands higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate.DexCom anticipates fourth-quarter product revenues to surge an impressive 64% on a year-over-year basis to $84 million. The company is riding high on the back of a number of FDA approvals as well as a robust pipeline. DexCom has received clearances from the FDA for G4 Platinum Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) system and the CGM remote mobile communications device - DexCom SHARE. The company also remains focused on introducing a steady stream of innovative products related to its sensor technology. (  ) is yet another Zacks Rank #3 stock that has an earnings ESP of +10.71%. This provider of automated, multiplex molecular diagnostic testing systems recently announced preliminary fourth-quarter results. The company anticipates revenues of $9.8 million, which highlights a 52% rise from the year-ago quarter figure.During the quarter, the company installed 38 XT-8 analyzers, which brought the total installed base to 540 analyzers within the U.S. market. GenMark also completed the development stage of the ePlex sample-to-answer system in the quarter. It expects to launch ePlex in Europe sometime around the middle of the year. The company plans to file for 510(k) approval with the FDA in the second half of the year.GenMark is set to report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2015 financial results on Feb 24. (  ) has a Zacks Rank #3 with an earnings ESP of +2.47%. This manufacturer of t:slim insulin pumps recently gained FDA approval to market t:flex Insulin Pump. At 480 units, t:flex's insulin reservoir has the largest capacity currently available in the U.S.The large capacity of the new pump will help the company to address the needs of teenagers with type 1 diabetes and many with type 2 diabetes. We believe that Tandem's diabetes management product portfolio keeps it well positioned to gain from rising diabetic population worldwide.Despite currency volatility and sluggish spending environment, we believe that rising demand for better healthcare at affordable cost will be a key growth driver for medical instrument suppliers in 2015.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Last time, Medtronic had posted a decent fiscal second-quarter 2015 with earnings in line and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Notably, on Jan 26, 2015, the company completed the long-awaited $42.9 billion takeover of its Irish counterpart, Covidien, subsequent to the receipt of the Irish Court's verdict in favor of the acquisition agreement.Medtronic's trailing four-quarter average earnings beat is pegged at 0.27%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Our proven model shows that Medtronic is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. Medtronic's  is +2.06%, since the Most Accurate estimate stands at 99 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 97 cents. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. Medtronic currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Medtronic's Zacks Rank #2 and +2.06% ESP makes us reasonably confident of a positive earnings beat at the company.Management at Medtronic, Inc. has recognized this historical merger, probably one of the largest in the MedTech industry, as a momentous event that will bring forth a unique company combining the extensive and innovative capacities of both Medtronic and Covidien.The combined entity, with an official joint force of over 85,000 employees present in more than 160 countries coupled with annual revenues of $27.4 billion in 2014, will now expedite Medtronic's fundamental strategies of therapy innovation, globalization and economic value.The combined business is expected to be divided into four major groups viz. Cardiac and Vascular Group (CVG), Diabetes Group, Restorative Therapies Group (RTG) and the new Covidien Group. The combined entity will operate in four major regions, namely, Asia Pacific, the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and China.We expect the newly formed Medtronic plc to win a larger market share owing to the combined strength of two MedTech behemoths, and garner more profits in the near term.However, margin pressure poses a major cause of worry. Moreover, headwinds such as unfavorable currency movement and global economic uncertainties persist. Based on current exchange rates, Medtronic expects to have a negative 50 to 60 basis point foreign exchange impact in the third and fourth fiscal quarters, which would result in reported gross margin on par with the comparable second quarter number.Here are three other companies you may want to consider as our model shows they also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:The Kroger Co. (  ) has an earnings ESP of +4.49% and a Zacks Rank #2. Kroger is expected to report its fourth-quarter earnings on Mar 5.Actavis plc (  ) has an earnings ESP of +4.38% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.

The \"Share\" and \"Follower\" apps will be available on the Apple App Store at no additional charge. The company plans to extend this service to the Android platform as well.DexCom is riding high on the back of a number of FDA approvals received over the past few months. In Nov 2014, FDA approved a new algorithm designed for DexCom's G4 Platinum Continuous Glucose Monitoring system.Prior to that, DexCom Share was cleared by the regulator in Oct 2014. We view that the company is making significant progress in extending Continuous Glucose Monitoring to mobile devices, in a bid to enhance customer convenience.We feel these approvals will benefit DexCom's long-term prospects. Once the approved products are rolled out in the market, these will help drive significant top-line growth.Notably, DexCom announced preliminary product revenues for fourth quarter and full year 2014.

Last quarter, the company had posted a positive earnings surprise of 0.88% while the four-quarter trailing average beat is pegged at 0.41%. Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Barring an unimpressive first quarter of 2014, CVS Health delivered two successive quarters of earnings and revenue beat in 2014. However, this being the first quarter that will see the full financial effect of the company's decision to exit the tobacco category, CVS expects profit growth in the fourth quarter to be somewhat lower than the sequentially previous numbers.However, we are encouraged that based on 15 successful selling seasons; the company has invested incrementally in the next season to ensure a successful migration of new customers.Over the quarters, the Pharmacy Services segment has been positively impacted by growth in specialty pharmacy and favorable purchasing economics while the Retail Pharmacy segment has benefited from increased sales and an improved margin rate, partially offset by incremental store operating costs associated with operating more number of stores.In the fourth quarter, within the retail segment, CVS expects revenues to be up 0.25% to 1.75% year over year. Adjusted script comps are expected to increase in the range of 3.5% to 4.5% while total same store sales growth are projected to remain in the range of negative 1% to positive 0.5%. The company expects front store same store sales to reflect a negative impact of approximately 900 basis points relative to the tobacco exit in the fourth quarter.On the bright side, the company expects expansion in retail gross margins in the fourth quarter driven by better purchasing economics which includes the quarterly payment from Cardinal Health as well as the exit from the tobacco business.In the PBM segment, the company expects revenues to increase 16.75% to 18.25% with adjusted claims to remain between 270 million and 275 million. However, the company expects a significant decline in PBM gross margins during the fourth quarter due to price compression and drug mix.Our proven model does not conclusively show that CVS Health is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is, however, not the case here as you will see below. CVS Health's earnings ESP is 0.00%, as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at $1.21. CVS Caremark has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are three companies you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.

By 2035, the worldwide number is estimated to grow to as many 592 million patients.Diabetes is a chronic disease caused by the body's inability to produce or effectively utilize insulin, which prevents the body from adequately regulating blood glucose levels.Diabetes is typically classified into two major groups: type 1 and type 2.Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the body attacking its own insulin-producing cells of the pancreas. Without any natural insulin production, patients with type 1 diabetes must rely on frequent insulin injections in order to regulate and maintain blood glucose levels. As of 2012, about 1.25 million American had been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes.Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder that results when the body is unable to produce sufficient amounts of insulin or becomes insulin resistant, and this type is much more common than type 1. About 19 million Americans have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, and a further 8.1 million have type 2 but remain undiagnosed.Treating diabetes is both complicated and costly. The most recent estimates from the American Diabetes Association indicate that total costs to treat diabetes in the U.S. reached $245 billion in 2012 alone, up from $174 billion in 2007.It's no surprise that a market with that level of spending has attracted investors' attention.There are plenty of ways for investors to gain exposure to the diabetes treatment market, such as Big Pharma companies like  ,  , and  , who produce a range of drugs used to treat the disease. On the opposite end of the diversity spectrum,  joined the game recently with its launch of Afrezza, an innovative inhaled insulin that eliminates the need for patients to take shots. Since MannKind has only this one drug approved, it is higher risk than its larger competitors, but it is more of a pure play on the diabetes treatment market.On the drug delivery side, investors can take a stake in insulin pump manufactures like  ,  , or  , all of which have products on the market for insulin delivery to diabetics.However, there is another company I've had my eye on for a few years, and its been one of my biggest mistakes as an an investor that I've never personally bought shares. The company has been a massive long winner, up a market-crushing 560% since going public in 2005 , leaving investor favorite MannKind in the dust. That company is  .Dexcom produces and sell a product called a continuous glucose monitor, which is a two-part device designed to shows users what their blood glucose level is  . Currently, most patients with diabetes check their glucose levels with a meter that requires the user to add a drop of blood to a strip to get a point-in-time reading. The problem with this method is that patients and providers do not get an accurate reading on what is happening with the patient's blood sugars throughout the day, as glucose levels can fluctuate rapidly.Dexcom's system shows a continuous graph of the patient's blood sugars levels, which can lead to better decisions about insulin dosages, ultimately providing for much better blood sugar control.Source: Dexcom 2014.Dexcom's solution has enjoyed rapid adoption since launching in 2006, and full-year revenue jumped an impressive 62% in 2014 to $259.2 million. Gross margins for the company have been going up, and in Q4 2014, they hit a very impressive 70%, which allowed the company to generate a profit for the first time ever. The balance sheet is strong as well, with $83 million in cash and equivalents versus $3 million in debt. Dexcom is giving investors plenty of reasons to believe growth will remain strong in the years ahead. The system received expanded approval in February 2014 for the pediatric market, providing a meaningful tailwind for the company.The company also has announced partnerships with several insulin pump manufacturers that will allow for the displaying of Dexcom's sensor readings directly on the pump itself, which eliminates the need to carry a separate Dexcom receiver.Source: AnimasAnimas Corp.'s Vibe insulin pump has this feature built in and received FDA approval in December 2014.  's  T:Slim pump is slated to have this feature as well, and this version is currently pending FDA approval. Dexcom has also announced a similar agreement with  's OmniPod system.Dexcom is only scratching the surface internationally, as well -- the company only generated 14% of its revenue outside the U.S. in 2014. Lastly, Dexcom has announced that its system will work with the  Watch, giving patients a much more convenient way to monitor what is happening with their blood sugar.Analysts predict the good times are going to continue to roll, with revenue expected to climb another 39% this year to $360 million and reach $489 million in 2016. As the company matures and economies of scale set in, margins should expand nicely, providing a big boost to the bottom line. Dexcom shares can hardly be called cheap, as they are currently trading at about 20 times  2014  .However, given the opportunity presented by such a large market, Wall Street is understandably excited about the company's future, and it's been bidding up shares to match the opportunity, particularly given that the company is finally profitable.There is a chance the stock price has gotten ahead of itself, but given that Dexcom has proven its technology is well-liked by patients and providers, and has plenty of room for growth ahead, the company remains my favorite way to invest in diabetes.

Which technologies might move the needle most? Three Motley Fool analysts offer insight into what they believe could have a transformative effect on the sector. :One fascinating healthcare field to watch over the next few decades is prosthetic limb technology. Touch Bionics and Ottobock are among the companies that manufacture and install cutting-edge robotic hands and legs that can greatly improve quality of life for amputees.Touch Bionics' i-limb hand reads electrical signals from a patient's remaining limb to control the hand's movements. Whereas these readings once could produce only a single grip pattern, the i-limb lets an amputee move all five fingers, allowing him or her to dial the phone or even type. Ottobock's C-Leg, which uses sensors to make real-time adjustments in the prosthetic knee and leg, lets amputees run and ride bicycles.Meanwhile, a stretchable synthetic skin from a team of South Korean researchers could one day help amputees regain their sense of touch via ultra-thin \"nano-wires.\" The skin, which must be connected to a patient's central nervous system, is still undergoing animal testing.Looking even further ahead, scientists could eventually print out fully organic limbs. Last July, scientists at the University of Nottingham in England printed out \"bones\" by feeding the polymer polylactic acid and gel-like alginate through a 3D printer. The printer then coated the \"bone\" with adult stem cells, which could grow into tissue and muscle.Combining all of these technologies could produce a huge leap forward in prosthetics, and allow doctors to seamlessly rebuild amputees' missing limbs.Source: Dexcom. : Tackling the global spread of diabetes won't be easy, but technological advances such as next-generation glucose monitors could be a good place to start. The number of people diagnosed with diabetes is set to soar from 365 million today to 552 million worldwide by 2030, and that will put significant pressure on the global healthcare system. According to a 2010 study from the International Diabetes Federation, global spending on diabetes will reach $490 billion per year in 2030. More important, the rising prevalence of diabetes means millions more people are likely to die from the disease. According to the American Diabetes Association, diabetes was the cause or a contributing cause in more than 234,000 deaths in the United States in 2010.If we hope to halt or reverse those numbers, we'll need to approach patient care more holistically, and that could mean looking beyond drug therapies toward  's continuous glucose monitoring sensors. Those sensors track and trend glucose levels, and alert patients when levels reach certain levels. By more accurately monitoring and treating these levels, patients might delay disease progression. That, in fact, could already be happening. Dexcom's sales jumped 60% in the past year to $68 million in the third quarter. But there's much work still to be done. Industry watchers estimate less than half of type 1 diabetics and an even smaller percentage of type 2 patients use monitors or insulin pumps to manage their disease. : One healthcare technology that is set to transform our lives over the next 10-20 years is vastly cheaper blood testing.Currently, traditional lab tests are handled by laboratory diagnostic companies such as  and  . These companies use expensive, older technology to turn around blood samples in a few days -- at relatively high cost, as vials need to be transported to central testing centers.Theranos, a private company, has developed a far less expensive lab test and charges at least 50% less than regular Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates. Theranos' test results are also turned around in hours rather than days and are less invasive, requiring just a prick of blood rather than a whole vial.As the company's mission states, \"Theranos is on a mission to make actionable health information accessible to people everywhere in the world at the time it matters, enabling early detection and intervention of disease, and empowering individuals with information to live the lives they want to live\"With significantly cheaper costs and easier access, blood tests could be conducted far more often to check for warning signs of diseases that currently are only screened for once every year or two. Catching diseases early generally lowers the cost of care and eases the difficulty of treatment.While it will be a few years before the technology rolls out across the country, Theranos has teamed up with  to launch testing centers, starting in California and Arizona and hopefully expanding to all of Walgreen's 8,100 drug stores.

The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true \"apples-to-apples\" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of DexCom Inc (Symbol: DXCM), the market cap is now $3.95B, versus Bemis Co Inc (Symbol: BMS) at $3.90B.Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of DXCM vs. BMS:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which indices will include the stock, and which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and \"tosses out\" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller \"up-and-comers\" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). And ETFs that directly follow an index like the S&P 500 will only own the underlying component of that index, selling companies that lose their status as an S&P 500 company, and buying companies when they are added to the index. So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at TheOnlineInvestor.com find value to putting together these looks at comparative market capitalization daily.At the closing bell, DXCM is down about 0.3%, while BMS is trading flat on the day Tuesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) saw a big move last session, as the company's shares fell by nearly 10% on the day.

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n trading on Wednesday, shares of DexCom Inc (Symbol: DXCM) crossed below their 200 day moving average of $38.92, changing hands as low as $38.80 per share.

The revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in the company's molecular diagnostics franchise and blood screening franchise, owing to the Japanese Red Cross deal. However, a consistent decline in U.S. ThinPrep pap test sales on account of interval expansion, partially offset these improvements. (37.7%) improved 3.1% year over year to $241.5 million. Revenue improvement was driven by strong growth in 3D mammography system sales, as well as service revenue growth from the growing installed base of digital mammography systems. However, the sales decline of 2D mammography systems, as transition of customers to Hologic's 3D systems continued (as Hologic expected), partially neutralized this improvement.The  business (12.3%) recorded revenues of $78.5 million, up 2.3% from the comparable prior-year period. This increase was owing to strong growth in global MyoSure system sales, partially neutralized by declines observed in U.S. NovaSure system sales.Revenues from  (3.7%) increased 10.4% year over year to $23.4 million, owing to growing sales of Hologic's new Horizon platform and to a lesser extent, an increase in sales of mini C-arm system sales.Hologic's gross margin was 52.2% in the reported quarter, up 550 basis points (bps) year over year from the year-ago equivalent tally of 46.7%.

In the reported quarter, all of Hologic's four business segments delivered positive growth for the first time. Management expects this progressive momentum of Hologic to continue over the long term as well.Recently, CMS has increased the reimbursement rates for Hologic's 3D mammography screening and diagnostic services. Per management, this will not only elevate Hologic's financial position but will also expand patient accessibility for this advanced technology, in the long run.

Medtronic posted positive sales growth across all three business groups -- cardiac and vascular, restorative therapies, and diabetes -- with the diabetes group posting impressive 13% growth thanks to strong sales of the MiniMed 530G.Source: YChartsDespite those robust earnings, Medtronic stock has remained nearly unchanged since the report, so investors are likely wondering if the stock will rise or fall in the near future. In a previous article, I discussed three reasons  . In this article, I'll highlight three reasons that it could also rise. Medtronic's proposed $42.9 billion acquisition of Dublin-based  will benefit the company in two ways -- a lower corporate tax bill and a much larger, $3.7 billion per year footprint across high-growth, emerging markets.However, an additional benefit could be a higher dividend. Since Medtronic is currently based in the U.S., all of its foreign profits (54% of its bottom line before taxes) must be repatriated to the U.S. before they can be used to pay dividends. That causes them to be taxed at the 35% U.S. corporate income tax rate, minus any foreign taxes already paid. If Medtronic moves to Ireland, that rate drops to 12.5%. Since Medtronic pays out nearly a third of its profits as dividends, that move would likely result in a much higher dividend for shareholders.Attracting more income investors would definitely fit into Medtronic's long-term strategy, since the company has raised its dividend for 37 consecutive years. In June, the company raised its quarterly dividend 9% to $0.305 per share, increasing its forward annual dividend yield to 2%. While that rate is definitely better than rival  , which pays 1.6%, it's still significantly lower than  's rate of 2.8%. Medtronic's MiniMed 530G with Enlite, which the FDA approved last September, consists of a continuous glucose monitor, or CGM, which commands an insulin pump to shut off insulin delivery when glucose levels fall below a preset threshold, making it the first \"wearable artificial pancreas\" in history.This allowed Medtronic to simultaneously gain market share in the CGM and insulin pump markets. Since the MiniMed 530G's introduction, the diabetes group has posted double-digit sales gains for three consecutive quarters.MiniMed 530G. Source: MedtronicThe global CGM market is expected to grow from $194.8 million in 2012 to $568.5 million by 2020, according to Allied Market Research. That growth is expected to be driven by a preference of CGMs over conventional devices and a rise in diabetes cases across the world.The MiniMed 530G could soon face competition from Johnson & Johnson and  's Animas Vibe, which could soon be approved by the FDA. However, the CGM market has such strong growth potential that there could be plenty of room for both products as well as other competitors. Meanwhile, Medtronic's next generation MiniMed 640G, which can predictively shut off insulin  low thresholds are met, could keep it a step ahead of the competition. Competitive pressure means that Medtronic will keep launching cutting-edge devices to remain ahead of the competition. Medtronic's fierce rivalry with St. Jude Medical yielded two of the company's most innovative products -- the Reveal LINQ miniaturized implantable cardiac monitor, or ICM, and Activa \"brain pacemaker.\"The Reveal LINQ is about one-third the size of a triple-A battery and about 80% smaller than comparable ICMs. The device is smaller than St. Jude's battery-size pacemaker, which the company gained through its acquisition of Nanostim last October. Both devices are leadless (they don't require wires that connect to the heart) and implanted through the femoral artery in the thigh. During  , CEO Omar Ishrak attributed the 4% growth of the cardiac rhythm and heart failure business --  -- directly to strong demand for the Reveal LINQ.Medtronic's Activa brain pacemaker uses deep brain stimulation, DBS, to treat neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease. DBS systems helped Medtronic's neuromodulation revenue rise 11% year over year to $479 million last quarter. St. Jude is also competing against Medtronic in this field with similar DBS devices.Stronger competition in ICMs, DBS systems, and artificial pancreases should encourage Medtronic to launch innovative new devices which could generate strong sales and keep it ahead of its rivals. In conclusion, Medtronic is a solid company which still has plenty of opportunities for fresh growth. A bigger dividend, a growing presence in the insulin pump and CGM market, and newer products on the horizon are just three reasons that Medtronic could still be a great long-term investment, even as the stock flirts with all-time highs. The smartest investors know that dividend stocks simply crush their non-dividend paying counterparts over the long term. That's beyond dispute.

The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist.

(Symbol: GHC) at $3.32B.Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of DXCM vs. GHC:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's).

These products helped diabetics track meals, insulin dosages, glucose levels, and medications. One major breakthrough was  's iBGStar Meter for iOS, which converts any iPhone into a strip-reading glucose monitor for type 1 diabetics.Sanofi's iBGStar. Source: Sanofi.Yet one product has remained elusive -- a wireless, continuous glucose monitor, or CGM, for smartphones that would eliminate daily pinpricks, remain concealed as a mobile app, and alert the user via push notifications when glucose levels hit certain thresholds. Such a device would also enable better tracking of daily glucose levels and allow easy data sharing with family members and medical professionals. could soon make that dream a reality with its new Bluetooth-enabled CGM for iOS, known as Guardian Mobile. The FDA has not approved the system yet, but the company recently told MobiHealthNews that it will start a \"pivotal clinical trial\" for the device later this fall. The Guardian Mobile would be a major upgrade for the company's top CGM, the Medtronic Guardian, which communicates wirelessly to a pager-sized device with a custom display. If approved, Medtronic's Guardian Mobile could be the first smartphone CGM to hit the market. The only potential competitors in this field are  , which filed a patent in January for a similar device, and Senseonics, which raised over $84 million to develop an embeddedcontinuous glucose monitor that can last for six months under the skin before being replaced.The Guardian Mobile would help Medtronic expand its reach in the growing global CGM market, which Allied Market Research estimates will grow from $194.8 million in 2012 to $568.5 million by 2020. That growth, unfortunately, will be fueled by rising diabetes rates across the world.The Guardian Mobile would also help Medtronic expand its presence in the mobile health, or mHealth, market, which Grand View Research estimates will grow from $1.95 billion in 2012 to $49 billion by 2020. This growth is expected to be fueled by growing smartphone shipments, which research firm IDC expects will rise from 1 billion units last year to 1.7 billion units in 2018. The Guardian Mobile CGM and app wouldn't be Medtronic's first move into the mHealth market -- the company has already launched 70 consumer-facing iOS apps for patients and doctors.Therefore, a device that straddles both the CGM and mHealth markets could achieve a much higher growth rate than standalone CGMs. Medtronic and Dexcom are the largest players incontinuous glucose monitors , and split the $250 million U.S. market roughly in half last year, according to Raymond James.Medtronic's Guardian system. Source: Medtronic.However, Medtronic made a breakthrough last September with FDA approval of the MiniMed 530G with Enlite, a first-generation \"  \" that connects a CGM to an insulin pump. The CGM signals the pump to halt insulin delivery once glucose levels drop below a preset threshold. Since theintroduction of the MiniMed 530G, Medtronic's diabetes group has reported double-digit revenue gains for three  . The diabetes group is Medtronic's smallest business, accounting for 9.7% of its top line, but it is also the fastest-growing unit.During Medtronic's  , CEO Omar Ishrak noted that the MiniMed 530G helped the company gain market share in pumps and CGMs simultaneously. The MiniMed 530G could face competition soon from Dexcom and  's Animas Vibe, a similar \"artificial pancreas\" that has already been approved in Europe, Australia, and Canada. That's why Medtronic is preparing to launch a second-generation device, the 620G, which predictively shuts off insulin delivery  low thresholds are met.Along with the MiniMed 530G, the Guardian Mobile could help the company's diabetes business continue growing and widen its lead over Dexcom and other CGM competitors. Medtronic's Guardian Mobile could be the first step toward linking diabetes patients to cloud-based solutions, although the system won't initially be compatible with  . That would certainly fit into Medtronic's long-term strategies -- in the past, it connected pacemakers to the Internet via its CareLink network. If systems such as Guardian Mobile are eventually synchronized with HealthKit, cloud-based electronic health reordss, and wearable technology, they could considerably improve the lives of type 1 diabetics within the next decade.Apple recently revealed the product of its secret-development \"dream team\" -- Apple Watch.

MannKind's Afrezza is already approved in the U.S.; Agios' drugs aren't out of phase 1 yet.Despite the early stage, which admittedly makes it risky, I think Agios has more potential. Just look at when their drugs were partnered:  licensed Afrezza after it was approved, and  teamed up with Agios before its drugs were even in the clinic. The amount of money they got upfront -- $150 million for MannKind and $130 million including an equity investment for Agios -- was also fairly similar, despite the difference in development stage.Agios' drugs are designed to attack cancer in a novel way by blocking altered metabolic activity caused by mutated proteins in cancer cells. If the drugs work, it won't be hard to convince doctors to use them, because the biology is straightforward. For MannKind's Afrezza, doctors are very comfortable with the way insulin helps diabetics, but they may not be nearly as comfortable delivering it through the lungs, especially since the FDA slapped a black box warning on the drug. : MannKind's Afrezza might go on to perform well commercially, but  looks to me like the better company. Novavax is a small-cap biopharma focusing on the development of nanoparticle-based vaccines and adjuvants for a host of common diseases in need of new therapeutic options -- such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), seasonal and pandemic flu types, among many others.While vaccines tend to have razor-thin margins, the dearth of commercially available treatments for RSV suggests that this program could have more pricing power.Perhaps the main reason I prefer Novavax over MannKind, though, is the lead role its platform should play in the future of vaccine development in general -- which to my mind gives the company more upside than a stock which is based really around one drug. MannKind, by contrast, simply isn't in the game of developing \"breakthrough\" therapies that could influence clinical outcomes across a wide diversity of diseases.Source: Dexcom. : MannKind's Afrezza is an intriguing drug, but  . Dexcom makes and sells the G4 Platinum, a continuous glucose monitor, or CGM, that provides diabetics with glucose levels every five minutes as well as displays the diabetics' glucose trend. Those sensors transmit data to a small device resembling a smartphone, allowing patients better insight into determining whether they should eat or take insulin. Since using Dexcom devices should reduce blood sugar highs and lows, Dexcom could play a big role in slowing disease progression to more life-threatening conditions, such as heart disease.Demand for Dexcom systems is growing quickly, with second-quarter sales jumping 64% to $58 million, and that's driving sales of Dexcom's high-margin disposable sensors. Rising sensor sales helped profit the company's gross margin climb from 66% exiting 2013 to 68% in Q2 (up from 61% last year). According to analysts, margin expansion will help Dexcom turn profitable next year, and if so, investors may find Dexcom's $3 billion market cap is too small relative to its total addressable market. According to research conducted by the University of Chicago, the number of diabetics in the U.S. is expected to double to 44 million people over the next 20 years. The best biotech investors consistently reap gigantic profits by recognizing true potential earlier and more accurately than anyone else. Let me cut right to the chase.

The company continues to expect improvement in gross margin in the year as volumes continue to rise, mainly consumable product sales.Operating expenses in the quarter jumped 53.6% to $42.1 million, driven by increased share-based compensation due to an uptrend in share price. Dexcom's non-cash equity related charges soared 86.8% to $9.9 million for the quarter from $5.3 million in the first quarter of 2013.Research and development (R&D) expenses spiked 55.9% to $14.5 million in the quarter. The increase is partially attributable to a $2.1 million increase in non-cash equity related expense.The remaining increase in R&D expenses relates to continued investment in the product pipeline, focusing upon higher accuracy, better connectivity, patient convenience and lower cost.In the quarter, Dexcom conducted a number of clinical studies related to future technology, new sensors, new algorithms, enhance labeling, failure connectivity and general product improvements. The company has a few pending submissions with the FDA, including DexCom SHARE, the DexCom G4 system for professional use, the SweetSpot cloud-based system.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses went up 52.5% to $27.6 million in the quarter, driven by increased headcount for commercial infrastructure.

It helps regulate the glucose level by providing information on the direction and rate of glucose change and also alerts users in case of major fluctuations in the glucose level.The PLATINUM Professional CGM System is the first and only real-time professional CGM which provides unblinded feedback, thus allowing patients to experience the benefits of real-time glucose monitoring.Through real-time visibility of dynamic glucose changes, clinicians can coach their patients to better outcomes. The professional CGM System allows clinicians to retrospectively alter treatment after viewing the effects that specific foods, exercise, stress and medications have on their patients' glucose level.The DexCom G4 PLATINUM Professional CGM consists of a medical practice-owned professional CGM system and sensors. Patients are placed on a professional CGM for a period of seven days - this involves minimal training and setup time.During this period, dynamic and comprehensive data is collected that can be shared with the patients. Such information helps patients to understand the impact of their behavior on their glucose levels. It thus provides the doctor with an opportunity to review glucose data retrospectively with the patients to make therapeutic treatment recommendations.By taking at least two calibrations from a blood glucose meter daily, the DexCom G4 PLATINUM Professional CGM provides continuous readings on the rate and direction of glucose change up to every five minutes.The system can also be customized for personalized glucose targets and alerts and has an alarm feature to alert the user if glucose levels rise or fall to dangerous levels.DexCom's mission is to provide doctors, patients and caregivers new medical technology to improve their understanding and management of diabetes.The currently available professional CGM systems offer only retrospective, blinded information on the glucose level of patients. The novel DexCom G4 PLATINUM Professional CGM will enable clinicians to gain real-time insight into their patients' glycemic profiles leading to improved glucose control.Over the long run, DexCom remains focused on replacing finger stick meters, the traditional standard-of-care for glucose monitoring, with CGM.DexCom currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Although the FDA had sent the warning letter on Mar 14, the company disclosed it only early last week.Since the revelation of the warning letter, DexCom's shares dropped 5.7% to close at $41.95 yesterday.The federal watchdog agency conducted an inspection of DexCom's San-Diego facility in Nov 2013 after which it determined that the company was not in compliance with the MDR regulations that were recently updated in Jul 2013.The FDA warning letter held that the glucose monitoring company failed to report at least 4 incidences of low blood sugar (i.e. hypoglycemia) requiring medical treatment that were not correctly detected by the firm's blood glucose monitoring device.The company also failed to report one instance which reasonably suggests that DexCom's blood glucose monitor malfunctioned and shocked a patient.The referenced medical interventions to treat hypoglycemia are considered medical interventions necessary to prevent permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure. According to the letter, DexCom failed to submit an MDR for each referenced event. However, the FDA did not impose any sanctions in the warning letter.Dexcom disclosed the FDA warning letter, saying only that the letter flagged \"deficiencies in filing MDRs involving the company's continuous glucose monitoring system.\"Before the end of Apr 2014, Dexcom expects to submit all materials necessary to maintain compliance with the FDA's reporting obligations, in an effort to resolve any remaining deficiencies and have the warning letter repealed in due course.According to Dexcom, the warning is not likely to affect its current operations or its ability to manufacture and sell its G4 Platinum systems and sensors. Neither is it expected to impact any of its pending or future bids for approval from the FDA.Though the last two weeks have been witness to a downtrend in DexCom's share price, we believe it is well-positioned for future earnings growth.DexCom reported strong top and bottom-line results for the fourth quarter of 2013, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimates on both fronts. Following the earnings release on Feb 20, shares of this medical device company depicted an uptrend.Moreover, over the past two months, the company has seen 9 positive estimate revisions for the current year causing the Zacks Consensus Estimate to improve 30.8% to its current level of a loss of 9 cents per share from a loss of 13 cents for 2014.

The narrower loss can be attributed to higher revenues and a substantial fall in operating expenses during the quarter.Total revenues grew 20.4% to $93.6 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $81.0 million significantly. Product revenues surged 36.1% to $45.1 million while Service revenues rose 8.7% to $45.5 million.The improvement in Product revenues was attributable to impressive rise in product orders. Gross product orders almost doubled (102%) to $80.3 million in the quarter while net product orders (gross orders less cancellations and age-outs) soared 232% to $59.4 million in the second quarter.At the end of the quarter, product backlog was $362 million, up roughly 30% from the backlog at the end of the fiscal 2013-second quarter. The increase in Service revenues was driven by the higher installed base and conversion of customers to emerald and diamond service contracts.For fiscal 2014 ending June this year, Accuray upgraded its revenue guidance to a range of $340 to $350 million from the prior range of $325 to $345 million based on its performance in the first half of fiscal 2014 and optimism triggered by the continued momentum of converting orders to revenues. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $344 million lies within the guided range.However, Accuray expects lower net orders in second half of fiscal 2014 compared with the net orders in the first half of the fiscal year.

Many times, stocks are off investors' radar screens for a reason, though there are some hidden gems that could be worth uncovering by those with a high risk tolerance.One way to find these underappreciated stocks is by looking at companies that haven't seen their share prices move higher lately, but have observed analysts raising earnings estimates for their stock. This trend could signal that investors haven't quite embraced the rising estimate story yet, but that the potential for a big move higher is definitely there.One such company that looks well positioned for a solid gain, but has been overlooked by investors lately, is  (  ). This medical instrument company stock has actually seen its current year loss estimates narrow from loss of 13 cents to loss of 9 cents over the past month. But that is not yet reflected in its price, as the stock gained only 2.44% over the same time frame.You should not be concerned about the price remaining muted going forward.

However, it does not inject hyperemic agents into the patient's body that cause stress to the heart. Moreover, iFR reduces timing costs per procedure and makes physiology guidance fast and routine during multi-vessel disease cases. Combined with the company's recently-introduced Verrata Pressure Guide Wire, the iFR Modality can be used most efficiently.The iFR Modality, which was earlier introduced in Europe and Japan, has shown a strong adoption rate. Currently, this product is installed on more than 300 systems globally, including Europe and Japan. According to the company, this latest U.S. FDA clearance will boost the adoption rate further leading to upgradation of more than 90% of Volcano's worldwide installed base of multi-modality systems.Volcano Corp. is currently progressing well with the rollout of iFR Modality in Europe and Japan. According to the company, the recent release of two studies, ADVISE II and ADAPT-DES with their positive outcomes, will help increase iFR and FFR adoption and IVUS penetration in more complex cases.According to the company, the broader market for intra-body imaging and sensing products is expected to grow from $332 million in 2006 to $2.7 billion by 2021, representing a CAGR of 15% approximately.

The device had earlier been FDA approved for use among adults 18 years and older.DexCom's shares shot up as much as 8% in the trading session following the announcement. The stock has been up 2.6% since the news release.Currently, the DexCom G4 PLATINUM (Pediatric) is the only available CGM system that has been approved for children as young as 2 years old.The DexCom G4 PLATINUM can continuously track glucose levels for 7 consecutive days throughout the 24-hour period. This user-friendly wireless technology system facilitates viewing of the glucose levels as and when needed.Unlike the conventional blood glucose meter, DexCom G4 PLATINUM CGM system displays the moving trends of the glucose levels, which in turn helps the user to undertake correct choices in proper diabetes management. Uncontrolled glucose levels pose potential health complications and can even lead to death. To battle this concern the CGM system is fitted with an in-built alarm that alerts when the glucose levels either rise or fall to dangerous levels.DexCom has designed the product with a tiny sensor and wireless transmitter to make it easy for use in children. The DexCom G4 PLATINUM is also believed to be one of the smallest and lightest CGMs available in the market.The FDA approval of the new DexCom G4 PLATINUM for use in children comes as a respite for parents who can easily monitor glucose levels on a regular basis without being bothered about the child being at home, or away at school, or even participating in sports activities.Effective management of diabetes is essential as it is often associated to have long-term impacts on the health of people.

In fact, these factors have significantly restricted the industry's bottom-line improvement this past year.To make matters worse, this year, more spending cuts are expected to come into effect which will last through 2021. The medical devices spending cut, if not repealed, may take a grave turn in 2014, leading to serious consequences like delaying progress in medical breakthroughs, deterioration in job creation, and tempering of economic growth.The imposition of medical device excise tax as part of the Obamacare roll-out is taking a heavy toll on the medical devices sector, hurting pricing decisions of participants and subjecting them to tremendous margin pressure.However, as a ray of hope amid this difficult scenario, National Institutes of Health (NIH) recently won a $1 billion or 3.5% increase in its fiscal 2014 budget from the previous year's post-sequestration budget (according to fiscal 2014 Omnibus Appropriations bill released on Jan 13, 2014).

(Symbol: CLF), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true \"apples-to-apples\" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of DexCom Inc (Symbol: DXCM), the market cap is now $3.23B, versus Cliffs Natural Resources, Inc. (Symbol: CLF) at $3.11B.Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of DXCM vs. CLF:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which indices will include the stock, and which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and \"tosses out\" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller \"up-and-comers\" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). And ETFs that directly follow an index like the S&P 500 will only own the underlying component of that index, selling companies that lose their status as an S&P 500 company, and buying companies when they are added to the index. So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at TheOnlineInvestor.com find value to putting together these looks at comparative market capitalization daily.At the closing bell, DXCM is up about 0.1%, while CLF is trading flat on the day Tuesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter 2013 results before the opening bell on Jan 30.

DexCom missed the bottom-line consensus for the fifth consecutive time in the third quarter of 2012. Its loss per share of 25 cents was higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 22 cents per share as well as the year-ago loss of 20 cents a share.During the conference call, DexCom issued a ballpark estimate of $89 million for full year 2012 revenues compared with the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $95 million for the 2012 revenues. The company also asserted that it will continue to develop its GEN5 system. The joint development of  ' (  ) next-generation in-hospital glucose monitoring system is almost complete and the company expects CE Mark approval in Europe before the end of 2012.Overseas territories contributed 10% to the company's product revenues in the most recent quarter. We expect international revenues to strengthen as DexCom ventures into new territories. The company recently gained approval in Australia, while it anticipates approval in Canada and India. DexCom also plans to gain a foothold in other Asian countries like China and Japan. The comparison of the exponential rise of diabetes in developing countries to the fraction of the population using continuous glucose monitors implies that the market for DexCom's products remains largely underpenetrated in these geographies.Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared DexCom's new continuous glucose monitoring system, the DexCom G4 Platinum. The company received the CE Mark for its G4 system in June 2012 and already markets the product in the European Union as well as certain Latin American and Asian nations where the CE Mark is recognized. The commercialization of G4 in the U.S. could just be the catalyst that the company needs to gain share.On the flip side, DexCom faces aggressive competition from large players with deeper pockets. The company competes with Roche Diabetes Care, a division of  (  ) and LifeScan under  (  ) for its Seven Plus offering. Additionally,  (  ) and  (  ) have gained FDA approval for continuous glucose monitoring systems.Moreover, reluctance on the part of physicians and patients to adopt DexCom's products may make it challenging for the company to expand share. This is mainly because the company's glucose monitoring device is more invasive than other self-monitored glucose testing systems. Additionally, manufacturing constraints might hamper the supply continuum of the company.We still believe that DexCom is poised to gain a major share of the glucose monitoring market, driven by sustained product development initiatives, collaborations and increased need for continuous glucose monitoring.

Trials also indicate a 30% improvement in accuracy when blood glucose level is below 70mg/dl (for hypoglycemia relevance range).The inbuilt features of the G4 Platinum make it the most innovative system for continuous glucose monitoring in the market.

Net loss for the quarter soared 30% year over year to $17.3 million.Revenues surged 26.5% year over year to $23.1 million in the third quarter, marginally beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23 million.Product sales increased almost 27% to $21.1 million while development grant and other revenues improved 25.6% to $2 million in the reported quarter.Gross margin dipped to 36.4% in the third quarter from 44.7% a year ago. Operating expenses increased 19.8% year over year to $25.7 million due to higher R&D spending and selling, general and administrative expenses, which grew 28.6% and 14.4%, respectively, in the reported quarter. Research and development expenditure shot up on account of incremental clinical trials costs while selling, general and administrative expenses increased due to additional marketing initiatives.DexCom exited the third quarter with cash and short-term marketable securities of $53.4 million, down 45.1% on a year-over-year basis.DexCom is well placed in the industry that it serves. Given the burgeoning diabetes population in the U.S., its G4 Platinum presents considerable market opportunity. Successful commercialization of G4 in the U.S. could just be the catalyst that the company needs to gain share in the market it serves.Increased awareness and acceptance of the need for continuous glucose monitoring and international expansion should help drive sales of DexCom's products. The company expects to introduce its products in India by year end. It also plans to expand its footprint in China and Japan next year.In addition to upgrading and enhancing the functions of existing products, DexCom has also been active on the collaboration front, through which it is looking to leverage its technology with its collaborator's product offerings.Competition in the glucose monitoring market is fierce. DexCom competes with Roche Diabetes Care, a division of  (  ) and LifeScan under  (  ) for its Seven Plus offering. Additionally,  (  ) and  (  ) have gained FDA approval for continuous glucose monitoring systems.We believe that the company's move to buy healthcare IT company SweetSpot Diabetes Care, may allow it to compete more effectively through better data management systems.Despite increasing revenues, DexCom remains a loss making entity and its efforts are made more difficult by a stringent regulatory environment.

Its fourth-quarter fiscal 2011 loss per share of 18 cents was a penny higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Losses widened year over year despite solid double-digit growth in the top line.Revenues zoomed 43% year over year to $22.4 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Product sales spiked 54% to $20.9 million in the quarter.DexCom is focused on the development and commercialization of continuous glucose monitoring systems for ambulatory use by people with diabetes and by healthcare providers for the treatment of diabetic and non-diabetic patients.The diabetes market is large and growing. An important component of effective diabetes management is frequent monitoring of blood glucose levels. DexCom's product has a comparative advantage in terms of both patient convenience and quality of data generated vis-\u00e0-vis traditional diagnostic tests.We believe DexCom is poised to gain a major share of the glucose monitoring market driven by sustained product development initiatives, collaborations, favorable reimbursement and increased need for continuous glucose monitoring. Increased awareness and acceptance of the need for continuous glucose monitoring and more favorable reimbursement coverage should help drive sales for DexCom's products.Other potential catalysts include the FDA approval and launch of new products under the company's collaborative agreements with several companies including Insulet Corporation. DexCom plans to file a Premarket Approval (\"PMA\") for the Gen4 sensor system at the end of the first quarter or early second quarter of 2012.In addition to upgrading and enhancing the functions of existing products, DexCom has also been active on the collaboration front, through which it is looking to leverage its technology with its collaborator's product offerings.We also feel that the company's recent move to buy healthcare IT company SweetSpot Diabetes may allow it to better compete with  (  ) through better data management systems.However, competition in the glucose monitoring market is fierce and DexCom faces stiff challenges from much larger players such as  (  ), Medtronic and  (  ). Moreover, the company has incurred losses since inception and is exposed to a strict regulatory environment.
