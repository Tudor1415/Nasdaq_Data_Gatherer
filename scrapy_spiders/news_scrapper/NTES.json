Enquiries about U.S. listings have halved this year at one of the big four accounting firms in China versus 2019 levels, a senior auditor from the firm said.Many companies that reported plans for U.S. listings to China's securities regulator, marking an early stage in the process, are now targeting exchanges nearer to home, said a person close to the regulator.The China Securities Regulatory Commission did not respond to requests for comment, while the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission declined to comment.Listings take at the minimum several months to arrange, involving appointing advisers, preparing a prospectus and obtaining regulatory approvals. The further along the path a company is, the less likely it is to change plans.'INVESTOR UNCERTAINTY'Chinese firms accounted for about a third, or some $279 billion, of funds raised globally via IPOs in the past five years. About half of that was overseas, mostly through New York and Hong Kong floats.There are more than 550 Chinese firms listed on U.S. stock exchanges. Chinese firms often choose New York for floats given its prestige and international investor base, even as Beijing seeks to encourage them to list at home to share gains among local investors and limit foreign oversight.Chinese authorities have long resisted audit papers leaving China, making it hard for U.S. auditing regulators to check the quality of audits of Chinese companies.But a bill passed by the U.S. Senate which, if signed by President Donald Trump, would require U.S.-listed foreign companies to disclose levels of government control. It would also require that Chinese companies comply with U.S. oversight of their audits or face being delisted. \"For U.S. investors, it will mean fewer listings and it will be harder to capture the benefits of growth in China,\" said John Ott, partner with Bain & Company and a leader with its Greater China financial services practice.U.S.-listed Chinese firms have begun disclosing the risk of an \"adverse impact\" on their shares due to tighter regulations.Kingsoft Cloud Holdings Ltd , the first Chinese firm to brave New York since Luckin's scandal, warned efforts to increase U.S. regulatory access to audit information \"could cause investor uncertainty for affected issuers, including us\".Netease  and JD.com  also warned of similar risks in their recent filings with the Hong Kong stock exchange for secondary listings in the city.(Reporting by Scott Murdoch in Hong Kong, Engen Tham in Shanghai, Zoey Zhang in Beijing, Kane Wu in Hong Kong and Echo Wang, Joshua Franklin in New York; Editing by Jennifer Hughes and Himani Sarkar)((;))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["The U.S. Senate recently passed a bill that could force Chinese companies to delist their stocks from American exchanges. If the bill becomes a law, Chinese companies would need to prove they aren't owned by the Chinese government and open their books to the non-profit Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB).The bill still needs to be approved by the House of Representatives and signed into law by President Trump, but it enjoys broad bipartisan support. Therefore, it isn't surprising that several major Chinese tech companies -- including  ,  , and   -- all recently filed new IPOs in Hong Kong.Let's examine these three companies' moves into Hong Kong, and whether or not American investors \u00a0their U.S.-listed shares.Image source: Getty Images.Alibaba originally planned to\u00a0go public in Hong Kong last August, but it postponed the listing due to escalating protests across the region. It completed the offering in November, more than five years after its IPO in New York.It issued 500 million new ordinary shares and an over-allotment of 75 million shares to raise about $13.8 billion, marking the biggest listing of the year. The IPO diluted its total shares, which are split between its New York and Hong Kong investors, by less than 3%.Alibaba recently assured its\u00a0U.S. investors it wouldn't delist its NYSE shares and believed it could comply with any new regulatory demands. CFO Maggie Wu stated Alibaba would \"closely monitor\" the proposed bill, but\u00a0it's unclear if the tech giant will ever fully open its books to the PCAOB.JD.com, Alibaba's biggest rival in China's e-commerce market, also went public in the U.S. in 2014. JD recently filed\u00a0a secondary offering for 133 million new ordinary shares -- including 126.35 million U.S.-listed shares offered internationally and 6.65 million shares in Hong Kong -- which will be worth roughly the same as their U.S.-listed ADS counterparts.Image source: Getty Images.JD's secondary offering could raise up to $4 billion and dilute its existing shares by nearly 5%. It's expected to complete the\u00a0offering on June 18, which coincides with its 22nd anniversary and the final day of its annual \"618\" shopping holiday.JD hasn't commented about a potential delisting in the U.S. yet, but it could further strengthen its ties to Hong Kong with an IPO for  later this year. However, JD also recently filed another IPO for its  online grocery affiliate in\u00a0the U.S.,\u00a0which suggests it isn't giving up on New York just yet.NetEase, China's second-largest gaming company after  , went public in the U.S. in 2000. It recently priced a global offering of 171.5 million shares, but only 3% will be allocated to Hong Kong investors, with the rest offered to international investors on June 11.NetEase expects to raise\u00a0about $2.8 billion with its new IPO,\u00a0diluting its existing shares by about 5%. The shares also won't be sold at a meaningful discount to its U.S.-listed shares.Back in 2001, NetEase was nearly delisted from the  due to fraud allegations and a missed annual report, but it overcame those growing pains and became  of China's gaming sector. NetEase hasn't commented on the Senate's latest threats yet, but its recent spin-off of its\u00a0online education unit   in New York suggests it won't retreat from the U.S. anytime soon.The threat of a mass exodus of Chinese stocks from U.S. exchanges is alarming, but I doubt the bill will pass in its current form since it would seriously hurt American investors, funds, and exchanges.It isn't surprising to see Chinese companies file secondary IPOs in Hong Kong as safety nets, but they probably won't rush to delist their stocks from U.S. exchanges, which still generate far more liquidity than the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Still, investors may wonder what edge Bilibili has, considering that it operates in an ultra-competitive China entertainment industry with major players like  , ,  , and more. But in a sea of wannabes, here's why I think Bilibili's a legitimate contender.Image source: Getty Images.\"We enrich the everyday life of young generations in China.\"That's the mission that Bilibili shared in its IPO prospectus. It aims to fulfill that by providing a wide range of entertainments and services -- which include online games, videos, live broadcasting, and e-commerce -- to delights its users.A typical user\u00a0may join Bilibili's platform initially for its ACG (animation, comics, games) content, then move on to consume other video content --which include professional user-generated and licensed video content -- across different genres including lifestyles, games, dramas and more. Sometimes, they may join friends -- met on the platform -- for online games that are available only to Bilibili's users. Occasionally, they tune in to watch their favorite host performing on the live-streaming show, while at the same time, they shop for the latest anime products on Bilibili's mall. They usually end up buying something from the mall, as well as rewarding the host with virtual gifts.In short, Bilibili's business model combines the playbook from companies such as Youtube, IQIYI Inc,\u00a0HUYA Inc, and .At first glance, investors may find Bilibili's \"diversified\" business model unnecessarily complex -- usually a sign of poor focus and unclear strategic direction. Yet a deeper look reveals many positive attributes about the company.To start with, Bilibili aims to become a one-stop entertainment platform for its users. By diversifying its content offerings, it can appeal to a wider range of users while improving the engagement level of its existing members. As more users join Bilibili's platform and the engagement level grows, content creators -- who are also members of the platform-- will be encouraged to share more quality content.This, in turn, attracts even more new users, sparking a virtual cycle of continuous growth in the company's user base and content. The result is evident in Bilibili's operational metrics: Monthly active users (MAUs) have grown from 77 million in the first quarter of 2018 to 172 million in the first quarter of 2020 \u00a0while average usage time per user per day has increased from 76 minutes in 2017 \u00a0to 87 minutes lately.With a growing user base and improving engagement level, Bilibili can now monetize its business across multiple avenues, which include mobile games, value-added services, advertising, and e-commerce. This not only results in a more diversified and stable income source for Bilibili, but also opens up new growth opportunities.For example, revenue from value-added services grew 172% year-on-year in the first quarter of 2020, more than doubling the companywide revenue growth rate of 69%, thanks to higher income from its newly launched premium membership program and live broadcasting.Another important thing worth mentioning here is Bilibili's strong emphasis on community-building and social engagement. Its many aspects include providing social and interactive features on its platform to encourage interaction among users -- such as bullet chatting (users' comments that pop-up as texts on your screen when you watch video),\u00a0liking and following, gifting and rewarding, and communication tools-- and mandating a membership exam for users to become \"official members.\"Users need to pass a multiple-choice membership exam consisting of 100 questions, after which they can access to features available only to official members. These efforts result in a more engaged and loyal member base who:Despite all the positive factors mentioned above, investors should carefully watch several key risks for this young company.Bilibili is still a loss-making business and will likely remain so in the foreseeable future. Its operating loss has expanded by 305% between 2015 and 2019 \u00a0owing to the company's continuous investments in sales and marketing, content, and research and development to grow the business.Since the business remains in its early stages of monetization, future revenue may fall short of its original plan -- or fail to keep up with escalating costs. In other words, the company may never become profitable.Fortunately, the company's financial metrics have improved over the last few years. Quarterly revenue per monthly active user has increased roughly 19% from Q1 2018 to Q1 2020,\u00a0 and gross profit has improved from negative RMB 173 million in 2015\u00a0to positive RMB 1.2 billion in 2019 -- indicating that Bilibili is moving closer toward profitability.Bilibili operates in the highly competitive entertainment industry, with major players like IQIYI, Tencent Video, Youku, Huya, and more. These companies tend to focus on a specific segment of the entertainment industry -- for example, IQIYI focuses on video streaming, while Huya specializes in live-streaming -- while Bilibili operates in many segments. Hence, there's a risk the company may be a jack of all trades, master of none, weakening its competitive position over time. So far, however, Bilibili's strategy has been relatively successful in attracting and retaining its members, as evidenced by the improving operational metrics we mentioned above.Bilibili is a classic growth stock: a very high growth rate but no profits. Though it's still in its early days, the young company has demonstrated solid performance -- revenue has grown at an annualized rate of 168% over the last four years\u00a0 -- thanks to its one-stop entertainment platform strategy.Such performance has not gone unnoticed -- both Tencent and   have invested 13.3% and 7.2%\u00a0, respectively, in Bilibili's stock, which is a vote of confidence for the young company.On balance, I think Bilibili is a company worthy of further research, especially for investors who are looking to invest in growth stocks.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Chinese video-game producer NetEase, which made its debut on the Nasdaq 20 years ago, is preparing to raise $2.6 billion in Hong Kong. The secondary listing closer to home should help fortify it against global disarray.\u00a0 Rule relaxations a couple of years ago made it easier for Chinese companies trading in New York to sell shares in the former British territory, too. Alibaba blazed the trail in November. After initially delaying its plans, the e-commerce titan overcame anti-government protests that were roiling the city to raise $13 billion. That is an indication of how the stars are aligning for NetEase and boss William Lei Ding. Originally founded as an internet portal in 1997, its pandemic-friendly business model has proven resilient by keeping quarantined gamers busy playing self-developed titles and licenced ones such as \u201cWorld of Warcraft\u201d. Game sales increased 14% in the first quarter from a year earlier to 13.5 billion yuan ($1.9 billion). Revenue from its Youdao online education business more than doubled. The success has powered a roughly 50% rise in NetEase\u2019s market value, to $51 billion, since mid-March. That performance defies a backlash which has prompted U.S. lawmakers to seek to delist Chinese companies from American bourses if they don\u2019t comply with domestic accounting oversight. A Hong Kong listing provides an extra layer of protection. Alibaba\u2019s success on the venue provides an encouraging sign, too. Its American depositary receipts have been converting to Hong Kong shares at a healthy clip, according to an analysis of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing data. The stock price is up 15% since the new listing and got an extra pop last month when the creator of the benchmark Hang Seng index said it was rewriting its rules to allow dual-listed companies to be included. Despite all the upheaval in the world, NetEase seems to be moving from an unlikely position of strength.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["y Sam NusseyShares in Japan's Marvelous Inc  on Tuesday closed up 17% at their daily limit of 682 yen after the games maker announced China's Tencent Holdings Ltd  would take a 20% stake.Tencent will spend around 7 billion yen ($65 million) acquiring shares from Marvelous and its largest shareholders, Amuse Capital and its chief executive, Hayao Nakayama, a former Sega executive whose son founded Marvelous.

At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the NTES options chain for the new July 24th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $412.50 strike price has a current bid of $16.60.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $412.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $395.90 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of NTES, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $416.55/share today.\n\nBecause the $412.50 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if NTES shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for NetEase, Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.

Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that all percentages are based on renminbi.Like every company around the globe, we started the year with a great deal of uncertainty amid one of the world's worst health crisis. I am pleased to say that we have worked very hard to address the effects of the pandemic, providing help where we can and making the appropriate adjustments to our businesses to ensure the safety of our NetEase family. We believe many companies inside and outside of China will overcome this pandemic and come out strong.We had a good quarter, increasing our net revenues by 18% to RMB17.1 billion and our net income from continuing operations attributable to our shareholders was up by 30% to RMB3.6 billion, both on a year-over-year basis. For our online games, net revenues reached RMB13.5 billion in the first quarter on the back of our existing titles stellar performances, growing 14% year-over-year even though 1Q 2019 was itself a very strong quarter for our game services a year ago.Our legacy PC titles such as the Fantasy Westward Journey and New Westward Journey Online II continued their strong performances in the first quarter with new expansion packs launched for the Chinese New Year holidays, introducing a series of new content. Quarterly revenues for these games broke new records, hitting another all-time high since their debuts almost two decades ago. Momentum for legacy mobile games was also strong as we continued to supply this large and sustainable user base with continual content updates. Take our Fantasy Westward Journey Mobile game as an example, where we introduced a brand new character, which quickly gained popularity and was a strong driver for gross billings. While we continue to dominate the MMO genre, many of our recent titles and categories that are relatively new for us have also shown remarkable success and sustainability, providing us with steady revenue streams in what is now a very diverse game portfolio. Invincible, Onmyoji, Identity V and Life-After, launched in 2015, '16, '18 [Phonetic] and '18, respectively, serve as good examples of our superior game longevity within different game genres.Invincible, our 2015 launch, hit another quarter of record high gross billings and active users. We are pleased to see the game's strong traction in the SLG market. After more than five years of successful operations with Invincible, we have accumulated a solid SLG fan base and extensive expertise in this field. We look forward to developing more innovative games to delight our users in this engaging and thought provoking genre. Onmyoji continues to show remarkable longevity as we consistently introduced new characters. These additions are resonating well with new game players, further solidifying the reach of Onmyoji as a leading ACG game. As the first of our younger IPs that we have created in-house, our goal for Onmyoji is to have an even larger and deeper impact on the vibrant community of young users. In addition to Onmyoji: The Card Game, the collectible card game we launched last year, and the upcoming simulation game, Onmyoji: Yokai Koya planned for later this year, we have more exciting new games in store based on the Onmyoji IP. Later today, this evening, Beijing time, at our May 20 game day event, we will introduce two new Onmyoji spin-off games in brand new genres.Launched in 2018, Identity V and Life-After are also a few of our newer titles, attracting a large base of young fans and starting to demonstrate sustained longevity. Celebrating its second anniversary in April with a series of content updates, Identity V reached a milestone of 200 million registered users, attracting players with its characteristic art style and innovative game play. With Life-After, since its initial phase of stabilization, gross billings have been picking up steadily over the past few months as we launched a couple of highly popular expansion packs, introducing a series of new themes and innovative game play. We believe that Life-After will be another one of our titles that resonates with fans for many years to come. In terms of new titles, Fantasy Westward Journey 3D was launched at the end of 2019 and delivered a stable performance in the first quarter, further expanding the reach of the FWJ franchise as a whole and captivating both returning fans as well as a new audience. In April, we launched Dawn of Isles in China, previously known as Age of Isle. As our newest MMORPG featuring sandbox game play, the game topped the iOS download chart soon after its launch and was featured by the iOS app store.In overseas markets, we continue to gain market share in Japan. Knives Out and Identity V remain at the forefront of Japan's top grossing games chart and the user bases for both games are growing at a strong pace. The success of these games has helped us to gain a much better understanding of Japanese users and their preferences, allowing us to better tailor our games for the Japanese market. We have integrated this successful experience and know how into the design of other NetEase games, enhancing our ability to deliver popular titles to global audience. At the end of 2019, we began operating Invincible in Japan ourselves. With our proficiency in operating this game domestically, along with our newly acquired understanding of Japanese user preferences, we saw a steady increase in Invincible's revenue in the first quarter.Now turning to our game pipelines. Many of the games under development have the potential to achieve mass audience appeal, transcending geographies and spanning multiple genres. We have a number of these exciting new releases planned for 2020, which we expect to help us gain more brand recognition in the broader global markets, particularly in the US and European markets. As announced two days ago, EVE Echoes is ready for its global launch in August. Additionally, other exciting upcoming titles include Fantasy Westward Journey H5 version, King of Hunters, PES Club Manager, Onmyoji: Yokai Koya, Ghost World Chronicle, Revelation mobile game, Harry Potter: Magic Awakened, Diablo Immortal, Pokemon Quest and MARVEL Duel.Now for our education business. Youdao started the year off on a strong note with healthy gains across many of its primary financial metrics. Total net revenues accelerated by 140% year-over-year to RMB541 million and operating cash flow turned positive for the first time. We are seeing an increasing adoption rate of online education due in large part to the structural effects of the pandemic. Online courses generated gross billings of RMB519 million, up 287% year-over-year, primarily due to continued enhancement to our course content and product. To match the needs of newly enrolled students during the pandemic, Youdao quickly developed and refined new product, helping students receive the most effective teaching online, especially for those taking entrance exams this year. In line with the growing enrollment, we carefully crafted a few more products, including junior high school Math, high school English courses, which received wide popularity. We also expanded our education team to over 1,000 instructors and teaching assistants who are well-trained and incentivized to give our students the most tailored and personal support they need.During the quarter, we further enhanced our technology offering. With the launch of AI essay assessment in our dictionary app, a feature that automatically grade and offer suggestions to improve English writing. Going forward, Youdao will continue to build up its largely scalable business model and provide users with effective educational experiences empowered by great content and technology. For our Cloud Music business, we are also growing and proud to have celebrated NetEase Cloud Music's 7th anniversary in April. Revenue from our Cloud Music platform continued to accelerate with high speed, achieving triple digit growth year-over-year in the first quarter and record-high membership revenue. Live streaming revenue is also growing at a rapid pace. In the first quarter, we released several online live events that were particularly [Indecipherable] during the pandemic outbreak and helped to support our independent musician and their ability to distribute. These include the Bedroom Live Music Festival [Indecipherable] where well known musicians performed at home via live streaming and Indie Live, a high quality broadcast of independent brands -- bands' live shows. While we maintain a competitive edge in our regional music with now over 160,000 independent musicians on our platform, we are also looking to provide music from all over the globe to expand our music library. In March, we added popular Japanese music to our platform through our distribution agreement with Studio Ghibli, one of the most acclaimed animation studios in the world. Further adding to our catalog of songs, we recently signed a strategic partnership with Rock Records, one of the largest record labels in China. All in all, as with all of our businesses, innovation is key. Along these lines, our music platform's largest progression includes a newly launched karaoke offering for our young people. Moving ahead, we will continue to make sensible investments in content and innovation to remain relevant and competitive in the exciting world of music.Turning our focus to Yanxuan. After a short four years, we have developed a distinct and recognizable brand with a number of notable, self developed products that appeal to a wide range of consumers. In particular, Yanxuan has made a name for itself with distinctive offerings in housing, personal care and food categories. During the first quarter, we upgraded our membership offering to a pro membership to include more benefits, attracting a considerable new constituency. New memberships rose by 138% year-over-year, owning to our innovative marketing approaches such as collaborating with top live streaming celebrities. Meanwhile, our inventory has been managed to a healthy level as we continuously optimize our procurement and reduce obsolete inventory.Overall, we had a strong start to 2020. Our primary business lines grew during the first quarter and we are pleased to have advanced our mission to bring inspiring leading products and services to our growing community of followers. We will press forward as we have done for the past two decades, with our eyes on the long-term and plans to reach incremental gains along the way. This concludes William's prepared remarks.I will now provide a brief review of our 2020 first quarter financial results. Given the limited time on today's call, I will be presenting some abbreviated financial highlights. We encourage you to read through our press release issued earlier today for further details.Total net revenues for the first quarter were RMB17.1 billion or $2.4 billion, representing 18% increase year-over-year. Net revenue from online game services were RMB13.5 billion, up 14% year-over-year. This increase was primarily driven by the strong performance of our flagship titles in FWJ franchises, New Westward Journey II as well as Blizzard's World of Warcraft. Mobile games accounted for approximately 70% of net revenues from our online games in the first quarter. Net revenues from Youdao also increased 140% year-over-year in the first quarter, reaching RMB541 million, primarily due to the increased net revenues from online courses with a rapid increase in K12 paid enrollment and sales of intelligent learning devices. Net revenues from innovative businesses and others were RMB3 billion for the first quarter, up 28% year-over-year, mainly due to increased contribution from NetEase Cloud Music and CC live streaming.Overall gross margin was 55% in the first quarter. GP margin for our online game services for the first quarter was 64.1%. Our gross margin for online games is generally stable, fluctuating quarter-to-quarter within a narrow bandwidth based on the revenue mix of mobile and PC as well as self developed and licensed games. Youdao's gross margin expanded sharply to 43.5% in the first quarter, a vast improvement from 29.8% in the last quarter. This was primarily driven by the achievement of economies of scale and better faculty compensation structure. Gross margin for innovative businesses and others for the first quarter was 15.8%, up from 5.7% year-over-year. The improvement comes primarily from significantly increased revenue from our NetEase Cloud Music business.For the first quarter, total operating expenses were RMB4.9 billion. Our selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue was 10.9% compared with 13.7% in the prior quarter. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was a result of less spending in online game promotion and Cloud Music during this quarter. R&D expenses were RMB2.1 billion, up 5% year-over-year. We remain committed to investing in innovative content creation and product development, which is what's defining us as a technology company. The effective tax rate was 22% for the first quarter, relatively flat with the prior period and down from 31% in the first quarter of 2019.Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to our shareholders for the first quarter was RMB4.2 billion or $595 million, representing increase of 15% quarter-over-quarter and nearly 26% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS from continuing operations were RMB32.17 or $4.54 for the first quarter of 2020. Our cash position remains strong. As of 31 -- as of March 31, 2020 our total cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current time deposits and short-term investment balance totaled RMB79.3 billion compared with RMB74.4 billion as of the end of last year.In accordance with our dividend policy, we are pleased to report that our Board of Directors has approved a dividend of $1.16 per ADS for this quarter. This represents a regular dividend paying stream since 2013. On February 26, 2020, we announced the Board approval for a new share repurchase program for up to $1 billion of our outstanding ADS and we announced an amendment to such program earlier today to increase the total authorized repurchase amount from the original $1 billion to $2 billion. As of March 31, 2020, approximately 1.1 billion ADS has been repurchased for a total consideration of $342 million.Thank you for your attention. We would like now to open the call to your questions. Operator, please go ahead with Q&A.Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from the line of Alex Poon from Morgan Stanley. -- [Foreign Speech]I'll translate my questions. First question is regarding the lessons learned from COVID-19 regarding the game business. Many game genres have become very popular during this period, no matter it is mobile or shooting games and also casual games as well. So in terms of user acquisition, retention, game genre, development strategy, do we have some new thoughts, new ideas after this COVID-19? My second question is regarding the music business. Top line growth is very strong, how should we think about the product development and margin trend in 2020? Thanks very much. -- [Foreign Speech] -- Alex, I will provide a brief translation of William's remarks. Firstly, on games. During the pandemic, we have seen games becoming a sense event for family members staying together in-house so they have more time spent together as a family as a whole to get joy and excitement and some relief from game as a broad entertainment. It is also a boost to new game users during the past quarter. These will be obviously translated into our thinking of how to focus more on R&D self-development of games that can create a bonding opportunity for family members as a whole going forward. For the music, and William emphasized in fact, reemphasized from his prior remarks, that the ambition, the mission of NetEase Cloud Music platform is we want to create a vast environment to support development of China's independent musicians, people with talent who can express themselves and distribute their products to a group of music enthusiasts with passion, with the exploration of new diversified -- different genres of songs. And I think for the foreseeable future, that is our key focus of development.You also asked about the margin trend. I think that as we continue to grow the scale and diversification of our music revenue stream possibilities, we will naturally benefit a lot from economies of scale with the enhancement of margin trend and I think on the margin trend we are also quite optimistic. I hope that answers your question, Alex.Thank you very much. We will take our next question from Alicia Yap from Citigroup. Alicia Yap, your line is open. Please go ahead. -- Okay, hi. Thank you. Good morning, William and Charles. Congrats on the results. Thanks for taking my questions. My question is on your gaming business. As many other companies are seeing the normalizing trend of the gamers' traffic and activity post the lockdown lift off, how does that trend looking for NetEase games? And how should we think about the offsetting factor with your deferred revenue for the second quarter and also the lockdown in overseas that might benefit the overseas gaming closing? Thank you. -- Okay. Alicia, do you want to translate your question yourself? -- Sure. [Foreign Speech] -- [Foreign Speech] -- I will provide a brief translation of William's remarks. So he commented Alicia, I think your observation is right. However, that is a short-term volatility. I think across the board, as you mentioned, other game companies and us might be seeing. However, William emphasized that the growth engine of NetEase games is our ability to continuously produce in-house and launch new game titles as well as our ambition of becoming a more globalized game company with more exciting titles launched into overseas markets such as Japan and hopefully very soon in the mainstream Western market. With all that, we are not overly concerned about these short-term volatilities and we are very, very optimistic about the outlook of NetEase games growth driven by the diversification of new titles as well as diversification of new geographies. -- Thank you.We will take our next question from the line of Natalie Wu from China International Capital Corporation. -- Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a very solid quarter. [Foreign Speech]I will translate myself. So I have two questions. First one is regarding the PC game. So your PC game outperformed the industry despite a hold-off operation of the [Indecipherable], which is quite encouraging. It would be great if management can share with us some thoughts of the future outlook for that segment. And second one is regarding Harry Potter. So just wondering if the game is ready, but still need time to get approval in domestic China market? Will you decide to wait for the license or will you launch it firstly in overseas regions? Thank you. -- [Foreign Speech] -- Okay. So yes, Natalie, I will translate William's comments for everyone's broader benefit for the first question and I will answer the question on Harry Potter.So firstly, what we observed is that during the global pandemic, PC and console games, in general have seen an increasing trend as more people are spending time at home. And it is not so much correlated to the Internet cafe's operation as you can see from our game results because our PC games are legacy titles running for over a decade. In case of FWJ, we see a record quarter since its debut almost 17 years ago. And we are very confident about the sustained gross billing popularity of our flagship PC games. For the time being, our main concentrated focus of new game development is tilted toward mobile games. So launch of new PC games will be opportunistic. We do not have a regular agenda like we regularly launch new mobile games. So that's to your first question.Second question, Harry Potter. We are very excited about Harry Potter. It is a strong IP globally and we are confident in our R&D ability to convert this IP into an exciting game title. I think it's too early to predict about the situation on regulatory approval in China. And when it comes to the stage when the game is ready for launch, whether we will do a global simultaneous launch or whether we will do overseas launch first followed by domestic upon the approval, both are possibilities and we will decide that later when the game is more advanced. -- Got it. Thank you.We will take our next question from Shi Jialong from Nomura. Your line is open, please go ahead. -- Yes, good morning management. Thanks for taking my questions. First of all, congratulations on a very solid quarter. [Foreign Speech]I have two questions. First question is about NetEase online gaming business. Just wondering how much of NetEase online gaming revenue was contributed by overseas market in 1Q? My second question is about NetEase music business, according to various media reports, it seems to me NetEase music has accelerated the purchase of licensed content since this year, including the recent licensing agreement with top global record labels as well as the exclusive purchase of some of the highly rated music shows. I was just wondering why it seems NetEase music became more aggressive on content purchase? Thanks. -- [Foreign Speech] -- Jialong, first question. Overseas, first quarter our overseas revenue accounts for slightly more than 10% of our total game revenue, consistent with our level of last year, but we are very confident to continue to grow and even very strongly to grow this revenue contribution from the overseas game market in the next three years to five years. -- [Foreign Speech] -- I'll provide a quick translation of William's remarks. So first of all our dedication to support and promote independent musicians and native IPs are not mutually exclusive with our deep respect and open minded, strong collaboration with music label companies. In fact, in the past, there are obstacles in the industry preventing us from purchasing music content and music IPs directly from label companies. We are very, very active and indeed a collaboration with all these highly regarded label companies in an effort to acquire music IPs, content copyright. And will utilize our efficiency and our massive user scale of the NetEase Cloud Music to distribute their music content to a group of music enthusiast lovers. And we also want to reiterate that we hope that the whole industry in China and all the players in China can spend more focus, effort and resources into promoting native IP, organic music from independent musicians because I think it is going to be a much bigger ambition for the entire industry to see the rising of Chinese music, Chinese musicians as a whole to play a much bigger role on the global audience, on the global stage.Okay. We will take our next question from the line of Eddie Leung from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. -- Good morning. [Foreign Speech] So my question is about the new game launch. Historically, when we have a big year of a lot of new games to be launched, typically the marketing spending ratio would go up. So just wondering what could be the pattern this year? And whether there would be different ways to promote new games? Thank you. -- Okay. Yes. Eddie, your question is -- OK. Eddie, your question is on our outlook of marketing expenses. I want to reemphasize one point. NetEase games focuses a lot on self-developed in-house developed games. As such, we are always excited about our lineups of new games. Whenever we consider promoting a new game, it is always a return driven exercise internally. Depending on our projections of the game's performance and expectations of the gross billing, then we allocate marketing resources in a very sensible way. That is why I think in the prior quarters, I also made remarks that try not to look too much into the quarter-over-quarter fluctuations of the marketing spending dollars. In fact, if you look at my marketing dollars as a percentage of the overall revenue on the full year trend, last year, we controlled it at around 10%, a significant decrease from the prior two years. However, absolute dollars is not shrinking. That is because we are more sensible. We are more conscious about the return generation on my marketing dollars with more new game titles. Yes, we are going to spend more marketing dollars, but we are even more optimistic that with effective promotion, the new games are going to generate even faster return for us at the top line. So on the financial planning aspect, NetEase remains prudent and sensible. -- Got it. Thank you Charles.We will take our next question from the line of Alex Liu from China Renaissance. -- [Foreign Speech] I'll translate myself. My first question is on the cash allocation. We have very good cash flow on our core business and also a very solid cash balance. Just wondering, should we think about the enlarged stock repurchase program and perhaps further stock repurchase program as a more occurring practice down the road? And the second question is on the deferred revenue. Deferred revenue balance was very strong this quarter and I was wondering if the management could give some color on this growth and whether it's due to the mix change between PC and mobile game. Thank you. -- [Foreign Speech] -- Okay. Alex, for your first question, our treasury policy is always very prudent. We are one of the very, very few tech companies globally that pays a regular dividend. In fact, we've been paying a regular dividend since 2013 and we will continue to do so, returning value to our shareholders, especially long-term shareholders who has been supporting us in the journey of the growth over the last two decades. The stock buyback program is also a regular exercise for a couple of years. And when the situation requires and then within our ability, we can go back to the Board, just like this time, seeking for the authorization of enhanced dollar amount for the overall stock buyback. So that is on the treasury cash management aspect.For your deferred revenue, we don't further break down exactly on the composition, but I think you are right. In Q1, if I remember correctly, it is probably another record quarter for both recognized revenue as well as deferred revenue. And again, largely, it's underpinned by the gross billings and the growth of both PC lines as well as mobile lines of games, largely consistent with what you are seeing in the year-over-year growth for the recognized revenue. Youdao also contributed to a certain extent, of course, but then you can refer to Youdao's public filing for the deferred revenue incremental portion. -- Understood. Thank you very much.We will take our next question from the line of Binnie Wong from HSBC. -- Thank you. Good morning, William, Charles and Margaret. [Foreign Speech] I'll quickly translate myself. Post the COVID-19, do you think that it actually changes in terms of how we view our overseas games expansion trend? What are the new opportunities that we also see? And how do we see our target in the next three years to five years? How does that change or that remain the same? And then in terms of your upcoming game launches, which one do you think -- because these are all very highly anticipated, which one do you think that we probably will see launches soon? And then in terms of -- how do you see the significance of those? Thank you. -- [Foreign Speech] -- [Foreign Speech] So I will provide a brief translation of William's remarks. So firstly, how the pandemic situation globally would affect our thinking of game promotions, particularly in the overseas market. William's commented that generally speaking, the pandemic situation requires people to spend more time in house. So it is a structural tailwind for overall activities that happen at home, playing video games, watching drama, etc. And that, we think, is going to also benefit our game promotions because this content is having more user time, so to speak, on a global scale and we are not particularly concerned about the pandemic situation disrupting our plan, our original plan of game launches. Especially for these mature overseas markets, users are more attracted and emphasize a lot on game quality. I think that is our biggest selling point. It is the quality of the NetEase games.And second, you asked on the approval process and our expectation on the overseas games. It's really difficult for us to do a force ranking, which one is Number 1, which one is Number 2, because for all these projects since the inception of the project business planning, we think they are all great products, representing highest quality in their respective genre to target a trend to a very different segment of target users. So we are very excited. Some of the games can be launched as early as the middle of this year and some might have to wait until the second half, later part of this year. And William draws also a closing remark that he himself personally, throughout and given the pandemic situation, he's actually been thinking and giving a lot of more thought in terms of how game content can be designed and developed and how game content can be distributed to fulfill a better social responsibility and value to families, to people around the globe. -- Thank you. William and Charles, that's very helpful.We will take our next question from the line of Thomas Chong from Jefferies. Your line is open, please go ahead. -- Hi, good morning. Thanks William, Charles and Margaret for taking the question. I have a question, back to the music business. Given the fact that we have been also monetizing for the live streaming business models, can you comment about how we should think about the competition in the live streaming space as well as the competition with short form video? [Foreign Speech] -- [Foreign Speech] -- [Foreign Speech] So in the interest of time, I will provide a brief translation of William's remarks just now. So broadcasting is just one way of us thinking how we can monetize on our NetEase Cloud Music platform. It is not the only way and we will continue to explore different and innovative and diversified ways of monetization in a sensible and user appealing way. And -- but the essence of us, the biggest ambition and the mission of us doing the NetEase Cloud Music platform is that we want to contribute whenever we can within our ability to help promote and better enhance the Chinese music industry as a whole. It might look very different from mature market in the Western world, but we think Chinese music market is huge with huge upside potential and it could allow multiple players to develop its respective differentiated competitiveness, advantage and edge in collectively making China's online music industry a better and a more promising industry. -- Thank you.Due to time limit, that concludes today's questions-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the conference back to Margaret Shi for any additional or closing remarks. -- Thank you once again for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact us directly or TPG Investor Relations. Have a great day. Thank you. -- Okay.

After some recent fraud issues, the move is understandable, but shareholders in these two major stocks aren't happy about the ramifications.Washington has had a tough relationship with Beijing for years now, with issues ranging from trade disputes and tariffs to mishandling of intellectual property. Lawmakers have sought ways to protect U.S. companies from adverse business practices in China, but their lack of progress has made some impatient to take more aggressive action.Image source: Getty Images.Accordingly, the Senate passed a bill earlier this week that could potentially prevent foreign companies from listing their shares on U.S. stock markets. Under the , companies would have to demonstrate their independence from foreign government ownership and control, as well as submit financial statements for a U.S.-based oversight audit.That might not seem like such a large barrier, but legal issues in China could make it difficult or impossible for Chinese companies to comply. Already, Baidu has said that it will consider delisting its stock from the Nasdaq if the legislation goes into effect. With lawmakers having identified Baidu along with a host of other popular Chinese stocks as potentially affected by the legislation, it could be  to maintain their access as U.S. investors under the law.Recent events with some Chinese companies have been painful for shareholders, highlighting the potential impact of fraud on investors. Yet fraud isn't something that's limited to China. Some of the biggest scandals in stock market history have happened with U.S. companies, including Enron and WorldCom in the 2000s.What is true, though, is that investing internationally takes more effort. Language barriers can prove problematic, and the disclosures required under foreign law are sometimes different from what you'd expect to see from a U.S. company.Nevertheless, some of the best investing opportunities have come from Chinese companies. NetEase, for example, has been hugely successful, building up its  into a global colossus and finding ways to try to expand the scope of its enterprise over time. Baidu has faced longer struggles, but it maintains a commanding role in internet search within China.Investors shouldn't lose hope for their ability to keep investing in Chinese stocks, but they should be vigilant.

The Chinese tech giant's revenue rose 26% annually to 108.1 billion yuan ($15.3 billion), clearing expectations by about 7 billion yuan.Its net profit grew 6% to 28.9 billion yuan ($4.1 billion), topping expectations by over 5 billion yuan.

However, its gaming business did most of the heavy lifting and offset the softer growth of its fintech and cloud businesses.Image source: Getty Images.Tencent's online gaming revenue rose 31% annually, accelerating from its 25% growth in the fourth quarter, and accounted for 35% of its top line. Its growth was driven by mobile games like  and  in China, as well as  and  in overseas markets.Tencent's smartphone gaming revenue rose 64% annually during the quarter, but its PC gaming revenue fell 15% due to the weakness of  and the closures of internet cafes during the pandemic.However, Tencent's overall gaming business remained strong throughout the crisis, as stay-at-home measures boosted its growth in active and paid users. Tencent also refreshed its older games with graphical upgrades, in-game events, and social features, which helped gamers find other players in the same city.It expanded its League of Legends franchise with a new card game on PCs and mobile devices, and it continues to launch fresh overseas games like . In short, Tencent continues to expand and evolve its gaming business to widen its moat against resilient rivals like  .Many investors likely expected Tencent's ad growth to decelerate as the pandemic paralyzed the Chinese economy. Yet Tencent's online ad revenue rose 32% annually, accelerating from 19% growth in the fourth quarter and accounting for 16% of its top line.Image source: Getty Images.Tencent attributed that growth to a 47% jump in its \"social and others\" ad revenue -- which mainly came from its mobile ad network, which places ads in other apps, and WeChat Moments, which let its WeChat users share photos, status updates, and websites within a close circle of friends. That growth easily offset a 10% revenue decline in its media advertising business, which sells ads for its video and news platforms.Tencent noted that consumers spent more\u00a0time using mobile apps as they stayed home, which convinced advertisers -- especially in the gaming, internet services, and online education industries -- to buy more ads. Stronger demand across those industries offset its lower ad revenue from the fast-moving consumer goods, auto, and travel industries.That growth spurt is encouraging, but Tencent expects its ad revenue to \"normalize\" over the next few quarters as lockdown-focused businesses buy fewer ads. Therefore, this business could still face tougher headwinds throughout the rest of the year.Tencent's fintech and business services unit, which generates most of its revenue from WeChat Pay and Tencent Cloud, experienced a significant slowdown during the quarter.Its revenue rose 22% annually, down from 39% growth in the fourth quarter, and accounted for 24% of Tencent's top line. That slowdown was disappointing, since Tencent specifically  in late 2018 to expand those divisions and reduce its overall dependence on video games.Its fintech business, which competes against  -backed AliPay, struggled with lower commercial payments, especially off-line payments and cash withdrawals, throughout the lockdown period. That decline was partly offset by the stable growth of its wealth management and lending services. However, Tencent's commercial transactions had largely rebounded by late April.Tencent Cloud, China's second-largest cloud platform after Alibaba Cloud, was hampered by delayed deployments and fewer client acquisitions during the crisis. Those blows were partially cushioned by its expansion of remote collaboration services like WeChat Work and . Tencent believes its cloud business will eventually recover, but it could remain a weak link until the economy stabilizes.Tencent's strengths are clearly outweighing the weaknesses. Looking ahead, the growth of Tencent's gaming business should offset the slowdown at its fintech and cloud businesses, and buy it more time to restart stalled out projects.Tencent's growth could be lumpy over the next few quarters, and it still faces intense competition from rivals like ByteDance, NetEase, and Alibaba. However, its well-diversified portfolio of gaming, advertising, and business services still makes it one of the safest and strongest long-term investments in China's crowded tech sector.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The coronavirus has brought economies around the world to a screeching halt as businesses\u00a0large and\u00a0small have shuttered, and many of those allowed to keep operating have far fewer customers. The revenue declines have resulted in more permanent business closures and driven unemployment rates higher.But there are a few investing sectors that have thus far remained relatively immune to the worst effects of the pandemic. With hundreds of millions of people spending nearly all their time at home, video games have become a go-to way to pass the time for many and video game companies are seeing much higher user engagement, This, in turn, is boosting sales for gaming giants  and . Let's take a closer look at how these two companies and their investors could benefit from this new norm.Image source: Getty Images.In late February, NetEase announced . Its revenue rose by 9% year over year to 15.73 billion yuan (roughly $2.26 billion), beating analysts' consensus estimate by $70 million. Non- net income rose 15% to 3.66 billion yuan ($526 million) or $4.03 per share. This also beat Wall Street's average earnings estimate of $3.57 per share.Though NetEase shares rose in the days that followed that report, they then declined significantly as overall equity markets were decimated in the first half of March. But while the broad market has only partially rebounded from that plunge, NetEase stock more than recovered: It's up more than 7.5% year to date, compared to the decline of 12% at the time of writing.NetEase generates a majority of its revenue from its gaming segment -- it was 74% in the fourth quarter. According to data from App Annie, NetEase ended 2019 as the world's second-largest mobile gaming publisher in terms of sales, just below Tencent.That leadership position can be attributed to its strong gaming portfolio. Its was one of the most popular games on 's iOS in recent months, and new titles such as , , and  are also driving user engagement higher. Revenue from and mobile grew by double-digit-percentage rates in 2019. NetEase also launched a 3D version of the mobile game and is confident about its long-term success.According to company management, simulation games are gaining popularity in China, and NetEase is optimistic about its long-term prospects in the gaming category.The company's other business segments are also largely coronavirus-proof.\u00a0In late 2019, NetEase spun off its online education unit as , but still retains a majority interest in the company.  With schools' and colleges' campuses closed, Youdao is bound to experience a surge in remote education users of its streaming platform.NetEase's \"innovative business\" segment generates revenue from live video streaming, online ads, and NetEase Cloud Music. While Youdao accounted for 4% of sales in Q4, innovative business generated 24% of revenue.During the , management said it expected that the company's ad business would take the largest hit from the pandemic-propelled downturn, while its online games and online education businesses were unlikely to feel any major impact.China-based Tencent is the largest gaming company in the world, and its stock, too, has been volatile in 2020. At this point, though, it's back up by 7% year to date. The company generated $16 billion in gaming revenue during 2019.Tencent owns a roughly 15% stake in mobile gaming studio and has purchased stakes in many other companies behind blockbuster games such as  and  (. And Tencent owns a strong portfolio of games it developed in-house and continues to create new ones.Tencent's (known as  in China) has been a raging hit in the  -- just one demonstration of Tencent's significant potential to grow gaming sales in international markets. In 2019, the company generated just 23% of online game revenues from markets outside of China. The pandemic provides the gaming giant with an opportunity to diversify its player base.According to a Sensor Tower report,  raked in $232 million in revenue during March, up by 200% year over year and up by 21% from February; it was the top mobile game in the world last month. was the second highest-earning mobile game last month, generating $112 million in revenue.But online games only account for 30% of the company's revenue. Its other business segments include cloud services, mobile payment systems, and social networks. Tencent has managed to outperform equity markets as several businesses (with the exception of mobile payments) will likely be .China is a heavily regulated market. In 2018, the government temporarily stopped approving new Tencent games -- preventing them from being launched -- citing concerns over violence and . That suspension lasted nine months. There have been other more temporary service shutdowns over various censorship issues since then. On April 4, the Chinese government shut down all mobile gaming servers for 24 hours as part of a national day of mourning related to the coronavirus pandemic. While China is the world's largest gaming market, investors might be wary about government policies in an industry that generally has no restrictions in other global markets.\u00a0Another major risk factor is the ever-changing nature of the gaming sector. There has been a major shift toward digital and mobile gaming over the last few years. But, as in the rest of the  one never knows what might drive the next major disruption.For example, other gaming giants such as  and lost some ground in 2018 with ByteDance's  changed the gaming landscape with its \"battle royale\" game mode.While there are certain risks involved in investing in these companies, both have generously rewarded their long-term shareholders. In the last 10 years, NetEase shares are up by more than 900% while Tencent has gained a mammoth 1,190%.These two giants depend heavily on gaming, but their other business segments provide them with diversification. And both are making efforts to grow their international footprints, which will further lower their risk profile.The pandemic-driven uptick in the number of video game players and the growth in the amount of time they spend playing will be a near-term tailwind. But research company Newzoo expects the global gaming market to grow by 7.3% to $160 billion in 2020, which will provide ample opportunities for the leading companies to drive their top lines higher. Another Global Data report estimates the gaming market will reach $300 billion by 2025, up from $130 billion in 2018, an annualized growth rate of 13%.

Unfortunately, Cheetah's latest fourth-quarter report suggests that the stock could head much lower in this ugly market.Image source: Getty Images.Cheetah's revenue plunged 56% annually to\u00a0612 million yuan ($87.9 million) during the fourth quarter. Excluding the deconsolidation of revenue from the live streaming platform LiveMe, which it no longer holds a majority stake in, Cheetah's revenue declined 47%.Revenue from its utility products and related services fell 62% to 298.6 million yuan ($42.9 million) due to lower mobile app revenue in both China and overseas markets, as well as a decline in PC software revenue. About 80% of this segment's revenue came from ads, while the rest came from a la carte software sales and subscription services.The business's overseas mobile utility app revenue dropped 69% annually to 92.8 million yuan, mainly due to Facebook's removal of its ads. It doesn't account for Google's recent suspension of its apps and ads, which occurred in the first quarter.Cheetah's domestic mobile utility app revenue fell 70% to 106.5 million yuan, due to sluggish ad spending  and tougher competition from rival platforms, while its PC revenue fell 26% to 99.4 million yuan as Chinese users pivoted from PCs to mobile devices.Revenue from Cheetah's mobile games fell 13% annually to 285.1 million yuan ($40.9 million) due to a lack of hit games. That was also disappointing since market leaders   and   both reported robust growth in gaming revenue in their latest quarters.Image source: Getty Images.Cheetah expects its first-quarter revenue, which reflects the full deconsolidation of LiveMe's business, to decline 50%-55% annually.Google recently refused to reinstate Cheetah's Play Store, AdMob, and Google Ad accounts.

Last quarter, Cheetah generated 77% of its gaming revenue from ads, which have lower margins and less stickiness than in-app purchases and subscriptions.Cheetah's questionable behavior cost the company its overseas partnerships with Facebook and Google, and it now faces brutal competition from better-run tech giants with deeper pockets in its home market. Moreover, China's ad giants have recently ramped up their efforts to weed out click fraud, and Facebook and Google's actions against Cheetah could spark similar probes.As its name suggests, Cheetah is a company that exhausted itself in a reckless sprint -- and it could now face devastating losses as it runs out of room to run.

The pandemic tossed a wrench into its core growth engine, the social entertainment segment that houses its live streaming business.Image source: Getty Images.Tencent Music generated 68% of its first-quarter revenue from its \"social entertainment and others\" unit, which makes most of its money from live-streamed karaoke performances on its WeSing platform. Viewers buy virtual gifts for their favorite performers, who receive a cut of the revenue.This business attracted new mobile monthly active users (MAUs) during the quarter, but its sequential growth in paid users remained sluggish and its average revenue per paid user (ARPPU) declined sequentially and annually.Social EntertainmentTotalGrowth (QOQ)Growth (YOY)Mobile MAUs256 million15%13%Paid Users12.8 million3%19%ARPPU111.1 yuan(20%)(13%)Revenue4.27 billion yuan(17%)3%QOQ = Quarter-over-quarter.

However, those efforts could also dilute WeSing's identity and force Tencent Music to compete more aggressively against other live streaming platforms in China.The rest of Tencent Music's revenue came from its online music business, which sells streaming subscriptions and digital downloads to consumers, and sub-licenses its songs to other companies.

However, the company's total gross margin still contracted 410 basis points annually to 31.3% during the quarter as the social entertainment unit's margin contraction offset the online music unit's gains.Tencent Music didn't provide any guidance for the rest of 2020, but analysts expect its revenue to rise 18% and\u00a0for its earnings to dip 5% this year.

Yet there's a pocket of growth many investors are overlooking during the downturn: Chinese tech companies that generate most of their revenue from domestic streaming services.One such company is , the largest streaming music platform in China.\u00a0TME isn't dependent on supply chains or consumer spending and it wasn't surprising when its fourth-quarter numbers beat analysts' estimates with accelerating revenue and earnings growth.Image source: Getty Images.Its revenue rose 35% annually to\u00a07.29 billion yuan ($1.05 billion), beating estimates by $40 million and marking its strongest growth in three quarters.It posted a net profit of 1.04 billion yuan ($150 million), compared to a loss of 876 million yuan in the prior-year quarter. On a non-IFRS (adjusted) basis, its net profit rose 47% annually to 1.34 billion yuan ($193 million), or $0.12 per share -- which also beat expectations by two cents. Those numbers were solid, but the story gets even better when we dig deeper into its numbers and its guidance regarding the ongoing coronavirus crisis.TME generated 29% of its revenue from its online music unit, which offers streaming subscriptions and digital downloads.The platform's annual growth in monthly active users (MAUs) stalled out at 644 million during the quarter, but its growth in paid users, subscription revenue, and ARPPU (average revenue per paid user) all accelerated from the third quarter.

Those growth engines easily offset a decline in its , which comes from licensing its songs to other streaming platforms.Those growth rates indicate that TME, which controls roughly three-quarters of\u00a0China's online streaming music market, with its QQ Music, Kugou, and Kuwou platforms, isn't losing listeners to smaller rivals like 's  Cloud Music.TME's social entertainment business, which includes its live-streaming karaoke platform WeSing, generated the other 71% of its revenue during the quarter.The platform's user base shrank sequentially and annually, but its base of paid users continued to expand and they spent more money on virtual gifts and other value-added services.

That balance enables TME to achieve consistent profitability -- a goal which , one of its , still hasn't achieved. TME's dominance of China's streaming music market also gives it tremendous clout in negotiating favorable licensing fees from record labels.Those tailwinds boosted TME's gross margin 10 basis points annually to 34.1% during the quarter. Its operating margin of 16.5% also marked a huge improvement from its negative operating margin of 18% (which included a one-time accounting charge) in the prior-year quarter.TME doesn't offer guidance, but\u00a0analysts expect its revenue and earnings to rise 25% and 36%, respectively, this year. Those are stellar growth rates for a stock that trades at less than 30 times forward earnings estimates.During the conference call, Chief Strategy Officer Tony Yip stated that TME's first-quarter revenue would be pressured by lower ad spending during coronavirus-related lockdowns and adjustments to its live-streaming platform for compliance reasons, but that it was \"taking steps to mitigate these impacts\" and expects its \"revenue growth to improve into the second half.\" That forecast suggests that the coronavirus crisis is passing in China as businesses come online again.Tencent Music currently trades below its IPO price of $13, and its  is gradually recovering from the coronavirus crisis. It dominates the streaming music market, its growth rates remain robust, and its margins and profits are improving.Therefore, I believe investors should accumulate shares of TME throughout the market swoon, since it deserves to go much higher once the crisis finally ends.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $330.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $314.90 (before broker commissions).

Its gross margin also expanded 10 basis points annually to 29.8%.Like China's other , Youdao enlists instructors to remotely tutor students on a live streaming platform. Surging demand for these services, especially in rural areas, has sparked a land grab by companies like , , , and Tencent's Penguin Tutoring.However, the coronavirus outbreak is also boosting demand for these remote learning tools as students stay home -- so that headwind could actually benefit Youdao.The innovative businesses segment, which generates revenue from NetEase Cloud Music, a live video streaming platform, online ads, and its discount e-commerce marketplace Yanxuan -- accounted for 24% of its top line.

Shoppers will also likely purchase more products on Yanxuan and other e-commerce platforms as they avoid brick-and-mortar retailers.The only soft spot is NetEase's advertising business, which could suffer as crisis-stricken companies spend less money on ads.

Cheetah generated nearly 23% of its revenue from Google's platforms in the first nine months of 2019.This a devastating setback for Cheetah, which already lost nearly 60% of its market value over the past 12 months as its revenue plunged and operating losses widened. Cheetah plans to appeal Google's decision, but its rocky relationship with the tech giant indicates that the company could be in serious trouble.Image source: Getty Images.Cheetah Mobile went public nearly six years ago. The Beijing-based company produces a wide range of mobile apps and games.Last quarter, it generated 58% of its revenue from entertainment apps like games and live streaming services, 38% from mobile utilities like its web browser, security, and cleanup tools, and the remaining 4% from AI tools and other products.Cheetah Mobile once seemed like a great , but it lost its momentum over the past four years as a series of controversies raised red flags regarding its\u00a0business.Fiscal year20152016201720182019*Revenue growth109%21%9%2%(28%)Source: Cheetah Mobile financial reports. *Analysts' expectations.Back in 2014, Google removed several of Cheetah's top apps from its app store rankings over misleading ads and strategies.For example, it promoted its popular Clean Master app -- which claims to boost a device's performance by clearing out junk files and optimizing memory usage -- via popup ads with fake virus warnings. Users who clicked those misleading ads\u00a0were directed to install the app. Cheetah also pushed users to uninstall Google Chrome and install its own CM Browser as part of its \"optimization\" process.Image source: Getty Images.Cheetah rectified those issues, but it was hit by a bearish report from Prescience Point in 2017, which claimed the\u00a0company was reporting fake traffic and revenue figures. The firm claimed that Cheetah's financials didn't align with analytics firm App Annie's numbers, and warned that Cheetah's auditor had ties to fraudulent Chinese companies.Cheetah refuted those claims, but its troubles continued in 2018 when it was\u00a0implicated in a massive click fraud scheme. App analytics company Kochava discovered that seven of Cheetah's apps defrauded advertisers by \"injecting\" background ad clicks in its apps to generate passive ad revenue without a user's knowledge.Cheetah denied the charges, but Google subsequently booted Cheetah's CM File Manager from the Play Store after an\u00a0internal review. Cheetah also voluntarily removed its Battery Doctor and CM Launcher apps. All those brewing concerns likely convinced Google to finally pull the plug on all of Cheetah Mobile's apps.Analysts were already expecting Cheetah Mobile's revenue to plunge this year when it posts its earnings in late March, and Google's removal of its apps from its Play Store and ad network will likely result in a much steeper decline. Google's actions could also prompt Chinese app stores to take a closer look at Cheetah's apps.Cheetah's stock looks cheap, but the company's declining revenue, operating losses, and shady practices make it a toxic investment. Moreover, the ongoing macro headwinds in China -- including the country's economic slowdown, the , and the unresolved trade war -- will likely flush out weaker  like Cheetah Mobile.Investors looking for a reliable play on China's mobile market should simply stick with bigger companies like   and  , which both generate stronger growth than Cheetah Mobile without controversial growth strategies.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Joining us today on the call from NetEase senior management is Mr. William Ding, our CEO, Mr. Charles Yang, Chief Financial Officer.I will now turn the call over to Charles, who will read the prepared remarks on behalf of William. -- Thank you, Margaret. And thank you, everyone, for participating in today's call.Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that all percentages are now based on renminbi. 2019 was an eventful year for NetEase. We expanded the reach of our online games, grew our international presence, IPO-ed our online learning, Youdao, advanced our music platform and refined our operations in e-commerce. For the full year, we grew our total net revenues by 16% to CNY59.2 billion, and increased our GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to our shareholders by 60% to CNY13.3 billion. Online games segment is the cornerstone of our business. Despite having launched fewer games throughout the year, we continued to grow our online games business at a healthy rate in 2019 with 16% year-over-year increase in net revenues. Driven by the steady performance of our long-standing titles, we once again exceeded CNY10 billion this quarter, for the past seven consecutive quarters.Our flagship titles continue to provide solid support for our online games business with increasing longevity and user loyalty. In 2019, revenues from Fantasy Westward Journey Online and Fantasy Westward Journey Mobile both grew at double-digit rate, remaining prevalent after years of operations. Westward Journey Online and its Mobile version also grew steadily in 2019. After over 15 years of operation, our FWJ and WWJ franchises have been instilled in the collective memory of a generation of Chinese players. We further expanded the reach of these IPs through the introduction of FWJ 3D in mid-December last year, captivating both returning fans as well as new audience.As another iteration of the FWJ franchise in mobile, this 3D version game reserves the classic gameplay and social system, while bringing brand-new experiences to mobile users in a real-time 3D world. We are still working on new updates and expansion packs to further optimize the experience for FWJ 3D. And we are confident that over the long term, the 3D version will show similar longevity and popularity as our other titles in this franchise. In addition to growing and strengthening our existing franchise, we are also good at incubating new ones. Our corporate DNA and content innovation, marketing expertise and long-term operations have allowed us to consistently deliver new and long-lasting game titles to our users.Onmyoji is the first of these relatively younger franchises that we have built in-house. We are pleased to see that as we introduce more innovative new storylines, new characters and other new content, the influence of Onmyoji's IP is growing and resonating well with game players. In 2019, Onmyoji topped the iOS grossing chart four times, stabilizing at a new run rate after more than three years of operation. In December, we launched Onmyoji: The Card Game, its second spin-off game. Living up to expectations, the new Onmyoji card game carried on the tradition of impressing the market with its exquisite artwork. With this iteration, we also introduced more competitive and strategic gameplay, winning over a large group of hardcore, collectible card players. We are now also currently working on several new Onmyoji games, including Onmyoji: Yokai Koya, a simulation game, which we plan to launch in the first half of this year.Identity V is another young IP, where we see the potential to be building to a successful NetEase franchise. With this goal in mind, we are continually enriching this IP through a variety of initiatives, including esports, IP collaborations and off-line activities. We have hosted a number of high-profile events featuring Identity V, including both international and regional series tournaments. Most notably our global championship, Call of the Abyss, has attracted over 800,000 players from around the world since December. We also collaborated with Happy Valley, a popular national theme park brand in China bringing some of the in-game characters to life. We are pleased to see the early success of Identity V as it becomes another powerful IP franchise, establishing a broad and vibrant community of young players in China and abroad.Invincible, our 2015 launch that has been growing steadily year-over-year in terms of the revenue and active users, is now one of China's biggest SLG titles. Like with many of our games, we invented a brand-new in-game mechanism that resets gamers' scores every season, creating a much more balanced game experience and setting a new standard for the genre. Given the recently increasing popularity of SLGs in China, we are optimistic about our prospects and are working to bring more exciting content to the promising SLG category. The prerequisite to build a successful franchise is the ability to create popular game IPs in-house, which is propelled by our world-class R&D infrastructure. Over the past two decades, we have built one of the largest in-house R&D teams with China's most talented and passionate game creators, supported by one of the most unique and comprehensive R&D infrastructures in the world. We empower each of our talent with our game-enthusiastic corporate culture and second-to-none training mechanism in the industry.Our training programs at NetEase Games Academy are widely recognized in China as a premier online games training institution for the creative minds. Most recently, two of our training programs were awarded the 2019 ATD Excellence in Practice Awards by the Association for Talent Development, one of the most authoritative international awards in the global talent development industry. As we move ahead, we will continue to foster talent and stimulate new ideas that propel the development of our games.2019 is also a fruitful year for our licensed games, especially for our joint venture with Blizzard Entertainment. World of Warcraft Classic was launched in August as an inventive recreation of WoW, as it was in 2006. And it was very well received by a generation of returning players and newcomers alike. We are very pleased to see the continued popularity of WoW in China, achieving a record number of total monthly subscribers in the fourth quarter with increased revenue quarter-over-quarter. In 2019, we continued to advance our games and make inroads that expand our reach in overseas market. Knives Out remained a household name in Japan, topping the iOS grossing chart multiple times during the year. Leveraging our knowledge of building game brands, we further strengthened Knives Out's brand presence by engaging in a series of successful collaborations and our first ever esports championship tournament in Japan.Identity V also exemplifies our ability to operate games in the overseas market over the long term, leading Japan's iOS topping chart for the first time in September. With the success of these titles, we have accumulated a better and deeper understanding of our users in terms of their interest, social behaviors and preferences in style, aesthetics and gameplay. We have integrated this successful experience and know-how into the design of our other games, enhancing our ability to deliver popular titles to Japanese users. In addition to our success in Japan, we've also expanded our footprint across more regions. In December, we launched Marvel Super War in several Southeast Asian markets where it topped many of the iOS download charts. Building on our existing success at home and abroad, we have many exciting games in our pipeline including Harry Potter: Magic Awakened, EVE Echoes, Onmyoji: Yokai Koya, Ghost World Chronicle, Revelation mobile game, Diablo Immortal and Pokemon Quest.Turning to our online learning business, Youdao made solid progress in 2019, significantly growing its online course businesses. Youdao enhanced several course products including high school Chinese and Physics, practical English for adults, and coding courses for kids. We are also seeing excellent adoption and a rapid increase in sales of Youdao's intelligent learning devices, driven by the successful launch of our second-generation dictionary pack. We also expanded our tutoring and sales team and substantially improved our tutoring and operating systems to support them. These efforts have been rewarded by robust growth in gross billings of Youdao's online courses by 125% in 2019 and over 200% in the fourth quarter. More importantly, we have accumulated experience that we can replicate across our highly scalable online course model and are beginning to benefit from economies of scale. In 2020, NetEase will continue to support Youdao's mission to bring users more effective and technology-driven education experiences.Our Cloud Music revenue hit a record high in the fourth quarter with membership revenue more than doubled year-over-year. Revenues from digital albums and live streaming also grew rapidly. Sales of digital albums have proven to be particularly effective on our platform. For example, sales from 22-year-old Chinese pop star, Wang Yibo's digital single No Sense, exceeded CNY10 million within just 11 hours. Similarly, sales of Chinese singer-songwriter Hua Chenyu's digital single How I'd Like to Love this World exceeded CNY50 million after 45 days online, marking the highest digital single sales record online in China according to a third-party data source.NetEase Cloud Music is home to a large number of independent musicians. More than 100,000 independent artists feature their music on our platform and their songs were played back more than 270 billion times in the year. This makes NetEase Cloud Music the most recognized platform for original music by Chinese artists. In 2019, we plan to use the platform's distribution capability and its broad influence to create more viral content across the Chinese music industry.And finally, our focus with Yanxuan in 2019 remained on improving supply chain management and operating efficiency. We effectively reduced our inventory compared to a year ago, and consistently improved our positive feedback rate from users in the quarter. We made adjustments to our pricing management, which resulted in increased revenue and better gross margins from the business. Our participation in product design has resulted in the creation of many hit products by providing valuable research and market analysis gained from the customer end to our manufacturers. At the same time, we have significantly improved our membership system and are seeing the benefits of increased member repurchase rate. As for our manufacturer and factory initiatives, we have helped to build tailored online data systems that have further improved their manufacturing process and quality.In 2020, we will continue to enhance our brand influence and reaching China by bringing even more high-quality and personalized products to a growing number of consumers. We are excited for the new year. As our existing game titles continue to impress the market with their phenomenal longevity, 2020 will also see more game launches in China and globally from NetEase. 2020 also marks the 20th anniversary of NetEase being a publicly traded company. As an internet veteran in China, NetEase has remained relevant and continues to be a forerunner in the evolving market. With our long track record of success, our goal is to inspire our ever-growing community while bringing increasing value to each of our stakeholders.Before I pass the call over to Charles, I would like to share some updates on the evolving situation with the coronavirus outbreak in China. Right after the corona outbreak, we reacted instantly and rolled out a series of initiatives to support the affected regions. We set up a special fund of CNY100 million. The fund will be used to purchase medical equipment and medicine from home and abroad and delivered to places where the outbreak is the most severe and help is most needed. At the same time, Yanxuan immediately delivered over 200,000 free masks and other protective supplies to our customers and set up special funds for the supply apartments. For Youdao, we were among the first ones in the industry to offer free courses to K-12 students in affected areas, which was later expanded to other regions of China.For the college students, Chinese University MOOC connected with 800 universities covering 4,000 professors' lectures. We also provide our technology support to help other off-line educational institutions to move courses to online through Youdao Intelligent Cloud. Our company took every effort to protect the health and safety of our employees and adopted multiple measures to maintain our operational efficiency, such as flexible work policy and remote office collaboration using our proprietary technology. Overall, with respect to the outbreak, we currently expect to see some impact to our business lines in the near term. However, the situation is evolving.NetEase is committed to providing support to our employees, users and communities, and working together as we together move through this challenging time.This now concludes William's comments.I will provide a brief overview and review of our fourth quarter and full-year 2019 financial results. Given the limited time on the call, I will be only presenting some abbreviated financial highlights. We encourage you to read through our press release issued earlier today for further details.Total net revenue for 2019 were CNY59.2 billion or $8.5 billion, representing 16% increase year-over-year. Net revenue for the fourth quarter came in at CNY15.7 billion or $2.3 billion, representing 9% increase year-over-year. For 2019, our net revenues from online games services grew 16% year-over-year to CNY46.4 billion. And in the fourth quarter, it was also up 5% year-over-year to CNY11.6 billion. Mobile games accounted for approximately 70% of net revenues from our online games services in the fourth quarter. For 2019, net revenues from Youdao were up 78% to CNY1.3 billion. And in the fourth quarter, net revenue from Youdao was up 78% to CNY410 million, primarily due to increased net revenues from its online courses and sales of the intelligent learning devices.For 2019, net revenues from innovative businesses and others were up 12% to reach CNY11.5 billion. In the fourth quarter, it was up 18% year-over-year to reach CNY3.7 billion, mainly due to the increased revenue contribution from Cloud Music and CC live streaming. Our gross margin was 52.2% in the fourth quarter. Gross margin for our online games remained relatively stable. It fluctuates quarter-to-quarter within a narrow bandwidth based on the revenue mix of mobile and PC, as well as self-developed and licensed games. Youdao's gross margin improved to 29.8% in the fourth quarter. This was primarily driven by the improvement of the sales and better economies of scales.Gross margin for innovative businesses and others was 20.6% in this quarter. Margin improvement, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, was primarily due to the increased revenue from Cloud Music. For the fourth quarter, total operating expenses were CNY5.2 billion. Our selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue was 13.7% in this quarter. On a full-year basis, selling and marketing expense as a percentage of full-year net revenue was at 10.5% compared with 13.5% in 2018. R&D expenses were CNY2.3 billion, up 5% from the previous quarter. We remain committed to investing in content creation and product development, which is what defines us as a technology company. On a full-year basis, R&D expenses represent 14.2% of full year's net revenue comparing to 14.4% in 2018.The effective tax rate was 22% for Q4 and 18% for the full-year 2019. The lower effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and for the full year compared to the 2018 period were mainly due to reduced losses from certain loss-making subsidiaries of the company. Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to our shareholders for the fourth quarter totaled CNY3.7 billion or $526.1 million representing a decrease of 23% quarter-over-quarter and an increase of 15% year-over-year.

On February 26, our Board also announced and approved a new share repurchase program for up to $1 billion of our outstanding ADS for the next 12 months beginning on March 2.Thank you for your attention. We would like now to open the call to your questions. Operator, let's go to Q&A, please.[Operator Instructions]We will take our first question from the line of Alex Poon from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead. -- [Foreign Speech]I'll translate my questions. First is regarding music. So we are hearing the master agreements between Tencent Music and the top three labels are ending this year -- next year. And how will this change the competition landscape, revenue growth and cost structure of NetEase Cloud Music in the next two years? And my second question is regarding the overall company. Kaola has been loss-making, but it has been sold. And Music already raised enough funds. And the overall company margin is improving. So what's the thoughts on balance sheet, cash flow in the next two, three years? Thank you very much. -- Thank you, Alex.[Foreign Speech] -- [Foreign Speech] -- Thank you, Alex.For your first question, let me provide a brief translation of William's response. So firstly, label companies' exclusivity arrangement in the past years has served China's overall online music industry and affects all sorts of players along the value chain, not only just the platform like us, but also app stores and hardware manufacturers, upstream and downstream players along the chain. We hope that all label companies, not just the big three, going forward, can all comply with the regulatory frameworks serving China, with aim to provide a healthy environment to the overall industry as a whole. Financially, it's definitely going to make the cost structure of the Cloud Music -- of the whole industry to return to a more healthy and normalized level because in the past, the whole industry has been overpaying the content cost twice, three times or even more to the label companies in this unfair setup.Once the cost structure can normalize, then players like NetEase Cloud Music can focus more resources in promoting innovative music content and encourage native Chinese musicians with our mission to create a vibrant, healthy and successful music culture and community in China. So that's the response to your first question.On your second question, on the cash. So first of all, let me make a comment that with a conscious effort of being more focused on our core businesses, starting from the end of 2018, and you see a series of fruitful actions throughout 2019, we are benefiting from the economies of scale. As a result, our balance sheet has been growing strong. Our cash position has been very, very strong. Along the way, we've been also very disciplined in paying dividends, increased the dividend payout ratio and have regular stock buyback programs. All in all, we've acted in a responsible way to our shareholders. And especially in a relatively more volatile market, we think by having a strong cash flow position together with a disciplined and responsible treasury policy to our shareholders, that will make NetEase an even stronger and more defensive company throughout this macro turmoil.Operator, next question, please.We'll take our next question from Hillman Chan from Citigroup. Your line is open, please go ahead. -- Hello, William, Charles and Margaret.[Foreign Speech]So my first question is on the coronavirus impact on various business lines, positive and negative? And how long the impact would last in your point of view? And my second question is on the overseas game expansion. Can management update on the time line with the major IPs like the Apple, Marvel and Harry Potter? Thank you very much. -- [Foreign Speech] -- [Foreign Speech]Okay. Thank you, Hillman. Let me provide a brief translation for your two questions. First question on the coronavirus impacts to our different business lines. Firstly, William commented that the situation definitely affects the economy as a whole. It also affects us, different BUs to a different extent. But in particular, advertising segment will be more affected by the situation, whereas our online games and online education businesses are relatively less impacted by the situation for now, especially for online education given the physical restrictions of people going out and moving around. It helps to raise the awareness and the adoption rate of online education, which propels the trend of the growth of this new format of learning.For your second question on our general strategy and pipeline about overseas games. Firstly, William commented that we are very serious and very focused on overseas expansion as a major business strategy of our games BU. We've achieved first-step achievements in Japan with a couple of games that's been well established, and we are hoping to further leverage this experience and expand into mainstream Western market by bringing more high-quality products to the users in those geographies. In the past couple of years, we've been consciously moving up the learning curves, and we think we are more prepared, more ready to reap some fruits in this year and in the coming two, three years.Operator, next question please.[Operator Instructions]We will take our next question from the line of Alex Yao from JP Morgan. Your line is open, please go ahead. -- [Foreign Speech]So, I would like to follow up with a question regarding the impact of the coronavirus breakout on the gaming side of the business. So from a consumers' perspective, are you guys seeing increasing usage and a better monetization during the coronavirus breakouts? And then secondly, from content development perspective, is the current situation making internal content development more difficult? Would that potentially affect the new game launch in China this year? Thank you. -- [Foreign Speech] -- [Foreign Speech] -- [Foreign Speech] -- Thank you, Alex. I'll provide a brief translation for everyone's benefit on the call. So in terms of the user metrics, William commented that Chinese New Year period is always a high season for online entertainment as a whole for our games. This New Year period is obviously being affected by the coronavirus situation, so it is a longer Chinese New Year period. User metrics has been stronger than the previous similar quarters in Chinese New Year.And for your question on the R&D impact. For now, we do not see any significant delays or impacts to our R&D development progress as well as the planned pipeline launch schedule. Obviously, the virus situation is evolving, and we will continually assess the impact on the game development, if any. And William also further supplemented the virus impact on the online learnings in particular, we are a firm believer that online learning actually offers a better user experience overall vis-a-vis the traditional off-line learning. I think with the virus situation, more and more people are now more receptive and adaptive to the online learning model. And for a lot of learners, it is also an opportunity for them to be more outreaching to a more variety of knowledge that is only available and offered in a convenient way online.So all in all, we think this virus situation is probably a catalyst to propel the overall online learning industry as a whole.Operator, next question please.We will take our next question from the line of Natalie Wu from CICC. Your line is open, please go ahead. -- Thanks.[Foreign Speech]I would translate myself quite quickly. Just my question is regarding Cloud Music. Just wondering, despite that you've launched several features last year including Cloud Village, so you emphasized on the highlights broadcasting features on the Cloud Music app. But according to the QuestMobile, the daily time spent per user dropped by around 20% in the second half of last year. Just wondering what's the reason behind, or it's just simply because the QuestMobile data is not acting right? Can you give us some color on the Cloud Village business contribution for the Cloud Music? And also what kind of the new features that we should be anticipating this year? Thank you. -- [Foreign Speech] -- [Foreign Speech] -- [Foreign Speech] -- [Foreign Speech] -- [Foreign Speech] -- [Foreign Speech] -- [Foreign Speech] -- [Foreign Speech] -- Thank you, Natalie, for your question. Let me briefly translate William's comments. So Cloud Village as well as the other features such as live streaming, etc., this is overall -- this is our way of thinking how, as a music platform, we can enhance value-add to our users. Most of them are very vibrant music enthusiasts. We want to provide an integrated experience, not only just listening, but from listening to also spending more time watching the streams as well as interactions. So many of the initiatives and the strategies are around us building a more vibrant community on our NetEase Cloud Music platform, but the mission of us tapping into the online music segment is really to provide the most conducive channel of promoting native songs, native IPs for the Chinese independent musician artist.With regard to your second part of the question, on the QuestMobile data. Again, I think you are referring to the average daily user time spent on the app. Again, we do not know how external third-party data channels track this number. But based on what we are seeing in the second half, there's no decline in the user activity and the user time spent on our platform as a whole. So that's probably something you can further verify and double check with the external channel.Operator, next question please.We will take our next question from the line of Shi Jialong from Nomura. Your line is open, please go ahead. -- Hi, good morning, William, Charles and Margaret. Thanks for taking my question.[Foreign Speech]I have two questions. My first question is a follow-up on the overseas expansion. Just wondering how much of NetEase's mobile gaming revenue is currently generated from overseas market? And the management mentioned earlier on the call, this year will be a harvest year for NetEase online gaming business in the overseas market. So I just wonder what is the growth potential for the revenue contribution from the overseas game market going forward. My second question is about regulation. I just wonder how management think of the regulatory environment this year for China's online gaming industry.Last year, the authorities suspended new game approvals for certain number of months. So I just wonder what management think of the regulatory trend this year for China's game market. Thank you. -- [Foreign Speech] -- [Foreign Speech] -- [Foreign Speech] -- Okay. Thank you, Jialong, for your questions. Let me provide a brief translation and further supplement to some of the number related answers. Firstly, William commented that I think as all of us have noticed that over the Chinese New Year period, Apple iOS App Store has also implemented more stringent requirements, requiring developers who upload their content onto Apple iOS store would need to provide evidence of approvals, which is in line with the regulator's more emphasis in regulation or IP protection. In a way, we think that this is going to be more beneficial to first tier players, big players like NetEase. We have over 50 game studios, over 10,000 in-house developers working in a very compliant way of creating premium content. So when the whole environment, whether it's the iOS App Store, whether it's the regulators that's putting more emphasis in protecting IP and also encouraging regulated content to -- only regulated content to be uploaded and also having more punishment on the IP violations, that is longer-term beneficial for the whole industry, in particular, toward upstream content providers.On the top of our emphasis on in-house development, we are also putting more focus on collaborating with global developers. Joining hands -- strong hands together hopefully in making a joint effort to provide some exciting content to the global audience. That naturally brings to your first part of the question. For 2019, on a full-year basis, this is the very first time that NetEase overseas game revenue has accounted for more than 10% of the overall game revenue. First time in NetEase's history as bringing us closer to a global premium game operator. Like William commented earlier on, I think this year and the next couple of years, we are going to see more fruit -- we are going to bear more fruit in our international expansion.Operator? -- Thank you for the comments.Due to the time limit, that concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the conference back to Margaret Shi for any additional or closing remarks. -- Thank you once again for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact us directly or TPG Investor Relations. Have a great day. -- Thank you, everyone.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- \n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The provider of online services and casual games doesn't report financial results until later this month, but obviously investors think it will do just fine, going by its buoyant stock.This isn't an all-time high for NetEase. The stock was trading nearly 7% higher when it peaked in late 2017. However, for the stock to push to its highest level in more than two years is notable in itself, making it one of the few Chinese stocks scoring fresh recent highs last week. So let's review three reasons the market is warming up to NetEase again.Image source: NetEase.It's been nearly two months since NetEase last announced financial results, but when it did, it hit the ball out of the park.\u00a0NetEase posted an 11% increase in revenue in\u00a0\u00a0with an even meatier 74% surge in adjusted earnings from continuing operations.\u00a0The climate isn't kind in China when it comes to online advertising, and regulators have been known to put the clamps on the mobile and PC gaming industries form time to time. But NetEase has managed to persevere through the highs and lows. By the time 2019 is in the books, it will be 12 consecutive years of double-digit revenue growth for NetEase, and that's the kind of winning streak that commands the market's respect.\u00a0One of last year's forgotten Chinese IPOs --   -- is showing signs of life in 2020. The\u00a0Chinese intelligent-learning company has soared 64% so far this year, and it's now well above its original $17 offering price after spending most of 2019 as a broken IPO.\u00a0Youdao has been one of the few market winners in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, as the operator of e-learning solutions is  if the virus continues to intensify and physical schools temporarily close down. On top of that, Youdao was already on a roll, with gross billings for its online courses more than doubling over the past year. Its K-12 student base has nearly tripled.\u00a0NetEase has skin in this game, having spun Youdao off last year and commanding a 67.6% stake at the time of the IPO. But even so, Youdao may not move the needle much for NetEase. This is a $2.6 billion company, so NetEase's position is worth roughly $1.8 billion, while NetEase commands an enterprise value just shy of $40 billion. However, some investors who want in on Youdao could choose to buy the less risky NetEase instead.\u00a0Seeing a company routinely smoke Wall Street profit targets is great, but the only thing better than that is when the percentage of the beat is widening.

Let's see why market sentiment has turned around for these three Wall Street newbies.\u00a0Image source: Uber Technologies.Growth is starting to accelerate for the world's leading ridesharing service. Uber's revenue has gone from rising 14% in the second quarter of last year -- its first report after going public in the springtime of last year -- to 30% in the third quarter and 37% in .\u00a0The most impressive part of this story is that top-line growth is accelerating at the same time it's steering closer to profitability.

Its faster-growing Uber Eats business continues to be a drag on its bottom line, but its take rate continues to improve on that front. Uber is going a lot of things right, and with 111 million monthly active platform consumers and growing, it's hard to see the stock shifting back into reverse.One of this year's biggest winners regardless of IPO class is SmileDirectClub. The company sells clear dental aligners at a steep discount to braces or aligners available through dentists and orthodontists. SmileDirectClub markets directly to consumers, using locally scanned impressions of teeth and remote dental pros to create the corrective aligners.\u00a0The platform's popularity is booming, with revenue soaring\u00a051% in SmileDirectClub's\u00a0. The excitement in 2020 has stemmed from the \u00a0that opens the door for SmileDirectClub to sell its products directly to the dental industry.

Youdao closed out the year in the mid-teens, but it's been moving sharply higher in 2020.\u00a0Youdao's first quarterly report as a public company is encouraging. Revenue nearly doubled, up 98% to hit $48.4 million. Its adult paid enrollments are growing slowly, but its K-12 student base has nearly tripled over the past year. Add it all up, and gross billings for its online courses have more than doubled over the past year. There is growth across all three of its segments -- online courses, intelligent-learning device sales, and online marketing services -- and investors wanting to ride Youdao with slightly less volatility can buy into majority stakeholder NetEase. The controlling stakeholder hasn't generated the 50% pop that Youdao has, but it's still smoking the market in 2020 with its 11% ascent. Youdao is a small part of NetEase's business, but it does have a 67.6% stake in its spinoff.\u00a0\u00a0will always be risky.

Let's see how this outbreak could affect Chinese companies, many of which were already struggling with China's economic slowdown.The Chinese government has already locked down over a dozen cities to contain the virus, and many cities have been suspending public transportation, taxis, and ride-hailing services. Air travel between Chinese cities is being tightly controlled, and overseas airlines are\u00a0either canceling or changing their flights into China.Therefore, investors should steer clear of Chinese online travel agencies like , hotel chains like , and airlines like\u00a0 .

Luckin's revenue has been rising by triple-digit percentages since its IPO last year, but that meteoric growth was mainly driven by new store openings and steep promotions. Its losses are still widening, and the coronavirus could prevent its new stores from generating sustainable comps growth.Companies that generate most of their revenue from display ads could also struggle since the outbreak will likely throttle China's economic growth and force companies to rein in their marketing expenses. The ongoing slowdown of China's economy -- which is growing at its slowest rate in\u00a0three decades -- already hurt advertising heavyweights like\u00a0 and \u00a0over the past year. The coronavirus outbreak could exacerbate that slowdown, and crush those companies' hopes for a cyclical recovery.The longer consumers stay home, the more likely they'll use e-commerce platforms like\u00a0's\u00a0Tmall and . Both e-commerce leaders generated strong growth throughout 2019 as the country's economy stalled, and the coronavirus outbreak could boost their online orders throughout 2020.China's video game industry should also hold up well, as long as the government  new gaming approvals again or implement tougher playtime restrictions.  , which generates most of its revenue from video games and has  than its larger rival , should be well-insulated from the coronavirus fears.Image source: Getty Images.Live video streaming platforms, which generate most of their revenue by allowing viewers to buy virtual gifts for their favorite broadcasters, should also be immune to the slowdown.

Baidu's freemium video platformcould also see an uptick in paid subscribers as viewers watch more shows and movies from home.The media often compares the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak to the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s, which\u00a0ultimately claimed\u00a0about 1,000 lives over eight months before being contained.Yet many Chinese stocks which were crushed during the SARS epidemic ultimately recovered. Shares of (then known as Ctrip) have risen about 1,450% since the SARS epidemic started in Nov. 2002. NetEase's stock fared even better with a 2,910% rally, and shares of China Southern Airlines more than doubled.Therefore, investors shouldn't panic and sell all their  on the coronavirus news.

And more than stateside mainstays \u00a0 or , Activision has the household-name American brands (,\u00a0) that investors are hanging their hats on in forward-thinking valuations.Image source: Activision Blizzard.The American gaming industry as a whole took a huge fall from its all-time highs in late 2018. Every major domestic gaming company experienced a six-month low circa March 2019 and has been recovering since then. Currently, Activision sits at a 27.49% loss compared with its Sept. 28, 2018, high of $83.19. The correction might be generally attributed to a generational shift from physical, console-based product to digitally based mobile and social gaming.Consumers also stopped spending record amounts of money on in-game content, which accounted for 50% of console revenue in 2018. Activision and its American competitors experienced a 2018 holiday sales hiccup, which weighed down 2018 Q4 results across the board and likely correlated highly with the 2019 gaming stock slump.The companies responded quickly, and the strategy they employed to bounce back has yet to really sink in with their core American audiences.ATVI data by YCharts.Note in the chart above that when it comes to tracking gaming companies specifically, the\u00a0\u00a0is more accurate than the more diversified\u00a0.American gaming consumer, meet China.With an internet population just under 4 times that of America, China is now No. 1 in total video game revenue ($36.54 billion versus America's $35.51 billion), although the country imposes strict gameplay curfews on children under 18. Chinese gaming companies have been dangling the carrot of market access over the heads of American companies for quite some time under the radar. The result: considerable Chinese influence over American gaming.The massive Chinese holding company Tencent owns just under 5% of Activision Blizzard. American gamers found out just how much 5% can be during a dustup a few months ago at the annual BlizzCon festival.At BlizzCon 2019, Blizzard punished Hong Kong gamer\u00a0Ng Wai Chung (known as Blitzchung) for using a company-sanctioned stream to speak out in favor of Hong Kong's liberation. He forfeited thousands in prize money and was banned from the following year's tournament.In America, the response was powerful and immediate, rising to the level of Congress and inspiring a widespread commercial boycott of Activision Blizzard's key titles.\u00a0Meanwhile, the stock suffered only a 7.82% loss and recovered that loss in a month. Why?Investors were much more concerned that Activision Blizzard procure the appropriate credentials to continue to distribute  in China. Activision seemed most concerned with this as well. The company deployed two press releases\u00a0simultaneously in response to the Blitzchung controversy, one to America and one to China. The American release apologized, reduced the punishment, and guaranteed free speech to BlizzCon players. The Chinese release doubled down on the decision, promising a ban and to \"protect [China's] national dignity.\"So, yeah, Activision sent two completely different messages out, but the smoke screen was enough for the company to renew its agreement with Chinese distributor   out to 2023 and help to ensure 's continued success in China. (Failure might have cost the company billions of dollars in in-game transactions over the next few months.)Since then, American bloggers have exposed the subterfuge ad infinitum. Every player in the world of gaming knows what Activision did. But if you look at the ticker, you'll see investor sentiment turn positive at about the same point that American consumer sentiment turned negative (circa Nov. 12, 2019).Can the scale of a company protect it from losing value even as it disappoints its core audience?Actually, it may be time to redefine the core audience of American gaming companies. To find out if Activision Blizzard and other American gaming companies will continue their recovery in 2020, look to China.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

Its mobile messaging app\u00a0WeChat reaches 1.15 billion monthly active users (MAUs), its older QQ messaging platform hosts 731 million MAUs, and it's the world's largest video game publisher by annual revenue.However, Beijing-based ByteDance, the\u00a0world's most valuable start-up with a valuation of $75 billion, has become a thorn in Tencent's side in recent years. Its flagship short video app TikTok (known as Douyin in China), which topped 500 million MAUs in\u00a02018, is luring away Gen Z users, who consider WeChat to be an app . ByteDance's news app Toutiao, which curates \"clickbait\" content, is also pulling younger and lower-income users away from Tencent News.Image source: Getty Images.The growth of ByteDance's family of apps, which\u00a0surpassed 1.5 billion MAUs last year, is forcing Tencent to resurrect old apps and develop new video apps to . Failing to do so would throttle the growth of its online advertising business, which accounted for 19% of its revenue last quarter.Unfortunately, ByteDance continues to grow, and it's been expanding into video games over the past year. Let's see how those efforts could undermine the gaming business, which generated 29% of Tencent's revenue last quarter.Over the past year, ByteDance acquired game developer Mokun Digital Technology and Levelup.ai, a developer of AI tools for video games. It also recently hired the core team of's  subsidiary Pangu Game after its parent company canceled the studio's projects, poached veterans of gaming companies like Perfect World, and\u00a0reportedly laid out plans to populate its gaming unit with over 1,000 employees.ByteDance hasn't officially unveiled any projects, but recently claimed that the unit will release its first two games in the spring for both Chinese and overseas gamers. Both games, along with ByteDance's longer-term pipeline, will include massively multiplayer online games with \"Chinese fantasy elements.\"Both Mokun and Pangu Game developed games for that crowded genre before, but\u00a0ByteDance still faces a tough uphill battle. Tencent and NetEase are still the largest game publishers , and both companies have massive brand recognition with consumers and established relationships with the government's fickle regulators.Tencent currently publishes five\u00a0of the 10 highest-grossing iOS games in China, according to App Annie. Its flagship title  ranks first, followed by , its  of  with patriotic overtones. NetEase's  and  also remain in the top 10.Yet ByteDance enjoys three key advantages against Tencent. First, it doesn't need to fret over the high start-up costs for its gaming business, since it's still a privately held company backed by venture capitalists. Tencent, on the other hand, has been cutting costs with layoffs, restructuring efforts, and  investments.Image source: Getty Images.Second, the size of ByteDance's audience -- which uses apps like TikTok, Toutiao, Vigo, Huoshan, Flipchat, Duoshan, and Lark -- is catching up to Tencent's audience of WeChat and QQ users. ByteDance is already connecting the digital dots with cross-app connections, Mini Programs for Douyin in\u00a0China, and  with pre-installed apps.The message is clear: ByteDance wants to build an ecosystem, and video games would naturally fit into its platforms. It could directly integrate its games into TikTok and Toutiao, or develop stand-alone mobile games tethered to their services.Lastly, ByteDance's growing interest coincides with Tencent's decision to pivot more of its resources toward its growing  businesses. Tencent continues to buy stakes in video game developers, but many of its recent investments are focused on expanding its  -- which could leave its Chinese gamers exposed to ByteDance's gaming blitz.Tencent investors shouldn't worry too much about ByteDance's gaming ambitions for now. However, they should keep tabs on ByteDance's progress and see if it leverages the strength of its Gen Z apps to gain ground -- which could cause long-term problems for Tencent's biggest business.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Those moves all stabilized its non-GAAP earnings growth over the past year.Analysts still expect Tencent's revenue and earnings to rise 23% and\u00a021%, respectively, next year. Those are solid growth rates for a 21-year-old company, but a lot of that growth is arguably baked into the stock, which currently trades at 30 times forward earnings.Ma's stock sales in January coincided with his resignation as the chairman and general manager of Tenpay Micro Loan, the part of its fintech business that grants small loans to consumers.Image source: Getty Images.Ma also resigned as the legal representative and executive director of Tencent Credit last September. These moves all indicate that Ma is stepping back from Tencent's fintech business, a major growth engine that's also highly exposed to tighter government regulations.Ma is only 48 years old, but he could also be gradually stepping back from Tencent's non-core businesses -- as   founder and CEO Richard Liu  -- to spread out his responsibilities or make way for a potential successor.However, investors should note that Tencent president Martin Lau also sold half a million shares to raise HK$192 million ($25 million) in January. Lau previously sold a million shares for HK$430 million ($55 million) in March 2018. Those two transactions reduced Lau's stake in Tencent to about 0.5%.Tencent's strengths still clearly outweigh its weaknesses, and it still has plenty of irons in the fire. Its stock isn't cheap at these levels, so it isn't surprising if Ma and other top executives sell some shares to raise cash. However, I believe Ma's minor sale shouldn't raise any red flags for long-term investors.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The stock has tripled over the last five years on the back of strong growth across its business lines,\u00a0including online games, online education, e-commerce, and advertising.\u00a0The company's bread-and-butter is gaming, which produces most of its revenue and gross profit.\u00a0Over the last five years, total revenue and earnings are up 415% and 275%, respectively, but with China's gaming market expected to grow to more than three times its estimated $60 billion value in 2017 over the next decade,\u00a0NetEase's rise is far from over.\u00a0China has the most-engaged and  in the world.\u00a0NetEase develops in-house and licenses over 100 mobile games,\u00a0with notable hits including  and . Also, it's a go-to partner for foreign companies that want to connect with China's burgeoning mobile game market. Since 2008, NetEase has been the distributing partner of 's\u00a0top titles in the Middle Kingdom, including , , , and .\u00a0\u00a0It also has seen tremendous growth from its e-commerce businesses,\u00a0including the cross-border retail platform Kaola and the Yanxuan marketplace.\u00a0But these businesses have not generated much profit for the company.\u00a0In the third quarter, management sold Kaola to \u00a0for $2 billion to focus on better growth opportunities like online games,\u00a0online education, and its cloud music service Yunfeng, which just received a $700 million investment from Alibaba.\u00a0The sale of Kaola signals that management is focused on allocating capital to the best growth opportunities, and those with the clearest path to profitability. While gaming is the main moneymaker right now, other businesses, including NetEase Cloud Music and Yanxuan are showing potential; revenue from these businesses rose nearly 50% between 2016 and 2018.\u00a0With Alibaba's investment in Yunfeng, NetEase plans to pursue further digital monetization opportunities in music to drive growth.\u00a0NetEase is a very profitable business,\u00a0and it maintains a policy of returning roughly 25% of its quarterly net income to shareholders through dividends. After the sale of Kaola, shareholders received a special dividend of $3.45 per share on top of their regular quarterly dividend of $4.14,\u00a0representing a yield of about 2.5% based on the current share price of $305. That's a nice payout, but the average yield over the last five years has hovered around 1%.\u00a0All in all, the combination of a shareholder-friendly management team and strong growth prospects makes the stock a compelling buy at its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 18.2.\u00a0I own shares of all three U.S.-based gaming leaders -- Activision Blizzard, , and Take-Two Interactive. But I believe Take-Two could outperform its peers over the next 10 years. Past performance is not always the best indicator of future returns, but Take-Two's returns have trounced those of its rivals lately, and there are a few reasons why I think that trend could continue.\u00a0For starters, it's growing off a smaller base of revenue than Activision or EA.\u00a0This means when Take-Two releases a grand slam like , which has sold 26.5 million copies over the last year, it has more of an impact on the top line.\u00a0Revenue is up 76% on a trailing-12-month basis through the fiscal second quarter (which ended in September).\u00a0With  and  building massive player bases,\u00a0Take-Two should see strong digital sales over the next few years from virtual items sold in-game, which should benefit its bottom line. data by Also, Take-Two is starting to , gradually building a wider base of revenue like its larger peers. Its relatively new Private Division label released\u00a0 in October to rave reviews.\u00a0Next year, a sci-fi shooter called  could be a surprise winner, too. The potential for additional hit games from Private Division is an overlooked possible catalyst for Take-Two in the long term. Of course, we're also getting closer to the next  title -- and the current installment has sold more than 100 million units since 2013.Considering all that, as well as the fact that it sports a lower forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio than its peers, Take-Two stock looks like a compelling buy, in my view. Currently, Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts sell for more than 6 times sales, whereas Take-Two sells at a P/S ratio of 4.47.\u00a0All three companies generally trade at similar PE ratios,\u00a0but as it continues to diversify its business across console, PC, mobile games, and esports,\u00a0and as management continues to steer it toward consistent profitability like its larger rivals, I believe Take-Two is the better buy among them now.\u00a0When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Furthermore, the deal gives the consortium the option of buying an additional stake of up to 10% in UMG by Jan. 15, 2021.Image source: Getty Images.Tencent Music is already the top online streaming company in China, but these deals will improve its access to UMG's lineup of artists, which includes Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga, and The Beatles. It will also likely lower Tencent Music's licensing fees for UMG songs, and bolster its sub-licensing business, which licenses its tracks to other Chinese streaming music platforms. This deal clearly benefits Tencent Music, but it could also hurt\u00a0  Cloud Music,\u00a0's  AliMusic, and other rivals in several ways.Tencent Music owns the three most popular music streaming apps in China -- QQ Music, Kugou, and Kuwo. These three apps control about three-quarters of\u00a0, while the rest of the market is fragmented among smaller players.NetEase and Alibaba are two of the market's more resilient underdogs. To challenge Tencent Music, the\u00a0two companies\u00a0pooled parts of their streaming libraries in 2018. Alibaba also acquired a  in NetEase Cloud Music last year.However, Tencent Music's clout still helped it secure more exclusive deals with the three largest record labels in the world: Access Industries' Warner Music,  Music Entertainment, and Vivendi's Universal Music Group. Those deals caused NetEase, Alibaba, and other companies to file complaints with China's antitrust regulators, which\u00a0subsequently forced all Chinese streaming platforms to share their licensing rights with their rivals via sub-licensing deals.Tencent Music complied and licensed its songs to rival platforms, but a  report last year claimed that TME's sub-licenses could be \"twice as expensive\" as direct licenses from record labels. That practice sparked an  last year and forced it to cut its sub-licensing fees.Image source: Getty Images.Some investors believed that the\u00a0probe could derail Tencent's , which started last summer. However, the deal was still approved -- and will likely allow Tencent Music to license songs at lower royalties from UMG, then sub-license them back to rivals like NetEase and Alibaba at current rates for higher profits. To add insult to injury, Tencent Music will also reap profits from NetEase and Alibaba's direct licensing payments to UMG.Tencent's UMG deal won't threaten Alibaba or NetEase's core businesses, since neither company relies heavily on streaming music revenue. Alibaba generates most of its revenue from its  business, while NetEase makes most of its money from .However, the deal makes it harder for both companies to gain ground in China's streaming music market. Alibaba operates AliMusic as part of its digital media and entertainment unit, which has been an  ever since its . NetEase opened up Cloud Music to nearly a dozen external investors since\u00a02013, but it still maintains a majority stake in the unit. NetEase doesn't disclose if the unit is profitable, but recently warned that it mostly relies on non-exclusive deals, and that the \"competition in China for exclusive or non-exclusive licenses to distribute music content is fierce.\"Moreover, maintaining a streaming music platform contradicts NetEase's strategy of streamlining its business with the divestments of its online comics unit and its e-commerce platform Kaola, as well as the spin-off of its education unit over the past year. This suggests that NetEase will prioritize the growth of its core gaming business over its music streaming business in the future.Tencent Music's investors should expect the UMG deal to stabilize the company's gross margins, which were weighed down by lower sub-licensing fees in . It should also reinforce its position as China's streaming music leader.However, the deal will make it tougher for Alibaba, NetEase, and other smaller rival  to keep pace with Tencent Music. These smaller players probably can't count on China's antitrust regulators to throttle Tencent Music's growth, or prevent the company from making additional investments in other big record labels in the future.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Alibaba's online marketplaces charge listing fees and commissions for third-party sellers, use third-party logistics services to fulfill orders, and don't take on any inventories. JD is a direct retailer that takes on inventories and fulfills orders with its own logistics network.JD generates higher revenue than Alibaba but operates at much lower margins. Alibaba founder Jack Ma once claimed that JD's low-margin approach would \"end\u00a0in tragedy,\" while JD founder Richard Liu declared that Alibaba's dependence on third-party sellers exposed\u00a0its shoppers to\u00a0counterfeit goods.Image source: Getty Images.But over the past few years, Alibaba quietly expanded into the direct retail market via its direct import services and Freshippo, Tmall Supermarket, and Intime brick-and-mortar stores. Let's dig deeper into these businesses, and see why they indicate that Alibaba is quietly becoming more like JD.Alibaba refers to its brick-and-mortar stores as its \"new retail\" business. It lumps those stores together with its direct sales business in the \"others\" segment of its core commerce revenue.Alibaba's core commerce revenue grew 40% annually to 101.2 billion yuan ($14.2 billion)  and accounted for 85% of its top line. Within that total, its \"other\" revenue surged 125% to 18.2 billion yuan ($2.5 billion), partly due to its acquisition of 's  Kaola cross-border e-commerce marketplace.Excluding its \"other\" revenue from both quarters, Alibaba's core commerce revenue only grew 29% annually, which merely matches JD's growth last quarter. This indicates that it's increasingly dependent on the growth of its brick-and-mortar stores, as well as new marketplaces like\u00a0Tmall International and Kaola, which fulfills cross-border orders with its own warehouses and logistics network.All these businesses operate at lower margins than its core online marketplaces. Furthermore, Alibaba recently boosted its stake in the logistics platform Cainiao from 51% to 63%, which moves it one step closer to becoming a first-party logistics player like JD.Alibaba's revenue from Cainiao rose 48% annually to 4.8 billion yuan ($666 million) last quarter and accounted for 4% of its top line -- but that's also low-margin revenue. If we exclude Cainiao, the new retail, and the direct import businesses, Alibaba's core commerce revenue would have only risen 28% last quarter.In short, Alibaba's core commerce business is relying more on low-margin businesses to boost its top-line growth. That's why the unit's operating margin fell 180 basis points annually to 31.7% last quarter, as its\u00a0 margin also declined from 41.1% to 38.1%.That trend is troubling because Alibaba's core commerce unit is its only profitable business, and those profits subsidize the growth of its unprofitable cloud, digital media, and innovation initiatives businesses.Meanwhile, JD's operating margins have expanded in \u00a0as the evolution of its logistics service into a third-party service for other companies bolstered its margins. As a result, JD's operating margins have improved over the past five years, as Alibaba's declined: data by Alibaba realizes that its investments in brick-and-mortar stores, cross-border e-commerce marketplaces, and logistics platforms will throttle its earnings growth. But these moves also widen its competitive moat.Its expansion into brick-and-mortar stores counters JD's  joint venture with  , which provides deliveries from a network of about 20,000 offline stores across 54 cities. It also counters 's  WeChat Pay, the digital payments platform that competes against Alibaba-backed AliPay. Tencent and Alibaba are both  brick-and-mortar retailers to those payment services.Alibaba's  makes it the top cross-border e-commerce player , which gives it an edge against JD in the direct import of overseas products. Its growing interest in Cainiao helps it match JD's efficiency in deliveries.During last quarter's , Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang claimed that the company's new retail strategy would \"further enlarge\" its addressable market by tethering brands to its e-commerce ecosystem and \"empowering\" retailers with new technologies. CFO Maggie Wu also stated that Alibaba would \"continue to invest\" in Cainiao's logistics platform.Despite these challenges, Alibaba remains a solid . Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to rise 29% and 23%, respectively, next year -- which are impressive growth rates for a stock that trades at 24 times forward earnings.However, investors should be aware that the core commerce business is depending more heavily on lower-margin businesses to drive its top-line growth. These moves strengthen its ecosystem, but they also mirror JD's moves -- which suggests that its rival's moves weren't so \"tragic\" .When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Its total number of wireless customers grew 3% annually to 943.6 million in October, and 4G customers accounted for 79% of that total -- up from 76% a year ago. Its wireline customer base grew 24% to 187 million.The government, which owns a controlling stake in China Mobile, dictates many of its business decisions -- including the sale of\u00a0its towers to  in 2015 to cut costs, its ongoing rotation of its management with its two state-backed peers ( and ), and the reduction of its monthly fees and elimination of its data roaming charges.China Mobile is expected to post nearly flat revenue growth next year with just 2% earnings growth. It only pays semi-annual dividends instead of quarterly ones, and it's only raised its payout annually over the past three years (excluding a special dividend in 2017). However, China Mobile's yield -- which is set annually by a payout ratio of 40%-50% -- has hovered between 4%-5% over the past year.The stock also trades at just nine times earnings,  the trade war, unrest in Hong Kong, and concerns about its earnings growth -- but it remains a conservative long-term play on .NetEase is the second largest video game publisher in China after Tencent.

Other popular titles include and.Image source: Getty Images.NetEase went public nearly 20 years ago, and it's no longer a high-growth company. Instead, it generates steady growth with consistent profits. It still generates most of its revenue from video games, but it streamlined its business over the past year by divesting non-core assets like its online comics unit and , as well as spinning off its online education unit \u00a0in an IPO.Analysts expect NetEase's revenue and earnings to rise 3% and 6%, respectively, next year, and it trades at a reasonable 18 times forward earnings. It spent just 16% of its free cash flow (FCF) on its dividend over the past 12 months, and it currently pays a forward yield of 1.3%, which was temporarily boosted to 2.4% with a special dividend.Tencent is significantly larger than NetEase, but it pays a much lower forward yield of 0.3%. It spent just 10% of its FCF on that dividend over the past 12 months, though, which indicates that it has plenty of room for future hikes.Raising that dividend could be a good way for Tencent, which \u00a0and other Chinese tech stocks like   by a wide margin this year, to appease its investors. It would also arguably be a smarter move\u00a0than the buybacks\u00a0it started implementing last September.Tencent still has lots of irons in the fire -- it owns China's top messaging platform, gaming business, and mobile payments system, as well as one of its largest video streaming, cloud, and advertising platforms. It also owns a sprawling portfolio of investments, which now generates over\u00a0a quarter of its net profits.Tencent's  still face daunting challenges -- its advertising business faces nimbler rivals like ByteDance, its gaming business faces tougher regulations in China, and its cloud and fintech businesses face fierce competition from Alibaba.

However, investors should be aware of three looming threats that could make it much tougher for Tencent to top those expectations.Image source: Getty Images.ByteDance was founded just seven years ago, but it now\u00a0reaches 1.5 billion monthly active users (MAUs) and 700 million daily active users (DAUs) across all its platforms. Tencent, by comparison, had 1.15 billion MAUs on\u00a0WeChat and 731 million MAUs on QQ last quarter. WeChat is still growing sequentially and annually, but QQ -- its older platform, which originated on PCs -- is shrinking.ByteDance's top apps are TikTok and Toutitao. TikTok, known as Douyin in China,\u00a0lets users create short musical videos and reaches over 500 million MAUs worldwide. Toutiao is a news app which aggregates \"lighter\" stories for younger and lower-income users.ByteDance generated $7.2 billion in\u00a0revenue in 2018, and it expects to more than double that figure to 120 billion yuan ($17 billion) this year. It also claimed 23% of China's digital ad revenue in the first half of 2019, according to\u00a0research firm R3, putting it in  behind 's  33% share. Tencent ranked fourth with a 14% share.Tencent's ad revenue, which accounts for nearly a fifth of its top line, rose just 13% annually last quarter, marking a significant slowdown from previous quarters. It attributed that decline to a 28% drop in its media advertising revenue (on Tencent Video and other media platforms), which coincides with the ongoing growth of ByteDance's media platforms. Tencent is fighting back against ByteDance with its short video app Weishi and its news app Tencent News, but neither app has gained much ground so far.Image source: Getty Images.Tencent launched its new fintech and business services unit -- which contained WeChat Pay, its wealth management services, and Tencent Cloud -- earlier this year. Revenue from that\u00a0 rose 36% annually and accounted for 28% of Tencent's top line last quarter.Tencent controlled 15% of China's  market at\u00a0the beginning of 2019, according to Canalys, putting it in a distant second behind Alibaba's 47% share. Tencent's cloud revenue rose 80% annually to 4.7 billion yuan ($670 million) in the third quarter, but Alibaba's cloud revenue still grew\u00a064% to 9.3 billion yuan ($1.3 billion) last quarter, which indicates that Tencent won't catch up anytime soon.Tencent's WeChat Pay remains the top payment platform in China, and 86% of China's mobile users used the app last year, according to Ipsos. However, 71% of users used Alibaba-backed AliPay, and 64% regularly used both apps.

China has agreed to buy at least $40 billion in American agricultural goods annually, tighten its intellectual property rules, and ban forced technology transfers from U.S. companies. In exchange for those concessions, the U.S. will roll back some tariffs and won't levy a new round of tariffs on consumer goods this month.That's good news for investors, but the trade war isn't over and unresolved issues are likely preventing investors from buying Chinese stocks. That's a prudent move, but we should realize that there are still plenty of high-quality Chinese stocks that have minimal exposure to tariffs or trade war impacts.\u00a0Let's take a closer look at three stocks that fit that description:  ,  , and  .Image source: Getty Images.Huya owns the largest video game and esports streaming platform in China. It was spun off by  in an IPO last May, and its stock rallied about 50% since its market debut as it dazzled investors with its robust growth in revenue and users.Huya generated 95% of its revenue by selling virtual gifts and items on its live-streaming platform last quarter. This business is well-insulated from the slowdown in the  and the trade war because it relies on dedicated domestic fans buying gifts for their favorite broadcasters. Only 5% of its revenue came from online ads, which are more exposed to macro headwinds.Huya's total monthly active users (MAUs) grew\u00a048% annually to 146.1 million last quarter. Its mobile MAUs rose 28% to 63.8 million, while its total paying users grew 29% to 5.3 million. Its main\u00a0rival,  ,  mobile and paid users. Huya is also consistently profitable, while DouYu's bottom line remains in the red.Analysts expect Huya's revenue and earnings to rise 37% and 80%, respectively, next year. Those are impressive growth rates for a stock that trades at just 23 times forward earnings.Bilibili is a diversified tech company that publishes mobile games, streams online videos and comics related to anime, comics, and games, and operates an e-commerce marketplace that sells related merchandise. It went public last March and currently trades more than 50% above its IPO price.Bilibili generated 50% of its revenue from\u00a0mobile games . The weight of this business is shrinking as it expands its other businesses. 24% of its revenue came from live video broadcasts and value-added services like virtual gifts. Those businesses are both well-insulated from macro headwinds.Online ads account for 13% of its revenue, but the unit's revenue growth actually accelerated over the past two quarters as larger advertising platforms struggled -- which indicates that companies are still pivoting their limited ad budgets toward Gen Z-oriented platforms like Bilibili. The remaining 12% came from its e-commerce marketplace.Bilibili's total MAUs grew 38% annually to 127.9 million during the quarter, as its revenue per MAU jumped 25%. Its average daily active users (DAUs) also grew by 40% to 37.6 million. Analysts expect its revenue to rise by nearly 50% next year. Bilibili isn't profitable yet, but it remains a promising play on China's growing Gen Z market.Image source: Getty Images.NetEase is the second-largest game publisher in China after .

That strategy boosted its margins and profits over the past few quarters.NetEase isn't a high-growth company like Huya or Bilibili, but it offers stable growth with a decent forward yield of 1.3% (which was recently boosted to 2.4% by a special dividend).

A report from Bloomberg mentioned that revenue will be split between Tencent (the developer) and Activision Blizzard (the owner of the  franchise).\u00a0Whatever the agreement calls for, Activision should be able to marginally pad its profits with this title. But with management prioritizing audience growth in the short term over profitability,\u00a0that will take time.\u00a0Analysts are currently calling for the company to grow earnings next year by 13% to reach $2.50 per share.\u00a0Another mobile title already in the works is\u00a0, which is being developed by another Chinese video game leader,  .\u00a0 was the fastest-selling PC title in history when it launched in 2012,\u00a0but it's uncertain how popular the mobile version will be, since the franchise mainly appeals to a PC audience.

If , a best-selling first-person shooter on console, can have this much success on a small mobile screen, anything is possible with other games, including , a popular esports title that has sold 50 million copies since its 2016 release.\u00a0To put 's download total in perspective, consider that Activision's total monthly active users across all franchises came in at 316 million in the third quarter.\u00a0Not all 148 million downloads will translate to an equal increase in monthly active users, since some people might have downloaded the app just out of curiosity. Nonetheless, there should be a significant increase in monthly active users when Activision Blizzard reports fourth-quarter earnings in a few months.CEO Bobby Kotick recently stated that he sees \"no reason why [monthly active users] shouldn't be one billion in the next five years.\"\u00a0There will certainly be challenges along the way.

Earlier reviewers criticized its unstable gameplay and confusing business model, which required gamers to buy the individual games they wanted to play on Stadia.\u00a0That was a far cry from the \" of games\" many industry watchers had expected. Instead, it was basically a cloud-based locker for purchased games that ran on Google's servers. This approach seemed clumsy compared to 's\u00a0Xbox Game Pass and  Arcade, which both granted gamers  from a large library of games for a flat monthly fee.Image source: Getty Images.In short, Stadia won't move the needle for Google or the nascent cloud gaming market anytime soon. However, investors should turn their gaze overseas to\u00a0the brewing cloud gaming battle in China between   and  , the country's two largest video game publishers.\u00a0Back in February, Tencent and   revealed\u00a0Instant Play, a new cloud gaming platform for PCs and mobile devices. The companies showcased the service in a few demos atMobile World Congress in Barcelona and the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. Tencent subsequently launched another cloud , Start, in a beta test across\u00a0southern China in March.It's unclear if Instant Play and Start are separate projects, but they indicate that Tencent wants to migrate its massive portfolio of games -- which include , , and  -- to the cloud. Tencent could also leverage its stakes in a growing list of publishers -- including  maker Epic Games, , and \u00a0-- to bring their top games to its cloud gaming service.Tencent's WeGame digital store on PCs also gives it a natural platform for launching cloud-based games. Tencent recently introduced a cloud service that lets developers host their games on Tencent Cloud and stream purchased titles on WeGame, which could serve as a stepping stone toward a full-blown subscription service.In addition, Tencent owns Tencent Video, one of the top video streaming platforms in China, and the messaging platforms QQ and WeChat, which\u00a0reach 731 million and 1.15 billion monthly active users (MAUs), respectively. Integrating its cloud gaming services into those massive ecosystems could create the seamless streaming, messaging, and gaming platform that Stadia aspires to be.NetEase started testing its\u00a0own cloud gaming service in late November. Unlike Tencent's services, which stream both PC and mobile games, NetEase only streams lightweight mobile games to Windows, iOS, and Android devices.NetEase's platform currently supports 38 mobile games, including 20 of its own titles and other hit games like Tencent's  and 's . These games are launched in a mobile browser instead of a dedicated app, and gamers can set the quality of the graphics to suit their internet connections.Image source: Bilibili.NetEase claims that the streamed games require less storage space and battery power. However, NetEase's service only offers a limited number of gameplay slots per game, and gamers need to queue up to play the game. That's likely because NetEase's  -- which is  than Tencent's -- can't handle that many simultaneous connections.\u00a0Therefore, NetEase might need to host its cloud gaming service on a larger platform, like   Cloud, to reach a larger audience and compete effectively against Tencent.Tencent clearly enjoys the first mover's advantage against NetEase in this market. Its cloud gaming services won't boost its gaming or cloud revenue anytime soon, but they could eventually merge with its other social and video streaming services to deliver a seamless on-demand gaming experience across multiple apps and devices.\u00a0That expanding ecosystem could widen  against NetEase in the gaming market, Alibaba in the cloud market, and ByteDance in the social media market. A cloud gaming service could also stabilize its video game unit, which generated 29% of its revenue last quarter but remains heavily dependent on hit mobile games like .Yet investors shouldn't dismiss NetEase's cloud gaming efforts. Its core gaming business, which generated 79% of its revenue last quarter, remains strong, with hit games like  and leading the charge. Its  with Alibaba (which acquired its e-commerce platform Kaola and a stake in NetEase Cloud Music) could also lead to a cloud gaming partnership as the market matures.Tencent and NetEase could both become major players in China's cloud gaming market, and the upcoming battle should be more interesting to watch than Stadia's clumsy stab at the cloud gaming market.\u00a0When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Its core video game business, which generated 79% of its revenue last quarter, is smaller than Tencent's, and its top mobile games still can't top Tencent's flagship title  in China.Despite those challenges, NetEase's stock rallied nearly 40% this year as Tencent's stock rose less than 10%. Let's examine four key reasons the underdog outperformed the market leader, and why that trend could continue in 2020.Image source: Getty Images.The  is growing at\u00a0its slowest rate in about three decades, and the U.S.-China trade war and tariffs are exacerbating the pain. That slowdown is causing many companies to cut their advertising budgets. The government's tighter oversight of gaming, fintech, and healthcare companies is also throttling ad sales to those markets.As a result, many top advertising platforms -- including,  , and Tencent -- struggled with slow ad growth in recent quarters. Baidu's ad\u00a0revenue, which accounted for 73% of its sales, dropped 9% annually . Weibo's ad revenue, which accounted for\u00a088% of its top line, grew just 1% .Tencent's ad revenue, which accounted for\u00a019% of its sales, rose 13% annually last quarter but marked a significant slowdown from its previous quarters. Tencent attributed that slowdown to sluggish ad sales on Tencent Video, but it's also likely struggling with competition from Gen Z-oriented rivals .NetEase doesn't generate significant revenue from online ads. The unit generated just 3% of\u00a0its revenue in the second quarter, and it stopped disclosing its ad sales separately in the third quarter. That low exposure to the fickle ad market likely makes it a more appealing investment than Tencent.NetEase remains the second-largest game publisher in China after Tencent, and video games generally hold up better than digital ads during economic downturns.\u00a0Tencent publishes three of the top 10 highest-grossing iOS games in China, according to App Annie, but\u00a0NetEase publishes four: , , and two titles from its\u00a0 franchise. Its battle royale game  is also one of the highest-grossing iOS games in Japan. The strength of these games indicates that NetEase isn't losing the gaming market to Tencent.Image source: NetEase.NetEase's gaming revenue rose 11% annually last quarter. That marked the unit's slowest growth in five quarters, but still matched Tencent's 11% growth in gaming revenue in the third quarter. NetEase still has a long pipeline of games to boost its growth, including ,, , and 's  and .NetEase generates most of its revenue from video games, but Tencent's gaming unit only generated 29% of its revenue last quarter. Therefore, investors who preferred a more direct investment in China's gaming market -- which finally passed some major\u00a0 last year -- likely preferred NetEase to Tencent.A common criticism of Tencent is that the company's diversification dilutes its focus. Tencent generates most of its revenue from video games and online ads, but it's also growing its cloud and fintech businesses, expanding into virtual assistants and connected devices, and investing in a growing list of domestic and overseas companies.NetEase, however, streamlined its business over the past year. It sold its  to, sold its  and a stake in its streaming music platform to , and spun off its education unit in an IPO. It also restructured its business from four segments to three: gaming, Youdao, and innovative businesses and others.Those moves all make it easier for investors to understand NetEase's business than Tencent's. Streamlining its business, cutting costs, and dumping weaker units also boosted NetEase's operating margin 350 basis points annually to 22.8% last quarter.By comparison, Tencent's operating margin plunged 800 basis points annually to 26.6% last quarter as it ramped up its investments. Therefore, investors who were burned by Tencent's ongoing ecosystem war against Baidu and Alibaba likely gravitated toward NetEase as a safer Chinese tech play.Analysts expect Tencent's earnings to\u00a0rise 15% this year and 22% next year, which are reasonable growth rates for a stock that trades at 26 times forward earnings. Tencent also pays a tiny forward dividend yield of 0.6%.NetEase is expected to post 130% earnings growth this year (thanks to its spin-offs and divestments), followed by 7% growth next year. It also trades at a reasonable 19 times forward earnings, but it pays a higher forward yield of 1.3%. NetEase also recently approved a special dividend, which\u00a0temporarily boosts that yield to 2.4%.Both Tencent and NetEase are still solid long-term plays on China. However, NetEase's lower valuation and higher yield -- which complement its aforementioned strengths -- suggest that it could continue to outperform Tencent next year.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Comps across all of its U.S. restaurants actually dipped 0.2% for the third quarter, as overall results were held back by a 2.2% decline at Bonefish Grill.\u00a0There are still a couple of reasons for optimism. For starters, Bloomin' Brands' bottom line is growing faster than its revenue gains. Adjusted earnings climbed 25%, overcoming the flattish top-line results. The restaurant operator is finally joining many of its peers in the delivery market, leaning on third-party providers. Bloomin' Brands launched on DoorDash this fall, kicking things off in late September with a novel 50,000 steak giveaway. Bloomin' Brands also recently announced that it's exploring strategic alternatives, a move that leaves outsiders speculating as matchmakers.

There are still some growth stocks that have been resilient, and that includes NetEase. It's wrapping up what should be its 12th consecutive year with double-digit revenue growth, a surprise only because Chinese regulators were cracking down on online gaming last year.\u00a0NetEase soared two weeks ago after posting better-than-expected results, as revenue and adjusted earnings from continuing operations rose 11% and 74%, respectively, in the third quarter. Wall Street can't seem to get a good read on NetEase, and that's just fine for the bulls.

Let's dig deeper to see if its strengths outweigh its weaknesses.Bilibili's main platform provides anime, comics, and gaming (ACG) content for China's Gen Z users. Its total monthly active users (MAUs) grew 38% annually to 127.9 million. Its year-over-year growth in MAUs and revenue both hit their highest levels in over a year:Year-over-year growth. Source: Bilibili quarterly reports.Its revenue per MAU also rose 25% to 14.5 yuan ($2.06), while its non-gaming revenue per MAU more than doubled to 7.2 yuan ($1.02). Its average daily active users (DAUs) also grew 40% to 37.6 million.Bilibili generated over 50% of its revenue from mobile games during the quarter, down from 69% a year earlier. That reduction highlights one of the company's long-term goals: to evolve from a mobile gaming company into a diversified digital media platform.Another 24% of its revenue came from live video broadcasts and valued-added services (VAS) like virtual gifts and subscriptions, 13% came from digital ads, and 12% came from its e-commerce marketplace. Here's how those four core businesses fared over the past year:YOY = Year-over-year. Source: Bilibili quarterly reports. *Due to spin-off of its offline events business.Bilibili's mobile gaming revenue rose on the popularity of its flagship game, Aniplex's, as well as newer titles. Its live broadcasting and VAS revenue rose as more broadcasters joined the platform and more viewers bought virtual gifts and subscribed to its premium services. It also expanded this platform over the past year with its investments in  and its acquisition of 's   unit.Image source: Aniplex.Its ad revenue growth accelerated as it ramped up its brand and performance-based ads, which was particularly impressive since its bigger ad rivals -- including  , , and   -- all posted withering advertising growth in their most recent quarters.Baidu's ad revenue fell\u00a09% annually last quarter, Tencent's decelerated to 13%, and Weibo's rose\u00a0just 1%. This indicates that advertisers are being more selective and gravitating toward Gen Z-friendly platforms like Bilibili and ByteDance's TikTok as the economic slowdown crimps their advertising budgets.Bilibili's e-commerce business, which sells licensed and tie-in products for its ACG content, grew significantly as it tightened the to 's\u00a0Taobao.Bilibili expects its total revenue to rise 67%-71% annually in the fourth quarter. However, investors should note that the company often sandbags its guidance: It  just 61%-64% sales growth in the third quarter.Bilibili still lacks a clear path toward profitability, but there are a few glimmers of hope. Its total operating expenses rose 71% annually to 774.4 million ($108.3 million), but that growth rate trailed its revenue growth by a percentage point.Its spending on sales and marketing, which surged 85% and accounted for nearly half its operating expenses, could also cool off as it passes several intense summer promotional blitzes for its digital platform and games. Bilibili's strong user growth and its rising ad revenue also suggest that it can gradually reduce its own ad spend as its brand grows.Bilibili's cash and equivalents grew from 5.2 billion yuan at the end of 2018 to 8.4 billion ($1.17 billion) at the end of the quarter, but that notably included a big $734 million boost from a convertible note sale and a secondary ADS offering in April. Bilibili's cash position would have dropped significantly without those offerings, but it can still afford to burn through $50 million per quarter for several more years.Bilibili remains a promising growth stock in China's , and it seems fairly cheap at less than four times next year's sales. I'd like to see narrower losses (at least sequentially) before I consider buying any shares, but I think it remains a promising long-term play on China's growing Gen Z market.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that all percentages are based on renminbi. Firstly, to assist better understanding and analysis of our quarterly results, I would like to remind everyone that based on the changes in this quarter, including the sale of Kaola and the NYSE listing of Youdao, we will now be reporting segment report as online games, Youdao and interactive businesses and others, which includes now Yanxuan, NetEase Cloud Music, Internet media, CC live streaming and others.Kaola's financial results has been deconsolidated and listed as discontinued operations. This applies to the current quarter, as well as the historical comparative periods. This quarter, our total net revenue represents both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter growth. You can also refer to Youdao's earnings release for more details about its quarterly results.I will now read the prepared remarks on behalf of William. We have had quite a eventful third quarter with a number of strategic moves made across our business lines. Those moves allow us to realign our resources and sharpen our strengths in areas where we see the most potential for our sustainable long-term growth. During this quarter, we continued to grow our online games business with steady performances from existing titles and further expanded our overseas presence. We are pleased to have achieved another quarter of strong financial performance with total net revenues increasing by 11% and non-GAAP net income from continuing operations increased by 74% year-over-year.For games, our online games revenue continues to exceed RMB10 billion for the sixth consecutive quarter, driven primarily by the steady performance of the long-running titles in our games portfolio. Our flagship, Fantasy Westward Journey series and Westward Journey series, continue to perform strongly, as two of the longest and largest running game IPs in China. Those games continue to attract a loyal crowd. Fantasy Westward Journey Online achieved another record high quarter of gross billings, since its debut in 2003, 16 years ago, while the mobile version also reached its highest quarter of gross billings in the last two years. While the Westward Journey series, we introduced a brand new dragon character in conjunction with an expansion pack in August, for both the PC and mobile games, which quickly gained popularity within fans. Westward Journey Online also peaked in gross billings this quarter, reaching the highest level we've seen since 2015.Other games launched in more recent years are also enjoying impressive popularity with highly active core user bases, Invincible had another quarter of record revenue with continued growth in active users. In October, with its fourth year anniversary, Invincible reached number two on China's iOS top grossing chart. Onmyoji also celebrated its third anniversary this quarter and topped China's iOS grossing chart for the third time this year since September. In addition, other games in our portfolio, including our new ghost series, Identity V, all about [Foreign Speech], which previously known as CRX [Phonetic] and Life-After are also enjoying a sizable and steady run rate with their respective large basis of royal fans. Two weeks ago, we launched an updated version of Life-After. The update came with an overhaul of the game, introducing a series of new themes and innovative gameplay, leading to a strong growth in the number of active users and gross billings. These games span different genres, target different user profiles and last a long time horizon. This is how we achieve sustainable revenue base for our existing portfolio of games and the continuously add more and more game titles to this expanding game portfolio. The fans that these games have accumulated over the years and reach of their influence have turned each of them into valuable IP, giving rise to the possibility of more renditions [Phonetic] of these popular characters and story lines.Most recently, in October, we launched Xuan Yuan Sword: Dragon Upon the Cloud, a Chinese style term-based MMORPG, which topped the iOS downloads chart soon after its launch. And for Bloom & Blade, a new MMORPG we just launched last Friday is also trending well. This game is designed to target female game players and was featured by the iOS app store.Our joint venture with Blizzard Entertainment has also had a good quarter. In line with our successful 10-year partnership operating Blizzard's World of Warcraft in Mainland China, the popular franchise continues to provide new thrilling game experiences to players across the world. August 27 marks the official launch in China of Blizzard's World of Warcraft Classic, inventive revitalization of WoW as the world's renowned MMORPG, calling on the nostalgia of a generation of old players and intriguing new players alike. This latest release increased both revenue contribution and total number of subscribers for the game.In terms of overseas revenues, we delivered a record quarter. We now have two blockbuster games in Japan, Knives Out and Identity V, both of which gained top positions on Japan's iOS grossing chart. Life-After, our newer release is also ramping up well in Japan. With the success of Knives Out, we gained a better and deeper understanding of users in Japan, in terms of their interest, social behavior and preferences in style, aesthetics and gameplay. We passed the successful experience and knowledge on to the design of other NetEase games, enhancing our ability to deliver popular titles to Japanese users. Identity V, topped Japan's iOS top grossing chart for the first time in September, while Knives Out remains a household name in Japan among the gamers. To further support our games growth in Japan and stimulate player enthusiasm, we hosted Knives Out Championship, our first ever e-sports championship tournament in Japan from May to August, with more than 500,000 players participating.In terms of our pipeline of games, we are pleased to have received license for FWJ 3D, which is currently undergoing the final round of beta testing and is scheduled for launch in December. In addition, we are excited to announce plans to release Harry Potter: Magic Awakened, a card game featuring a blend of strategic roleplay elements that invites players to experience the magical wizarding world.Other games included in our lineup include Onmyoji: The Card Game, Marvel Super War, Onmyoji: Yokai Koya, EVE Echoes, Ghost World Chronicle, Diablo Immortal and Pokemon Quest. While our existing games are expected to sustain our online games revenue at a high-level, the abundant pipeline titles represent opportunities to further fuel the revenue growth for our online games.Now, turning to our education business. We have completed Youdao's public listing on the New York Stock Exchange in October. This marks our first ever carve out IPO under the NetEase umbrella and the beginning of a new journey for Youdao, to lead our efforts in revolutionizing the way that people learn and receive education.Following the IPO, NetEase remains Youdao's majority shareholder and will continue to support Youdao's future growth that propels their mission to empower the people of China on their lifelong learning journey. Over the past 13 years, Youdao has become a strong contender in the online education space with clear advantages in Internet-native, tax-driven content offerings.The Internet has disrupted many industries in the world. But so far it has had a minimum impact on the education space in China. This offers tremendous opportunity for Youdao. Led by Dr. Zhou, Youdao's senior management team is comprised mostly of computer science graduates and doctorates from top universities who are best suited to lead the transformation in the online learning space, enabled by the application of technologies. Both Youdao and NetEase are fully committed to investing in technology and content creation in order to bring to our users more effective and technology-driven education experience.Moving on to innovative businesses and others. For NetEase Cloud Music, we continue to deliver a highly differentiated music product, with the mission to help tens of thousands of talented Chinese independent musicians, create indigenous content that resonates with Chinese listeners. We strive to provide our users with the most intimate, interactive and high-quality music experience, as we continue to amass more and more of what we call cloud villagers. We know we are on track.NetEase Cloud Music continues to ramp up its monetization efforts, reaching new record high revenues in the third quarter. Revenue growth has been strong across the board in subscription, advertising and live streaming, leading to continued improvement in our financials. We entered into a definitive agreement with Alibaba and Yunfeng for approximately $700 million in September. With our new strategic partners, we are able to explore more innovative forms of monetization for this highly engaging music platform.For Yanxuan, the focus continues to be about operating efficiency. During the third quarter, we continued to optimize our supply chain management to reduce our inventory and to deepen our relationships with choice manufacturing partners. We help our manufacturing partners better understand the consumer metrics and provide them with better visibility and ultimately better sales figures. Forging ahead, Yanxuan will continue to focus more on quality control and bring high-quality products to our consumers.In September, we completed the sale of our cross-border e-commerce business, Kaola, and we are pleased to have found a strategic fit for Kaola within Alibaba's extensive ecosystem.In summary, we had a busy quarter, being more focused and realizing value for each of our core business areas. We are very confident in the future prospect of the sectors we choose to be in, and we have developed and will continue to strengthen our distinct product offerings in each of these markets. We will persist in our pursuit of excellence across all of our business lines and the needs of our users always remain at the heart of our business strategy. As we advance each of our businesses and create value, we are always looking for ways to increase returns to our shareholders. This quarter, in addition to our regular dividend, representing a 30% payout ratio, we will also be distributing a special dividend of $3.45 per ADS this quarter in consideration of the sale of Kaola business. As always, we appreciate and value the long-term support from our shareholders, and we are always devoted to maximizing the interest of our shareholders.This concludes William's comments.I will now provide a brief review of our third quarter 2019 financial results. Given the limited time on today's call, I will be presenting some abbreviated financial highlights. We encourage you to read through our press release issued earlier today for further details. Our total net revenues for the third quarter were RMB14.6 billion or $2 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately 11%. And again, let me remind everyone that the revenue has taken into the consideration that we have deconsolidated Kaola results in the current quarter, as well as the historical comparative period.Net revenues from online game services were RMB11.5 billion, up 11% year-over-year. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by Life-After, which was launched at the end of last year, as well as continued strong performances from Invincible and Identity V. Mobile games accounted for approximately 71% of net revenues from our online games in the third quarter.Net revenues from Youdao nearly doubled year-over-year to RMB346 million, primarily due to increased net revenues from Youdao Premium Courses driven by higher paid student enrollments and average selling price.Net revenues from innovative businesses and others were RMB2.8 billion, up 4% year-over-year due to mainly the increased monetization from Cloud Music, partially offset by decreased revenue from online advertising businesses due to macro environment.Overall gross margin was 53.8% in the third quarter. Gross margin for our online games services for this quarter was 63.8%. Our gross margin for online games is generally stable, fluctuating quarter-to-quarter within a narrowband based on the revenue mix of mobile, PC, as well as self-developed and licensed games. Youdao's gross margin was 25.8%, an improvement from 23.3% in the prior-year period due to increased net revenues from Youdao Premium Courses and down from 32.9% in the previous quarter. Gross margin for innovative businesses and others, for the quarter, was 15.2% compared to 15.5% and 17% for the previous quarter and prior-year period, respectively. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to decreased net revenues from advertising services.For the third quarter, total operating expenses were RMB4.5 billion.Our selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of our net revenue were 11.1% compared with 8.9% in the second quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase was mainly due to increased marketing expenditures related to online game services, as well as the summer promotion of Youdao, which is typical in the online education space.R&D expenses remained steady at around RMB2.2 billion. We remain committed to investing in content creation and product development, which is what defines us as a technology company.Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to our shareholders for the third quarter of 2019 totaled RMB4.7 billion or $661 million, representing an increase of 21% quarter-over-quarter and 74% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS from continuing operations were RMB36.31 or $5.08 for the third quarter.Our cash position remains strong. As of September 30, our total cash and cash equivalents, current and non-current time deposits and short-term investment balance totaled RMB61.4 billion compared with RMB49.7 billion as of the year-end last year.As William mentioned in his remarks, we are pleased to report that our Board of Directors has approved a dividend of $7.59 per ADS. This includes a regular quarterly dividend of $4.14 per ADS, equivalent to approximately 30% of our net income attributable to the shareholders, plus a special dividend of $3.45 per ADS.Thank you for your attention. We would like now to open the call to your questions. Operator, please go ahead to the Q&A.Thank you. [Operator Instructions] For the benefit of all participants on today's call, if you wish to ask your question in Chinese, please immediately repeat your question in English. Please ask one question each time. If you have more questions, please join the queue again. We will take our first question from Natalie Wu from CICC. Your line is open. Please go ahead. -- Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question on the upcoming FWJ 3D. Just wondering if management can give us some color on your expectation for that game. And do we need to worry that game could have the possibility of cannibalizing your current FWJ mobile grossing, if that FWJ 3D could be the next hit game? Thank you. -- Okay. Thank you, Natalie. I'll translate that question for William.[Foreign Speech] -- [Foreign Speech] Okay. I'll provide a brief translation of William's response. FWJ 3D is currently scheduled to launch in the first half of December. And we are quite excited about this game because this game represents accumulation of over a decade long of RMB experience both from the PC version, as well as the mobile version of FWJ. And we can assure to the users and the investor community that you're going to see a lot of innovative -- innovation in this game. So this game is -- we are hoping that this game can attract many enthusiastic fans about the Westward Journey franchise and we -- given all these games are in-house developed by NetEase, we are not overly concerned about any internal cannibalization to our existing FWJ PC and FWJ mobile.Next up, we have Alex Poon from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead. -- [Foreign Speech] -- Okay. [Foreign Speech] Thank you, Alex. I'll provide a brief translation of William's comments for the audience. Firstly, on Music. So in short, yes, we are very actively exploring different opportunities in terms of monetization, that will be reflected in the upcoming quarters as we continue to explore, strengthening existing monetization channels, as well as to apply some innovative brainstorming new features, for instance, social aspects, et cetera, that we mentioned previously.In terms of our cost control, NetEase as a whole, not only as NetEase Music, we are very prudent and practical in terms of cost control. We think that in order to differentiate our Music business from the competition, we are going to further strengthen sales production, UGC, independent musicians as a differentiated content. As a result, we do not see any material increase in terms of music content acquisition cost. Overall, we are very confident about the prospect of monetization, which will lead the path to profitability. We do not have any definitive timetable for breaking even or IPO. But I think as long as we progress on track toward the mission and those are -- those growth will come just naturally.To your second question on the overseas games strategy, so as you had mentioned, we've been also quite active in exploring overseas opportunities. The various overseas investments that we made in those studios are mostly valuing their R&D expertise, which we think can supplement to our in-house R&D capability. Equally our NetEase R&D expertise is something that attracts those business partners to collaborate with us. Today, we have achieved a small milestone in Japanese market and we are hopeful that with more new game launches on the global stage, step by step we are also going to have a more promising future in terms of the US and European, Western market.Next up, we have Hillman Chan from Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead. -- Hello, William, Charles and Margaret.[Foreign Speech] Thank you very much for taking my question. My first question is to follow up on the FWJ 3D mobile. During the final beta testing for Android, do we have a sense of the percentage of participants coming from those currently playing mobile FWJ? And also, could you share more observation from the beta testing as well?And then my -- another question is on the Marvel Super War. Could you share more on the development status and launch timetable? And what other game genres for the Marvel IP under development and the status, please? Thank you very much. -- [Foreign Speech] Okay. Thank you, Hillman. For your first question on FWJ 3D, as you know, we've started beta testing as early as in the summer. So far, the testing results has been very promising, which leads to our confidence in launching this game in the first half of next month.For your second question on Marvel IP, as we have reviewed the overall partnership with Marvel on our May 20 game day, there will be multiple games that's going to be developed by NetEase for Marvel IP and Marvel Super War is one of them. I think Marvel Super War is well on track from a development perspective, so this game could be expected in the near-term. Obviously, for Chinese market, this is after all subject to the license approval. But several of these Marvel games are targeting both the Chinese market, as well as international markets. -- [Foreign Speech]Next up, we have Kenneth Fong from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead. -- [Foreign Speech] I have a couple of questions related to the overseas business. First, what is the overseas game revenue as a percentage of our total game revenue?Second about our game pipeline, which one of you see great potential for the overseas market next year?Third is, how do you see the competitive landscapes for the overseas game development, especially I noticed that there is a lot of Chinese game developers also very active in publishing overseas? Thank you. -- [Foreign Speech] So, Kenneth, to translate William's response and also to add a few more color. In terms of the overseas game revenue, [Technical Issues] above 10% of our overall game revenues and we see great potential in terms of further enhancing both the absolute dollar by overseas game revenue, as well as this percentage ratio.To your second question, in terms of game-specific product line-ups for the various international markets, apologies for your understanding that we would not be able to elaborate the details here, but there is a solid plan where we say that we are confident to increase the overseas game revenue, as well as the percentage. It is actually bottom-up, it is supported by a very extensive study of the overseas market, as well as our product line-ups.For your third part of the question, in terms of the competitive landscape of the overseas market, I think that's a good question because when we are launching our products to the overseas market, we realize that in more developed markets like Japan and US, users are actually a lot more sophisticated. The only way to impress, to retain, to attract these users is through product innovation and game quality, that is something that NetEase is proud of our competitiveness. And with that confidence, I think it represents actually a very, very optimistic upside of the overall NetEase games in the markets beyond China. -- [Foreign Speech] Thank you.Up next, we have Jialong Shi from Nomura. Your line is open. Please go ahead. -- Good morning, management. Thanks for taking my call and congratulations on a solid quarter. Let me first ask my questions in Chinese.[Foreign Speech] I have two questions. The first question is about the online gaming business. So I was just wondering when Company will officially launch the upcoming new mobile game, Harry Potter. And also, I was wondering, what Company did to -- in Q3 to have helped the two legacy titles, FWJ and WWJ2 to achieve record high growth in Q3, respectively.And my second question is about the online music business. We heard from some media that China's regulator is likely launching investigation into the license in practice between record labels and music streaming companies. So, I was wondering, if management can provide some colors on this ongoing investigation and -- or specifically what potential changes this investigation may bring to the music streaming industry. And related to that, what potential impacts these changes may have on NetEase Cloud Music business? Thank you. -- [Foreign Speech] Thank you, Jialong. I'll translate William's response for the audience. Firstly, given that we have abundant line-ups for the game pipeline, William is actually encouraging people try not to focus too much on individual titles, whether it is existing FWJ, WWJ or the upcoming FWJ 3D or Harry Potter, all of these are high-quality games that we self-develop and we are very confident about their performance, longevity and we have a lot more than just those couple of names that we quoted. For the past summer, yes, FWJ and WWJ, both have delivered a record quarter stimulated mostly by expansion packs in the summer. Harry Potter is also scheduled for launch. We don't have a concrete timetable yet, but it should be planned for next year.On your second question, Jialong, on the Music, we've also learned from the media about potential regulatory investigations and queries into that. Our general attitude is that, for any sort of industry growth, a conducive environment from the players and from the regulators are ultimately longer-term beneficial to serious and long-term players. Our mission ultimately is to ensure that the industry, as well as the passionate Chinese online music users benefit from a healthy and diversified growth of the industry. Overall, we think an appropriate and conducive environment is going to be long-term beneficial to all the players in this sector. -- [Foreign Speech]Next up, we have Daniel Chen from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. -- [Foreign Speech] I will translate myself. I'm asking on behalf of Alex Yao. So my question is, first one is related to PC games. We noticed some of our top PC games such as, World of Warcraft Classic and Fantasy Westward Journey, actually performance is very resilient. So could management talk about the PC game market outlook in next few years? And what are the key growth areas?Second question is related to some of the new innovative trends. Could management talk about NetEase strategy in this new innovative trends, such as 5G and cloud gaming? Thank you. -- [Foreign Speech] Okay. Thank you, Daniel. I will translate William's response and also add on to your first question. Your second question, William commented, that's a great question, that the industry has been noticing these new features. First of all, William thinks that the user recognition of game titles, so any sort of content is ultimately attracted to the content, less so on the different screens or media. So ultimately, it is the best quality content for the different sector of users that dictates who is the winner. Cloud gaming, as well as 5G, all these are great features to supplement to this content creation industry, whether they are going to be a mainstream feature or whether that's going to be disruptive to the overall user experiences, those are all good questions to ponderance [Phonetic] to be further observed. Overall, we think as long as it's content industry, whether it's education, whether it's music, whether it's games, ultimately content is the King, the one who has the capability of developing the highest quality content would always be the ultimate winner. -- For your first question on the PC games, we have recorded a great quarter in terms of PC games of our portfolio. We've seen both FWJ, WWJPC, as well as WoW Classic delivering quite strong quarterly results. Overall, we think -- obviously, we can't speak for the entire industry but as for us, we are fairly confident about the steady performance of our PC games into 2020. -- Thank you.Next up, we have Thomas Chong from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead. -- Thanks management for taking my questions. I have two questions. The first question is about our Cloud Music business, given that we are going to include more features, such as live streaming to the music side, how should we think about the impact of our short-form video to live streaming?And my second question is about the OpEx trend. Given the fact that we are innovating a lot of new business, as well as we are also expanding to overseas, how should we think about our R&D headcounts going forward? Are we going to expand our headcounts in overseas? Thank you.[Foreign Speech] -- [Foreign Speech] Okay. Thank you, Thomas. I'll translate William's remarks. Firstly, he thinks that the short video industry in general is actually a positive catalyst to China's online music industry because as you can see, all the presentation of short format video, as well as live streaming require some sort of a music element, which actually helps to promote music popularity.For NetEase Cloud Music specifically, we now have over 80,000 Chinese independent musicians that's been nurturing on our platform and this figure is growing. We think short-format video is a very conducive way to promote good music. Based on our data and user statistics, we are not seeing short-format video as a distraction or a competition for users screen time and others. We think ultimately user traffic is attracted by good music, Chinese and global alike. Currently, on Cloud Music, we now have almost all the good music of the last couple of decades, those are the core assets that attracts users. -- And quickly before we wrap up this call, for your second question, on the OpEx trend, our R&D headcount is steadily increasing. In fact, overall, by the end of the third quarter, especially after the summer recruiting season, our headcount has represented a slight increase comparing to last quarter, as well as to the last year-end. I think this is a strong factual evidence dismiss many ungrounded market rumors of so-called massive layoffs about NetEase. -- Thank you.Thank you. I would now like to turn back the conference to our management for any additional or closing remarks. -- Thank you once again for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact us directly or TPG investor relations. Have a great day.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- \n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That's why it wasn't surprising when  , the country's top e-commerce player, recently announced that its gross merchandise volume (GMV) rose\u00a026% annually to $38.4 billion during that 24-hour period.That growth rate was impressive, but it marked a slowdown from its 27% growth in 2018 and represented its slowest growth since the shopping event started in 2009. Does that slowdown suggest that Alibaba's core commerce business is losing its momentum?Image source: Alibaba.Alibaba's core commerce business -- which includes Taobao, Tmall, AliExpress, Alibaba.com, Kaola, Lazada, and its Freshippo brick-and-mortar stores -- generated 85% of its revenue last quarter.Its total revenue rose 40% annually to 101.22 billion yuan ($14.4 billion) last quarter as its operating profit grew 32% to 32.07 billion yuan ($4.56 billion). As Alibaba's only profitable business unit, the core commerce unit subsidizes the expansion of its unprofitable cloud, digital media, and innovation initiatives divisions.Alibaba is  the core commerce unit overseas and intends to reach  annual shoppers by 2024, but it still generates most of its revenue in China. Its growth in China remains healthy -- mobile monthly active users (MAUs) across its Chinese retail marketplaces grew 18% annually to 785 million last quarter, as its annual active consumers rose 15% to 693 million. Tmall's GMV also grew 26% on robust sales of fast-moving consumer goods and consumer electronics.But if we track the revenue growth and  margins of the core commerce unit over the past year, we'll notice that the business isn't immune to the economic slowdown .Source: Alibaba quarterly reports.That revenue growth would likely have been even lower without the inclusion of Lazada, which serves Southeast Asia, and AliExpress, which lets overseas customers purchase goods from Chinese sellers.Alibaba's slower Singles Day growth indicates that the core commerce unit's deceleration will continue, but the company still has a few tricks up its sleeve. First, Alibaba is launching more promotions for shoppers in China's second- and third-tier cities, who often prefer  on its discount rival  . Gaining more lower-income shoppers in rural areas could offset its slower growth in maturing top-tier cities like Beijing and Shanghai.Image source: Getty Images.Second, Alibaba is encouraging its merchants to engage sellers via live video streams. It launched this year's Singles Day event with a live-streamed performance from Taylor Swift, followed by live-streamed marketing from over 1,000 brands. This strategy taps into the Chinese consumer's growing affinity toward live streaming platforms (as seen with the meteoric rise of ByteDance's TikTok), and mimics similar \"\" platforms like .Lastly, Alibaba will continue expanding its e-commerce overseas and acquiring smaller platforms like 's  Kaola, which  its cross-border e-commerce platform. Those moves could significantly expand Alibaba's global shopper base and possibly offset slower purchases from individual customers.Investors shouldn't fret over the slight dip in Alibaba's Singles Day sales. It remains the 800-pound gorilla of China's e-commerce and cloud markets, and analysts expect its revenue and earnings to grow\u00a034% and 29%, respectively, this year. Those are still stellar growth rates for a stock that trades at about 20 times forward earnings.The Chinese economy is growing at its slowest rate in over two decades, but the growth of Alibaba's core commerce unit indicates that the average online shopper still has plenty of spending power. Alibaba can also throw other irons into the fire to keep its e-commerce engine chugging along for years to come.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Its revenue rose\u00a031% annually to 6.51 billion yuan ($910 million), which missed expectations by $3.5 million.However, its net income rose 6% to 1.03 billion yuan ($144 million), while its  net income grew 8% to 1.24 billion ($173 million), or $0.11 per ADS, which beat expectations by two cents. Those results were mixed, but a deeper dive reveals a few key numbers which brought back the bulls.Image source: Getty Images.TME generated 28% of its revenue from its online music business, which includes its music streaming apps (QQ Music, Kugou, and Kuwou) and digital downloads. The unit's annual growth in paid users, subscription revenue, ARPPU (average revenue per paid user), and total revenue\u00a0 from the .QOQ = Quarter-over-quarter. YOY = Year-over-year. Source: TME Q3 report.Its growth in mobile MAUs (monthly active users) might look anemic, but it marks a significant improvement from its flat quarter-over-quarter growth last quarter. This indicates that TME isn't losing users to rival platforms like 's  Cloud Music.The remaining 72% of TME's revenue came from its social entertainment unit. That business generates most of its revenue from the WeSing karaoke platform, which lets users buy virtual gifts for their favorite performers.Image source: Getty Images.This business is TME's core growth engine, since the average social entertainment user generated roughly 14 times as much revenue as the average online music user. The unit's annual growth in mobile MAUs and paid users accelerated during the quarter, but its growth in ARPPU and total revenue decelerated slightly.QOQ = Quarter-over-quarter. YOY = Year-over-year. Source: TME Q3 report.The platform's growth in paid users and its sequential dip in ARPPU strongly suggests that WeSing is attracting more viewers, but the average viewer is spending less money on virtual gifts. This might just be a short-term blip, but it could also indicate that the platform's growth is peaking.Unlike  , which remains unprofitable due to high content licensing costs, TME is consistently profitable thanks to the growth of its higher-margin social entertainment unit and  with top record labels.However, the online music's sublicensing business, which licenses its tracks to other streaming platforms, was  by Chinese antitrust regulators over allegations that it intentionally overcharged its domestic rivals.The reduction of that higher-margin licensing revenue, along with higher licensing payments to record labels, caused its gross margin to drop 540 basis points annually to 34%. However, that still marked a 110 basis point improvement from the previous quarter.Higher operating expenses -- led by higher marketing and R&D costs for new services -- caused TME's operating margin to fall 300 basis points annually and 20 basis points sequentially to 18.3%. Nonetheless, TME's robust revenue growth still boosted its total operating profit 12% for the quarter -- indicating that investors shouldn't fret too much over its margins.Tencent Music doesn't offer any forward guidance, but analysts expect its revenue and earnings to rise 32% and\u00a034%, respectively, next year -- which are stellar growth rates for a stock that trades at less than 30 times forward earnings.By comparison, Spotify is expected to post\u00a024% revenue growth next year as its bottom line remains in the red. Therefore, it's safe to say that TME is a better all-around play on the streaming market than Spotify (which notably owns\u00a0a major stake in TME).Tencent Music didn't deliver a perfect quarter, but its strengths clearly outweigh its weaknesses. It remains the 800-pound gorilla  streaming music market, and it generates robust revenue growth and stable profits as its industry peers struggle to stay in the black.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

If that\u2019s the case, there should be no shortage of stocks to buy on hopes the dispute is resolved.To be honest, I\u2019m somewhat skeptical that the trade war has had the impact some investors believe. It\u2019s true that after the dispute began last year, Chinese stocks fell sharply. But U.S. stocks declined as well during the fourth quarter. It was a \u201crisk-off\u201d market, and Chinese stocks have more than their fair share of risk. Meanwhile, the market generally does have a long-term focus, and few investors believe that the trade war, and its effects, will last forever.That said, there no doubt has been some impact on Chinese equities. Trade factors are pressuring the domestic economy, for instance. So it\u2019s certainly possible that a trade deal could lead directly to a rally in Chinese stocks, even if that rally might not be quite as significant as some bulls believe.The next step is finding the best stocks to buy when the trade war is eventually resolved. These three stocks look like the best choices at the moment.One is a high-risk bet worth taking, and thus precisely the kind of bet aggressive investors should take on hopes of a deal. The other two strike a nice balance between quality and upside: strong enough to manage through until a trade war resolution is reached, and with enough growth potential that a resolution might materially change the long-term outlook. All three look like strong picks for China bulls.There are three core reasons why streaming video play  (NASDAQ:) is a smart choice for investors betting on a trade war resolution. First, as I\u2019ve argued going back to last year, IQ stock looks like  for China bulls in general.Even though the oft-made comparison to  (NASDAQ:) is , the gap in valuation between the two stocks is immense. Investors who would prefer the long-term growth of Chinese stocks to the lower risk of U.S. issues should consider iQiyi stock regardless of near-term factors.Second, iQiyi has seen significant impact from the trade war already. Lower advertising revenue, driven by macro weakness, has hit recent . Overall top-line growth has decelerated noticeably as a result. True, other Chinese stocks like  (NASDAQ:) and  (NASDAQ:) have seen similar pressures. But both companies have broader secular concerns in terms of user traffic that have contributed to their own selloffs. IQiyi likely would see an immediate financial benefit from a trade agreement, which in turn would help iQiyi shares.And, finally, as I wrote this week, IQ stock has been hit by  among U.S. traders as well. Growth stocks have fallen across the board. It would seem likely that higher-risk group would get a bounce on a trade deal, which would only contribute to the upside potential for IQ in such a scenario. (NYSE:) is another high-risk, high-reward play. But the case at the moment is intriguing.Like IQ stock, TME has important differences relative to its Western counterparts, in this case  (NYSE:) and  (NASDAQ:) unit Pandora. Its social entertainment business \u2014 essentially live streaming \u2014 still drives the majority of profit and revenue. Growth there is decelerating, a potential risk to TME stock.But Tencent Music Entertainment has another notable distinction: it\u2019s profitable. In fact, TME stock currently looks reasonably cheap. Backing out nearly $3 billion in cash on the balance sheet, shares trade for roughly 24x 2020 consensus earnings-per-share estimates. That\u2019s a reasonable multiple for a company still early in its growth, and one with obvious opportunity to expand music consumption in the country.There are risks. A Chinese  could upend the business model. Competition will remain intense.But all Chinese stocks have risks. The backing of parent  (OTCMKTS:), growth potential and valuation combine for an attractive bull case regardless. Those positive attributes don\u2019t look priced in at $14. If a trade war deal can drive increased confidence toward the Chinese consumer, they will be priced in.Despite a $35 billion market capitalization, online gaming company  (NASDAQ:) seems overlooked among Chinese stocks. It shouldn\u2019t be, as there\u2019s a lot to like here.NetEase has a dominant market position in its vertical. Revenue growth has slowed, but lower spending has led to impressive profit growth. Non-GAAP net income rose 33% year-over-year in the second quarter, which followed  in Q1.And yet NTES stock is cheap, at just 17x forward earnings. It looks far too cheap. Gaming growth in China will continue. The IPO of education arm  (NYSE:) further strengthens the balance sheet. And margins should continue to improve.NTES stock has risen 50% from December lows, but it still sits below early 2018 highs. As sentiment improves toward Chinese stocks, NetEase should benefit.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold a position\u00a0in any of the aforementioned securities.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["The internet celebrated its 50th anniversary recently.

But like many of these big online firms, it does a little bit of everything. While gaming is a core driver, there are ancillary businesses that orbit around gaming, like advertising, e-commerce and email accounts. Finding rock-solid business models like this is a core component of my  strategy.NetEase sports a market cap of $36.3 billion, so this isn\u2019t a mom-and-pop operation. It is huge, and hugely popular. Recently it refocused on its gaming offerings and developing new games.Remember, online gaming is becoming a major sport, with global revenue now eclipsing the NFL and NBA.

It sells curriculum packages \u2014 both online and in print \u2014 to upscale private schools.As you may know, Brazil has a very wide gap between the haves and the have-nots. Many business executives are flown to work by helicopters to avoid any issues with traffic and also potential kidnappings.In this kind of world, public education isn\u2019t a top priority and the country can only provide so much money to support public schools. Those that can afford it, send their kids to private schools.And ARCE has stepped into that gap with curriculum for those private schools, so there is a standard of learning among them. It also likely allows those students to match up with peers in more developed countries if they look to pursue university educations abroad.With a market cap of $2.1 billion, there seems to be demand. And ARCE stock is up 81% in the past year, so there are signs are that it has found a growing niche.One caveat: ARCE stock just started trading last year, so the stock is still finding its footing and may be a bit volatile given its dependence on an emerging market economy.Source: Shutterstock\n\t(NASDAQ:) is a U.S. company that focuses on digital solutions for local and state governments.Basically, EGOV helps local and state governments upgrade their online platforms, integrate their departments, secure information and provide portals for internal and external users.This is a very big undertaking and will last a very long time, which means that EGOV, as one of the two largest firms in this business, is in very good shape moving forward.This business certainly isn\u2019t as sexy as online gaming or gambling, but it is steady, reliable work with no end in sight.

The event was a notable success -- particularly when compared to BlizzCon 2018.\u00a0Last year's event was the most controversial in BlizzCon history, with fans voicing dissatisfaction about the publisher's focus on mobile and the lack of big new content for PC and console platforms. After the fan reaction to last year's show prompted stock sell-offs and questions about whether the company was losing touch with its audience, investors can be relieved that BlizzCon 2019 enjoyed a much better reception.\u00a0Image source: Activision Blizzard.Last year, Blizzard unveiled  -- a take on the popular franchise for  devices. This proved to be a highly controversial reveal among  enthusiasts, many of whom were looking forward to a new mainline entry for the series for PC or console platforms and were disappointed that Blizzard instead seemed to be focusing on mobile. The company set those concerns to rest at BlizzCon 2019.\u00a0fans who were disappointed with the focus on the series' upcoming mobile installment at last year's conference had a lot to be happy about at this year's show.

This will likely prove to be a popular move among the franchise's hardcore fans, who generally regard  as the pinnacle of the series and tended not to be thrilled with the last game's look.The upcoming  sequel will not include an offline mode. This development may not sit well with some fans, but it's not surprising, given the focus on connectivity and games-as-a-service in the modern industry -- and from Blizzard in particular.  has gotten a great reception so far and seems to be in line with what series enthusiasts were looking for.While  stole the show, Blizzard also rolled out a new trailer for  and provided additional information about what players can expect from the mobile title. Blizzard plans to share more information about  next year, and it's likely that the game is on track for a 2020 release. This is somewhat surprising following comments from codeveloper  in February that suggested development on the title was pretty much completed.

For gamers who already own the original , the big hook for buying the sequel will be the story-driven PVE content. Otherwise, they can sit tight with the original game and still enjoy its upcoming competitive-multiplayer content. This is a novel approach to expanding the series, and investors will want to keep an eye on how it pans out.It's almost unheard of for a game designated as a full-on sequel to have much of its content made available for owners of a previous title in the series.\u00a0Making this content accessible to owners of the original  may limit the unit sales of , as players who are only interested in the PVP modes will have little reason to pick up the new title. However, it is evidence of the company's commitment to the  component of the series and its desire to keep the player base unified.If Blizzard had completely separated the PVP multiplayer modes of  and  rather than intertwining them, there would be a real danger of splintering the player base and winding up with two separate competitive communities and esports leagues.

After the blowback, though, it cut the suspension to six months; restored his winnings, saying they were won fairly during the match; and the \"shoutcasters\" were also suspended for six months.While the video game company says its response is only about gaming and not any larger geopolitical issue, to many it appears Blizzard is trying to forestall any fallout hitting it as occurred when the NBA Houston Rockets general manager tweeted out  and virtually all of the league's Chinese partners suspended their partnerships with it.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images. also faced backlash in Hong Kong with a number of its  because of comments the daughter of one of its licensees made in support of Beijing.The  for Activision, and out of fear of retribution and the potential loss of revenue, it doesn't want to anger the Chinese government,  , the tech giant that owns a 5% stake in the gamer, or  , with which it has a distribution partnership. After the NBA controversy rocketed to the fore, Tencent suspended all of the basketball league's video streams in the country.The Asia Pacific market is currently Activision's smallest region, accounting for $1 billion in revenue in 2018, or 13% of the $7.5 billion total.That's a not insignificant sum, and though Activision has been hampered by China suspending the game approval process from March 2018 to January 2019, so that massive titles like  weren't released in the country, it is anticipating gaming league owners to begin showing the contests in their home markets, including China.During Activision's second-quarter , CEO Bobby Kotick said regular-season games would begin being hosted in cities in China and elsewhere, noting the Overwatch League continued to break viewership records on ABC and ESPN. That's big for Activision because, as Kotick told analysts:Our in-game advertising initiatives are continuing to grow at incredible rates, advertising net bookings doubled year over year in the second quarter, and with the foundation for advertising initiatives now in place, we're actively exploring opportunities to leverage these capabilities across other parts of the business.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images.The Americas represent almost 52% of Activision's 2018 revenue, and according to data from Newzoom, there were about 179 million players who spent over $30 billion last year. In comparison, there are some  in China, but they only spent $38 billion, 60% of which was on mobile games.\u00a0Because U.S. gamers spent almost three times as much per capita as Chinese gamers, there is a massive opportunity to grow the business there. But only if they're in the market, which is why Activision finds its partnership with Netease key. The two have been in business together for 11 years, and they recently extended the agreement until 2023.\u00a0Last year, Netease represented 12% of Activision's revenue.Activision is attempting to chart a path between the protests and its business in China, though it faces a backlash here at home for seeming to sidle up to an authoritarian regime by squashing a player's pro-democracy support. Although there may be some immediate, short-term implications for its actions, it seems difficult to believe gamers will stop playing , or delete\u00a0\u00a0from their smartphones.\u00a0With Activision Blizzard undoubtedly hunkering down and waiting for the outrage over its actions to burn itself out or move on to a new target, assuming the Chinese government is mollified by its swiftly crushing dissent, there should be little long-term impact on the video game giant's business.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Its e-commerce business accounted for 29% of sales last year. This includes the Kaola platform and the company's private-label brand Yanxuan, though Kaola was recently acquired by for $2 billion.

However, Alibaba does have an edge and the acquisition of Kaola can be a growth catalyst in the luxury segment.If we look at the revenue breakdown for Alibaba, second-quarter 2019 numbers indicate 15% revenue from sales commissions. I am of the opinion that as Alibaba expands significantly into luxury brands, the sales commission revenue will accelerate.In general, luxury brands tend to have healthy margins and as sales growth through the Alibaba platform, commissions\u2019 growth will also be robust.While I don\u2019t expect a meaningful impact in the near-term, healthy commissions can translate into EBITDA margin expansion in the next 3-5 years. This will have a positive impact on free cash flows and valuations.Therefore, the impact of luxury brands is beyond gross merchandise volume growth or top-line growth.I am surprised by the fact that Alibaba stock has remained largely sideways in the last few quarters. The company has reported strong fundamental developments and the business outlook also remains optimistic.One reason that can explain the sideways movement is the trade war between China and the United States. However, I expect both countries to work towards a gradual truce and BABA stock can surge higher on further positive developments.The positive is that investors have a golden opportunity to accumulate a stock that has multiple growth triggers. Over the next 3-5 years, cloud computing, AI chips,  business,  and luxury brand sales will dictate the stock price trend.Overall, the outlook for all these sub-segments of business is promising and Alibaba stock is worth accumulating and holding.As of this writing, Faisal Humayun did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["It would seem like the news has been pretty good of late for  (NYSE:) stock \u2026 with one obvious exception. The last two earnings reports have looked impressive. The overhang of a major stockholder is ending. And yet Alibaba stock has stayed stuck, trading sideways since February.\nSource: Nopparat Khokthong / Shutterstock.com\n\tTo be sure, the U.S.-China  presents an apparent stumbling block in front of BABA stock. But rival  (NASDAQ:) has outperformed Alibaba shares of late, while facing the same trade-driven macro headwinds at home.JD isn\u2019t the only Chinese stock with better returns. Yes, Alibaba Group shares have returned 27% so far this year. That\u2019s better than the 16% average of China\u2019s 21 U.S.-listed large-cap (>$10 billion) stocks. But that return puts BABA stock just seventh in the group, well behind leaders  (NYSE:) and  (NASDAQ:), the latter of which has almost doubled in the last two-plus months.So, relative underperformance, a cheap valuation, and Alibaba\u2019s market-leading status would seem to clear a path for BABA stock to finally break through $200 and beyond. After all, it\u2019s hard (though not impossible) to see external conditions being much worse, yet Alibaba has grown earnings and Alibaba stock has managed to rise.That path is open. But the concern has to be that if BABA shares stay stuck, it could signal they\u2019re going to be stuck for a very long time.Alibaba Group has had some headwinds in 2019. The trade war has pressured consumer and business confidence in China, as several companies have noted in recent months. Protests in Hong Kong have only added to the geopolitical risk, and likely led to Alibaba\u2019s decision to .Major shareholder  (NASDAQ:) is liquidating its Alibaba stock. According to Alibaba\u2019s second quarter release, that company (formerly ) sold almost 10% of Alibaba shares outstanding between May 20 and August 9.There are pressures on the business and pressures on the stock. And yet Alibaba has posted strong back-to-back earnings reports. Revenue increased 51% year-over-year in the fiscal fourth quarter (ending March) and another 42% in Q1. Adjusted EPS handily beat Street estimates in both quarters.Meanwhile, BABA stock hasn\u2019t exactly soared \u2014 but it\u2019s held up. The stock bounced from levels around $150 in late May, amid the Altaba selling, and has neared $180 three times in the past few weeks.Given those external pressures, the case for BABA stock here is that in a tough environment, investors still were happy to buy and/or own shares. So what happens when that environment gets better? After all, Altaba\u2019s liquidation is likely over at this point. The trade dispute should be resolved at some point, even if that point isn\u2019t necessarily anytime soon. Put another way, it seemingly only can get better for Alibaba Group, and for Alibaba stock, from here.The catch is that for some investors, it\u2019s not going to get better for BABA stock. To bears, Alibaba has significant structural problems. Its VIE structure \u2014 shareholders  a piece of a variable interest entity in the Cayman Islands, not Alibaba itself \u2014 makes BABA a no-go for some investors.Accounting issues have . They were raised again in the decision to go forward with the Hong Kong listing. As I noted at the time, it was strange for Alibaba to sell stock at seemingly cheap prices to raise capital when it had plenty of cash already. Indeed, the company is  to acquire  from NetEase (NASDAQ:), a deal it is financing from cash on hand.There have been worries about self-dealing, highlighted by  to former CEO Jack Ma. And many investors ignore Chinese stocks altogether, worried about a \u201chard landing\u201d or, worse, an implosion of the economy still run by a nominally Communist single party.Those skeptics admittedly could be wrong. \u201cHard landing\u201d predictions, for instance, have been made for . The VIE structure could change once Chinese regulations do. And, to at least some extent, a 20x forward P/E multiple incorporates those risks.But at least for now, those skeptics and that skepticism seem to matter. They\u2019re at least one reason why a proverbial lid has stayed on BABA stock. (Shares at this point haven\u2019t moved for two years now.) They\u2019re why, to some investors, Alibaba stock seems like a generational opportunity: an e-commerce leader in a country with over a billion citizens trading at a discount to many U.S.-based large caps with minimal growth. Other investors simply see the stock as a trap at almost any price.If the news around Alibaba stock gets better, particularly with the Altaba overhang gone, BABA stock has to rally. Otherwise, BABA starts to look like a stock that looks cheap \u2013 and will always look cheap, given the structural risks assigned by the market. As  on BABA, I can see that path to $200+. If Alibaba stock doesn\u2019t take that path, however, it might be time to worry.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["\u00a0(NYSE:), like many Chinese stocks, has been volatile in 2019, mostly due to trade war concerns. Still, BABA stock has added more than 30% so far this year.   Yuan, the Chinese currency has also , and reports of a potential cooling of the Chinese economy well into 2020 have added to the recent uncertainty surrounding Alibaba shares.Alibaba stock and other Chinese names may undergo further volatility and profit-taking in the coming weeks. However, investors with a two- to three-year horizon may consider investing in Alibaba shares, especially as the company gets closer to report earnings on . Here is a deeper look at the longer-term prospects of BABA stock.Alibaba\u2019s current share of the  is almost 60%, and about 87% of its total revenue comes from eCommerce.The group operates through three main eCommerce sites \u2014 Taobao, a Chinese online shopping website, Tmall, a Chinese-language website for business-to-consumer online retail, and Alibaba.com, the group\u2019s international trade site.The three sites have hundreds of millions of users globally and host millions of businesses. BABA\u2019s mobile monthly active users (MAUs) on its eCommerce platforms now tops n.Alibaba has recently announced the acquisition of , the eCommerce platform of China-based \u00a0(NASDAQ:) for $2 billion. Kaloa currently provides Chinese consumers with imported merchandise, , as well as personal and household items, such as skin care, cosmetics and baby products.Tmall Global and Kaola are China\u2019s  cross-border eCommerce platforms, respectively. Therefore two combined platforms are likely to surpass rivals in China.Many analysts believe that Alibaba\u2019s bottom line is not going to be too adversely affected by current trade wars as its business model is tied to China directly, \u00a0of bi-party trade wars.In fact, on , when Alibaba released quarterly earnings, the results exceeded analyst estimates in both revenue and earnings. BABA stock\u2019s revenue increased 42% annually to 114.9 billion RMB ($16.7 billion). It topped estimates by about $880 million.Strength in numbers was in part due to Alibaba\u2019s core commerce business where revenue rose 44% year-on-year in the June quarter.According to the quarterly report, annual active consumers on retail marketplaces reached 674 million, an increase of 20 million from the 12-month period ended March 31, 2019. Over 70% of those new consumers were from less-developed cities in China, a fact that was regarded as Alibaba\u2019s successful push into lower-tier Chinese cities.Alibaba is rapidly expanding into many other lucrative industries, including cloud computing infrastructure, digital payments, online entertainment, and food delivery.With a population of 1.4 billion people, China is the largest country in the world. A rising middle class leads to higher consumerism, and that bodes well for many industries in China. One of those industries set to benefit is cloud computing.Alibaba\u2019s concentrated push deeper into cloud computing is increasingly being compared to the success of \u00a0(NASDAQ:) cloud business. In cloud computing, BABA is now the\u00a0\u00a0in Asia.In the most recent earnings result, investors cheered that BABA\u2019s cloud computing revenue soared 66% YoY. It now brings in about 7% of total revenue.Alibaba has over\u00a0 of the public cloud market in China. The market share of s \u00a0(OTCMKTS:), its biggest competitor, is about 11%.As a result of increased diversification as well as the growth in the cloud space, Alibaba\u2019s total revenue is expected to grow by double-digit percentage rates. Such a growth rate would indeed be impressive for a company with a market cap of about $461 billion.Finally, forward-looking investors may want to pay attention to BABA\u2019s  numbers too. Currently, more than 90% of the ecommerce giant sales are made in China.But BABA also has investments in start-ups in South Asia and Southeast Asia. Higher incomes and rising internet penetration rates are likely to strengthen both regions\u2019 eCommerce markets and contribute to sustainable growth for BABA stock.Among the start-ups in those regions in which BABA has stakes are\u00a0, an Indian digital payments provider, and , a Singapore-based eCommerce company that is growing in overseas markets. For example, according to the most recent results, Lazada achieved over 100% YoY order growth.The group\u2019s international businesses is led by its overseas marketplace AliExpress\u00a0which also expanded with 29% YoY sales growth.BABA is also looking to partner with European companies. Many European companies are still discovering new ways to enter the Chinese market, and BABA may enable them to connect with Chinese customers faster.BABA\u2019s mobile payment network, Alipay, is also seeking to expand in Europe. International growth will not only help increase the company\u2019s bottom line, but it will also enable BABA to diversify away from China, lowering the macro risk of BABA stock.Alibaba stock has multiple catalysts to drive growth in the coming years. Its core marketplace operations provides the group with strong cash flow. In other words, eCommerce, cloud computing, and other investments throughout China and globally make it a disruptor and a sound long-term investment.In China consumer disposable incomes are going up, fueling growth in many sectors, including eCommerce. In fact, the e-commerce market in China is forecast to almost double within the next four years to reach . Therefore, even if the Chinese economic growth pauses for a few quarters to come, the country\u2019s growth potential is intact.Therefore long-term investors should view any decline in Alibaba stock as a good opportunity to buy into the shares.However, traders with a short-term horizon should remember that there might be further choppiness and even profit-taking in Alibaba stock. The daily volatility of Alibaba stock is high, giving it a wide trading range, so short-term traders should proceed with caution.As of this writing, Tezcan Gecgil did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["(NYSE:) began a new era this month. Founder Jack Ma , a role that now belongs to current CEO Daniel Zhang. Although leadership transitions always bring some degree of uncertainty, it so far does not look like a factor that will hurt Alibaba stock.\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\tHowever, several external issues have held down BABA stock. Unfortunately for traders, these factors will probably continue to hamper Alibaba Group for the foreseeable future. Still, as long as Mr. Zhang preserves one thing, investors can earn substantial returns in Alibaba stock.Jack Ma\u2019s has taken a gradual approach in stepping away from the company he founded. He vacated the CEO position in 2013 but remained chairman of the board until this month. Mr. Ma will retain a seat on the company\u2019s board. Still, the company now belongs to Daniel Zhang, a man who has held the CEO position since 2015.Many worry about the change in leadership. However, Alibaba made the transition a years-long process that has involved little in the way of surprise. Thus far, it looks like it will resemble that of Tim Cook taking over at (NASDAQ:) as opposed to the transition that preceded Jeff Immelt\u2019s disastrous tenure at (NYSE:). Since Zhang has become a known quantity, I do not see Alibaba making radical changes. Likewise, I do not see any significant revisions in the case for or against Alibaba stock.To be sure, one thing has remained the same about Alibaba Group regardless of leadership. The best thing about Alibaba stock is its connection to China. Likewise, the worst thing about BABA stock is its connection to China.Like it or hate it, Alibaba stock is a growth machine. Analysts forecast earnings increases of 23.3% this year and 26% the next. They also predict revenue will grow by 31.9% \u00a0and 29% in the same respective periods.Management can take much of the credit for these increases. Acquisitions such as the recent purchase of the (NASDAQ:) e-commerce platform Koala merely enhance these increases long term. Also, with the continuing growth of China\u2019s middle class, BABA stock to maintain or increase its growth. More importantly, these increases come amid the current challenges facing Alibaba. Thus, the stock should deliver significant returns to investors even if external conditions do not improve.However, investors also need to remember that Alibaba stock is a Chinese equity. Hence, it has seen its potential held back from the U.S.-China trade war. It also suffers from more internal political disputes. In all likelihood, the protests in Hong Kong led to Alibaba delaying its listing on the . Moreover, the company cannot directly sell stock in Alibaba to Americans. For this reason, BABA stock is an ownership stake in a Cayman Islands-based holding company entitled to the company\u2019s earnings.Do these factors hold Alibaba Group down? Absolutely. Many traders prefer to minimize politics. Also, while I do not expect Alibaba to renege on agreements that created the holding company supporting BABA stock, one cannot escape the fact that Alibaba stock is not an ownership stake in Alibaba.Hence, these factors have likely stopped Alibaba stock from achieving the triple-digit price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios seen with other growth tech stocks. Instead, the stock trades at a more modest forward P/E ratio of around 20.8. Given the doubts some investors hold about China, I do not expect this multiple to improve significantly. Fortunately for Alibaba stock bulls, it does not have to get better.The negatives will not stop the growth of Alibaba stock. While the trade war and conflict with China make for great headlines, traders have long since priced these doubts into BABA.Would an end to the trade war help? Since the beginning of the trade dispute hurt Alibaba stock, it stands to reason that BABA may recover some of that lost value. However, the status of Alibaba Group as a Chinese company, as well as the nature of Alibaba stock itself, will probably prevent it from achieving a significantly higher valuation.Still, none of those issues matter as much as some believe.

And it looks reasonably cheap from a fundamental standpoint, with a 26 times forward multiple despite analyst expectations for 250% growth in earnings per share between 2018 and 2020.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\tTo be sure, I do believe JD stock is somewhat undervalued. I wrote last month after the company\u2019s blowout earnings report that .

Most notably, the stock fell 19% in eight sessions starting in late July, during which time the U.S. . The distance from 2018 highs, too, might seem trade-related.But the story isn\u2019t quite that simple. That doesn\u2019t mean JD.com stock is a sell. Again, I see upside from current levels. But it does mean that a trade war resolution, if and when it comes, might not be the catalyst some bulls hope.There no doubt is some trade war impact priced into Chinese equities at the moment. For instance, the  (NASDAQ:) still is down 23% from January 2018 highs.But one notable contributor to that decline has been currency. The Chinese yuan has fallen over 10% against the dollar over that span. That means profits \u2014 and expected profits \u2014 are less valuable in American dollars. And given that Chinese companies, including JD.com, generate nearly all of their revenues domestically, currency alone likely has driven roughly half the decline in Chinese stocks over the past 20 months.Meanwhile, JD stock \u2014 perhaps surprisingly \u2014 actually has underperformed that ETF over the same period. JD shares have dropped almost 40%. And there have been some company-specific factors driving the decline. 2018 results were disappointing. JD missed Street estimates for revenue in both the second and third quarters. For the year, non-GAAP net income declined 31% in local currency.To be sure, JD was investing in its business, which created some pressure on margins. And the huge second quarter \u2014 in which margins rebounded \u2014 suggests those investments are paying off.Still, this year, revenue growth has slowed, to under 17% year-over-year in the first half. That\u2019s notably slower than larger rival  (NYSE:).  (NASDAQ:) grew its revenue , albeit off a much smaller base.Again, none of this is to suggest that JD stock is a short or a sell here. At 26x forward earnings, valuation is reasonable in the context of current growth. But there are risks here. A number of key employees . Margins are exceedingly thin. Any incremental pricing pressure can lead to a repeat of 2018\u2019s earnings decline.And some of these issues have been a factor in the underperformance of JD.com stock. This isn\u2019t just a trade war problem.Would a trade war resolution help JD stock? Absolutely. But there\u2019s certainly a risk that it could be what is known as a  event. It\u2019s not as if investors have simply dumped the sector: MCHI has gained almost 12% this year and JD.com stock has risen 43%. Some kind of resolution \u2014 at some point \u2014 already is priced in.There\u2019s another question as well: Is JD stock necessarily the biggest beneficiary of a trade war resolution? I still think there\u2019s an intriguing long-term case for  (NASDAQ:) .  (NASDAQ:) and  (OTCMKTS:) could be interesting as well.Forced to choose, I\u2019d still pick JD.

With 4G, the latency, or time to elicit a response of an action, is 50 milliseconds \u2013 making smooth gameplay extremely challenging due to lags.Given that 5G has a latency of 1-3 milliseconds, 5G cloud gaming could be almost indistinguishable from an actual console game. With 5G, the download speed is also that much faster, allowing for more graphics and video delivery. The new generation wireless technology is supposed to offer download speeds of up to 100 times faster than the current wireless technology; 4G.5G cloud gaming could also make different business models possible. Currently most console gaming publishers make the majority of their money from selling the video game upfront. With 5G, however, gaming publishers could offer gaming subscriptions on a monthly basis, similar to how Netflix offers streaming to subscribers.Due to the subscription model, gaming companies could potentially realize higher valuations due to better visibility in terms of their revenues as the change in subscribers generally don't change as much as the change in a video game.

Kaola, which was launched four years ago, lets Chinese consumers buy luxury goods from overseas markets.Alibaba will also acquire a minority stake in NetEase's music streaming platform, NetEase Cloud Music, for $700 million. Let's see how these two deals could widen Alibaba's moat and strengthen its core business.Image source: Getty Images.Alibaba is the top e-commerce player in China. It controls about 56% of\u00a0the market, according to eMarketer, with four core marketplaces: its consumer-to-consumer platform Taobao, its business-to-consumer platform Tmall, its business-to-business platform Alibaba.com, and its overseas marketplace AliExpress.Those businesses are firing on . Alibaba's core\u00a0commerce business posted 44% annual revenue growth last quarter, and it added 34 million mobile monthly active users (MAUs) across its marketplace to reach 755 million mobile MAUs.Alibaba's core commerce business is consistently profitable and supports the growth of its other unprofitable businesses, including its cloud, digital media, and innovative solutions units. These businesses widen Alibaba's moat against ecosystem rivals like   and .Alibaba's digital business has been a money pit for years due to the high costs of acquiring content for its Youku Tudou video platform and Alibaba Music streaming music platform. Both platforms are underdogs -- Baidu's  and Tencent Video dominate streaming videos, and   leads the music market.Alibaba's core commerce business faces two long-term headwinds: competition from Tencent-backed rivals like  and, and the gradual slowdown of the .It's addressing these challenges by  beyond China with its Southeast Asian marketplace Lazada, AliExpress for overseas buyers who want to purchase products from Chinese merchants, Alibaba.com for overseas businesses that want to buy products from Chinese suppliers, Tmall Global for connecting international brands to Chinese buyers, and Tmall International for direct cross-border sales.Research firm Analysys claims that Tmall International currently leads\u00a0the imports market with a 29% share, followed by NetEase's Kaola with a 22.6% share. Earlier this year Kaola was  to merge with   China, which controls 6% of that market. That deal is likely off now, but the combination of Tmall International and Kaola should still enable Alibaba to control over half of the cross-border imports market.Image source: Getty Images.That's a smart move for two reasons. First, it reinforces Alibaba's reputation as the top e-commerce partner for luxury brands like 's Gucci and , which already sell their products on Tmall Global and Kaola. Second, affluent customers still make big luxury purchases during economic slowdowns, which could offset softer sales of cheaper products.As for music streaming, Tencent Music controls over two-thirds , while NetEase Cloud Music ranks\u00a0a distant second with a market share in the mid-teens. Alibaba Music controls a much lower single-digit share of the market.Therefore, buying a minority stake in NetEase Cloud Music could allow Alibaba to pool some of its streaming music resources (like content licenses) with NetEase, which could reduce the long-term operating expenses at its money-losing digital media unit.NetEase generates most of its revenue from online games, but\u00a028% of its sales came from its two e-commerce platforms -- Kaola and Yanxuan -- . The e-commerce unit's revenue rose 20% annually during the quarter, with Yanxuan growing at a much faster rate than Kaola.Yanxuan's business model is more controversial than Kaola's since it sells \"unbranded\" versions of brand-name products, which come close to being . Yet NetEase seems comfortable taking that risk, and it clearly prefers to sell its slower-growth cross-border marketplace to focus on Yanxuan's growth.NetEase could apply the proceeds from Kaola's sale toward expanding Yanxuan or developing new games -- which would widen its moat against Tencent, the 800-pound gorilla of China's gaming market.Meanwhile, Alibaba's streaming music investment could boost the operating profit of NetEase's \"innovative businesses\" unit (which includes NetEase Cloud Music and other smaller businesses), which finally achieved an operating profit last quarter after years of losses.Alibaba's deal with NetEase benefits both companies. Alibaba expands its e-commerce and streaming platforms, while NetEase streamlines its business as its least profitable business gains a much-needed boost. Moreover, the deal widens both companies' moats against Tencent's  ecosystem of services.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Alibaba, in collaboration with that country's Yunfeng Capital, has also agreed to invest around $700 million in NetEase Cloud Music service. NetEase said it will continue to be the controlling shareholder in the service, although it did not provide details of what Alibaba's equity participation might be. It also did not specify by which means it would be paid.Alibaba hasn't yet made a public statement on either deal.

That was on the back of comparable store and direct-to-consumer sales that rose 15% combined. Net profit saw a higher increase, rising 31% to almost $125 million ($0.96 per share).Lululemon saw particularly good growth in men's clothing, a category it hasn't necessarily been associated with over the years. What also helped was the significantly higher number of stores in which customers could pick up goods they ordered online.Those headline fundamentals convincingly beat analyst estimates. On average, these were for slightly under $847 million in revenue and $0.89 in per-share net profit.On top of that, Lululemon raised guidance for the entirety of its fiscal 2019. The company now believes its revenue for the year will total $3.80 billion to $3.84 billion, with per-share earnings landing at $4.63 to $4.70. Its previous top-line estimate was $3.73 billion to $3.77 billion, and its EPS forecast was $4.51 to $4.58., is one of the most actively traded issues tonight.

(adjusted) net income, however, fell to just under $2.0 million, or $0.01 per share, from the Q2 2019 result of $5.2 million ($0.03).That revenue figure easily topped the $221 million expected by analysts, but those prognosticators were modeling a higher per-share adjusted net profit of $0.04.Making up for that, DocuSign proffered quite strong Q3 and full-year guidance. For the latter period, it's anticipating total revenue of $947 million to $951 million, billings of $1.06 to $1.08 billion, and adjusted gross margin of 78% to 80%. It did not provide a range for net profit, adjusted or otherwise. That revenue range indicates a year-over-year revenue increase of at least 35%.The market likes that kind of revenue growth, and it's hungry for stocks active in the online security space.

JD stock gained nearly 13% after its second-quarter earnings came in well ahead of analysts\u2019 average expectations.Source: Sundry Photography\u00a0/\u00a0Shutterstock.com\n\tAnd there\u2019s a simple reason why JD.com stock can keep climbing. Specifically, even after those gains, JD.com is up only 2% over the past month. That\u2019s because JD stock dropped 17% in five sessions a couple of weeks ago on fears of an escalating trade war, and Tuesday\u2019s gains only recaptured most of those losses.In other words, the good news from JD\u2019s earnings doesn\u2019t seem priced in. And that, in turn, suggests that JD could keep moving higher, as long as the company gets a little bit of outside help.Compared with analysts\u2019 average expectations, JD.com had a truly impressive quarter. Its earnings per share of 33 cents, excluding certain items, was 25 cents above the average estimate. That was the company\u2019s biggest earnings beat since its 2014 IPO. JD\u2019s year-over-year revenue growth of almost 23% was more than five percentage points better than the Street\u2019s average expectation.On an absolute basis, too, the results looked strong. The 22.9% increase in its sales was a notable acceleration from the 13% growth . And its net income, excluding certain items, increased more than 600% year-over-year.And it\u2019s how JD grew its sales and profits, not just by how much they increased, that helps the bull case on JD stock. When JD.com sold off last year, worries about a potential  and its impact on the Chinese economy were key drivers of the decline . But investors also fretted about , which  in Q2 of 2018.In Q2 of this year, however, JD managed to drive strong growth while posting a modest increase in gross margin and, more importantly, controlling its operating expenses. Its fulfillment expenses only rose at half the rate of its revenue. Furthermore, its marketing spending increased less than 7%, and its general and administrative spending increased only 5%. JD.com\u2019s spending on technology jumped 34% year-over-year, but that line item amounted to less than 2.5% of its revenue.That focus on cost control is much-needed, and not just for JD.com.  (NASDAQ:) stock rallied after its Q2 results showed that its cost leverage had driven solid profit growth. Investors have wanted Chinese stocks to start showing some margin improvement, and NTES and JD.com both delivered.JD.com\u2019s Q2 results showed that the company is moving in the right direction. And so it\u2019s a little surprising that JD stock has not responded more favorably to the results.It seems that JD.com stock can \u2014 and maybe should \u2014 move even higher. Again, the stock trades below where it did on July 30, before JD.com posted a blowout quarter\u00a0 and the U.S. decided to postpone additional tariffs. At this point, the outlook of JD stock seems to be stronger than it was two weeks ago, and yet JD stock is cheaper than it was then.And JD.com is getting close to cheap or at least, it\u2019s not quite that expensive. Heading into Q2, analysts\u2019 average 2019 EPS estimate for the full year was 68 cents. JD.com now has generated 66 cents in non-GAAP EPS in just the first two quarters of the year.JD can generate EPS of over $1 in 2019, which would put its price-earnings multiple below 30. In 2o20, that multiple could drop to the low- to mid-twenties.That multiple isn\u2019t necessarily that cheap in the context of Chinese stocks right now. Rival  (NYSE:) trades at less than 20 times the average fiscal 2021 EPS estimate. Internet plays  (NASDAQ:) and  (NASDAQ:) are even cheaper.But JD.com\u2019s thin margins, still only 2%+ in Q2, still have much more room to increase. And thus there\u2019s more room for the company\u2019s profit to grow, making a higher multiple justified.JD does pose some risks. JD.com hasn\u2019t always been the most consistent performer. Sentiment toward Chinese stocks on the whole still looks shaky \u2014 and , as I wrote last month. As a result, in the near-term, JD stock might be choppy.Still, for Chinese bulls, JD stock looks awfully attractive. And there appears to be room and reason for its post-earnings gains to continue.As of this writing, Vince Martin did not hold any of the aforementioned securities.\u00a0\u00a0The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ome of China's earliest publicly traded online companies are getting pretty cheap.  \u00a0-- the country's leading search engine provider -- is hitting  this summer.

Baidu's business has decelerated dramatically, as China's slowing economy has cooled budgets for paid search leads.

Analysts see NetEase revenue accelerating next year for the first time since 2015.\u00a0Each company is facing unique challenges, but both Baidu and NetEase are struggling with their signature businesses. Baidu's online advertising business has seen its revenue growth turn negative, and revenue from continuing operations \u00a0in its latest quarter. Overall profitability is going the wrong way. NetEase is holding up relatively better, as revenue and earnings rose 15% and 20%, respectively, in . However, the online gaming business that contributes 61% of the top-line mix at NetEase still saw its growth rate come in at less than half of what it was achieving in each of the three previous quarters.Buying into  is risky these days. Trade tensions and a slowing economy in the once red-hot nation are weighing on investor appetite for the country's former market darlings. For now, NetEase is the one that's better situated to deal with the new normal, and it also rewards investors with a modest, yet tangible, dividend that currently works out to being a 1.6% yield.If investors think that the rocky times will continue, NetEase has proven the more apt of the two in navigating through this rocky terrain. However, if you feel that the tariff standoff with the U.S. will be resolved sooner rather than later and that China's economy will eventually right itself -- and both of those things are just a matter of time, one would think -- then Baidu is positioned for the bigger bounce.Both companies have the well-entrenched businesses and pedigree papers to beat the market once conditions stabilize, but if and when investors get hungry for Chinese equities again it will likely be Baidu leading the way.\u00a0When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

On an adjusted basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and other one-time charges, its net loss still widened from 19.5 million RMB to 256.1 million RMB ($37.3 million).

The Chinese internet titan is buying part of video-games group NetEase's e-commerce business for $2 billion. Perhaps more significantly, the two are forging closer ties in music-streaming, where rival Tencent's dominance is under antitrust scrutiny. Jack Ma's $466 billion empire is taking over Kaola, a site known for high-end, foreign goods ranging from Japanese skincare to baby formula from New Zealand. It's a fast-growing segment in China's otherwise cooling e-commerce sector. Together, Alibaba and Kaola will have a 50%-plus share of that market, according to data tracker iiMedia.It's an unusual move for Alibaba. The company\u2019s size and heft means it rarely courts local niche competitors. Friday\u2019s deal, though, will see the e-commerce group, along with Ma's Yunfeng Capital, invest $700 million in NetEase's music-streaming arm. Known as Cloud Music, the Spotify-like service already boasts over 800 million users and counts search engine operator Baidu, as well as private equity heavyweights General Atlantic and Boyu Capital, as backers. It has still struggled to catch up with market-leader Tencent, which also competes head on with NetEase's core video-games business.The timing is helpful. The country's antitrust watchdog is investigating Tencent Music Entertainment over exclusive licensing deals it struck with major record labels, media reported just last month. It's a controversial practice that has given the company\u2019s dominant music apps a powerful advantage over rivals. A potential crackdown on these agreements, combined with Alibaba\u2019s backing, could help level the playing field for NetEase, whose own market capitalisation is less than a tenth that of its nemesis.That suggests further deals could follow. Alibaba operates its own music-streaming service, which could eventually be folded into Cloud Music. And NetEase's remaining e-commerce operations, a private-label brand, looks ripe for divestment too.

The combined entity is expected to post annual sales north of $12.7 billion at current exchange rates and it should come to dominate several key consumer healthcare consumer markets such as pain relief, vitamin supplements, respiratory care, and oral care.Unfortunately, investors can't invest directly in this new healthcare behemoth -- at least not yet. In short, Glaxo plans on eventually spinning off its consumer healthcare unit, but this next step in the process may not occur for up to three years.\u00a0The good news is that American investors can buy Glaxo's shares in anticipation of this potentially lucrative consumer healthcare spinoff.

In an  that took place last November, NetEase Chief Financial Officer Charles Yang had this to say: \"Out of the three largest online games markets in the world, we now have reached critical acclaim in two: China and Japan.

In July Alibaba unveiled an online business-to-business [B2B] marketplace for American businesses that features enhanced marketing tools, domestic payment options, and a U.S.-based support team.\u00a0It says the difference between its B2B service and one that Amazon operates is the businesses that position themselves on the site will still own their data and customer relationships, something that has always worried sellers on Amazon.Alibaba says it has over 630 million active customers in China, or double the entire population of the U.S. It doesn't actually need to market directly to U.S. consumers because the opportunity is so much smaller than it is in China, but the move to entice American businesses to its site is a smart one.

The headline numbers weren't too bad: Its revenue rose 31% annually to 5.9 billion RMB ($859 million), topping expectations by $18 million, as its adjusted net profit rose 6% to 1.1 billion RMB ($164 million), or $0.10 per ADS, beating estimates by two cents.However, Tencent Music's slowing growth, contracting margins, and murky expansion plans spooked the bulls. Let's dig deeper into its second-quarter report to see if those concerns are justified.Image source: Getty Images.Tencent Music generated 26% of its revenue from its online music streaming apps (QQ Music, Kugou, and Kuwou) and digital downloads during the quarter. However, revenue at the unit fell 3% sequentially as it lost monthly active users (MAUs), and that drop wasn't offset by an increase in its paid subscribers and monthly average revenue per paid user (ARPPU).QOQ = Quarter-over-quarter. YOY = Year-over-year. Source: TME Q2 report.Tencent Music's growth looks dismal compared to that of its closest rival, 's\u00a0 Cloud Music. NetEase stated that users of its mobile app rose 50% annually to 800 million  and that its subscriber base grew 135%, although it didn't disclose an exact number.Tencent Music is gradually converting its MAUs to paid subscribers, but its low monthly ARPPU of 8.6 RMB ($1.22) indicates that it doesn't have much pricing power in this market. , which also\u00a0owns a stake in Tencent Music, charges subscribers $5 to $10 per\u00a0month in most markets.On the bright side, the unit's 32% annual growth in subscriber revenue marked an acceleration from its 26% growth in the first quarter. Tencent Music stated that it will support that growth by launching more \"membership privileges and differentiated services\" for its paid members and expanding its services to other platforms like connected cars, smart speakers, and smartwatches.It also believes that a recent redesign for QQ Music will improve its music recommendations and boost listener engagement rates, as tighter ties to 's  other services -- including Tencent Video, Tencent Pictures, and Tencent Games -- could tether more listeners to its apps. It's also looking for ways to expand its digital music services beyond China, but it could face a lot of competitors in that crowded market.The remaining 74% of Tencent Music's revenue came from its social entertainment business, which generates most of its revenue from the live streaming karaoke app WeSing. Like other Chinese live video platforms, WeSing makes money when viewers buy virtual gifts for their favorite broadcasters.Image source: Getty Images.That business is still booming, with solid sequential and annual growth in MAUs, paying users, and monthly ARPPU -- which hit a whopping 130.2 RMB ($18.48) during the quarter.QOQ = Quarter-over-quarter. YOY = Year-over-year. Source: TME Q2 report.WeSing is integrated into Tencent's WeChat, the biggest mobile messaging platform in China with 1.1 billion MAUs worldwide. That integration, along with the rising popularity of its top streamers and in-app singing games, is boosting the app's engagement rates in China and new markets across Southeast Asia.However, the unit's 17% year-over-year growth in ARPPU still marked a deceleration from its 28% growth in the first quarter. If that deceleration continues, the social entertainment unit's growth probably can't offset the ongoing slowdown at its online music business.Unlike most other music streaming platforms, Tencent Music remains consistently profitable thanks to its higher-growth social entertainment unit and favorable\u00a0 with record labels.However, its gross margin still declined both sequentially and annually to 32.9% as it increased its ecosystem investments, licensed more content, and generated less revenue from its sublicensing business (which sublicenses songs from its record labels to other Chinese platforms).That pressure caused its adjusted net profit growth to drop to the single digits for the first time since its December IPO, and that could be the new normal unless its revenue growth accelerates again. That's why investors weren't impressed by Tencent Music's second-quarter report, and why it's only hovering about 10% above its IPO price.The company also didn't provide any guidance for the full year, which makes it tough to gauge its ability to counter growing challengers like NetEase Cloud Music. Therefore, I think investors who want exposure to Tencent Music should simply stick with Tencent, which retains a majority stake in the company within its well-diversified portfolio of businesses.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Source: NetEase quarterly reports.NetEase attributed its improved e-commerce margins to its supply chain improvements and higher sales volumes, while stronger sales growth and tighter cost controls boosted its innovative business margins -- which indicates that its highest-growth business is finally a profitable one.Its gaming margins were weighed down slightly by higher royalty fees and revenue-sharing costs for certain games, and its ad margins were weighed down by lower revenue and higher expenses.Meanwhile, a 5.5% year-over-year reduction in operating expenses boosted NetEase's operating margin 430 basis points to 18.6%. That improvement, along with share buybacks, helped it easily beat earnings expectations with 20% growth.Analysts expect NetEase's revenue and\u00a0earnings to grow 16% and 13%, respectively, next year (in USD terms).

However, its strengths outweigh those weaknesses. Its gaming business is faring well against Tencent, its innovative businesses are growing (particularly Cloud Music, which grew its subscribers by 135% annually during the quarter), and its tight cost controls and buybacks will support its future earnings growth.Therefore, NetEase looks like a promising investment in China's tech sector, even as tough headwinds rattle the market leaders.

And thank you everyone for participating in today's call. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that all percentages are based on renminbi. We are very pleased to report another quarter of financial and operational growth across our businesses with a 15% increasing revenue and 46% growth in our net income on a year-over-year basis. Online games remained a cornerstone of our business. Despite a seasonally slower period in the second quarter, the steady performance of our game portfolio marks the fifth consecutive quarter that we have exceeded RMB10 billion in online game revenues. Our flagship titles continue to provide solid support to our online games business. Throughout the year, these titles have remained relevant to each generation of users, as we diligently explore and create innovative new elements to our games, keeping our content fresh.Take Fantasy Westward Journey online, as an example, over the course of the last 15 years, since its initial launch, we have introduced close to 30 major expansion packs, averaging approximately two major expansion packs per year, with many smaller scale updates along the way. For FWJ's mobile version, we have made even more frequent updates with nearly 40 major updates, since its initial launch four years ago. Beyond substantial game overhauls and additions, we consistently look for various ways to keep our users engaged.During the quarter, we held a number of FWJ E-Sports tournaments, which helped boost our user stickiness and drive continued revenue contribution for future periods. The expertise we have gained from operating these flagship titles over the long-term has been deployed in developing our newer games, providing us with more steady revenue streams in what is now a very diverse game portfolio. Invincible, Onmyoji and Identity V launched in 2015, '16 and '18 respectively, serve as good examples of our superior game longevity with different game genres.Invincible continues to grow steadily in terms of revenue and number of active users, achieving new record in the second quarter. Onmyoji topped the iOS grossing chart in China, twice in the second quarter, as we launched our hit expansion pack in Q2 that featured a rich and captivating story line. Identity V is also growing steadily after more than a year of operation.During the quarter, we also launched an updated version of Solution [Phonetic] and renamed this MMO Sensation into all about Xuan Yuan. The update came with a full-fledged overhaul of the game, including improved graphics, new characters and new social systems. As a ground breaking game in the MMORPG genre, the original CLX [Phonetic] impressed the market at its initial launch over a year ago with its best-in-class graphics and high degree of freedom for users to customize and design their own characters and story lines. The game quickly accumulated a large and loyal community of users, particularly among the younger generation. Now with the relaunch, we are thrilled to delight players even without the games original IP. Our strong content and an amazing team of designers captured the spirit of the game while breathing new life into this market favorite. As a result, all about Xuan Yuan is attracting a growing user base and generating increased revenue contribution quarter-over-quarter.Our growing portfolio of games has generated a solid fan base. Our goal is to have an even larger and deeper impact on the vibrant community of game users. Onmyoji is the first of these younger IPs that we are cultivating. In order to expand the reach of Onmyoji's IP, we are currently working on four new Onmyoji games. These include the Japanese Collectible Card Game called, Onmyoji: The Card Game. A simulation game called Onmyoji: Yokai Koya and two other Spin-Off games.In July, we also launched the Onmyoji, cafe and shop in Guangzhou featuring popular Onmyoji characters. This location has become a must see destination for many young fans. We are confident that these initiatives will further strengthen our increasingly valuable game IP and further enhance our recognition among younger generation. In terms of newer titles, we most recently launched BuildTopia and Sky in China, and a few other games overseas. BuildTopia is a real-time creative shooting game topping the iOS download chart within a day of it's launch. And Sky is a adventure game bringing users a heart warming experience and receiving multiple recommendations from the Apple store. We also launched an updated version of Tom and Jerry which prove instantly popular among younger players taking the game to the top of the iOS download chart, shortly after its launch and continues to trend well with a growing user base.Globally, we continue to advance our games and make inroads that expand our reach. Knives Out remained popular in Japan and topped the country's highest grossing games chart multiple times in May and June. Additionally Identity V was ranked for the first time on Japan's iOS top three grossing chart in July, following our collaboration with famous Japanese comics. The success of these games has helped us to gain a much better understanding of Japanese users and their preferences allowing us to better tailor our games for the Japanese market. Some of the titles, we recently introduced in Japan also show promising signs of popularity. We now have three more titles in Japan, which are live after previously known as Night Falls: Survival. Cyber Hunter as well as Super Mecha Champions, a Mecha anime shooting game which we just released in July. All three of these games topped Japan's iOS download chart shortly after their launches.In the second quarter our overseas games revenue accounted for more than 10% of our total games net revenue. Having the right products is the key to global expansion and we will continue to invest in game content that will resonate with global players. In terms of R&D, we are looking for talent and teams that complement our R&D skills on a global scale. In July, we announced our minority investment in behavior interactive, an online games pioneer in Canada and the leader of the Asymmetrical Battle Arena genre. In addition, we also launched a new video game studio in Montreal, Quebec in Canada with an aim to hire local and international resources to broaden our R&D capabilities in North America.Our extensive pipeline also holds a number of exciting new titles for the upcoming quarters. These include Fantasy Westward Journey 3D, Xuan Yuan Sword: Dragon Upon the Cloud, Pokemon Quest and Bloom & Blade.Moving on to our e-commerce business. During the second quarter we made additional progress to improve our operating efficiency. We further optimized our internal structure, enhanced our warehouse and logistics operations and upgraded our supply chain management. For Kaola, our self-build bonded warehousing Ningbo began trial operation in June. This warehouse is capable of handling millions of orders every year, which we believe will help us to improve operating efficiencies even further.During the quarter, we also signed strategic partnerships agreement with additional international brands such as L'Oreal and Maybelline, enabling our customers to more conveniently access these world-renowned beauty brands.For Yanxuan, we continue to promote supply chain upgrade by helping manufacturers improve their design, reduce production cost and enhance efficiencies. We are further deepening our collaborations with top-performing partners, which will allow us to renegotiate better commercial terms, implement better controls over quality and optimize product creativity.On the product side, we are even more selective with new product offerings, enabling us to focus on and dedicate our resources to top products with the highest repurchase rate and customer satisfaction rating, by offering customers greater value for their money with better product quality and pricing, we hope to further improve customer satisfaction.Turning on to our online music business. We continue to innovate and create a highly differentiated product with an unparalleled social experience on our NetEase Cloud Music app. At the end of July, we added a new highly popular community module known as the Cloud Village. This is a music community that fosters discussion, creation and sharing and personalized expression around music. It is presented in the format of waterfall containing music video blog, music micro blog and many other exciting features that allow music lovers to follow and express themselves interactively. This brand new module changes the way that users experience music from just listening to also watching and interacting. At this moment we have over 800 million users on our music app, which is 50% up year-over-year. Subscriber numbers are also growing very strongly at 135% year-over-year increase.For online education, Youdao continues to deliver solid growth and we see significant opportunities in the online learning industry. Over the course of the last 13 years, Youdao has built a robust suite of technology driven learning products and services. With its leading AI technology, strong content and predictive development capabilities Youdao has steadily build a large engaged and diverse user base with over 100 million average total MAUs in the second quarter of 2019. We do not take the responsibility of education lightly and we encourage innovation within each content studio at the Youdao.Our courses are regularly evaluated and their success is measured by user satisfaction ratings, which we believe is pivotal to the long-term sustainable growth of any online learning company. Youdao most recently hosted its Annual Product Launch Conference in Beijing. At the event we announced five different products for children including Youdao Children's English mobile app, Youdao Mathematics Online Course and Youdao Chinese Reading Online Course. All designed to improve children's learning habits as well as Youdao sell tooling and kata [Phonetic] to online courses teaching coding to children between the age of 3 to 18.Additionally, we also announced our second-generation Youdao Dictionary Pen supported by more advanced optical character recognition and technology, allowing more accurate and effective scanning translation. In an evolving Internet market, content is king and NetEase is best known for our content creation capabilities. This rings true across our different business segments. We continue to emphasize product enhancement, craftsmanship and innovation, and better user experiences to thrill our ever-growing user community of different segments. Through our industry knowledge, deep IP, diversification strategy within our core competencies and our international growth initiatives, we believe we can continue to bring relevant exciting new products and services to NetEase players, fans and users around the world.As we continue to grow and evolve, we are always very appreciative of the long-term support from our shareholders. With that in mind, our Board of Directors have approved a dividend payout ratio of 30% this quarter. We are delighted to be returning value to our investors as our business continues to boast healthy and growing profits.This concludes William's comments. I will now provide a very brief overview of our second quarter 2019 financial results. Given the limited time on the call, I will be presenting some abbreviated financial highlights. We encourage you to read through our press release issued earlier today for further details.For the second quarter, our total net revenue were RMB18.8 billion or $2.7 billion representing approximately 15% increase year-over-year. Net revenues from online game services were RMB11.4 billion, down 4% quarter-over-quarter, but up 14% year-over-year. The sequential decrease was due to the second quarter, typically being a slower quarter seasonally. Year-over-year increase was primarily driven by increased revenue contribution from flagship titles, such as FWJ and new games such as Justice and Life-After. Mobile games accounted for approximately 72% of net revenue from our online games in the second quarter.Net revenue from e-commerce, were RMB5.2 billion and net revenues from advertising services were RMB582 million. Net revenues from our innovative businesses and others were RMB1.5 billion up 18% quarter-over-quarter and 23% year-over-year, both due to increased contribution from Cloud Music, CC live streaming and Youdao.Our overall gross margin was 43.3% in the second quarter, compared with 44.1% in the preceding quarter and 44.5% for the prior year's period. Gross margin for our online game services for the second quarter was 63.1%. By and large, our gross margin for games is generally stable fluctuating quarter-to-quarter within a narrow bandwidth based on the revenue mix of mobile, PC, self developed and licensed games.For e-commerce our gross margin was 10.9% in the second quarter. We achieved a positive gross margin for our innovative businesses and others business of 1.4% in the second quarter versus losses of 13.1% and 7.3% in the prior quarter and second quarter of last year respectively. The significant improvements came from increased revenue contribution from some of our business lines within this segment, as mentioned a moment ago, as well as better cost controls.For the second quarter, total operating expenses were RMB4.6 billion. Our selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue were 9.4% in the second quarter, largely stable from the previous quarter. We continue to see operating leverage, as we benefit from economies of scale and improve operational efficiency.E-commerce related shipping and handling expenses, included in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of e-commerce revenue was 7.4% in the second quarter, significantly improved from 8.4% in the previous quarter. R&D expenses were maintained at around $2 billion level reflecting our commitment to investing in content creation and product development, which is what defines us as a technology company. Operating income for the second quarter of 2019 increased by 2% quarter-over-quarter and 50% year-over-year to RMB3.5 billion. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 18%. The lower effective tax rate in the second quarter was mainly due to reduced losses from certain subsidiaries, as well as certain tax credits being recognized for certain subsidiaries of the company during the quarter.Non-GAAP net income attributable to our shareholders for the second quarter totaled RMB4 billion or $531 million representing an increase of 21% quarter-over-quarter and 34% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS were RMB28.06 or $4.09 for the second quarter of 2019. Our cash position remains strong. As of June 30, 2019, our total cash and cash equivalent, current and non-current time deposits and short-term investments balance totaled RMB55.6 billion compared with RMB50.1 billion as of year end last year.For the second quarter, we are pleased to report that our Board has approved a dividend of $1.04 per ADS representing a 30% dividend payout ratio. As we mentioned earlier in William's remarks, we are thankful for the long-term support from our shareholders and we are always looking for ways to return value to our shareholders. As a result, this quarter's higher dividend payout ratio reflect this commitment as we continue to both healthy and growing profit.Thank you for everyone's attention. We would like now to open the call to your questions. Operator, please go to Q&A.Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Hillman Chan from Citi. -- Hi, good morning management. Hi, good morning, Management. Thank you for taking my question. I have a question regarding the overseas expansion strategy for our games. So as we noticed, we recently launched new game studio in Montreal and acquired stake in behavior, interactive and our games are doing well in Japan and in some overseas market. So going forward in the future could management share more on the strategies in particular what are the key focus markets by geography, the target game genres and the steps you will take to achieve the overseas growth either from organic growth or M&A and also some of the update on the latest partnership synergy with overseas studio [Phonetic] would be helpful? Thank you. -- [Foreign Speech]Hi, thank you Hillman. I will provide a brief translation of William's comments for everyone's benefit. So, as you can see that we have been very active and open-minded for deeper collaboration with global premium game studios, this is because for ourselves, NetEase, we have been cultivating in game content development, R&D with almost two decades of expertise and experiences. So, we are very, very open-minded and we'll continue to explore deeper collaboration with peers, the best-in-class studios globally.In terms of the overseas expansion strategy, William has summarized from a few different aspects. First is about our games launch, NetEase games into global stage. Currently, we have achieved certain milestones in Japan and we are hopeful and we are working hard to make also our popular content, popular games into a popular hit into mainstream western market in North America and Europe.In terms of collaboration, with global peers, we've always been focusing on joint R&D development as a priority, because that is our know-how and that is where we see a lot of supplementary capabilities that we can provide to each other. The goal is to jointly develop by leveraging each other's competitive strengths to develop premium content for global gamers.As to the genres, there is no fixed rigid framework. We are very open-minded to be more explorative in nature, because as everyone can witness in the most recent years game genre has been evolving very fast and we are very glad that NetEase is always a pioneer in the forefront of keeping innovation in terms of game plays and genre. -- Thank you so much William and Charles. -- Thank you.We would take our next question from Alex Poon from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead. -- Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I have a question regarding the music business. It is very glad to see the new module Cloud Village launched recently. Can you also talk about in the second half, how your monetization strategy will change? And I also have seen some news regarding the timetable of profitability. Can you also share with us how are you going to control the costs and achieve the profitability? [Foreign Speech] -- [Foreign Speech]Okay. Alex also for for everyone's benefit, let me quickly translate William's remarks. So, we are glad to see that you've noticed in our most recent version update of Cloud Music. There is a prominent music community feature called Cloud Village. So everyone, a true music lover is now official Villager of our app. As we've mentioned previously, a key focus of Cloud Music is to dedicate our platform and our user outreach to promote independent musicians and independent music, here in China. And with this community features, I think this is more productive in us achieving this mission.In terms of your question on monetization by and large, I think it can be categorized into one being the user subscription, which we now seeing a very robust growth in both the overall users as well as subscriber growth more than 135% year-over-year. Second is act from advertising, which again come growth hand in hand as we are growing our user base and popularity among the users. The third is broadcasting, which is not only in the format of video live streaming, but also audio broadcasting. Fourth, now with the establishment of a community feature, we will also be more innovative and exploring deeper monetization opportunities around these community interactive features.In terms of your question on profitability, we have never officially commented on any timetable, but rest assured, we feel very, very confident about the growth upside of China's online music industry as a whole, and NetEase as you can now witness for the past few records. we are very disciplined in controlling costs at a reasonable level, as well as be focusing on the return on the various investment, whether it's selling, marketing or R&D into our different business segments. So profitability is ultimately our target. -- [Foreign Speech]We would take our next question from Natalie Wu from CICC. Your line is open, please go ahead. -- Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I actually have two here. First one is regarding the Cloud Music as well. You just mentioned about the -- you mentioned the Cloud Village module. Actually I tried that module and it's very innovative and interesting. Just wondering, can management share with us some further operating metrics regarding the user engagement recently for other Cloud Music? I just want to get a sense of how that's -- that new function has improved the user engagement, say the daily active user or the daily time spend, something related with that?And secondly about the Mobile IP. Just wondering how should we anticipate that use of Mobile IP? Will there be some new brand -- some brand new games or journalists launching under these IPs? Or just new updates with these new features embedded in our existing games? Thanks. [Foreign Speech] -- Thank you. Natalie. I will answer your first question on operating metrics, and then William will further comment on the Mobile IP. Well, as you know, we've only launched this new updated version almost, I think it's July 29, toward the very end of July. So it's about 10 days. So there's really not a lot of operating metrics that I can specifically share. But we've seen very, very encouraging signs of strong growth in both DAU and MAU, since we launched the most updated version. This data is exactly why we are confident that our innovation in bringing in this new interactive community feature will eventually be very well rewarded. Because it is not only a way of change in people's habit of experiencing music, but hand in hand as this new feature is now not only encouraging users to listen, but also to watch and interacting with other music lovers, it also creates possible opportunities for us to explore monetization potential. And I'll leave the second question to William. -- [Foreign Speech]For the Mobile IP, Natalie, it's a big area for a deep-rooted collaboration is that we will buy, we will leverage mobile's global popularity of the IPs to develop games. And it's not only one, it's actually several games across different genres, that we have different schedule and timetable to collaborate literally develop with mobile and the partnership also goes beyond games. For all those details, it will be gradually announced as we further progress along these long-term strategic partnership. -- Got it. Thank you. Looking forward to that.We will take our next question from Thomas Chong from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead. -- Hi, good morning. William, Charles and Margaret. Thanks for taking my questions. Congratulation on solid cost control for this quarter. And my question is mainly focusing on the cost side. Often for the GP margin the innovation and others achieved the first positive gross profit in the past 12 months. Can we basically assume that our cost control, is where we are solid, and we should expect innovation and others to maintain GP margin to be positive going forward, as well as for e-commerce do we need to stay stable GP margin for e-commerce in 2019?And my second part of the question is about the opex. Can management comments about the headcount that we have in Q2 versus Q1? And how should we think about 2019? In particular for R&D expenses, is there any reason why we see a sequential decline? Should we expect the trend to go -- to be continued in the following quarters? Thank you. [Foreign Speech] -- Thank you, Thomas. I will take your questions. On the cost side, let me first begin by saying that NetEase has been listed since 2000 for 19 years and we have gone through various cycles over the last 19 years of journey being a listed company. So we've always been very, very disciplined in terms of making adaptive measures to -- in corresponding to different macro environment. For 2019, as we commented in the previous quarters' earnings call, one key focus is a more disciplined balance between gross and margin, so we are very happy that at least for the last two quarters we have been delivering on what we have promised to the market being very disciplined.Well, having said that, it doesn't mean a scale back in terms of headcount by the end of the second quarter, the overall headcount is by and large stable versus a quarter ago or end of last year. So a lot of market rumors commenting on massive layoffs and all that, those are actually just not fact. So relating to your other questions R&D, yes, we are a technology company. So R&D is an engine for our continued sustainable growth for the longer term. I do not see any reason why we should scale back or cut down R&D cost significantly. Quarter-to-quarter, small fluctuations that can -- it's difficult to explain, sometimes it relates to some one-off event, sometimes it's the provisions and all that. But I think a general trend is that we are going to dedicate a considerable amount of our net revenue into R&D. But again like I commented earlier on what ever formats of investment, whether it's R&D and or selling, marketing, we focus internally on the return on these investments.In terms of margin, the reason why we have grouped some business segments into innovative businesses and others is exactly because they are in a relatively early stage. So, as they continue to grow, they are top line at user base. The economies of scale will help us to improve their margin trajectory. It is too early to predict whether all those relatively young business segments, we are then starting from this quarter, always have positive GP margin. But I do not see any indication of margin materially decline. So going forward, as long as my music business, my Youdao are growing healthily, I think earlier on Natalie also -- I think Alex also ask that question, profitability making positive profit and then returning value to our shareholders. It always remains as a priority to NetEase. -- Thank you Charles. And congratulation again.Thank you. We will take our next question from Bill Liu, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead. -- Thank you. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. I have a follow-up question on costs, mainly about the sales and marketing line. I noticed that for this quarter, it's almost flattish quarter-on-quarter, but a reduction from a year-on-year perspective. So, I wonder for the sales and marketing expense, so how should we think for this line for rest of the year, given that for on one side, we have a deceleration in e-commerce growth and on the other hand, the new -- the number of new approvals has been rather limited comparing to previous expectation. Thank you. -- Thanks, Bill. I'll again take that question, since it relates mostly to financials. For selling and marketing, majority of the selling, marketing is allocated to games. And as you mentioned, relatively speaking, a few new games that is being launched in the first half of this year, that explains why the selling and marketing on games is relatively lower amount comparing to periods where we have major titles that we need to promote.Now on e-commerce, as I mentioned for now at least two, three quarters, it's always a balanced approach between how fast we want to grow the top line as well as the profit profile of my e-commerce segment, and I think coming into 2019, we are more disciplined in keeping that balance in a sense that we will not -- it's just never our philosophy that we are to pursue a faster top line growth at the expense of a bigger loss. So that is not our intention, and it's never in our corporate DNA. So these two factors accounts mostly why in the first half for the past two quarters, selling and marketing expense has been maintained at a very cautious and disciplined level. Well, that does not mean that we face resource constrained. In the second half, if there are new games that's ready for marketing and promotion, we will do so. And if there are opportunities for us to see a reacceleration of my e-commerce or other business segments, top line growth, we will not hesitate to spend marketing dollars, but whatever marketing dollars we spend, it will be a very calculated investment, focusing on returns and focusing on the results of my marketing dollar expenditure. -- Okay. Thank you.Thank you. We will take our next question from Eddie Leung, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. -- Hey, good morning guys. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two quick questions. The first one is about E-Sports. It seems like there is a plan to invest in a stadium in Shanghai. So wondering how would that affect our capital expenditure going forward. And then secondly, just any update on game regulation. Any thing related to the young users, time restriction, anything along that line would be helpful. [Foreign Speech] -- [Foreign Speech]So Eddie, I'll translate the first question. I think you noticed the recent news we made at ChinaJoy. Yes, we are going to invest in Shanghai, it was related. And Shanghai is very supportive of E-Sports, and overall new economy as a whole, as you may notice that our team Dragon which most recently won Championship in the Overwatch League is a team that is based in Shanghai. And we've also had plan to invest. It's not solely just for e-sports stadium, but it's a e-sports and as well as R&D center that is more tilted toward developing e-sports relevant game content. So that's a longer-term strategic plan.And in terms of capex, because its going to be spend across next three, five years or even longer. So from the financial statement, from a cash flow perspective, these are well within our resource capability and control. It is not going to impact our financial results materially at all.[Foreign Speech]And on your second question, game regulation. We don't have any further update on how the regulation is progressing. -- [Foreign Speech]Thank you.Thank you. We will take our next question from Jialong Shi from Nomura. Your line is open. -- Hi, good morning -- Hi, good morning, management. Thanks for taking my call. I have two questions. First question is about your dividend payout and as Charles mentioned in the prepared remark, you revise your dividend payout from a fixed 25% to the range of 20% to 30% going forward. So I still -- I just wonder, the rationale to make this change. Is it fair to think going forward you will be able to pay higher than previous 25% in dividend since your earnings outlook is getting better.And my second question is about Fantasy Westward Journey 3D, and this game will -- based on the games website, this game will start a new donor testing today. So can you give us some colors on its revenue potential based on the performance during the past rounds of testing? And is there any potential cannibalization risk between the upcoming FWJ 3D and your existing 2D FWJ game?And finally, how long do you expect this latest round -- how long this latest round of testing may last, and when you expect to monetize this new game?[Foreign Speech] -- [Foreign Speech]So, to just translate for everyone's benefit. For FWJ 3D, yes, we started -- we will start close beta testing are enjoyed today. As to the official launch and monetization timeline that will be subject to, first of all, obviously the approval, when we can get the license. Secondly also based on the testing results of this closed beta testing round.On your concerns on internal cannibalization, as this FWJ 3D and the current FWJ PC version and the FWJ mobile version, they are targeting different user appeals. So see -- we see very, very little concern if any at all in terms of user internal cannibalization. We are very, very confident and positive about the future outlook of FWJ 3D upon its official launch. -- For your first part of the question on the dividend payout ratio. Let me comment saying that NetEase is in fact one of the very, very few technology companies globally that has been consistently paying dividend, returning dividend to our shareholders on a quarterly basis. Every quarter the exact dividend payout ratio is obviously subject to the Board approval. So now the Board has authorized management instead of a fixed 25% point to a 20% to 30% range, and does not mean that we are bound by this range. So every quarter the exact dividend payout ratio will be dependent on the financial and operational performance of the company and ultimately, subject to the Board's reapproval, so it does not indicate that in the future we will always be paying 30%, but we are still pleased that this quarter, we are paying more, because we are confident about our sustainable profitability profile down the road. For the future quarters, it all depends on how the macro economy and our outlook of the company's performance change. -- Thank you.That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Margaret, at this time, I would turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. -- Thank you again for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact us or TPG Investor Relations.

Despite solid growth, NetEase faces immense competition in the , and shareholders haven't seen the results that they've looked for from the video game giant.Coming into Wednesday's first-quarter financial report, NetEase investors wanted the company to prove that it could keep growing both its sales and profits at a pace worthy of its business prospects. NetEase's report was encouraging, as earnings rose substantially and the video game maker showed that it can keep up with peers in key areas of the industry.Image source: NetEase.NetEase's first-quarter results were solid. Sales came in at $2.74 billion, and on a local currency basis, top-line growth of 30% compared to year-ago levels was consistent with what most of those following the stock had anticipated. Net income in local currency more than tripled over the same period, and adjusted earnings of $3.48 per share were considerably stronger than the consensus forecast among investors and more than twice what NetEase brought in during the first quarter of 2018.As we've seen recently, the biggest source of NetEase's growth came from its online gaming business. Net revenue from online game services climbed 35%, and cost controls made the segment more efficient as well, as gross margin climbed more than 1.5 percentage points to 63.7%. The lower-margin e-commerce business also benefited from better conditions, with a 30% gain in revenue and a modest rise in gross margin to 10.2%.However, there were some weaker performances within the company. The advertising services segment underperformed, with sales declines of 5% and a plunge of close to 10 percentage points in gross margin to 49.5%. The company's innovative businesses segment managed to boost its top line by 5%, but losses widened from year-ago levels.NetEase cited multiple drivers of its growth. Familiar titles like played useful roles, with new expansion packs drawing interest, while newer efforts like and also helped the company's financial performance. More efficient operations in e-commerce were also notable contributors to growth.CEO William Ding put the quarter into perspective. \"Our heightened emphasis on online games, e-commerce, advertising, online education, and music,\" Ding said, \"allows us to sharpen our focus on areas where we see the most potential for sustainable, long-term growth.\" The CEO noted that structural efforts internally to make the most of NetEase's biggest opportunities paid off during the quarter and should help in the future as well.Part of the way that NetEase intends to build its business is through international expansion. The company said that games like and made strong initial showings in the Japanese video game market, and NetEase believes that its brand is becoming more well-known and recognized across the globe well beyond China's borders.Dividend levels finally staged a complete rebound. The company declared a $0.69-per-share dividend for the quarter under its variable dividend policy, and that was quite a bit above the $0.48 per share it paid three months ago.NetEase shareholders were happy with the results, and the stock jumped 7% on Thursday following the Wednesday night announcement. China will remain an ultra-competitive market for video game releases, and NetEase can't count on its reputation to ensure that it'll be able to take advantage of opportunities in the industry. However, with its recent efforts, the video game leader has proven that it can keep up with its rivals and move itself toward a more sustainable and faster growth trajectory over the long run.

Wait, that's an understatement. China's gaming market is nearly twice as large as Japan's - the nation that introduced the world to video games - and boasts three times as many online gamers as the world's second-largest gaming nation, the US.To put a number to China's gaming market, consider that 619.5 million people in China played games in 2018 - way more than the  of the US and Japan combined!As awe-inspiring as China's growth in the industry has been, a remarkable trend is taking shape that could change the dynamics of the Chinese gaming market: mobile gaming. In 2018, half the global total in online gaming revenues came from mobile, including smartphones and tablets, according to marketing intelligence firm Newzoo's 2018 Global Games Market Report. Newzoo estimates the number to go up to 59% by 2021. China should be the frontrunner.Now, you may have your fair share of doubts if you look at recent growth numbers: revenue from China's mobile gaming market grew only 15.4% to roughly RMB 134 billion in 2018 compared with 41.7% growth in 2017.However, those who've followed the industry closely would also know that Chinese regulators froze approvals for new games eligible for monetization last year for several months amid various concerns,  hard. Mobile gaming, otherwise, continues to gather steam in China.The overall share of personal computer (PC) games (client and web) in China's total online gaming market shrunk from 86.9% in 2012 to only 36.1% in 2017, according to data from iResearch.Meanwhile, mobile's contribution shot up to 62.1% from only 13.1% during the period. iResearch foresees mobile gaming's share to cross 70% by 2020.So what's powering up the mobile gaming growth engine in China? \"Mobile\" is the keyword here.Mobile gaming, of course, wouldn't have taken off if not for the rising penetration of smartphones in China. The availability of high-end economical smartphones has fuelled the gaming market.As smartphones become even smarter (think software and features that support high-end games), gaming companies also have an incentive to innovate to improve the user experience in games. A high-quality experience is one of the biggest drivers of China's gaming industry.Add to that affordable mobile internet and advanced mobile infrastructure such as the upcoming 5G, and you have an ever-growing addressable market for gaming companies.According to Statista, nearly 788 million people in China are currently accessing the internet through mobile phones. Compare that with China's total estimated internet population of around 800 million and it quickly becomes obvious that nearly  internet user in China today is accessing the web via mobile.That's an astounding statistic. And it's one that has unsurprisingly caught the attention of gaming stalwarts like  (NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) and  (NASDAQ: NTES) . These two are the largest gaming companies in China with a 2017 market share of roughly 44% and 18%, respectively (among publicly listed companies), according to iReasearch.In 2018, Tencent's total revenue from smartphone games jumped 24% to RMB 77.8 billion. In sharp contrast, Tencent's PC client games business saw revenue drop 8% to RMB 50.6 billion last year. Meanwhile, Netease derived 71% of its net online gaming revenue from mobile last year.It's a win-win for such companies as mobile games are not only generally cheaper and quicker to develop and launch than PC games but also easier to monetise.In fact, China's mobile gaming market is so alluring that other global companies want to try their luck. For example, Taiwan-based  is reportedly launching a sequel to its gamer-centric ROG Phone this year and will likely partner with Tencent to gain a foothold in China.US bank  predicts entertainment spending by the average Chinese consumer will grow 8% annually over the next 10 years, with games likely to drive this growth. In other words, mobile games clearly dominate China's online gaming industry and all signs point toward the trend continuing for years to come.So if you're a game lover, expect a lot more excitement and entertainment as companies rack their brains to launch better games that deploy machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) like never before.

Image source: Activision Blizzard.To understand why the best is still to come for Activision Blizzard, start with some of the catalysts that have hurt the stock's performance over the last year. The company's declining player base is one factor. There's been a significant drop in the monthly active user base, and continuing on this trajectory spells doom for the business. However, it's important to put the decline in context because a closer look at the trend highlights dynamics the can actually support the bull case for Activision Blizzard's long-term potential.Monthly active users (MAUs) is a common metric in online content services like video games or social media, and it provides a good baseline indicator for how much use a platform or service is getting. The chart below tracks Activision Blizzard's quarterly monthly active users over the last three years.Data source: Activision Blizzard.That's a pretty big decline across the stretch. But narrow in on what's happening at the operating-segment level. The business consists of three segments: Activision, Blizzard, and King Digital -- with the first two having mostly developed games for console and PC platforms, and King Digital having mostly concentrated on its mobile franchise\u00a0.\u00a0The chart below tracks quarterly MAUs for games from the Activision and Blizzard segments of the business and leaves out the contribution of the King Digital segment.Data source: Activision Blizzard.As the chart shows, there hasn't been a big drop for Activision and Blizzard monthly active users. Activision's quarterly MAUs were basically flat at the end of the three-year period -- as  made up the core of performance and was supported by a rotating cast of franchises. Meanwhile, Blizzard's MAUs are currently down from their peak, but they ended 2018's final quarter at 38 million, up from 22 million in 2016's final quarter as\u00a0 helped to offset the decline for .If that combined performance seems at odds with the company's huge MAU decline over the last several years, it's because the big user drop stems from the King segment, which saw its quarterly MAUs dip from 463 million players to 268 million across its first three full years since being acquired by Activision Blizzard.Casual players abandoned the developer's \u00a0and other supporting titles. But the important part is that King Digital's revenue actually grew roughly 28% from 2016 to 2018 because highly engaged players stayed with its games and per-user spending increased. Across the same stretch, Activision revenue increased roughly 11% and Blizzard's revenue fell 8%.What does this mean?The declining player base is something that Activision Blizzard needs to address (more on that in a bit), but the King segment leading the business' overall revenue growth highlights the importance of  engagement and sales. Even with the user-base erosion, Activision Blizzard actually managed to deliver record sales and earnings performance in 2018 -- a year that was relatively light on big releases. It was able to accomplish that because core player engagement stayed pretty strong.Returning to the three-year comparison, the company's sales are up roughly 14% since 2016 and earnings per share are up 25%. That's not exactly break-neck growth over a three-year stretch, but it occurred even as total MAUs fell 34.5% -- highlighting the fact that industry trends like growth for digital distribution and in-game content sales have helped performance. It also suggests that Activision Blizzard has a highly engaged core audience that should serve as a good foundation to build on.\u00a0Activision Blizzard will continue to face some headwinds in 2019, but there's light at the end of the tunnel.

That doesn't guarantee that  will have a successful transition to mobile platforms, but it does suggest there's an established fan base to tap into as well as a wide pool of new players to win over. will be the series' first real experiment with the free-to-play distribution model that's increasingly being tested for big-budget games -- making it an important release for the franchise and Activision Blizzard.  games have typically hit the market at the $60 price that's common for triple-A titles, and there's been strong demand at the premium price point. So it's reasonable to expect there could be a big market for a free, pared-down take on the property.But just because  will be available as a free download doesn't mean it won't bring in some cash. The game will likely be monetized through in-game purchases, as is typical with free-to-play games. It's also possible that Activision Blizzard will use the mobile version to test some of the  schemes it has been working on.The title will face some tough competition in the shooter space -- with battle royale games like  and  currently all the rage with players. That said,  should be able to carve out a sizable player base as long as its core gameplay is satisfying and the title features an appropriate amount of content.While  will face big competition, the gaming industry can actually support a large number of high-profile titles because the overall market is still growing at a healthy clip. A lot of that growth is happening outside of the North American, European, and Japanese markets that have historically been the industry's key territories.Crucially,  has the potential to be a hit in China and other international markets where Activision Blizzard is keen to build its position. The mobile version was mostly developed by Tencent -- making it much more likely that the title will be able to have a Chinese release. China requires that non-domestic companies partner with local ones in order to release games in that country, so the team-up between Activision and Tencent makes a lot of sense. The American company is also partnering with Chinese developer  for its upcoming game  .With China's regulatory agencies shifting and a trend toward increasingly stringent standards for attaining release licenses, there's still a significant risk that  won't be able to launch in that county. Activision and Tencent will still need to secure a release license from the country's online content regulation body. Both companies have experience with navigating the requirements of the country's censors, and regulators have recently resumed granting licenses. So the right approach is probably to be cautiously optimistic for a Chinese release at this point.Triple-A, big-budget gaming experiences are going free-to-play on mobile, and a high-end  could stand apart in the crowded mobile game field. There are still some key hurdles for the game to overcome, but the upcoming title has a lot of potential -- and it's one investors should keep an eye on.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

Alibaba will execute this program by utilizing its six procurement centers around the world.Further, TOF initiative enables international brands to gauge the popularity of their products in China before making a full entry. Sellers from outside China can keep a small sample of their products at one of the TOF centers, currently located in Japan, South Korea and the United States. These products will then be sold in China via Tmall Global platform.These initiatives bode well for Alibaba's growing focus on bolstering its import capabilities and catering efficiently to the demand of Chinese consumers.Additionally, the initiatives are likely to accelerate the company's plans of bringing international goods worth $200 billion into China over the next five years. | The online retail market of China is witnessing a boom on account of increasing penetration of Internet and mobile use.Per a report from Forrester, the country's online retail market is anticipated to reach $1.8 trillion by 2022.

We note that Kaola sells apparel, household appliances and other products which are imported from overseas manufacturers.Nevertheless, Alibaba's well-performing Tmall Global, known as the biggest cross-border platform in China, offering more than 20,000 overseas brands under 4,000 product categories from 77 countries is likely to continue its dominance in China.Currently, Alibaba carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Combined Monthly Active User (MAU) of Weixin and WeChat increased 10.5% from the year-ago quarter to 1.08 billion, driven by increasing adoption of Mini Programs and Weixin Pay.

Notably, Tencent and NetEase  are among the biggest game distributors in China.Tencent is benefiting from its dominance in China, which is the world's largest video game market, in terms of users (527 million) and revenues.

Wait, that's an understatement. China's gaming market is nearly twice as large as Japan's \u2014 the nation that introduced the world to video games \u2014 and boasts three times as many online gamers as the world's second-largest gaming nation, the US.To put a number to China's gaming market, consider that 619.5 million people in China played games in 2018 \u2014 way more than the\u00a0of the US and Japan combined!As awe-inspiring as China's growth in the industry has been, a remarkable trend is taking shape that could change the dynamics of the Chinese gaming market: mobile gaming. In 2018, half the global total in online gaming revenues came from mobile, including smartphones and tablets, according to marketing intelligence firm Newzoo's 2018 Global Games Market Report. Newzoo estimates the number to go up to 59% by 2021. China should be the frontrunner.Now, you may have your fair share of doubts if you look at recent growth numbers: revenue from China's mobile gaming market grew only 15.4%\u00a0 to roughly RMB 134 billion in 2018 compared with 41.7% growth in 2017.However, those who've followed the industry closely would also know that Chinese regulators froze approvals for new games eligible for monetization last year for several months amid various concerns,\u00a0\u00a0hard. Mobile gaming, otherwise, continues to gather steam in China.The overall share of personal computer (PC) games (client and web) in China's total online gaming market shrunk from 86.9%\u00a0 in 2012 to only 36.1% in 2017, according to data from iResearch.Meanwhile, mobile's contribution shot up to 62.1% from only 13.1% during the period. iResearch foresees mobile gaming's share to cross 70% by 2020.So what's powering up the mobile gaming growth engine in China? \"Mobile\" is the keyword here.Mobile gaming, of course, wouldn't have taken off if not for the rising penetration of smartphones in China. The availability of high-end economical smartphones has fuelled the gaming market.As smartphones become even smarter (think software and features that support high-end games), gaming companies also have an incentive to innovate to improve the user experience in games. A high-quality experience is one of the biggest drivers of China's gaming industry.Add to that affordable mobile internet and advanced mobile infrastructure such as the upcoming 5G, and you have an ever-growing addressable market for gaming companies.According to Statista, nearly 788 million people in China are currently accessing the internet through mobile phones. Compare that with China's total estimated internet population of around 800 million and it quickly becomes obvious that nearly\u00a0\u00a0internet user in China today is accessing the web via mobile.That's an astounding statistic. And it's one that has unsurprisingly caught the attention of gaming stalwarts like\u00a0\u00a0 and\u00a0\u00a0. These two are the largest gaming companies in China with a 2017 market share of roughly 44%\u00a0 and 18%, respectively (among publicly listed companies), according to iReasearch.In 2018, Tencent's total revenue from smartphone games jumped 24% to RMB 77.8 billion. In sharp contrast, Tencent's PC client games business saw revenue drop 8% to RMB 50.6 billion last year. Meanwhile, Netease derived 71%\u00a0 of its net online gaming revenue from mobile last year.It's a win-win for such companies as mobile games are not only generally cheaper and quicker to develop and launch than PC games but also easier to monetise.In fact, China's mobile gaming market is so alluring that other global companies want to try their luck. For example, Taiwan-based  is reportedly launching a sequel to its gamer-centric ROG Phone this year and will likely partner with Tencent to gain a foothold in China.US bank  predicts entertainment spending by the average Chinese consumer will grow 8% annually over the next 10 years, with games likely to drive this growth. In other words, mobile games clearly dominate China's online gaming industry and all signs point toward the trend continuing for years to come.So if you're a game lover, expect a lot more excitement and entertainment as companies rack their brains to launch better games that deploy machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) like never before.

That's especially true in the game-hungry Chinese market, where many companies are fighting for market share and profit.  (NASDAQ: NTES) has  for more than a year now, and even though its fundamental business metrics are generally moving in the right direction, the pace of its growth hasn't lived up to all investors' expectations.Coming into Wednesday's  , NetEase shareholders were hoping to hear that the Guangzhou-based video game company had gotten itself back on track. The report was not entirely positive, but there were some aspects of it that should give shareholders hope that NetEase could return to its former glory at some point.Image source: Getty Images.NetEase in Q4 did end its troubling trend of decelerating profit growth. Revenue jumped 36% to $2.89 billion in local-currency terms, outpacing Q3's growth. That was, however, a bit slower than the 40% growth rate that most of those following the stock had forecast. On the bottom line, adjusted net income climbed 26% in local-currency terms to $343.2 million. That worked out to adjusted earnings of $2.55 per share, well above the $2.06 per share that NetEase earned in Q4 2017 on an adjusted basis.The company's best results came from its online gaming segment. Net revenue from online game services rose 38%, which worked out to a more than 40% rise in gross profit. E-commerce delivered more of a mixed performance, with revenue rising but gross profit falling. Segment sales for the unit rose 44%, but a big boost in costs caused gross profit to fall 13% from year-ago levels. The advertising services business was even more sluggish, with sales gains of just 3% and a 4% drop in gross profit. NetEase's innovative businesses segment came in mixed as well, with a 14% rise in revenue but a modest negative gross profit that almost doubled from the year-earlier quarter.Among the biggest drivers of NetEase's results were mobile games, and the company continued to get a rising contribution from them -- they accounted for almost 70% of video game revenue for the quarter. New games like  and  were the primary contributors to performance there. But in e-commerce, larger-scale promotions and sales discounts weighed on gross profit, and seasonality had an impact on advertising services' performance.On the expenses front, the news was good: Total operating expenses were up just 25%, a fact that allowed faster sales growth to produce a healthier bottom line.CEO William Ding said he was happy with how things were going. \"2018 was a very fruitful year of diversification for our online games,\" Ding said, and \"while our flagship titles remain stronger than ever, we also introduced a number of highly successful titles for PC-client and mobile platforms.\" Ding also pointed to NetEase's efforts to widen its footprint in Japan as integral to its global growth strategy.Management is looking beyond video games for NetEase's future successes. Ding said it will focus on the promising e-commerce, music, and online education segments; the company intends to make substantial investments in those areas as part of its broader business strategy for 2019.Despite the progress NetEase made during Q4, the company still has some ground to make up. Under its variable dividend policy, it declared a $0.48 per share payout for the quarter. That's higher than the $0.45 per share that shareholders received in Q3, but well below the company-best $0.61 per share dividend it paid two quarters ago.NetEase did specifically discuss concerns that some analysts voiced regarding  .

And that's despite a modest  this past November after Tencent's revenue and  , helped by the Chinese tech giant's decision to reorganize in an effort to shift its focus toward its promising advertising, digital content, payments, and cloud services businesses.Since then, however, Chinese regulators finally began digging into backlog of gaming license requests, and we saw a handful of Tencent's newer mobile game titles start to appear in the approved lists in late January.Investors should be watching closely in Tencent's impending quarterly report -- which is slated for this Thursday, March 21,  -- for signs of not only whether the company's lucrative gaming business is back in action, but also whether it was able to sustain momentum in its other segments. If Tencent can show investors it's effectively firing on all cylinders once again, I think the stock's recent gains will only be the beginning of a much longer-term trend. Western-developed KFC and Pizza Hut are among the world's largest restaurant brands and are the underpinning of Yum China Holdings' business. It also has exclusive rights to develop Taco Bell in China, as well as owning local concepts East Dawning and Little Sheep. With 8,400 restaurants in over 1,200 Chinese cities, Yum China is a fast-food industry leader in the giant Asian nation.Although up materially since its late 2016 IPO, the stock has basically gone nowhere for over a year -- even counting the big 24% rise in early 2019. But it has huge growth potential, adding more than 800 new locations in 2018 and pushing systemwide sales up by 5%. It expects to open as many as 650 new restaurants this year, which should support high-single-digit top-line growth. data by The reason for the stock's weak 2018 showing  . This performance metric tracks results at units open for at least a year and came in at a weak 1% in 2018. That's not unexpected, given a slowing Chinese economy and increasing local competition. To offset such headwinds, Yum China is looking to improve margin in 2019 by as much as 1.3 percentage points. That, plus the increasing store count, should help keep earnings heading higher as the company continues to build out its business.With a  of 24, Yum China isn't cheap, but it's also not far out of line with other industry giants.

Bilibili is a Chinese tech company that owns a Gen Z-oriented platform of video games, anime, and online comics. It generates most of its revenue from mobile games -- 62% of its top line last quarter -- but it's aggressively diversifying its business with live video broadcasts, online ads, and an e-commerce platform  into  's (NYSE: BABA) Taobao marketplace. Bilibili believes it will eventually generate less than half of its sales from video games.Bilibili's number of monthly active users (MAUs) rose 29% annually to 92.8 million last quarter. Within that total, its mobile MAUs grew 37% to 79.5 million, and its number of average monthly paying users nearly quadrupled to 4.4 million. Its \"official\" members, who must pass a \"geek culture\" entrance exam to access more perks, surged 44% to 45 million. Revenue climbed 57% annually during the quarter, and analysts expect sales to rise 56% for the full year.Bilibili's rapidly growing base of Gen Z users attracted big investments from  (NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) and Alibaba, two aging tech giants that are facing competitive pressure from ByteDance's portfolio of popular Gen Z apps, including TikTok and Jinri Toutiao.

Year-over-year revenue growth, on an RMB basis.NetEase's gaming business, which was crippled by a nine-month freeze on new approvals in China, roared back to life during the fourth quarter as the company's main growth engine.

Gross profit margins, on an RMB basis.NetEase's gaming gross margin expanded annually, buoyed by higher total revenues and certain fixed costs in online games, but declined sequentially due to its higher dependence on lower-margin mobile games and licensed titles.Its e-commerce margins fell both annually and sequentially on higher promotions and discounts, which indicates that its e-commerce business is struggling to stay relevant in the shadow of  (NYSE: BABA) and  .Yanxuan's controversial business model of selling \"unbranded\" products also  to government crackdowns on counterfeit goods. Kaola, which focuses on imports, could fare better (especially with Amazon's support), but it still trails behind Alibaba's Tmall Global in that smaller market.As for the innovative businesses unit, NetEase noted that a \"decreased revenue contribution from certain online platform businesses which have relatively higher gross profit margins\" caused the segment to stay unprofitable. In other words, NetEase probably secured fewer paid subscribers for NetEase Cloud Music as Tencent Music aggressively expanded  last December.Lastly, the gross margin of its advertising business improved sequentially on seasonally higher demand for ads. However, higher staff-related expenses and content acquisition costs caused the year-over-year decline.Analysts expect NetEase's revenue and earnings to rise 24% and 21% annually, respectively, this year. Those are solid growth rates for a stock which trades at 29 times this year's earnings. It also pays a forward dividend yield of 0.7%.NetEase remains a solid investment on the Chinese tech industry, and it could rebound on any progress in the trade talks between the U.S. and China.

Carbon Black's results seemed reasonably strong on their face, with sales climbing 27% on a 32% rise in recurring revenue compared to the year-earlier period, and customer growth was also encouraging. However, the company said that CFO Mark Sullivan will resign in early March, and its guidance for 2019 indicated slowing growth prospects for the coming year. Wall Street analysts responded with ratings and price-target cuts, and that could bode poorly for the company's efforts to move further toward cloud-centered offerings.Finally, shares of NetEase sank 6%.  in its fiscal third quarter, helping to boost adjusted net income by 26%. However, despite strength in its online gaming segment, weaker results in e-commerce, advertising services, and the innovative businesses division held back NetEase's overall results. Moreover, more companies are fighting to win video game market share both within China and in international markets. Overall, that spells bigger challenges for NetEase ahead, and shareholders seem uncertain whether the company's up to the task after a tough year for the stock.

On a GAAP basis, its net loss widened from 51 million RMB to 191 million RMB ($28 million).Investors don't seem concerned about Bilibili's losses for now, since the stock remains more than 50% above its IPO price.

Bilibili's  of  's (NASDAQ: NTES) online comics business should further bolster its \"other\" revenue.Bilibili expects its revenue to rise 10%-12% sequentially during the first quarter, which would mark an acceleration from its 7% sequential growth in the fourth quarter. Analysts expect its total revenue to rise 54% this year.Bilibili's top-line growth is impressive, but its cost of revenue jumped 72% annually during the quarter, its operating expenses more than doubled, and it lacks a clear path toward profitability. Its sales and marketing expenses also surged 181% as it promoted its mobile games and its own original anime content.On the bright side, Bilibili finished the quarter with 4.1 billion RMB ($601 million) in cash, cash equivalents, and time deposits, which represents a big jump from 745 million RMB a year earlier (prior to its IPO) and 2.9 billion RMB in the third quarter.That cash cushion gives Bilibili plenty of time to gradually narrow its losses. Wall Street expects Bilibili's non-GAAP net loss to narrow from $0.27 per share in 2018 to $0.13 per share in 2019.Bilibili's core businesses are flourishing, it retains a strong position in the lucrative Gen Z market, and its stock isn't that pricey at about five times this year's sales.

Source: Shutterstock (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) are not faring that much better, either, losing around one-third of their value from their 52-week highs. Why are gaming stocks out of favor and should value investors even consider Activision, especially when the company is forecasting weaker results going forward?Activision generated  net revenue of $7.5 billion for the year. In Q4, the company's revenue was $2.38 billion, also setting a record.EA's 2018 EPS of $2.72 was also the highest ever and came in well above its 2017 EPS of $2.21 levels. But EA's 2018 operating cash flow was $1.79 billion, below last year's $2.21 billion.Markets glossed over the strong figures and focused instead on its weak booking numbers. Even though its bookings of $7.26 billion reached records levels, they were only slightly ahead of last year's $7.16 billion. With bookings growth clearly slowing, investors are unwilling to pay a premium for Activision stock.After Activision stock dropped 48% from its yearly highs, the shares trade at a more reasonable price-earnings ratio of 19. which  published, is the hottest cross-platform game on the market. It is popular not only on mobile devices but on consoles and PCs, too. That has worried the owners of Activision stock and ATVI itself. If consumers can install and play Fortnite and similar games for free, how will Activision justify charging high prices for its blockbuster franchise,  ?ATVI is well-positioned in mobile devices through its ownership of King Digital, the maker of the popular, free mobile game,  . In Q4, King's revenue grew 5% YoY to $543 million, and its operating income jumped 28% to $207 million. And for the first time since ATVI acquired King, its monthly active users reached 268 million, thanks to the launch of  in October 2018.For now, Activision is strategically well-positioned to grow its market share in the free-to-play games market. Using effective marketing techniques, ATVI could increase its MAU and revenue in this space.Activision may double down on its efforts in esports and  , and invest more in its Battle.net in 2019. It has to. It cannot afford to think only of the revenue and profits from its core titles. Instead, it needs to add tools that gamers will use and appreciate, thereby improving its monthly user metrics.Management did not go into much detail on how it would reinvigorate demand for its  franchise. In the second half of last year, demand for the latest game in the series slowed even though ATVI lowered the prices it charged for the game. ATVI's  game did not perform any better even after new features were added to it.As expected, Activision said on its Q4 conference call that it would cut its operating costs and lay off some of its employees, while putting more resources into its digital network.Blizzard's strong Q4 results may continue in 2019.

(NYSE: BABA) and  (NASDAQ: JD) hold a near-duopoly, with a combined market share of about 75%.Image source: Getty Images.Amazon China fared slightly better in the imports market with a 6% share, according to research firm Analysys. Alibaba's Tmall Global leads the imports market with a 29% share, followed by NetEase's Kaola with a 22.6% share.Since Amazon views Alibaba as a major rival in the e-commerce and  , it makes sense to partner with NetEase instead. Let's see how this deal could benefit both companies.Amazon's e-commerce business is running out room to grow in the US and other developed markets. That's why it's aggressively expanding into higher-growth markets like Southeast Asia and India.Amazon often considers India to be its most promising market. In 2016 it committed $5 billion to its investments in India, which included joint ventures, infrastructure upgrades, and original digital content for the Indian market. That expansion helped it control about 30% of the Indian e-commerce market last year according to Citi Research.However, the Indian government  new policies for e-commerce platforms which could derail Amazon's plans. These new laws ban online retailers from offering exclusive sales, bar them from selling products in which they own equity interest, restrict discounts and cashback offers, and limit foreign direct investments in local retailers.Amazon protested the new rules, but it clearly needed to focus on other growth markets besides India. China, which it has mostly neglected over the past 15 years, seemed like a logical choice since it already established a toehold in the market.Image source: Getty Images.Going head-to-head against Alibaba's Tmall or JD in the business-to-consumer market would be foolish, since many other e-commerce companies previously failed to crack that duopoly. Amazon launched Prime in China three years ago, but the platform isn't supported by a massive portfolio of digital content like its U.S. counterpart.Therefore, focusing on the smaller market of cross-border imports makes more sense. Merging Amazon China's import business with NetEase's Kaola could help it gain ground quickly in that smaller market.NetEase generates most of its revenue from online video games. However, more than a quarter of its revenue comes from its two e-commerce platforms, Kaola and Yanxuan.NetEase's e-commerce business was its fastest-growing unit in recent quarters. However, the unit's operating margin (10% in the third quarter) also remains much lower than the 60%+ operating margins of its online gaming and advertising businesses.Yanxuan, NetEase's e-commerce platform for \"unbranded\" products, is controversial because it  that are identical to those produced by Chinese manufacturers that produce goods for multinational brands. For example, a pair of unbranded UGG boots from an \"UGG manufacturer\" on Yanxuan costs a fraction of the price of the authentic product on Tmall.These products technically aren't knockoffs, but the theft of designs raises serious red flags for Yanxuan's future. Chinese regulators already cracked down on another controversial marketplace,  (NASDAQ: PDD) , over  last year.That's probably why NetEase doesn't want to become overly dependent on Yanxuan, which became the e-commerce unit's growth engine over the past three years. Kaola showed promising growth in the past, but NetEase's attempts to expand its presence by procuring overseas products and opening brick-and-mortar showcase stores have been costly.Merging Kaola with Amazon's import unit could solve those problems. The investment would give Kaola fresh capital for its expansion efforts, and Amazon's connections could help it import more overseas products at lower prices.Sealing this deal could benefit both Amazon and NetEase. Amazon can finally make more progress in China, and NetEase can expand Kaola to reduce the e-commerce division's dependence on Yanxuan's shaky business model.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

I will now turn the call over to Mr. Yang, who will read the prepared remarks on behalf of Mr. Ding. -- Thank you, Margaret. Happy Chinese New Year, and thank you, everyone, for participating in today's call. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that all percentages are based on renminbi. With that said, I will deliver opening remarks on William's behalf.2018 was an exciting year for us. We ended the year with record total annual net revenues of CNY 67 billion, a 24% increase from 2017. Our strong performance was driven by a diverse portfolio of online games, as well as healthy growth in our e-commerce, advertising services and other Internet product and service offerings. Our online games business remains the core of our strategy.The fourth quarter marked our third consecutive quarter exceeding CNY 10 billion in online games net revenues. In the fourth quarter, our online games revenue reached CNY 11 billion, a 38% increase compared with the same period last year. Our continued success in online games is underpinned by our commitment and vision to having a positive impact on the online games industry, our ability to deliver best-in-class quality games with an emphasis on in-house R&D and native IP empowered by our unique corporate culture and the right training mechanisms and infrastructure to nurture talents, all of which we have spend over two decades investing in. 2018 was a fruitful year for us in terms of our online games genre diversification initiatives.In addition to our legacy titles that spent decades of popularity, we are continuously adding new titles and creating new IP that we hope will garner the same longevity. Throughout 2018, we launched a number of highly successful games covering a wide spectrum of categories with chart-topping titles, such as Chu Liu Xiang, Identity V, QwQ, Justice, Butterfly Sword, Ancient Nocturne and in the fourth quarter, Night Falls: Survival. Night Falls: Survival has been the top performer on China's iOS download chart since its release in November. This is a cooperative survival role-playing game, game set against a doomsday background, where players rebuild their living habitat and restore civilization with other survivors after the apocalypse.It has attracted a large fan base with a high degree of innovation that combines MMORPG, sandbox and shooting game play features all-in-one game. Night Falls: Survival has stayed consistently at the top of China's iOS grossing chart, ranking #3 in terms of total grossing games for the month of November and December according to App Annie. This game is now also available in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. While we continue to dominate the MMO genre, many of our new titles are in brand-new categories that we have either recently entered or pioneered.Our ability to break into new territories has helped us capture users that reach beyond our traditional MMO game players. As a result, our user base has grown rapidly, spanning across different emerging demographics, including younger, more casual and more female users. Turning to our legacy titles, the market is still in awe of the longevity of our flagship franchises. After over -- for 15 years of operation on PC and more than three years on mobile, our active Fantasy Westward Journey and Westward Journey Online sagas are still growing.We continue to supply this large and sustainable user base with interesting content. In the fourth quarter, we launched content updates for our Fantasy Westward Journey and New Westward Journey Online series on both PC-client and mobile platforms. Tianxia III also celebrated its 10th year anniversary with a new expansion pack at the end of November, delivering encouraging sequential quarterly revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Some of the titles we launched in more recent years, such as Onmyoji have also entered a steady stage of operation.Through the introduction of new content, Onmyoji climbed back to the No. 1 spot on the iOS grossing chart twice in the fourth quarter, two years after it first became a market sensation in 2016. Invincible, an SLG game we launched over three years ago, has been growing steadily year over year, both in terms of revenue and user numbers since its launch. Other titles, such as Onmyoji Arena, a multiplayer online battle arena game which we released in early 2018 has also begun to show similar healthy trend.2018 was also a milestone year for our international expansion. Net revenues from our international games accounted for more than 10% of our total game net revenues for two consecutive quarters now. In Japan, Knives Out has become a household name among young gamers. It has remained one of Japan's leading grossing games since March 2018.It has also been ranked as China's top grossing mobile game in overseas market for five consecutive months from August to December 2018 according to Sensor Tower. During 2018, as well as in recent months, we brought a number of other distinctive new titles to Asian markets, including Rules of Survival, Identity V and QwQ, each of which opens doors for us in their respective markets. Going global offered an excellent opportunity for us to promote Chinese culture, as well as our original IP and best-in-class production quality in markets worldwide. We see huge potential to further build our brand and bring our games to players outside of China, particularly in mainstream Western market.For example, we plan to bring our popular hit Night Falls: Survival to Japan and the U.S. in the first half of 2019. We are now working with other world-renowned game developers not only to bring their flagship titles to China but also help transform some of their most important titles into mobile games. Most significantly, we renewed our 11-year partnership with Blizzard Entertainment in Mainland China, extending our publishing agreement until January 2023.And as we previously announced, we are codeveloping the highly anticipated new mobile game, Diablo Immortal, with Blizzard. Our world-class R&D capabilities, particularly in the mobile arena, afford us an excellent opportunity to appeal to a global audience. We plan to continue to invest in global talent and IP to further this momentum. For example, we recently closed a deal with Codemasters, a U.K.game studio, and made minority investments in Quantic Dream, a French game studio, as well as Second Dinner, the U.S. studio founded by ex-Blizzard veterans. We have a number of strong titles in our pipeline, including Fantasy Westward Journey 3D, Xuanyuan Sword, Ages of Isle ancl Pok\u00e9mon Quest, just to name a few. We will continue to introduce thrilling new games that maintain the high level of integrity, innovation and excellence upon which our users rely.Our ability to create unique content has been a driving force in NetEase' success over the last 20 years. This is historically prevalent across our offerings, including online games, NetEase news and NetEase email services. For our next phase of investment, we again look for areas where our content creation abilities can stand out, succeed and have strong profit growth potential. E-commerce, online education and music are three sectors that fit these criteria and will be the focus of our next phase of strategic growth.For Kaola, we are increasingly encouraged by the government's favorable policies toward cross-border e-commerce. Raising the cross-border duty-free quota per transaction and raising the duty-free annual quota per individual incentivized customers to buy more products across a wider range of categories. We are continuously collaborating with more international brands to raise these companies' brand profiles in China. For example, Abbott, a global maternity and baby products manufacturer, is one of our more recent partners.Through our strategic agreement, Kaola will be one of the first to sell Abbott's high-end baby formula in China. In the fourth quarter, we also held a NetEase Kaola super brands day event, whereby participating brands were allotted targeted promotional resources on our platform. Many of the internationally renowned brands experienced rapid sales growth based on Kaola's support, including British high street brand, Kattle; American sports equipment brand, Under Armour; well-known European organic baby food brand, Little Freddie; and U.S. baby food brand, Mead Johnson.For Yanxuan, we continue to enhance the efficiency of our supply chain, establishing new workflow programs in order to work more closely with quality designers and train our premier supplier to ensure high-caliber product design and craftsmanship. In December 2018 and January 2019, we opened our very first brick-and-mortar Yanxuan store and our flagship Kaola store, respectively. These pilot stores offer customers an integrated online-to-offline shopping experience, where customers can see and try our product in person, enjoying greater convenience. Located in Hangzhou's busiest business district, the stores generated strong interest and demand from tourists and visitors to Hangzhou, proving to be an effective marketing tool as we work to further scale our e-commerce offerings.In addition, education is a large and important area of focus for us. Our influence and reach in the online education arena grew substantially in 2018. We have great confidence in the continued growth of this space, and we believe our strong background in Internet and AI technology provides us with an advantage in delivering a superb user experience in online education. In 2018, gross billing from Youdao online courses more than doubled from the prior year, making this vertical the largest contributor for Youdao.We introduce the dual teacher mode to provide a better studying experience, in which students are equipped with one lecturer and one assistant counselor for each online session course. This teaching mode proved to be popular with users, yielding higher renewal rates for some of our K-12 courses. While our online education offerings currently cover both K-12 education and higher education, we expect our K-12 offerings to be a bigger growth driver going forward. In 2018 and early 2019, we launched several educational apps supported by AI technology or tailored toward K-12 users, making studying more personalized and targeted.These apps include: Youdao Mathematics; Youdao Verbal English; Youdao Homework, which contain after-school tutorials for children; Youdao Reading, which helps children develop positive reading habit; and Youdao Children's Dictionary. We believe, like with all our businesses, our dedication to ensuring a positive user experience and creating differentiated and unique content is what will set us apart and allow us to succeed in the online education space in the longer run. For music, we are receiving more recognition for NetEase Cloud Music, especially among the critical younger generation demographic. With over 600 million users, our NetEase Cloud Music was China's most downloaded free music app on iOS in the fourth quarter according to App Annie.China's digital music market is thriving, and we continue to provide our growing community with a differentiated and personalized user experience. In 2018, the number of paying subscribers more than doubled from the prior year, and the sales of digital albums on our NetEase Cloud Music platform experienced robust growth year over year. We completed a round of financing for NetEase Cloud Music in November 2018 and brought in complementary business resources and stakeholders to help ensure a healthy growth outlook for our online music platform. As we move through the year, online games will remain the backbone of our operations, both domestically and overseas.We are proud of our in-house production capabilities, and we are excited to take our products abroad and win over global players with our innovative and proprietary content. At the same time, we will take an even more focused and concentrated approach with our investments in nongame segments, namely e-commerce, online education and music. Our relentless drive to create premium content has paved the way for our success, and our investments in carefully chosen new areas will allow us to stand the test of time in China's rapidly evolving Internet industry. This will continue to be the foundation for our next exciting stage of growth.This concludes William's remarks. I will now provide a brief review of our fourth-quarter and full-year 2018 financial results. Given the limited time on today's call, I will be presenting some abbreviated financial highlights. We encourage you to read through our press release issued earlier today for further details.We finished the year with a new revenue record both on an annual basis and on a quarterly basis. Net revenues for the year were CNY 67.2 billion or USD 9.8 billion, representing a 24% increase year over year. Net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2018 came in at CNY 19.8 billion or USD 2.9 billion,representing a 36% increase year over year and an 18% increase quarter over quarter. Net revenues from online games grew for the fourth consecutive quarter, reaching CNY 11 billion, representing a 6% increase quarter over quarter and 38% year over year.The sequential increase was driven by the launch of Night Falls: Survival and Ancient Nocturne, and the yearly increase was primarily driven by the launch of Knives Out, Chu Liu Xiang and Identity V. Mobile games account for approximately 70% of net revenues from our online games in the fourth quarter and for the 2018 full year. Our e-commerce business continues to demonstrate robust growth in 2018 with total net revenues increased by 65% year over year to CNY 19.2 billion. For the fourth quarter, net revenues from e-commerce were up 50% quarter over quarter and 44% year over year to CNY 6.7 billion.Net revenues from our advertising services business were also up by 4% year over year in 2018, yielding CNY 2.5 billion for the full year. For the fourth quarter, net revenues from advertising services were CNY 761 million, representing a growth of 18% quarter over quarter and 3% year over year. The top-performing verticals were automobile, real estate and Internet services sectors. Total net revenues from our innovative businesses and others segments were CNY 5.2 billion for the year, an increase of 40% year over year.Net revenues from innovative businesses and others were CNY 1.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018, which was relatively flat quarter over quarter and up 14% year over year. As you may have noticed, we renamed our email and others segment to innovative businesses and others. With our heightened focus on developing key incubated businesses, we believe this name better reflects the nature of this segment's revenue composition. The main components within this segment have not dramatically changed and as a reminder, include live video streaming, Cloud Music, online education and certain other cloud application services among others.Gross margin was 38.6% in the fourth quarter, compared with 44.8% in the preceding quarter and 39.3% a year ago. Gross margin for our online game services for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 62.8%, which is largely stable. As a reminder, our gross margin for games typically fluctuates quarter to quarter within the narrowband based on the revenue mix of mobile, PC self-developed and licensed games. Gross margin for our e-commerce segment was 4.5% in the fourth quarter of 2018.The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year decreases were due to larger-scale e-commerce promotion and discounts during the promotional season. On a full-year basis, gross margin for this segment was 8%, compared to 10.3% last year. During the fourth quarter, we incurred CNY 5.4 billion in operating expenses. The year-over-year increase was mainly due to increased R&D mostly related to online games, as well as increased shipping and handling costs related to the growing scale of our e-commerce business.The increasing R&D is a testament to our commitment to investing in best-class R&D infrastructure, talent and products. While we continue to grow, we take a disciplined view of our spending, staying within a well-controlled range. Selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue consistently came down from the first quarter of 2018, coming in at 12.1% in the fourth quarter, compared with 14% in the previous quarter and 16.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017. E-commerce-related shipping and handling costs as a percentage of e-commerce net revenues was 8.6% in the fourth quarter.On a full-year basis, shipping and handling costs as a percentage of e-commerce revenue was 8.7% in 2018, compared to 10.1% last year. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased by 57% year over year to CNY 2.2 billion. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 were 34%, compared to 34% and 18% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2017, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 28% for the full-year 2018, compared to 17% for 2017.The year-over-year increase in the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter and for the full year were due to higher operating losses incurred by some of our nongame businesses. As we have discussed on our prior calls, clue to the increase in the scale of some of our loss-making business units, we expect the effective tax rate to increase further in 2019. Non-GAAP net income attributable to our shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2018 totaled CNY 2.4 billion or USD 343 million, representing an increase of 4% quarter over quarter and 26% year over year. Non-GAAP net income attributable to our shareholders for the full-year 2018 totaled CNY 8.7 billion or USD 1.3 billion, compared to CNY 12.8 billion in 2017.Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS were CNY 18.33 or USD 2.66 for the fourth quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS were CNY 66.68 or USD 9.70 for the full-year 2018. Our cash position remains strong. As of December 31, 2018, our total cash and cash equivalents, current and noncurrent time deposits and short-term investment balance totaled CNY 50.1 billion, compared with CNY 43.2 billion as of December 31, 2017.For the fourth quarter of 2018, we plan to pay a dividend of CNY 0.48 per ADS, representing 25% of the net income attributable to our shareholders. As of November 15, 2018, under our share repurchase program for up to USD 2 billion, we had repurchased approximately 4.6 million ADS for approximately USD 1.2 billion. On November 14, 2018, our board announced the approval of a new share repurchase program for up to USD 1 billion of our outstanding ADS for the next 12 months beginning on November 16, 2018. No shares were repurchased under this new plan as of December 31, 2018.Thank you for your attention. We would like now to open the call to your questions. Operator, please go ahead to Q&A.[Operator instructions] We'll go first to Thomas Chong with Credit Suisse. -- Hi, good morning. Thanks, management, for taking my questions. My first question is about our investment approach on e-commerce, education and music business. I just want to get a sense why we choose 2019 to be the year to step up the investments across these areas? Are we seeing any new trend or industry trend that we see there's a lot of potential? And given the fact that the tax rates are maybe higher on the losses, how should we think about the earnings growth or the margin trend that we should expect? And my second question is about the gaming regulations, in particular, the suspension for the new license applications.Just want to see any color on that. And my final question is about our e-commerce business. Can management talk about any view on our synergies to be expected with our strategic partner, if there's any? -- Thanks, Thomas. I will translate your question one by one for William. [Foreign language] -- [Foreign language] -- [Foreign language] -- [Foreign language] -- Thomas, the first question. William would like to first remind that it has been years for NetEase to be exploring into e-commerce, online education, music. For instance, for our online education, in particular for Youdao, we have almost a decade of experience nurturing into this vertical. Now we are seeing the increased sophistication of AI technology, as well as a much higher level of user acceptance to education format online.That's why we think with a huge potential market, as well as the readiness and maturity of this market, it is time for us to be very focused in making a bigger impact in online education. Music and games are, in essence, a content-driven business, and we are confident of our content creation differentiation capability. For e-commerce, again for both Kaola and Yanxuan, we've been investing for years. And this is definitely an area that NetEase is going to continue to invest.[Foreign language] -- [Foreign language] -- For your second question on any update on gaming regulation. We also noticed there are  and rumors yesterday talking about large game suspensions. We would like to say that we do not see that. Some provincial and local regulators have modified the format of material submissions, but we do not interpret that as a shutdown of new game approvals.[Foreign language] For e-commerce, first of all, we do not make comment or response to any ungrounded market rumors. But as a mentality, NetEase is always very open-minded to embrace stakeholders, strategic partners, business partners, that can bring synergy and win-win to our e-commerce segment, as well as many of our other segments.[Operator instructions] We'll go next to Eddie Leung with Merrill Lynch. -- Hey, good morning, guys. Just actually a very quick question on the gross margin of your e-commerce business. I remember, you guys, especially, for example, like Charles mentioned, that there would be hopefully a target on stabilizing the gross margins of the e-commerce business. So just wondering if you could provide some outlook on that front given the fourth quarter fluctuation in gross margin. -- [Foreign language] Thank you, Eddie. I will take your question directly. For our e-commerce, as you have noticed that for Q4, gross margin was lower than prior quarters, as well as Q4 of last year. But at the same time, I hope that you can also notice that a substantial improvement in us lowering our inventory, which means in Q4, we have engaged in larger-scale promotional events to optimize our inventory structure.Going forward in 2019 and forward, it is always a very prudent strategy for NetEase to balance top-line GMV revenue growth, as well as a margin profile. For now, we expect that the overall e-commerce segment in 2019 and forward can still have a very robust top-line growth, at the same time, with a relatively stable GP margin over the full year. But of course, quarter over quarter, there might be fluctuations that is just typical to e-commerce seasonality.We'll go next to Alicia Yap with Citigroup. -- Hi, good morning, William, Charles, Margaret and Randy. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask, could management comment how many titles that NetEase has submitted while still waiting for approval? And if let's say, China license continues to hold up longer, if the new games is ready, will NetEase actually decide to launch those new games to overseas markets first even though China markets are not yet ready to launch? Follow-up on this, Charles, your questions on the -- I mean, your answer on the gross margin for e-commerce, you say stable for the full year. Do you mean this 8% on 2018 will be the trend for 2019 and going forward? -- OK. Alicia, I'll take your second -- I will translate your first question, and I will take your second question directly. [Foreign language] -- [Foreign language] -- So Alicia, first part of your question. We have over 10 titles that have already been submitted in the approval pipeline. And as to your second part of the game right relation question. Yes, for overseas market, it is not restricted by the domestic approval.So there are games, for instance, that we have already started testing and trial in overseas markets. For us, we see that as two pillars of further growing our game segment in 2019. And for your second question, our e-commerce margin. Yes.For us, we always strive to seek a disciplined balance between top-line growth and margin profile. It is also our intention to maintain e-commerce gross profit margin in the neighborhood similar to 2018 full year, that is in the high single-digit area. But of course, this is not an easy battle, and it requires a lot of effort and hard work from our business unit.[Operator instructions] We'll go next to Natalie Wu with CICC. -- Hi, good morning, William, Charles and Margaret. Thanks for taking my question. Firstly, very quickly. Can you give us some color on the region breakdown for your overseas game revenue? Because it's been shown in a couple of last quarters.And also the margin profiles there, any difference versus the domestic market? And secondly, you mentioned about the online education endeavor. Also, the Youdao's revenue has been double last year. I'm just wondering, can you share with us any color on the contribution from the K-12 business versus the higher education? And under which line do you recognize that revenue? And also, in the future, just wondering, will Youdao be the major business unit for your online education endeavor? Or if there would be any synergy with other business lines, should we anticipate or -- is this just to operate independently for Youdao? -- OK. Thanks, Natalie. I'll translate the questions. [Foreign language] -- [Foreign language] -- [Foreign language] -- [Foreign language] -- [Foreign language] -- [Foreign language] -- OK. So Natalie, I'll provide a brief and summarized translation for the answers. Firstly, for the overseas games contribution, for now, it is mainly coming from Japan contributed by Knives Out's performance. And Ijust mentioned in the  , our next focus is to further tap into mainstream Western market, hopefully, by more and more titles.In terms of margin profile, there's very -- it's largely the same between domestic games and offshore games. But of course, in domestic games, given the scale, we do enjoy better economy of scale. So margins are slightly higher, but there is really no significant differences between the games, whether it's overseas or in domestic market. For online education, William has provided a detailed explanation just now in Mandarin.So to summarize, first of all, Youdao has now over a decade of operation cumulating a sizable user base. We first started as a study tool, Youdao Dictionary, and there is a high degree of overlap with the current focused K-12 online courses in terms of users. In addition, given that NetEase is a controlling shareholder of Youdao, there's also significant overlaps between the users of our email services, music, for instance, with online courses, whether being student themselves or parents of those students. And we do see a kind of a coordinated effort in promoting online education by utilizing resources from our matrix of products.And more recently, driven by the AI technology, Youdao has also been introducing AI-empowered hardwares, which is also being very well received in the market. So all in all, for our online education endeavor, we will be mainly focused on online education, which will mitigate and avoid many concerns around offline education that the market is being concerned about.And we'll go next to Alex Poon with Morgan Stanley. -- Hi, William. Hi, Charles. Hi, Margaret. Congratulations on the great results.I have questions regarding game business. In the last two quarters, you mentioned RMB 10 billion is the online game revenue run rate. And this quarter, you have surpassed CNY 11 billion. So can we say CNY 11 billion is your new base, new benchmark we can reference to, especially you have a very strong pipeline in the coming year? And the second question regarding games is on the user acquisition side, we are seeing a lot of promotion in short video platforms to get for game business.Do you see this channel as a lower user acquisition cost for game business structurally that this can improve your overall game return in future? And lastly, can you talk a little bit about Diablo Immortal's status? And also, Eclipse Isle is missing in the pipeline in your press release. I'm wondering why is that not in your press release. -- Sorry, Alex, which game that you are referring to that's missing? -- That's [Foreign language] -- OK. Thanks, Alex. I'll translate your questions to William. [Foreign language] -- [Foreign language] -- OK. So Alex, I will answer your question. Firstly, as you know, we do not provide guidance, revenue or profit. But as a general trend, like I have commented in last quarters, that we are very confident about the solid foundation of our game revenues going forward.I think it is encouraging to see that we have delivered three quarters that is trending above CNY 10 billion. We are extremely happy to see that the number has surpassed CNY 11 billion. But like I said, it is a solid foundation or the future incremental increase will be supported by our continuous effort of launching new and successful games in the pipeline. For your question on user acquisition.NetEase, given our scale and track record in operating online games, we have a diversified source of new user acquisitions, among which short video live streaming is becoming an increasingly important source of new user acquisitions. Whether the cost is lower, it all depends. But on an average blended basis, it does seem short video is a very cost-competitive and cost-efficient manner for us to acquire new users. Diablo Immortal, we are a codeveloper on that game together with Blizzard.As to the exact launch timetable, I would encourage markets to direct the question directly to Activision Blizzard. And from a codeveloper's perspective, the game development is pretty much ready. Of course, there's always space for us to optimize and enhance, but it is not any concern that game development side will cause any potential delay. As your last bit of questions specific about our pipelines, we did announce several exciting new games that's in our earnings release in the pipeline.As you know, that we have over 50 studios on our NetEase Games platform and there are numerous new games of different stages in our R&D and potential launch pipeline. And we are very, very confident about the robust game pipeline for 2019.We'll go next to Alex Yao with JPMorgan. -- [Foreign language] I have a couple of questions on music. First of all, how do you think about the competition in China's online music industry? And then secondly, regarding monetization. What are our strategies to improve the music monetization, including both the pure music streaming operation? And potentially, would you be considering adding the live broadcasting feature to your music streaming service to improve the monetization? -- [Foreign language] -- Alex, I will -- for the benefit of everyone in the call, I will provide summarized translations for William's answer. So first of all, about your position in competitive landscape, we recognize the fact that we are, relatively speaking, a latecomer into online music segment. However, we are highly convinced that China's online music market has huge potential. And after years of competition, it appears now that TME and NetEase Cloud Music are the two clear leaders.And as a latecomer, we are a little bit disadvantaged in terms of copyright, etc. However, as a latecomer, especially with the deep insight in trying to understand the user's need, we do have differentiated advantages as well comparing to competitors, especially in terms of user experience and providing trends that represents innovation, which links also very relevantly to how to think about potential monetization. It is actually, for the whole industry, it is in a trial mode, whether it is by paying users, advertising, live streaming or even potentially some other new and innovative format, it is all possible. Some of the formats of innovation or monetization has already been proven either by us or by our competitors.But we fundamentally believe there will also be other very interesting format that we can potentially think about music, music user monetization. Because after all, we think this huge market potential is underpinned by music content, and we believe after these many years of development, online music, this whole format is becoming now a new habit that is highly receptive by Chinese Internet users. And uniquely, as a unique differentiation to many other type of formats, music content is a content that can be enjoyed repeatedly, either in different variations, by different singers, in different settings. And also, there's no language boundary.So all in all, we think NetEase Cloud Music will remain as a pioneer and an innovative leader in terms of providing differentiated music content to our users.At this time, I will hand the call back over to Margaret Shi for any additional or closing remarks. -- Thank you once again for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact us or TPG Investor Relations. Have a great day.

In 2018, NTES stock returned a massive loss of nearly 32%, due in large part to the U.S.-China economic conflict. But with its fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings report just around the corner, will NetEase turn things around? Source: Technically, the current momentum - or lack thereof - don't bode well. After trudging forward since hitting a low in September, NetEase stock lost traction earlier this month. Year-to-date, NTES shares are about 2% under parity, which isn't a great look for management. After all, they're trying to convince investors that the worst is behind them.However, recent news involving  (NASDAQ:  ) just might shake up NTES stock from its doldrums. For over a decade, Amazon attempted to crack the Chinese retail code but to little success. In 2016, the tech superstar managed to  of the Chinese commerce sector. Nearer-term data suggests things haven't changed that much.As a result, industry reports indicate that Amazon will merge its China-based import arm with  , a Chinese shopping platform. NTES owns Kaola, which potentially adds a new wrinkle to NetEase stock.That's because NetEase either leverages diversity or suffers from an identity crisis, depending on your perspective. While most folks primarily recognize NTES stock as an investment in Chinese video games, the underlying firm has a rich and storied history.Initially, NTES owned a successful news portal and email business. Later, it moved to video games and e-commerce via Kaola. At the same time, it's also operating music and anime-content streaming services, working with and conversely competing against  (OTCMKTS:  ).Merging with an Amazon-run business offers several synergies. But will investors find NetEase stock too complicated for its own good?While some analysts may find encouragement with the latest rumors, neither NetEase nor Amazon have confirmed them yet. More importantly, the investing public will likely seek tangible results from NTES stock. Unfortunately, this arena is where the gaming/e-commerce/streaming company has faltered.For Q4, the  for earnings per share calls for $10.20. This is decidedly on the higher end of individual forecasts, which ranges between $6.80 and $12.31. But the general optimism also has a flip-side: the markets expect management to deliver.In the year-ago quarter, NTES generated an EPS of $9.71, badly missing consensus EPS of $12.47. Upon disclosure, NetEase stock absorbed a sharp decline. It briefly recovered before skidding throughout most of last year.Since year-over-year EPS expectations fell, NetEase must put some meat on the table. Not doing so could reduce investor confidence in an already-challenging environment.On the revenue front, Wall Street's consensus estimate targets  . This forecast rests right in the middle of the spectrum, which ranges from $2.8 billion to $3 billion. In Q4 2017, the company rang up $2.2 billion.From outside appearances, NetEase should at least easily best the prior-year quarter's sales haul. But for stakeholders in NTES stock, they have a much higher standard. Between fiscal years 2014 and 2017, revenue growth averaged a whopping 64%. But more than likely in FY 2018, that growth will slow to a relative snail's pace.Even if Q4 sales hit the high end of $3 billion, annual growth for 2018 will slip sharply to under 25%. The issue then becomes that the more convoluted NetEase stock has become more expensive. That additional nominal growth has disproportionately decelerated earnings. Therefore, prospective buyers want to see justification for the premium.I don't want to give the impression that NTES stock is in danger of crumbling. Certainly, its positive fundamentals, such as a rock-solid balance sheet, will keep it in the game.But tech investors aren't interested in merely staying in the game: they want to see growth and lots of it. Unfortunately, the data suggests that the robust growth phase for NetEase stock has faded. Now, they're in a struggle with industry titans like Tencent and  (NYSE:  ).Of course, the Amazon rumor is a sentiment lift for the company. But in order to bolster its e-commerce arm, management must invest significant resources. Currently, NetEase generates most of its revenue from gaming. So to make an effective transition to e-commerce will likely incur serious expenses.Management could very well pull this off. However, investors have other options which don't carry such big question marks. Therefore, I'd wait before making any risky moves towards NTES ahead of Q4.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (Symbol: IEMG) where we have detected an approximate $92.4 million dollar inflow -- that's a 0.2% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 1,138,200,000 to 1,140,000,000).

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the NTES options chain for the new September 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $240.00 strike price has a current bid of $28.20. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $240.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $211.80 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of NTES, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $244.64/share today.Because the $240.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

The deal grants NetEase's music streaming unit, NetEase Cloud Music, access to CUBE's entire music catalog -- including \"sought-after albums and tracks from popular performers such as BTOB, CLC, PENTAGON, Yoo Seon-Ho and (G)I-DLE.\"NetEase's deal with CUBE complements several other similar partnerships with South Korea's top music companies -- including Big Hit Entertainment (which owns Korean boy band BTS's songs) and Loen Entertainment.Image source: Getty Images.NetEase claims that these deals are establishing NetEase Cloud Music as \"the go-to destination for Chinese fans of Korean music and entertainment.\" The company says that CUBE selected it as a partner for its \"proven copyright management capabilities\" and its \"large, demographically young user base.\" But will this deal help NetEase Cloud Music gain meaningful ground against  (NYSE: TME) , the top music streaming platform in China?NetEase asserts that NetEase Cloud Music has over 600 million registered users, but it's never disclosed the platform's number of monthly active users (MAUs). Tencent Music has over 800 million MAUs. In 2017, research firm DCCI estimated that NetEase controlled about 16% of China's music streaming market, compared to Tencent Music's 76% share.Tencent Music  by merging the music streaming platforms QQ Music, Kugou, and Kuwo with the karaoke platform WeSing into a single ecosystem. That dominance gives Tencent Music tremendous clout in negotiating licensing deals, and its listeners currently have access to over 20 million songs from over 200 domestic and international music labels.NetEase has a smaller library of about 10 million songs, but it's carved out several niche markets -- including independent artists  . The company recently shared that over 70,000 indie musicians have uploaded over 1.2 million songs to its platform.NetEase owns a majority stake in NetEase Cloud Music, and it reports revenue for the business under its \"E-mail and Others\" segment. Revenue from this segment rose 32% year over year and accounted for 8% of the company's total top line  , but it reported a negative gross margin -- mainly due to higher content licensing costs for NetEase Cloud Music.Image source: Getty Images.To offset some of those costs, NetEase allowed several investors -- including  and private equity firm General Atlantic -- to invest in the music unit, which raised $600 million in its latest funding round. During last quarter's , NetEase CFO Charles Yang stated that those investments \"set a stage for its potential spin-off IPO in the future.\"Such an IPO would be similar to  's (NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) IPO for Tencent Music or Baidu's IPO for  -- which reduced expenses for their parent companies. However, until that happens, investors will probably be left in the dark regarding NetEase Cloud Music's actual growth rates in MAUs, revenue, and profits.NetEase generates most of its revenue from online games (which provided 61% of its revenue last quarter) and its Kaola and Yanxuan e-commerce platforms (which provided 27% of total revenue). The problem is that both of those businesses are overshadowed by larger rivals. Tencent is the biggest online game maker in China, and  is the leader in the highly competitive e-commerce market.Therefore, NetEase faces a lot of pressure to expand its ecosystem to stay relevant. The company is pivoting away from the markets where it's weaker, like its online ads and digital comics businesses (which it  last year) to focus on the growth of more promising revenue streams like NetEase Cloud Music.Most of NetEase's music partnerships aren't exclusive, since record labels won't snub Tencent Music to work with its distant competitor. In fact, CUBE Entertainment granted Tencent Music a timed exclusive deal for its content in late 2016 that only expired last September -- so NetEase is merely gaining access to lots of songs that were already available on Tencent Music.Therefore, NetEase's deals with CUBE and other music labels will expand the appeal of its music platform, but they definitely won't help it gain significant ground against Tencent Music. Instead, NetEase's best bet would be to nurture the growth of its niche markets -- like EDM and indie music -- to widen its moat as it contemplates an IPO.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In late December, the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television (SAPPRFT) released a list of newly approved titles -- 80 in all -- the first such approvals since March of last year. An additional 84 games were given the green light this week. This brings an end to the freeze that has paralyzed China's once vibrant video game industry and left investors fearing the worst.While this is good news for gaming companies in China, the country's biggest video game publishers,  (NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) and  (NASDAQ: NTES) , failed to make the cut, with no games approved in the first two batches. Let's take a look back at what led to the shakeup and where it leaves investors today.China has resumed video game approvals. Image source: Getty Images.Last year was a tough one for the gaming industry in China, as a number of factors -- each more challenging than the last -- ground progress to a halt. The Chinese yuan fell against the dollar to levels not seen in nearly a decade, and the Shanghai Composite Index fell to multiyear lows as 2018 drew to a close, taken down by a slowing economy and the ongoing trade war between Washington, D.C., and Beijing.The biggest contributor to the industry woes, however, was a freeze on video game approvals by the Chinese government. The crackdown began early last year over growing concerns regarding the effects of violent content, myopia, and gaming addiction on children. The moratorium on new titles resulted in the slowest revenue growth for the industry in a decade and weighed heavily on both  and  , whose stocks fell 24% and 30%, respectively, in 2018.China shuffled the government departments responsible for reviewing video games early last year, while also making changes to the approval process. Previously, two departments shared the responsibility: The National Radio and Television Administration and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. Initial reports indicated that licenses hadn't been issued for months and the process of registering games was becoming more difficult, a result of a bureaucratic shakeup.Later reports indicated that SAPPRFT was formed in April and charged with oversight of the approval process. This agency is overseen by the publicity department of the Communist Party, signaling the increasing scrutiny of the Chinese government on the video game industry. Regulatory officials sought to \"implement controls on the total number of online video games, control the number of new video games operated online, explore an age-appropriate reminder system in line with China's national conditions, and take measures to limit the amount of time minors [spend on games].\"In early December, a newly formed committee -- the Online Games Ethics Committee -- began the process of evaluating new video game titles for approval. In a sign of tougher times ahead, the oversight group rejected nine games outright, while asking video game publishers of the remaining 11 titles to make changes to the games.Image source: Getty Images.Investors in Tencent and Netease shouldn't panic as local media reports indicate that the license approvals are being granted in the order they were received, so titles for China's two largest gaming companies likely are still be waiting to be reviewed. This process will take some time, as it's estimated that there are at least 7,000 games in the backlog. Given the size of the two batches of approvals granted thus far it isn't much of a surprise that the gaming behemoths weren't among the first to be approved.It seems to be only a matter of time before Tencent and Netease make the cut.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

During this period, WB stock has gone from $140 to $53.50.And even though tech stocks have attracted many buyers so far in 2019, Weibo hasn't followed that trend. This week, WB stock has plunged by about 10%.The main cause of the weakness this week was a downgrade of WB stock by  from \"buy\" to \"neutral.\" Nomura, whose downgrade was very late, coming after the huge decline of WB stock, also cut its price target on Weibo stock from $74 to $64.It's true that WB does face some legitimate issues. U.S.-Chinese relations continue to be dicey, as there is buzz that the negotiations between the nations are going sideways.In the meantime, the Chinese economy is decelerating. In Q4, its gross domestic product () grew by 6.4%, which was the slowest increase in 28 years. This is despite the fact that the Chinese government, using methods such as tax cuts and easier monetary policies, has been ramping up its efforts to stimulate the economy.Yet despite all this, I still think the selloff of WB stock has been overdone. The fact is that the company has built a solid digital platform. It's essentially the  (NYSE:  ) of China, but it's growing much more quickly than TWTR and has higher margins, giving WB stock an edge over Twitter stock.Consider Weibo's third-quarter results. The company's net revenues soared by  and its net income jumped by 63% to $165.3 million.Moreover, WB continues to show strong user growth. In Q4, 70 million net monthly active users were added, pushing its total MAUs to 446 million.A key part of Weibo's success is that it has been laser-focused on its core competency: allowing people to discover and share news. As a result, WB has benefited from strengthening engagement trends and increased overall popularity. WB also has a strong balance sheet, as it has about $1.6 billion in the bank.One good example of WB's strategy is its investment in improving advanced recommendation algorithms, which enable it to promote much more relevant trending topics and content. Another factor that has strengthened WB is its strong video platform. In an effort to further enhance its video offerings, WB has been focusing on live broadcasting, which has become quite popular with its users.Weibo will probably not be immune from the problems of the Chinese economy. Let's face it, when growth starts to slow down, the first area that companies look to spend less on is advertising.But Weibo stock still has a number of offsetting, positive catalysts. One such catalyst is the strong, continuous increase in the usage of digital platforms in China. In other words, companies will continue to spend more on internet ads, benefiting WB and, ultimately, WB stock.Secondly, the valuation of WB stock is certainly much more attractive now than it was six months ago, as its forward price-earnings multiple is now 17. It seems that a great deal of top-line pressure is already baked into WB stock at its current levels. What's more, Weibo stock is cheap compared to other Chinese internet companies like  (NYSE:  ), whose forward price-earnings multiple is 23, and  (NASDAQ:  ), which has a forward price-earnings multiple of 30.Granted, Weibo stock will likely continue to be volatile. But for investors looking for an interesting play on China - which has seen a steep drop in overall valuations - WB stock looks like a good choice.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["oday's session NASDAQ composite index advanced 361.44 points.

They should also focus on its recent restructuring, which better aligns its digital platform businesses to compete  .Tencent's gaming business also isn't out of options yet. The unit is still mulling investments in other high-growth gaming companies, like South Korea's Nexon, and expanding  to fresh overseas markets via the  Switch. Therefore, investors shouldn't fret over the approval process. The \"gaming winter\" forced Tencent to prioritize the growth of its other businesses, which should offset its declines in gaming revenues for the foreseeable future.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(NASDAQ: ATVI) issued a third-quarter earnings report in early November that fell below Wall Street's expectations, but the company still posted solid results overall. When a stock suddenly drops 38% in just three months, it's easy to assume the worst for a company, but Activision is still very profitable, generating over $7 billion in annual revenue, and is investing in promising growth initiatives.Now could be a great time to consider picking up shares of one of the leaders in a growing $138 billion industry. Let's take a look at three initiatives underway right now that could make a big difference in the company's fortunes going forward.Image source: Getty Images.While 2018 was the year of esports for Activision, next year may be the year the company's consumer products business takes off. Earlier in 2018, Activision  with top toy makers  and Lego to manufacture and distribute  -themed Nerf blasters and Lego sets.What's interesting about these partnerships is that Hasbro and Lego are currently struggling to grow. Both toy companies had a tough year due to the  . Hasbro's revenue was down 8% over the last year, while LEGO reported just 1% growth in revenue in the first half of 2018.Hasbro and Lego are leading toy brands that generate about $5 billion in annual revenue each. These companies want to spur new expansion, and they both see the popularity of Activision's  aiding their growth objectives in 2019. That says a lot about the brand relevancy of top video game franchises in the world of entertainment today. has become one of the key growth initiatives for Activision over the last few years. Things kicked off in a big way in 2018 with  . CEO Bobby Kotick believes esports will reach a similar scale as traditional sports. However,  League is just one cog in the wheel of the company's esports strategy.Activision is partnered with  (NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) to distribute a mobile version of  in China, which has the potential to be a big moneymaker for the company. Activision is taking \"the biggest action franchise of the last two decades to the largest gaming market in the world,\" as COO Coddy Johnson explained on the company's third-quarter conference call.Also, Blizzard recently announced  -- a mobile version of the classic PC franchise. The announcement at BlizzCon in early November received a hostile response from gamers, but the company sees an opportunity to reach a significant worldwide audience for this classic PC franchise. Blizzard is partnered with  (NASDAQ: NTES) , another top Chinese game company, to develop  for mobile devices.Both of these games could be very successful as esports titles. Mobile esports games have swelled in China, accounting for 24% of the top grossing titles on Android devices, according to industry researcher Newzoo. The company that dominates the Chinese mobile market is none other than Activision's partner -- Tencent.Tencent has successfully leveraged its popular social media platforms like WeChat to distribute titles to a Chinese audience that currently has an insatiable demand for video games. Tencent controls a 50% share of all mobile esports titles in China on Android devices and has a 63% share of mobile esports games on iOS. It's clear Tencent knows which games can be hits in the Chinese market, and that gives Activision a great opportunity and partner to grow its  franchise.Global spending on mobile games is a massive market, valued at $70 billion currently, more than double the revenue generated on PC and console. With graphics technology in tablets and smartphones achieving parity with gaming consoles, the mobile game industry should continue to dominate global spending on video games, and Activision is just now starting to tackle this market with its most prominent titles.Another critical piece of the puzzle with Activision Blizzard's mobile game strategy is in-game ads. King Digital Entertainment, which Activision acquired in 2016 for $5.9 billion, is the maker of  , one of the most popular mobile games of all time according to data from App Annie.King has been a very profitable segment for Activision. In the last quarter, King contributed $506 million in revenue and $184 million in operating income to consolidated results:\n  \nData source: Activision Blizzard.Management has discussed its digital advertising opportunity in the same breath as esports and in-game spending, which implies that it sees mobile ads as a significant growth driver. King has been gradually ramping up in-game ads for a segment of its player base this year. While ad revenue is still tiny relative to the company's total revenue, it grew 50% sequentially in the third quarter.King is using a form of in-game advertising called \"rewarded video,\" which offers players in-game content in exchange for watching an ad. Activision generated 57% of its revenue in 2017 from in-game spending. Rewarded video could become one of the primary ways the company monetizes its games, since players won't have to spend money. Long term, Activision has plans to introduce in-game ads throughout its titles. data by Activision stock has lost nearly half of its value in recent months, but this could represent a tangible buying opportunity. The company has generated $1.8 billion in free cash flow over the last year, which puts the stock's price-to-free-cash-flow ratio at 21. That's much more attractive than the 32 multiple the stock traded for just a few months ago. With expected growth from consumer products, mobile games, and advertising, Activision's current price offers a reasonable entry point into one of the top game makers in the world.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.NetEase and Bilibili generate most of their revenue from online games, but both companies are expanding their ecosystems with digital content like streaming media and online comics. NetEase's comics unit notably helped  's Marvel introduce its first group of Chinese superheroes back in May.Image source: Getty Images.61% of NetEase's revenues came from online games  . 27% came from its e-commerce platforms, 8% came from its email and \"other\" services (including comics and streaming music), and the remaining 4% came from online ads. However, the email and other services segment reported negative a gross margin last quarter.\n  \nGross profit margins, RMB basis. Data source: NetEase quarterly reports.NetEase attributed the unit's negative margin -- which represented a big drop from its positive gross margin of 13.1% a year earlier -- to higher content licensing costs for NetEase Cloud Music and other digital services.NetEase Cloud Music is the  music streaming platform in China after  (NYSE: TME) , which recently went public and plans to spend about 40% of its IPO proceeds expanding its music catalog. NetEase won't surrender this promising market to Tencent Music -- even though its rival controls about 75% of the online streaming market -- so it makes sense for NetEase to prune its less important digital assets, like online comics, to cut costs.Bilibili's online games accounted for 69% of its revenue  . 16% came from video broadcasts, 13% came from online ads, and the rest came from \"other\" businesses, which include a small e-commerce site for selling licensed and tie-in products.Image source: Bilibili.Bilibili is aggressively reducing its dependence on video games, which it believes will only account for about 50% of its revenue within three to five years. It also believes that serving up a wider variety of online content for Gen Z users -- which accounted for 82% of its 93 million monthly active users (MAUs) last quarter -- will help it remain relevant in a market dominated by bigger digital platforms.That's why Bilibili recently acquired a minority stake in Japanese animation studio  to expand its anime catalog and partnered with  (NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) to launch more streaming anime shows and new mobile games. Tencent also invested  to claim a 12% stake in Bilibili as part of the deal.In November, Bilibili launched an online comics app, but that market was already dominated by Tencent Comics and NetEase Comics. Earlier this month, Tencent claimed that its comics app had 120 million MAUs -- which was larger than Bilibili's entire user base -- while NetEase Comics reportedly had 40 million registered users.However, Bilibili's acquisition of NetEase's comic assets could help it catch up quickly, while Tencent's investment in Bilibili suggests that the two companies could share comic book licenses instead of competing against each other.This asset sale sounds like a win-win deal for NetEase and Bilibili, but it could benefit the former more than the latter. The deal could help NetEase cut costs, but it could cause Bilibili's operating expenses to rise. That's troubling, since Bilibili posted an adjusted net loss of 203 million RMB ($30 million) last quarter -- compared to a net loss of just 2.9 million RMB a year earlier.Bilibili's bet on online comics could pay off over the long term by locking in more Gen Z users.

The decline can be attributed to a slump in PC and smartphone gaming revenues.Moreover, sluggish VAS revenue growth (almost 55% of revenues) and unfavorable revenue mix hurt Tencent's results. The ongoing shift toward lower-margin smartphone games has been eating into VAS gross margin. Higher content cost of video streaming subscriptions also hurt profitability. These factors along with lower interest income from payment business dealt a major blow to the stock.Notably, Tencent has lost more than $200 billion in market value since its peak in January. Year to date, the stock has lost 27% compared with the S&P 500 Composite's decline of 4.7%.China is the world's largest video game market in terms of users (527 million) and revenues.

The held-up approval resulted in estimated revenue loss of almost $1.4 billion till October-end, according to SuperData Research,  by The Wall Street Journal.Further, in August, the Chinese Education Ministry announced plans to limit the number of online games and the amount of time kids spend playing on electronic devices.

The review pace is particularly encouraging as it is likely to help video game developers launch titles by the first half of 2019 instead of the earlier projection of mid-2019.It is also being speculated that the approval process will start again by the end of this year, helping companies cash in on the upcoming Lunar New Year, China's most celebrated season.China is the world's largest video game market in terms of users (527 million) and revenues. However, in the first half of 2018, revenues increased 5% to 105 billion yuan ($15 billion).

The halt in approval process resulted in an estimated revenue loss of almost $1.4 billion till October-end, according to SuperData Research,  by The Wall Street Journal.Some market observers believe that the halt in the approval process was a deliberate attempt by the government to hurt the video game industry's growth rate.

The Chinese internet giant has struggled as its bread-and-butter gaming business has  , while the rapid growth of the e-commerce business is hurting its bottom line. Additionally, the Chinese government's decision to freeze new video game approvals, which is expected to be in effect until early next year, has also slowed the company.But NetEase's third-quarter results show that it can fight all these odds. The company's top line  thanks to solid growth in online gaming and the e-commerce business. The results were good enough to boost the morale of NetEase investors as they now believe that the company can get back to its winning ways. The company is headed in the right direction, but its path toward growth is still bumpy. Here's why.Image source: Getty Images.NetEase gets 60% of its total revenue from the online gaming business, so the 27.6% annual growth in this segment was one of the biggest drivers behind the company's impressive growth. But even more impressive was that NetEase managed to do it despite the adverse regulatory environment in China.The company credits the diversity and longevity of its gaming portfolio. Its flagship titles performed steadily last quarter as the company enriched them with new content, and it will look to build on their popularity with newer iterations. What's more, NetEase's online gaming gross margin increased 260 basis points year over year thanks to the improved contribution from PC client games, which carry a higher margin profile.Moreover, NetEase's mobile gaming  on the back of its expansion into international markets and the popularity of its existing titles. The company's focus on improving the gamer experience with new expansion packs allows it to keep a handle on development costs, as it doesn't have to make new games from scratch. The same applies to the international markets, in which NetEase can localize the content of its existing games.The only problem is that the online gaming business could be hamstrung because of the Chinese government's regulations. The freeze on new video game licenses led to single-digit growth in the country's gaming market in the first half of 2018. That's a far cry from the 31% growth seen last year. And it won't be surprising to see the pain continue in the short run, as the country is taking longer than expected to implement new licensing procedures.And in a bid to cut down on childhood myopia, China is also considering a limit on new game licenses that it issues. NetEase's online gaming business could run into some problems because of government regulations. But the company's move into international markets is helping it beat the domestic slowdown, as the latest results show, indicating that NetEase is ready with an alternative to overcome any potential weakness in China.NetEase's e-commerce business has been growing at a terrific pace. Revenue from this segment was up 67% year over year, accounting for just over 26% of the company's total top line. For comparison, NetEase was getting 21% of its total revenue from the e-commerce business a year ago. However, this growth is coming at a cost.The company's margins in e-commerce are extremely thin compared with the bread-and-butter gaming business. Its e-commerce gross margin stood at just 10% last quarter, versus the 65% for online gaming. This isn't surprising -- e-commerce in China is very competitive, so NetEase is rapidly raising its expenses in this area to grab a greater share of the pie.Its e-commerce cost of revenue shot up nearly 70% annually in the latest quarter, outpacing the segment's top-line growth. But then, investors shouldn't forget that the Chinese e-commerce market is  . If NetEase can eke out enough of a share, it should be able to maintain sales growth momentum on the back of higher volumes.That's the only way NetEase can grow its earnings and beat the thin e-commerce margins, so it is taking steps to boost sales. The company recently struck a deal with a global shipping company to bolster the transportation and logistics of its Kaola e-commerce brand. The company believes that the deal will allow it to reduce delivery times and boost cross-border trade.This is the latest in a series of steps by NetEase to go after this massive opportunity in China, especially the country's appetite for foreign goods. Kaola has already announced that it will purchase $20 billion worth of foreign goods in the coming years. On top of that, the company is going to increase its warehousing space by 80%, and boost the coverage of its overnight delivery service to 70% of Chinese customers.There's no doubt that NetEase is sitting on some solid catalysts, but there will be growing pains. The e-commerce business needs to gain enough scale in order to make a meaningful contribution toward NetEase's earnings. Meanwhile, the online gaming business seems to be back on track thanks to overseas growth.In all, NetEase's earnings power will improve gradually, provided its top line keeps growing at a solid pace, and that's exactly what consensus estimates suggest. The company is expected to clock stronger revenue growth in 2019, which will boost its earnings after a tepid performance this year. That being the case, NetEase is capable of delivering upside and continuing its resurgence despite the headwinds.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Shares now trade down roughly 17% year to date. Part of that performance is related to the market's recent pullback, but there are also some important issues that the business has to address. data by Activision Blizzard's recent third-quarter results weren't thrilling, with the company delivering year-over-year declines in sales and earnings and news that monthly active users (MAUs) across its titles had fallen once again. The mediocre performance arrived after the company  that was roundly rejected by fans of the series. The stock is down roughly 26% in November as of this writing.Image source: Activision Blizzard.The third quarter saw Activision Blizzard's revenue decline 12% year over year to $1.51 billion, and earnings per share fell from $0.47 to $0.42. Perhaps most worrying, the company's MAUs declined to 345 million, versus 385 million in the prior-year period and 352 million MAUs in this year's second quarter. The company's declining MAU base is an issue that  .The gaming giant's monthly-active-user base has declined roughly 30% over the last two years. Much of that atrophy stems from King Digital's mobile games shedding players, but the migration of users actually hasn't had a big impact on overall performance because the core audience of  has continued to spend. However, there is evidence that some Activision and Blizzard franchises are losing momentum, and that puts pressure on developers to create new, successful properties in addition to substantial updates for existing games and breakthrough new releases in existing franchises.While the third-quarter results were disappointing, investors should also keep in mind that Activision Blizzard's performance in a given period can face uneven comparisons depending on the company's release schedule. This tendency has been reduced somewhat by the video game industry's focus on driving in-game purchases (helping to smoothing out revenues between game releases), but it can still be a factor in skewed comparisons.It's worth mentioning that the company released  in last year's September quarter, while its biggest releases in this year's third quarter were expansion packs for  and  . Expansions can still drive big sales, but these are franchises that appear to be waning --  because the game is nearly 15 years old, and  because it hasn't lived up to hype and fan expectations.The backdrop of declining users and aging franchises does make the reception for the company's most recently unveiled game more concerning.  debuted at the company's BlizzCon conference about a week before the publisher reported its third-quarter earnings, and to say that the game hasn't won fans over would be an understatement. The mobile game's reveal received a broadly negative response because hard-core series fans were expecting a PC game. Fans were also disappointed that the mobile title is being developed in conjunction with Chinese developer  .Whether or not the title goes on to be a success,  will go down as having one of the most controversial game reveals ever. In that context, it's understandable that  's flubbed debut caused shares to dip roughly 7% in the day of trading following the reveal. It's also not unreasonable to think that the response might have worsened the stock's post-earnings sell-offs. Investors are looking for new products that can expand the company's active user base, and the loudest feedback on its next potential growth engine is overwhelmingly negative. However, the negative response to the game's unveiling doesn't necessarily mean that the title won't be a success.Activision Blizzard's growth is slowing as some of its core franchises are losing steam, and that highlights the possibility that efforts to reenergize existing games and launch new properties will fall short. However, the company still has a lineup of gaming franchises that compares very favorably against its industry competitors. It also has a talented collection of development studios and a commendable history of launching new properties, so there are good reasons to have confidence in the company's ability to navigate many of the issues at hand.Devoting more energy and resources toward bringing some of its existing franchises to mobile could be controversial, but it's a move that has the potential to pay off in big ways. Mobile represents the world's largest and fastest-growing gaming platforms and offers the potential to accelerate growth in markets like China and India. As the reaction to  demonstrates, it will be important that Activision Blizzard delivers high-quality products on mobile and continues to deliver fresh content for its console and PC-based gaming audiences. But concerns that the company is out of touch with its market appear to be misplaced.The company's stock declines following the reveal of  and the publishing of disappointing user-base declines highlight some key challenges ahead. However, Activision Blizzard still looks poised to benefit from the industry's ongoing shift to digital distribution, growth for in-game purchases, and expanding overall demand for gaming content. The company also looks uniquely well positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities like  and augmented reality.After recent sell-offs, Activision Blizzard stock trades at roughly 20 times this year's expected earnings. For risk-tolerant investors willing to embrace possible volatility, that's a valuation that leaves room for substantial upside over the long term.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

However, NetEase also rebounded more than 10% over the past month, and the company posted solid third-quarter numbers that easily beat analyst expectations.But will that recovery last through 2019? Let's take a closer look at NetEase's core businesses to find out.Image source: Getty Images.NetEase generated 61% of its revenue from online games last quarter. Its e-commerce platforms (Kaola and Yanxuan) were responsible for 27% of it, 8% came from email and other services, and the remaining 4% came from its online advertising business. Here's how those four businesses fared over the past year.\n  \nYear-over-year revenue growth, RMB terms. Data source: NetEase quarterly reports.NetEase attributed the recovery of its gaming business to the popularity of internally developed mobile titles like  ,  and  ; as well as popular PC games like  and  . NetEase currently publishes four of the top 10 highest-grossing iOS games in China, according to App Annie, while its rival  (NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) publishes the remaining six.Those games were all approved prior to the  , which could last until the first half of 2019. Mobile games accounted for 68% of NetEase's online gaming revenue during the quarter.NetEase's e-commerce growth, primarily supported by the explosive growth of its off-price marketplace Yanxuan, is decelerating. However, investors should note that Yanxuan uses a  of selling \"identical\" unbranded versions of pricier products -- which leaves it vulnerable to crackdowns on counterfeit goods.Image source: Getty Images.The growth of NetEase's email and other business is buoyed by the growth of  , the second largest music streaming platform in China after Tencent Music. However, its advertising business remains weak due to intense competition from market leaders like Tencent and  (NASDAQ: BIDU) .The growth of NetEase's core business units looks solid, but only the gaming business' gross margin improved year over year.\n  \nGross profit margins, RMB basis. Data source: NetEase quarterly reports.NetEase's e-commerce margin contracted as it used bigger discounts to expand Kaola and Yanxuan, while its email and other margin dropped as it paid higher content licensing costs for NetEase Cloud Music. Its advertising margin contracted on higher staff expenses and content acquisition costs.NetEase's operating expenses also rose a whopping 60% annually to 5.4 billion RMB ($792 million) as it expanded its businesses. This caused its operating margin to contract from 20.4% to 12.5%, and for its non-GAAP net income to decline 23% annually.That's troubling when we compare NetEase's operating margin to the margins of Tencent,  (NYSE: BABA) , and Baidu, which lead China's gaming, e-commerce, and advertising markets, respectively.\n  \nData source: Quarterly reports.NetEase is the underdog in all three markets, but it has lower margins than the market leaders. If it aggressively boosts its spending to keep pace with the market leaders, its earnings could continue to decline. That's why analysts expect NetEase's revenue to rise 25% this year, but for its earnings to fall 42%.NetEase faces uphill battles in 2019, its expenses are rising, and the stock isn't cheap, at nearly 30 times forward earnings. I think Chinese tech stocks will eventually rebound, but I'd stick with market leaders like Tencent, Alibaba, and Baidu instead of this unbalanced underdog.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

NetEase's results were mixed, but investors were happy that rising sales growth pointed to a potential recovery in the future.Image source: NetEase.NetEase's third-quarter results continued the trends of higher sales but lower earnings that the video game company has seen  . Revenue was higher by 35% as measured in renminbi, working out to $2.45 billion and accelerating from the company's 22% growth rate during the second quarter. Once again, though, adjusted net income was down, falling 25% and working out to $328.9 million. That translated to adjusted earnings of $2.55 per share, which was $0.04 better than the consensus forecast among investors.From a segment perspective, NetEase got significant sales contributions from most of its business units. The online game revenue division saw its growth bounce back from sluggish levels earlier in the year, posting a 28% gain in revenue that translated into a 33% rise in gross profit. E-commerce continued to provide even greater growth for the company, with a 67% sales gain that sent gross profit up by 46%. E-mail and other services boosted segment sales by 32%, but advertising services managed to pick up just 2% in its top line, and neither of those two areas fared well in terms of gross profit growth.NetEase pointed to several factors driving its results. Mobile game revenue actually fell as a percentage of total revenue, coming in at 68% versus nearly 75% three months ago. However, self-developed mobile games continued to push gross profit for the unit higher, and the Kaola and Yanxuan websites pushed e-commerce results higher. However, more expensive licensing fees kept weighing on the other-business segment, especially related to the NetEase Cloud Music platform.Operating expenses kept soaring as well, coming in 60% higher than year-earlier figures. Marketing costs, research and development investment, and overhead expenses were all markedly higher from the same period a year ago, and tax rates soared as well.CEO William Ding kept his eyes on the future. \"While the performances from our flagship titles remain remarkably steady,\" Ding said, \"we are innovators at our core, [and] NetEase is one of the very few companies that has consistently created distinct new game IP for both PC-client and mobile platforms.\" The CEO also pointed to international expansion efforts as instrumental to the company's long-term prospects.One of the biggest wins that NetEase claimed was its collaboration with  (NASDAQ: ATVI) on the new  role-playing game. That's been a controversial move, with  for restricting the latest release in the popular series to mobile platforms rather than launching a PC-based version as well. Nevertheless, Ding believes that the move will result in \"increasing our visibility and expanding our foothold in the global online games market.\"NetEase's latest dividend reflected the company's policy of tying payouts to earnings. Investors will receive $0.45 per share in their third-quarter payment.

But what happens when a game's unveiling goes wrong? What happens when dedicated fans of a franchise or developer almost unanimously reject what's on display?There aren't universal answers to those questions, but the reaction to  's (NASDAQ: ATVI) latest game is a case study in how this scenario can play out and has to be one of the most negative reactions to a game in recent memory. The company revealed  , a mobile installment in a famously PC-centric series, at its recent BlizzCon conference -- and intense fan reaction helped send the company's share price 7% lower in the day of trading that followed. Should shareholders be concerned that the company is losing touch with its audience?Image source: Getty Images.There's no sugarcoating the  fan base's outright rejection of  . As of this writing, the game's cinematic reveal trailer has over 570,000 downvotes compared to just over 21,000 upvotes on YouTube. The title's first gameplay trailer hasn't fared much better on the platform, showing just 15,000 upvotes compared to 223,000 downvotes. With that kind of reaction from fans, it's safe to say that  had the worst-received reveal of a Blizzard game ever -- and the company's subsequent stock performance shows that shareholders are worried about how the game has been received.  has always been a PC-focused franchise and the Blizzard division a PC-focused developer -- and franchise enthusiasts were expecting the series' next big evolution to come to their preferred platform. Rubbing salt in the wound, the game isn't being created solely by Blizzard -- Chinese company  (NASDAQ: NTES) actually handled most of the game's development.Blizzard had been dropping hints for months that the  franchise would be heavily featured at this year's BlizzCon. Fans naturally assumed that this meant that a sequel to  was soon to be revealed, and excitement started building in enthusiast communities to the extent that the company actually felt compelled to come out and say that a new, mainline series installation would not be revealed at the event. Of course, such denials are par for the course even when a big reveal is on the way, and this did little to reduce expectations.Fans are also upset that the game appears to use resources from another NetEase game.  is built on the same engine as the Chinese company's game  , and while the two titles feature different art styles and content, comparing them reveals game design and visual similarities. Some of that is down to NetEase's game being heavily inspired by  , but critics aren't necessarily wrong in suggesting that corners were cut in bringing the franchise to mobile. The partnership with  also makes it clear that the game is being built with the Chinese market in mind and has some fans concerned that  won't stay true to the franchise's roots or quality standards.Blizzard has a reputation for being one of the best production houses in the gaming industry, while NetEase has recently come to be known for making passable but often unremarkable variations on other companies' games in order to capitalize on popular trends. Many PC gamers already look down on the types of simplified gameplay experiences common on mobile, and it's not surprising that farming much of  's development out to an unpopular company has not inspired confidence.Image source: Activision Blizzard. represents a step in the right direction when it comes to getting some of the company's big franchises represented on mobile, even if it winds up not providing the perfect blueprint for that push. The people most informed about  seem broadly negative on the title, but there are plenty of people who don't know about the game or who are less sensitive to the ways it will diverge from the core franchise and who might love it upon release.If  delivers a solid experience, it should be able to win over some of its current critics. More importantly for shareholders, it should have a strong shot at pleasing an even wider audience. The partnership with NetEase should have the effect of making the game easy to release in China, the world's biggest mobile market, and there's significant promise in the idea of a more casual-friendly take on the franchise formula. The game won't have the depth that  enthusiasts have come expect, and it's not going to live up to the standard set by the mainline series. However,  still has a better than 50-50 shot of being a success in the mold of other hit mobile games.If  provides a fun multiplayer experience that's easy to pick up and play and has enough substance to keep users coming back, the initial reaction to the title won't stop it from being a hit. Regardless of its having been built on NetEase's existing engine, it's graphically impressive for a mobile game, and it's got the  franchise's interesting aesthetic and setting to work with. Given that much of the development is being handled by NetEase and that the game is being built on some preexisting resources, it's also likely the game will be solidly profitable even if it doesn't go on to be a huge hit.In addition to the possibility that an individual release will underperform, one of the big risks with any franchise installment is that it will damage the broader property. Even an entertainment release that's commercially successful in its own right can  if it causes audiences to sour on future releases. Thankfully, there's not a big risk that  will cause fans of the mainline series to abandon the broader property. A sequel to  is almost certainly in development -- and some sources even suggest that an announcement for a new mainline installment was pulled from this year's BlizzCon late in the conference's planning stages.The more concerning possibility is that  isn't the optimal vehicle to bring the franchise to mobile, which could have a negative impact on interest in future installments for the platform. However, even if  doesn't win over gamers, Blizzard could probably rectify potential shortcomings by delivering a high-quality follow-up.The reaction to Activision Blizzard's new game has been undeniably negative, but the subsequent sell-offs appear to be misguided.

Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that all percentages are based on Renminbi. With that said, I will deliver opening remarks on William's behalf. We are very pleased to report another strong quarter with total revenues up 35% year-over-year. Each of our primary business lines continues to grow, supported by our loyal community of users and our strong R&D team that strives to bring best-in-class games and Internet services to both users in China and internationally.Total revenues for our online games in the third quarter stood at RMB10 billion for the second consecutive quarter and we are confident that this trend is sustainable. In addition to our growing catalog of games and world class R&D capabilities, our online games portfolio is more diversified than ever before. We now operate numerous games that span a wide variety of genres both domestically and internationally, as well as games that appeal to both PC and mobile players.Through this diverse catalog, we can appeal to a multitude of players and interest levels worldwide. With the introduction of new games and our work in mobile has propelled our success in recent years. Our flagship titles remain remarkably steady. In the third quarter, Fantasy Westward Journey and Westward Journey series enjoyed another quarter of year-over-year growth, driven by the popularity of new expansion packs released over the summer.Some of our newer titles released in recent years share this type of longevity, such as Invincible, Onmyoji, Knives Out and Identity V just to name a few. The remarkable longevity of these games is attachment to NetEase unique skill set and ability to operate games successfully over long periods of time. Very few companies globally kind of test this type of endurance in online games through different economic cycles and NetEase is proud to be among these prestigious ranks.The value of our most popular games reaches far beyond the titles themselves. After years of operation, these games have accumulated huge fan bases, turning them into very powerful IP. Each self developed IP has the potential to become its own sustainable franchise with potential to diversify beyond just online games. One good example of this is with one of our most recognizable games Fantasy Westward Journey. This IP has been in successful operation for 16 years translating across PC and mobile platforms and sustaining interest with continuous expansion packs and new content. A cartoon series based on this IP has been airing on CCTV since October this year in a recent report published by a renowned domestic think tank, Liaowang Institute Fantasy Westward Journey is ranked the sixth most valuable IP in China's entertainment sector.We are now looking to develop another iteration of this IP on mobile, Fantasy Westward Journey 3D, scheduled for launch in 2019. This pipeline game will be realized as a real time MMO in 3D format and reserve the classic game play and social system, while bringing in brand new experiences to mobile users in a 3D world. In addition to our ability to maintain a strong existing portfolio, NetEase is also one of the very few companies in the world that has consistently created distinct new game IP for both PC client and mobile platforms. A few recent titles that fit this profile are our PC client game, Justice, that we launched at the end of June, mobile game Ancient Nocturne which we launched at the beginning of September and mobile game Night Falls: Survival, which we launched in early November.For Justice, we recently launched a new expansion pack, which contains a sophisticated set of social systems including faction systems, marriage systems, brotherhood, et cetera, all of which help to produce and solidify an active and deeply integrated user community. This in turn creates another powerful IP for NetEase. On the mobile side, Ancient Nocturne is a innovative mix of role playing and collectible card games. The story line was written by our in-house team of producers, with a dedicated effort toward promoting Chinese culture and Asians mythology. Ancient Nocturne was featured by the iOS app store and shortly after its release it climbed to the top of the iOS growth in charting China.Night Falls: Survival was launched in early November and became an instant hit. The game is in original cooperative survival RPG setting a doomsday world. This game took us almost three years of in-house R&D effort. Upon release, this innovative game play immediately impressed the market and Night Falls: Survival quickly became the number one downloaded game on the iOS app store and monetization is also ramping up smoothly. Some of our other new titles launched in the third quarter include Butterfly Sword and Fever Basketball, both launches further diversify the genres we offer in our mobile game portfolio. These games also received positive feedback in their respective categories.For Minecraft in just over a year, we now have attracted over 150 million registered users in China, most of them being K-12 students. Minecraft is great strategic importance to us as it gives us access to a much younger demographic that we never had before. We consider Minecraft an educational asset that stimulates children's creativity, promotes traditional culture and allow them to explore different types of Arts and Sciences. In many schools and universities, Minecraft is also used for teaching purposes. For example, students in 19 University of Aeronautics and Astronautics uses our game in their classes to explore the mysteries of the universe. More recently, Minecraft hosted a science fair in partnership with NASDAQ China using the game to raise public interesting in understanding outer space.We continue to welcome talented and imaginative developers to create more interesting play modules that inspire our younger users. As of today we have more than 2,000 third party developers on our platform. For many of these kids, Minecraft is the first game that they were exposed to and we take a heightened approach to our social responsibility with new content for this target audience. As with all our games, we take very proactive measures to monitor the time spent and money spent by our users to ensure sustainable growth of our games business.Moving onto our overseas expansion effort. We are taking a much more global approach to our online games business. We see axle and overseas opportunities to expand our brand and extend our games outreach to a global audience. In the third quarter we took this a step further and for the first time in our company's history, our overseas games revenue accounted for more than 10% of our total games net revenue.Our success in Japan has been widely witnessed. Knives Out has consistently ranked among the top five games on Japan's iOS revenue grossing chart. We continue to add more localized content to broaden and deepen our geographic footprint in this important market. In August, we introduced some iconic content with Attack on Titan, a popular Japanese Anime/Manga series. This in game collaboration gained overwhelming popularity among users and in October Knives Out reached the People's Choice Award by Google Play in Japan and Taiwan.Similarly, Identity V was ranked number one on the iOS downloads chart in Japan for 18 consecutive days and was featured by iOS app stores in 50 countries. Out of the three largest online games markets in the world, we now have reached critical claiming two being China and Japan. The United States market is the next frontier for Netease. Earlier this month, Blizzard Entertainment announced that we are collaborating to develop Diablo Immortal. We are very proud that Blizzard has chosen us to help bring one of their largest game franchise to mobile. We consider this is a huge opportunity to show the world and particularly Western gamers, Netease' strong R&D capabilities.Turning to our e-commerce business. This continues to be our fastest growing business segment. In the third quarter, revenues from our e-commerce business grew 67% year-over-year, well outpacing the industry average. While this business is rapidly expanding, we are conscious of our margin profile. We maintained a disciplined approach to spending and our gross margins were capped at 10% in the third quarter. We continue to look for efficiency enhancement particularly with supply chain integration and fulfillment solution upgrade.We recently signed a contract with global shipping giant Maersk to support and improve Kaola's global transportation and logistics services. With this agreement in place, we expect deliveries of overseas procurement to be more timely and for Kaola's cross border logistics to be more smoothly. Kaola and Yanxuan are complementary components of our e-commerce ambitions. Kaola is a platform and Yanxuan is our private label brand. We continue to focus on running a one key e-commerce business model built on our differentiated approach and strong consumer recognition. For Kaola, our goal is to bring the best brands across the world to Chinese consumers who are looking for quality and authenticity in their purchases.At the very China International Import Expo that took place in Shanghai last week, the government shared its intention to encourage import's trade increase consumer confidence, reduce tariff and promote cross border e-commerce. Over the next 15 years, China is expected to import over USD400 trillion goods and services from overseas, which means a growing number of brands from all over the world will benefit from this trend. At the Expo, we connected with a great number of internationally renowned brand committing purchase agreements totaling approximately RMB20 billion.Additionally, we signed strategic partnership upgrade agreements with Chem Brand including Xenon, Nestle, Swift and Sanofi which will give our users better access to their product and in turn further strengthen our competitive advantage as a global supply chain provider. Under the long-term strategic support of Kaola, some of our partners have achieved better than expected revenue growth in the third quarter, such as Rossmann, one of Germany's largest health and beauty chains and Woolworth, Australians grocery chain. On Yanxuan side, we pioneered innovative e-commerce business model in China. We are responsible for the designing of our products with dedication to the aesthetics, style, material and craftsmanship of each item that we offer. We work with carefully selected manufacturers to produce the product we design and offer these more affordable, yes, high quality items to our consumers.On the design side, we are partnering with more art institutions that supply us with our regional ideas. We're also bringing products designed by independent designers from both China and overseas. On the manufacturing side, after two years of hard work, we now work with over 500 manufacturers, each of which is top ranked in their own field. Going forward, we plan to take a more concentrated approach and focus on working with the very best partners possible.Moving onto our other steady businesses that help to put NetEase on the map and continue to support our growth. Our advertising services revenue in the third quarter increased by approximately 2% year-over-year to RMB644 million or USD94 million, with Internet services, automobile and real estate sectors as the top performing verticals. Net revenues from our email and others businesses were RMB1.4 billion or USD204 million in the third quarter, with a year-over-year increase of 32%. We see tremendous value in many of our incubated businesses. NetEase Cloud Music and Youdao are just a few of these business lines with initiatives under way that are yet to be fully realized.

I will now provide a very brief overview and review of our third quarter 2018 financial results, given the limited time on today's call, I will be presenting some abbreviated financial highlight. We encourage you to read through our press release issued earlier today for further details.Net revenues for the third quarter of 2018 were RMB16.9 billion or UDS2.5 billion. This compares with RMB16.3 billion and RMB12.5 billion for the preceding quarter and third quarter of 2017 respectively. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter increases were driven by revenue growth across all business segments. Net revenues from online games increased by approximately 28% year-over-year, due to strong performance from both PC client games and mobile games, such as Justice, Fantasy Westward Journey Online, Chu Liu Xiang, Knives Out and Identify V. Mobile games accounted for approximately 68% of net revenues for this quarter, compared with 75% and 68% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of last year.Our gross profit for the third quarter of 2018 was RMB7.5 billion or USD1.1 billion, compared to RMB7.2 billion and USD5.9 billion for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017 respectively. Our gross profit for online games segment increased year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter as a result of increase in revenue. Gross margin for our online games improved to 65% in the third quarter compared with 64% in the preceding quarter and 63% a year ago. The quarter-over-quarter increase in gross profit margin was mainly due to increased revenue contribution from PC client games, which have relatively higher gross profit margins, the mobile games.The year-over-year increase was due to increasing revenue. During the third quarter, gross profit for our e-commerce business increased due to the expansion of both Kaola and Yanxuan. Gross profit margin for our e-commerce business was 10% in the third quarter compared with 10% and 11.5% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017 respectively.We strive to keep a disciplined balance of rapid top line growth and steady gross profit margin for our e-commerce business. Gross profit margin for advertising services for the third quarter of 2018 was 64%, this compares with 67% and 68% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2017 respectively. The decreases were mainly due to higher staff related cost and content purchase expenditures. Gross profit, gross loss margin for our email and others business for the third quarter was 3%. This compares to gross loss margin of 7% last quarter and gross profit margin of 13% for the third quarter of 2017 respectively.The year-over-year decrease in gross margin was primarily due to decreased revenue contribution from certain online platform businesses which have relatively higher gross profit margins, as well as higher licensed music content costs related to our Cloud Music businesses in the third quarter. The quarter-over-quarter improvement was primarily due to higher revenue contribution from certain online platform businesses with relatively higher margins in this quarter.As we have mentioned before, our other businesses include many promising inculpated businesses such as Youdao, Cloud Music and CC live broadcasting among others. Many of these businesses are undergoing an investment phase as they require up-front spending to acquire content and talent. We believe their upside potential in the long-term will more than justify our current investment. Gross margin will continue to improve as we further expand our scale. Total operating expenses for the third quarter of 2018 were RMB5.4 billion or USD792.1 million. This compares to RMB4.9 billion and USD3.4 billion for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of last year.The year-over-year increase in operating expenses were mainly due to increased staff related cost, R&D investments and marketing expenditures. The quarter-over-quarter increase were mainly due to headcount expansion during the summer recruitment season and our GNN expense included a bad debt provisions relating to advertising business.e-commerce related shipping and handling costs included in selling and marketing expenses for the third quarter were RMB385.5 million or USD56.1 million 8.6% of the net revenues from e-commerce businesses, which is an improvement from 8.9% in the preceding quarter and 11.1% in the third quarter of last year.Effective tax rate for this quarter was 34.2%, compared to 15.7% and 8.1% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of last year. The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter changes in the effective tax rate were mainly due to certain subsidiaries of ours that received tax credits recognizing different period, as well as the expansion of some of our loss-making subsidiaries. As we have discussed on prior calls, we expect the effective tax rate for 2018 on an annual basis to be in the high 20's and the effective tax rate will grow higher in 2019. Our net income attributable to shareholders for the third quarter was RMB1.6 billion or USD232.4 million. This compares to RMB2.1 billion and USD2.5 billion for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of last year.Non-GAAP net income attributable to our shareholders for this quarter totaled RMB2.3 billion or USD328.9 million. This compares to RMB2.7 billion and USD3.0 billion for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of last year. For this quarter, our diluted earnings per ADS were RMB12.43 or USD1.81. Our non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS were RMB17.50 or USD2.55 respectively.Our cash position remains strong. As of September 30th 2018, our total cash and cash equivalents current and noncurrent time deposit and short-term investment balance totaled RMB42.6 billion or USD6.2 billion. This compares with RMB43.2 billion as of the end of last year. Returning value to our shareholders remains a top priority.For this quarter, we plan to pay a dividend of 45% per ADS, representing 25% of the net income attributable to our shareholders. Under our current share repurchase program, which began on November 16, 2017 and the amendment announced on June 11, 2018 authorizing a total repurchase amount up to USD2 billion. We had repurchased approximately 4.5 million ADS for approximately USD1.2 billion as of September 30. Immediately upon the expiration of the current plan, our Board has approved a new share repurchase program for up to USD1 billion of our outstanding ADS for the next 12 months, beginning November 16, 2018.Thank you for your attention. We would like now to open the call to your questions. Operator. Please go ahead.Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Thomas Chong with Credit Suisse. -- Hi. Thanks, management for taking my questions and congratulations on the solid set of result. My first question is about the online gaming business, in particular recent cooperation with Blizzard, can you share a bit of -- more details about the timing of the launch of the new games, the revenue sharing ratio. And more importantly, do we expect to co-develop other new games in the future? And my second question is about, sorry, directly to the environment, how we should think about the online games outlook in 2019? Thank you. -- (foreign language) -- (foreign language) -- Okay. Let me translate the answers for William. So, on the Blizzard cooperation as you all know, our time proven collaboration is almost a decade long, with very, very pleasant partnership with Blizzard, bringing in great experiences to Chinese gamers their titles. And the collaboration on the Diablo mobile game is just another strong testament to the great partnership. We expect if everything goes on smoothly that the mobile game of Diablo Immortal will be launched globally next year.And regarding your second question on regulatory environment, so first of all, we believe the government's intention to regulate and make that game segment overall as a healthy and sustainable segment and we fully understand and support the government intention. China is the fastest growing and is also now the largest game market in the world and throughout the fast development, there are also certain issues emerging for instance undesired impact on minors, inappropriate content, et cetera. But in the longer-term, the regulators intention is really to promote online game segment as a format of entertainment educational asset, as well as to promote creativity in cultural innovation. So in the longer term, the government is fully supportive of developing online games industry in healthy and sustainable manner.Thank you, Thomas. -- Operator, next question, please.We will then take our next question from Eddie Leung with Merrill Lynch. -- Thank you for taking my questions. Management has mentioned that we have accumulated a large base of users. And there are more and more repetitions as far as content available to these users. So I'm just curious, how many of them actually are using multiple services or consuming multiple content on NetEase and how is that ration trending? And how management can encourage different business units to cooperate and hopefully get the users to have more NetEase, so this is.And then just a separate question on regulation on games. Could you remind us how many of your games in your pipeline already obtained the ISBN approval. Thank you. -- Eddie, can you translate your question in Mandarin, we didn't really get your question. -- (foreign language) -- Okay, thank you. Eddie. So you've translated the first question and I will translate your second question to William. (foreign language) Eddie, I will answer your first question. So first of all, we do not disclose user specific metrics to our different lines of businesses. But having said that, as you know, NetEase now has evolved into a much more diversified franchise more than just game company. So definitely users of NetEase products and services are enjoying the more and more content, premium content and elevated user experiences from the NetEase overall brand.We do not have the specific metrics to evaluate the overlap, but we think the overlap should be a significant ratio because after all users in different verticals they want to simply use the very best products and services they can find in the market. And as some of you may know, earlier this month, we have experimented a VIP membership program which upon purchase of the membership you will get a lot of membership benefit across different lines of our products, games, e-commerce music, et cetera. So that is also a measure to promote a kind of a cross experience of different product and services to our user base.(foreign language) -- (foreign language) -- (foreign language)So, Eddie to answer your second question, Netease is never a name to compete based on quantity of games. As you know, the games that we launched the top priority to emphasis is always premium quality, best in class experiences we provide to the users. So for the next quarter -- for next year, we are very optimistic about the rich pipeline that we are going to bring differentiated contents to the users. So all in all, it is not a game about quantity, but rather it is the quality of the games and the user experience upon the release of our games. As you can see we've been quite active and bringing in newer games throughout 2018, we think the trend will continue into 2019.We'll move next to Alicia Yap with Citi. -- Hi. Good morning, management. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two quick questions. Number one is that, with recent external funding for NetEase music, could you share with us the strategic thinking about this music business, does that mean we could try to use these funding to offset some of the cash need for the business and NetEase turn to separately spin-off the music business in the future, what is the competitive landscape given the dominant positions from Tencent music, will these be any special value proposition that NetEase music attract users to come over or do you think users actually will be using both NetEase and Tencent music platform?So second question just very quickly that on the online games revenue, we have been keeping the promise that we're actually able to achieve the quarterly run rate of RMB10 billion, so should we actually expect these growth to maintain and that we will keep these quarterly run rate stable and gradually improving. Thank you. -- (foreign language) -- (foreign language) -- So Alicia, to answer your two questions, first on Cloud Music, first of all, we view the competition with TME as a very healthy competitive dynamics. As you know TME and NetEase Cloud Music are now probably the leading two camps of online music on differentiated value propositions. For us, we are going to continue invest into R&D, maintaining Cloud Music's strong reputation as a trend settler with emphasis on innovation. This round of financing is a strong testament of recognition and support from both strategic and financial investors. So, it is also -- this also provide a strong motivation for us to keep Cloud Music as independently operated business franchise, which will set a stage for its potential spin-off IPO in the future when the time is ready.For your second question, short answer is, yes. We are very optimistic about maintaining sustainable and healthy growth trend of our online games revenue in the longer-term. This is underpinned by our continued R&D effort, investment and collaboration with multiple game studios. But aside from just financial metrics, William also wants to emphasize that a healthy and sustainable growth for games businesses is not only measured by financial metrics, but rather we care a lot more about user satisfaction and user recognition of our game quality, that applies to boast the gamer audience in China and in overseas. This would require NetEase to continuously invest to ensure that our competitive advantage in innovation, in localization, in understanding different geographies of the market are always ahead of the curve and we are confident to achieve that.Next we'll move to Jialong Shi with Nomura Securities. -- William, Charles, Margaret, good morning and congratulations on a very solid quarter. I will first ask my questions in Chinese.(foreign language)I have two questions here. My first question is about the regulations and in particular the regulation M2 to protect or to restrict minors' game play time. And we noticed NetEase competitor Tencent recently has adoped measures to restrict minors' time spent on Tencent's games. So, I just wonder if NetEase may follow suit and if yes and what will be the potential impact on NetEase gain revenue going forward. My second question is about your strategies for toward NetEase's e-commerce business, we saw NetEase's music and also your dollar subsidiary were both spun-off within the past year by raising capital from external -- external investors. And now looking across NetEase incubated businesses, the e-commerce business is the only baby tiger, there has yet to be a spun-off. And so I just wonder if NetEase may consider inviting external strategic investors into your e-commerce business, so that you guys may leverage external resources brought by those investors. Thank you. -- Okay. (foreign language) -- Thanks, Jialong. I will translate briefly the William's answers. First on your question on the anti-addiction measures. So, yes, we agree that our game operators share the responsibility to create a healthy online gaming environment for minors. In fact more than a decade ago when we were operating PC games, we already had measures in place to provide protection to minors to prevent addiction. For our logging system, we always encourage and require real name, with real personal age information for your logging.So on that we are going to continue to improve and enhance our mechanism to ensure that we share the appropriate responsibility as a game operator. But beyond that, William also commented that for anti-addiction for minors probably this should not be only narrowly focused on online games. In fact, in this cyber world on this mobile Internet age, there are multiple parties who can contribute their asset and obligation in creating a more conducive and healthy Internet mobile Internet environment for the minors.For your second question on e-commerce, so, as you know, Kaola and Yanxuan are two supplementary arms of our e-commerce businesses. In particular for Kaola, we've chosen it to focus on the cross-border e-commerce as a entry point, which we believe this is the right choice especially most recently President Xi saying that China Import Expo is being strongly encouraging imports -- China's imports in the coming years. We think there is huge upside to Kaola being a dedicated and leading operator in this cross border e-commerce.We do not rule out the possibility that along the way of the development of both Kaola and Yanxuan in its growth phase when there is the right and strategic partners emerge. But for now, we do not have any plan or any disclosure to make.And we'll take our next question from Natalie Wu with CICC. -- Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two here. First one about my -- about your e-commerce business. There is some concern on the market regarding the inventory issue of your e-commerce business. Just wondering, can you share some color on the SKU management, methodology of that business. Second question is about the overseas revenue contribution, you mentioned that, your overseas revenue contributed brand those hit games surpassed 10% for the first time, which is a very great number, last quarter, I remember the number was nearly 5%. So just wondering, can you help us understand about extra 5% contribution, how much is related with Knives Out and how much by Identity V. If they and also is there a blueprint for your overseas revenue contribution in the mid-term? And also the IP growth, how much is related about the overseas expansion endeavor. Thank you. I will translate myself.(foreign language) -- Thank you. Natalie. In the interest of time, I will take the questions and answer that directly in English. First of all for e-commerce, when you look at inventory of our e-commerce, I think the market needs to understand that it is not really apple-to-apple to many domestic e-commerce operators, because for cross border e-commerce, the inventory days will invariably be longer, it started when we make overseas procurement, including shipping et cetera. But we -- as we scale up, we are continuously optimizing our inventory management and we are confident that there is still a lot of space for us to improve and optimize here.Secondly, for the overseas revenue contribution, well, in fact, this is the first time that we announced this split, it was a quite a milestone achievement for us to arrive at above 10%. In the past couple of quarters, while we do not provide specific ratio, but it is climbing up trend. As we communicated in prior calls, the overseas contribution today primarily comes from Knives Out strong performance in Japan.Now with Identity V, with some other new games that we plan to bring to the international market, we are confident that the overseas revenue contribution will be more diversified going forward. But as to a percentage ratio, we really cannot give out any specific target, because you would understand that it is also dynamics right, it can be domestic games, growth is also very, very strong. So what I can say is that, the absolute dollar amount for sure, we are very, very confident that overseas games revenue is going to witness a strong growth. But as to the percentage, it is actually difficult for us to predict.For your third question, R&D expenses is acting fast, it's less so affected by the overseas expansion, because majority -- super majority of our game studios are domestically situated in China. So whether the game is distributed in China or distributed in the overseas market, bulk of the R&D expenses they incur in China anyways. And with successful game that's being proven in China and by launching this game in a new geography outside of China, it does not necessarily incur a great amount of margin or additional R&D expense. -- Thank you.And due to time constraints, we will take no further questions. I would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks. -- Thank you once again for joining us today. If you have further questions, please contact, NetEase's IR Director, Margaret Shi, based in Hangzhou, or or TPG Investor Relations. Thank you and have a great day. -- Thank you everyone.Everyone, that does conclude our conference call. We do thank you all for your participation, you may now disconnect. --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- Transcript powered by When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Each year, the Blizzard division hosts its own conference to spotlight new games, updates to existing titles, and other upcoming features and projects.The BlizzCon conference isn't always a source of huge news, but this year's show saw the company announce a controversial new title in addition to content expansions, reworkings, and remakes for games in big franchises. Read on for a summary of the most important bits for investors.Image source: Activision Blizzard. used to be one of Blizzard's top franchises, but despite an ultimately successful performance after a rough launch period for the series' 2012 release,  , it's fair to say that the property has been somewhat underutilized recently. That's set to change with  , a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) for Android and iOS platforms. Like earlier games in the series,  will see players teaming up to explore dungeons, conquer enemies, and collect equipment to boost their characters' stats and abilities, but it marks the first time that the series will land on mobile.Activision Blizzard is partnering with Chinese game developer and publisher  (NASDAQ: NTES) for the game, which should have the effect of opening the title up to the world's biggest mobile market once the country resumes the certification for new games after the current, temporary suspension. Games from outside China typically require a Chinese publishing partner in order to be released in the country, and Activision Blizzard is clearly moving forward with that market in mind. represents a promising step toward bringing more of the company's big franchises to mobile, and one that has the chance to be very successful -- though you might not guess it from how the game has been received. Early fan response to the title has been been decidedly negative, but much of this seems to be down to hardcore franchise enthusiasts who were expecting the announcement of a mainline sequel to  instead of a mobile game.Blizzard typically develops games for PC, and BlizzCon is typically used to highlight upcoming games for the platform. Many hardcore PC gamers and  fans aren't interested in the types of simplified gameplay experiences found on mobile, so it's not shocking that there's been vocal disappointment about the series' latest direction.The upcoming mobile release has also received criticism for seemingly being built on a game previously released by NetEase, meaning that  appears to reuse some development resources, design mechanics, and gameplay elements from an earlier title despite featuring a different art style and content. This has led to the game being labeled a \"cash-in\" in online discussion forums -- a critique that may not be totally unwarranted. looks like a smaller-scale project than Blizzard fans are used to, is the product of a partnership with a Chinese studio, and is probably being designed to be more casual-friendly than the typical  game. Put simply, it's probably not costing a ton to make compared to other Blizzard games, and it has the chance to be very profitable.Individual series releases should also be looked at in the context of what they mean for the broader franchise, and  is unlikely to make hardcore franchise fans less interested in a mainline sequel. Activision Blizzard hasn't announced a release date for  , but investors can probably count on the game being a hit when it's ready for market, so long as it delivers a quality experience.BlizzCon 2018 brought plenty of news on the  franchise front. Blizzard showed off new gameplay footage for  -- a version of the company's hugely popular MMORPG that will revert the gameplay to the way it was when the game was first released in 2004 and be included with every standard  (  ) subscription.  has been losing subscribers in recent years, but its longevity has still been impressive and the new option to switch back to the game's old style could help bring back some players.  is due for release in summer 2019. is going back to its roots in more ways than one. Before Blizzard released the MMORPG, its  franchise primarily consisted of strategy games.  a 2002 release that was the series' last mainline installment, is getting an updated version that's due for release in 2019.  will feature updated, high-definition graphics and a new story mode.Blizzard also debuted an upcoming expansion pack for  , its digital card game set in the  universe.  has demonstrated impressive staying power and proven to be a reliable sales generator for Activision Blizzard since its 2014 release. The new card set should help keep franchise fans playing and be a solid sales hit. , a first-person shooter developed and published by the Activision side of the business and released last year, is now free to download on PC until Nov. 18. BlizzCon usually features only games from the Blizzard wing of Activision Blizzard, but the PC version of  was the first game published by Activision to be featured on Blizzard's Battle.net online gaming platform.Activision's offering the game as a temporary free download highlights the fact that  hasn't performed to expectations, but the move could benefit the Battle.net ecosystem in a few ways. Making  free on PC for a limited time should bring in some new users to the game and to Battle.net. It could also encourage in-game item sales in  and other titles on Battle.net, open up crosspromotion opportunities, and encourage positive user sentiment about the platform.Adding new characters and other fresh content helps keep players engaged and sales flowing after a game is released. That's a core part of Activision Blizzard's business model, so it wasn't surprising to see new characters for  ,  , and  at this year's BlizzCon.

Unfortunately, the initial reception to the game -- which was co-developed with Chinese game maker  (NASDAQ: NTES) -- was overwhelmingly negative.Blizzard previously teased a major announcement for the  franchise, which hadn't been updated since its  expansion pack for  in 2014. Many gamers speculated that Blizzard would reveal another  expansion pack or title, so the introduction of a mobile-only title disappointed many longtime fans, who mostly played the previous titles on PCs.Image source: Activision Blizzard. principal designer Wyatt Cheng was even booed by the audience at BlizzCon after announcing that the game wouldn't be launched on PCs. Cheng's dismissive response -- in which he asked, \"Do you guys not have phones?\" -- was also slammed as being tone deaf across social media. Some gamers also claimed that  was merely a reskinned version of NetEase's mobile title  (also known as  ).In a subsequent interview with  , Blizzard co-founder Allen Adham admitted that the company expected some backlash against  , but \"not to this degree.\" Unfortunately, the fierce pushback against the game strongly indicates that Blizzard alienated many longtime fans of the two-decade old series.Blizzard, which merged with Activision over a decade ago, created the  ,  , and  franchises, which were all PC-centric titles. Many of those games were launched on consoles as well, but they generally fared poorly due to limited control schemes that were poorly suited for real-time strategy games, complex dungeon crawlers, and PC RPGs (role-playing games).Blizzard scored its first mobile hit with  , its free-to-play card game for mobile devices and PCs. It also successfully reached console users by launching its hit PC shooter,  , on the Xbox One and PS4.But despite these successes, the PC was considered Blizzard's primary platform, and esports tournaments featuring the PC versions of  and  reinforced that reputation. Many of Blizzard's fans also expected to pay full price for a complete game, instead of playing a free-to-play game saturated with microtransactions.Image source: Activision Blizzard.That's why gamers responded poorly to  , a free-to-play mobile-only game which will be monetized with microtransactions. The suggestion that the game is a reskinned version of NetEase's older game merely adds insult to injury.Blizzard likely pivoted  to mobile devices to complement Activision's push into the mobile market, which includes mobile  games and King's  titles. Just as Activision launched its mobile versions of  with Chinese gaming giant  , Blizzard worked with NetEase to bring  to mobile devices. That strategy seemed sound on paper, but it completely overlooked the fact that most of  fans were dedicated PC gamers.This setback could throttle the growth of Activision Blizzard's \"Mobile and Ancillary\" revenue, which rose 9% year over year during the first half of 2018 and accounted for 29% of the company's top line. Activision probably expected the first mobile  to become a new pillar of growth for the unit.NetEase licenses many of Blizzard's hit titles -- including  ,  ,  ,  , and  -- for the mainland Chinese market. It's also the second largest mobile game maker in China after Tencent. Those two facts made it an ideal partner for the development of  .Unfortunately, NetEase is also notorious for cloning popular games. Earlier this year, Korean publisher Bluehole sued NetEase for cloning features from its popular battle royale game  in  . That practice is widespread across the mobile gaming market, but it also indicates that NetEase doesn't spend much time developing new games. That's why it wouldn't be surprising if NetEase simply repackaged  -- which was already a mobile clone of  -- into a \"proper\"  game.Yet this debacle was also a wasted opportunity for NetEase, which generated nearly two-thirds of its revenue from online games last quarter. The unit's year over year sales growth decelerated to 7% last quarter due to the  of new game approvals in China, so  could have given it a shot in the arm with overseas revenue and future mobile collaborations with Activision.It's easy to dismiss the reception of  as a knee-jerk reaction from entitled gamers, but Blizzard and NetEase also clearly misjudged what the franchise's core gamers were expecting.  might not go down in flames, but it could tarnish the reputation of one of Blizzard's core franchises.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Baidu stock is off by one-third from May highs - and it could be worse. The 33% drop in BIDU stock pales in comparison to 50%-plus plunges at peers like  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ).Investors have been looking for a bottom since Chinese stocks  back in June. And the coming week could provide a long-awaited catalyst. Several large Chinese companies report earnings, with  first, on Tuesday afternoon.  (NYSE:  ) follows on Friday.The problem at the moment is that it doesn't look like good earnings will be enough.  swirling around Chinese (and U.S.) stocks aren't going away. A blowout quarter from Baidu and, in particular, strong guidance for the fourth quarter could pause the selling. But as I wrote last month, BIDU stock  . And I don't think it's worth trying to catch Baidu stock just yet.It would seem like strong numbers from Baidu on Tuesday, and other Chinese giants over the next two weeks, could at least allow the group to stabilize. Baidu in its  guided for 23%-30% year-over-year revenue growth in Q3. That includes a roughly three-point headwind from the divestitures of several smaller businesses.Analysts don't trust the guidance: consensus suggests just an 18% increase year-over-year. Earnings expectations look very low: the Street is looking for non-GAAP EPS of $2.42, down 35% against Q3 2017 (admittedly a blowout quarter).So if Baidu can hit its revenue guidance, that alone might suggest that the news isn't as bad as the Street and the market believe at the moment. And strong numbers might be a reminder that a company growing revenue at 25%-plus is trading for roughly 16x next year's estimated earnings, and closer to 15x backing out net cash.But I'm skeptical earnings can turn around Baidu stock - at least for good. Of late, earnings haven't been enough to assuage investor fears. One need only look at the U.S. market over the past two weeks. Corporate earnings have been strong - yet stocks have sold off.And for Chinese stocks, that has been true as well - including for BIDU stock itself. The last two  reports have been strong. Gains after Q1 earnings were erased in less than a month. Baidu stock fell hard after the Q2 report, owing to disappointing Q3 guidance, and resumed its sell-off this month. There's simply too much going on here for one backwards-looking report to change the case that much.After all, trade war fears aren't going away. The yuan continues to weaken, which has also played a part in the weakness seen in Chinese stocks.As I pointed out last month, it's not just Chinese stocks getting hit, either. Emerging markets around the world have been hammered over the past few months. Even in U.S. equities, there's a clear 'risk-off' trade, with sectors like semiconductors and housing seeing huge declines.The sell-off in BIDU is largely a sentiment problem. But there are company-specific risks as well. Baidu still operates a search engine in a single-party Communist country.  (NASDAQ:  , NASDAQ:  ) unit Google reportedly  - and provide stiff competition. Investments are pressuring near-term earnings, and more spend may needed to fight off Google.There's certainly a case that the sell-off has gone too far. But the other issue, as I pointed out last month, is whether BIDU stock necessarily is the best play on a rebound. I still think  (NASDAQ:  ) is  . And  on JD yet, either.And so I'm not rushing into BIDU stock, even at the lows. There are simply too many external factors, too ugly a chart and too many potentially more lucrative opportunities for investors who successfully time the bottom.

Changyou recently reported its third quarter earnings, which beat expectations but also revealed major headwinds. Let's dig deeper to see if Changyou's stock can rebound over the next few quarters.Image source: Getty Images.Changyou generated 81% of its revenue from PC and mobile games during the quarter. Its total average monthly active accounts for its PC games stayed flat sequentially and annually at 2.3 million during the quarter. Total paying accounts for its PC games rose 14% sequentially but stayed flat annually at 0.8 million. Changyou attributed the unit's sequential growth in paid users to improved in-game monetization efforts for its flagship title  .Total average monthly active accounts on its mobile games rose 16% sequentially but fell 29% annually to 3.7 million. Total paying accounts on its mobile games stayed flat sequentially but tumbled 50% annually to 0.7 million. Changyou attributed the unit's sequential growth to a launch of a new game during the third quarter, and its annual declines to the \"natural declining life cycles\" of its aging flagship title  .Changyou's gaming business faces two main headwinds: the suspension of new gaming approvals (which could last until early 2019), and tough competition from  (NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) and  (NASDAQ: NTES) ,  China's mobile gaming market. Tencent and NetEase publish nine of the top ten highest-grossing iOS games in China according to App Annie. Tencent also publishes Changyou's mobile titles, but the latter's biggest mobile title --  -- ranks 25th in App Annie's rankings.Image source: Getty Images.Changyou's total online gaming revenue fell 28% annually to $96 million during the third quarter, compared to a 23% drop in the second quarter. For comparison, Tencent and NetEase's online gaming revenues rose 6% and 7% year-over-year, respectively, during their second quarters.The rest of Changyou's revenue comes from cinema ads, online ads, and internet value-added services (IVAS). None of these businesses fared well during the third quarter.\n  \nSource: Changyou Q3 report.Changyou's cinema ad revenues were distorted by the acquisition and sale of some advertising resources. The annual drop reflects that strategic shift, and the sequential growth reflects a recovery in some of those revenues.Its online ad revenue growth was throttled by fewer ads for games on its 17173 gaming website, which was likely caused by Beijing's freeze on new game approvals. Its IVAS revenues were also dragged down by lower sales of PC and mobile internet products. Simply put, revenues from Changyou's secondary businesses won't offset the weakness of its gaming unit anytime soon.Changyou's total revenue fell 29% annually to $118 million during the quarter, which still beat estimates by $10 million.Changyou's gross margin (both GAAP and non-GAAP) dropped six percentage points annually to 67% during the quarter. However, the company also slashed its operating expenses by 67% annually to just $50 million, which boosted its operating margin of nearly 25%, compared to a negative operating margin last year.That improvement boosted Changyou's non-GAAP net income to $54 million, compared to a loss of $5 million a year earlier. That translated to $1.01 per ADS, which crushed estimates by $0.59.For the fourth quarter, Changyou expects its revenue to fall 17%-24% annually, and for its online gaming revenue to decline 13%-22% as Beijing's \"  \" continues. The company expects to post a non-GAAP net profit of $0.43-$0.52 per ADS -- but that would still represent a 19%-33% drop from the previous year.Changyou's stock looks cheap, but investors are ignoring it because a turnaround won't happen anytime soon.

Despite those headwinds, Baidu's core search-based ad business remains strong, and it remains a top play on China's booming tech sector.I recently discussed why Baidu's stock was too  . Today, I'll focus on the four major catalysts for Baidu's long-term growth.Image source: Getty Images.Earlier this year, Baidu introduced \"mini programs\" for its mobile app. These mini programs, which include games and travel apps, are installed from inside the Baidu App instead of a mobile app store. This allows Baidu to expand its app into a mobile platform, tether more apps to its ecosystem, and lock more mobile users into its app.This strategy mirrors  's (NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) introduction of mini programs for its mobile messaging platform WeChat last year. Last quarter, Tencent claimed that its mini programs had 200 million daily active users (DAUs), compared to 1.06 billion monthly active users (MAUs) on the WeChat app.Baidu's DAUs on the Baidu App rose 17% annually to 148 million last quarter. This means that even if all of the Baidu App's DAUs use Baidu's mini programs, its ecosystem will still reach fewer users than Tencent's mini programs. But if Baidu can offer its mobile search users similar mini programs as Tencent, it could widen its moat against WeChat.Earlier this year Baidu  (NASDAQ: IQ) , which leads China's online streaming video market alongside Tencent Video. The decision to turn iQiyi from a money-losing unit into an investment was a smart one, since it significantly boosted Baidu's earnings growth. Baidu still holds a majority stake in iQiyi, and integrates its streaming videos into its other platforms.Baidu also has a streaming music platform,  , but it only controlled 4% of the market last year according to DCCI. Meanwhile, market leader Tencent Music -- which was formed via a combination of three leading music platforms -- controls over three-quarters of the market with more than 800 million MAUs. The second largest player,  (NASDAQ: NTES) Cloud Music, has over 400 million MAUs.Image source: Getty Images.That's why it wasn't surprising when Baidu recently took a stake in NetEase Cloud Music in mid-October. NetEase will remain the unit's majority stakeholder, while Baidu will become a strategic partner -- which indicates that its ecosystem and content library could be merged with Baidu Music.Earlier this year,Baidu launched a  (BaaS) platform, which was aimed at helping companies process digital currencies and bill payments, and provided credit and insurance management services, audits, and other financial services on its blockchain network. It also launched a digital puppy adoption service, called \"Leci Gou\", to promote the service.If Baidu continues to expand its BaaS platform, it could counter the growth of rival blockchain platforms from Tencent,  ,  , and other tech companies. Winning over more enterprise customers could also allow Baidu to cross-sell more services and tether them more closely to its search and advertising ecosystem.Lastly, Baidu has a major presence in the AI and driverless car markets. In the AI market, it's expanding its DuerOS virtual assistant platform to more hardware devices. In August, Baidu revealed that the platform had an installed base of 100 million devices -- up from five million just six months earlier.The platform has  over 200 hardware partners,  ,  ,  , and  , which have launched over 110 types of DuerOS devices. This first-mover's advantage gives Baidu an Alexa-like lead in the Chinese market for voice searches, which could help it expand its ecosystem into connected homes.Image source: Baidu.Meanwhile, Baidu's open-source autonomous driving platform Apollo, which aims to be the \"Android of the auto industry,\" has attracted a growing list of partners, including  ,  , and  . Baidu has already been testing out its driverless cars in China and the US, which puts it at the forefront of this nascent next-gen market.Mini programs, streaming media, blockchain, and AI won't move the needle for Baidu over the next few quarters. But, over the long term, these investments could help Baidu diversify its business away from online ads and widen its moat against formidable ecosystem challengers like Tencent and Alibaba. Investors should remember that Baidu isn't just China's biggest online search company -- it's a diversified tech giant with plenty of irons in the fire.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The abrupt freeze caused the world's biggest gaming market to generate just 5% annual sales growth during the first half of 2018 -- down from nearly 30% growth in the previous year.The government reportedly plans to centralize gaming approvals to a single bureau, then ultimately limit its number of annual approvals. However, this new system probably won't be implemented until early 2019, according to Image source: Getty Images.Those developments cast a dark cloud over many Chinese video game makers. Shares of  (NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) , the world's biggest game publisher, declined about 30% this year. Its total online gaming revenue rose just 6% annually last quarter, as approvals for its biggest licensed games (  ,  , and  ) remained in limbo. Tencent's gaming revenue accounted for over a third of its top line.With Beijing's \"video game winter\" now set to drag on for at least two more quarters, Tencent looks like it's in trouble. But over the long term, these challenges probably won't kill Tencent or derail its long-term growth.Investors should realize that regulators are merely  new video game approvals, not  existing video games. This means that Tencent's top games just need to keep generating steady revenues until the government starts approving new games again.Tencent still tops the global charts in PC gaming.  , which is published by its subsidiary Riot Games, remains the most popular core PC game in North America and Europe, according to Newzoo. Tencent also owns a 40% stake in Epic Games, the publisher of  , which ranks second.Tencent still publishes 10 of the 20 highest-grossing iOS games in China, according to App Annie's rankings for the week of Oct. 14. Its top game, the MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) title  (also known as  ), consistently topped the charts after its launch in 2015. Another top 10 game, the kart racer  , was launched a decade ago.Arena of Valor. Image source: Tencent.Tencent also generates mobile game revenue from overseas markets like the U.S. Among the top 10 highest-grossing iOS games in the U.S., Tencent holds minority stakes in the publishers of three titles (  and two  games), and owns  and  through its subsidiary Supercell. Therefore, Tencent's top games should help it tread water (albeit with single-digit sales growth) until newer games arrive.The video game freeze also temporarily eliminates one of the biggest challenges for Tencent in the gaming market: endless competition from new game makers.Tencent's biggest rival is  (NASDAQ: NTES) , which publishes five of the 20 highest-grossing iOS games in China. NetEase's top game,  , consistently ranks second after Tencent's  . Like Tencent, NetEase's gaming growth decelerated significantly, with just 7% annual sales growth last quarter.With the Chinese gaming market basically \"frozen\" for a year, market leaders like Tencent and NetEase should continue to dominate the market with their older games. This means that both companies can probably spend a bit less money on research and development and marketing costs.Tencent is commonly seen as a video game company, but it also generates  from its expanding WeChat ecosystem, online ads, streaming services like Tencent Video and Tencent Music,  , and other investments.That's why the company  its business units to prioritize the growth of its cloud and content businesses over its gaming unit. As a diversified tech company, Tencent can probably offset the softness of its weaker businesses with the growth of its stronger ones over the long term.Therefore, it's shortsighted to sell Tencent's stock based on fears about a long winter for video games. Instead, investors should realize that these challenges should be short-lived and that the tech giant still has plenty of irons in the fire.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

For the Invesco NASDAQ Internet ETF (Symbol: PNQI), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $144.97 per unit.With PNQI trading at a recent price near $121.57 per unit, that means that analysts see 19.25% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of PNQI's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are 21Vianet Group, Inc. (Symbol: VNET), Ctrip.com International, Ltd. (Symbol: CTRP), and NetEase, Inc (Symbol: NTES). Although VNET has traded at a recent price of $9.51/share, the average analyst target is 53.52% higher at $14.60/share. Similarly, CTRP has 43.47% upside from the recent share price of $32.76 if the average analyst target price of $47.00/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting NTES to reach a target price of $301.62/share, which is 42.29% above the recent price of $211.98.

Yet it was a relatively solid quarter, with revenue rising 21.7% in local currency. During NetEase's , Chief Financial Officer Zhaoxuan Yang highlighted several powerful growth drivers that could help the company's stock rebound in the quarters ahead. Here are the key points long-term shareholders will want to know.NetEase dominates the massively multiplayer online (MMO) game market. Yet the company is also attempting to diversify its revenue by launching more non-MMO mobile games, such as  ,  , and  . Impressively, each of these games promptly rose to the top of China's app download charts. They also helped online game revenue rise 6.7% in the second quarter, to $1.5 billion.Notably, NetEase's expansion into more casual mobile game genres is helping it appeal to a different and generally younger user base. In turn, this is broadening NetEase's market opportunity beyond its core gamer base and home country of China.NetEase's new games are proving popular among more casual players. Image source: Getty Images.NetEase is adding more localized content to its games, which is boosting their popularity in international markets. For example, NetEase's games  and  have consistently topped download and sales charts in Japan. Additionally,  ,  and  all recently enjoyed strong launches in the U.S. NetEase is becoming much more than simply a play on the Chinese gaming market -- it's an intriguing means to profit from the growth of the  .NetEase's primary goal for its online retail business is to rapidly scale its operations in order to gain share. It's willing to accept somewhat lower gross margin and sacrifice some short-term profit to do so. It's a smart move, as those who can establish a leadership position in China's massive e-commerce market stand to profit handsomely.Moreover, NetEase believes that its Kaola and Yanxuan businesses are particularly well-positioned to profit from rising income and consumption patterns among China's growing middle class. Kaola helps to bring products from international brands to Chinese consumers. Yanxuan, meanwhile, uses an original design manufacturer (ODM) model, in which it partners with Chinese manufacturers to produce goods that it designs and that are sold directly from its e-commerce platform. Together, these two rapidly growing businesses could help NetEase become a powerful force in a Chinese online retail market that's projected to exceed $2 trillion in annual sales by 2020,  .More profits equal more dividends for NetEase investors. Image source: Getty Images.Rather than a fixed dollar amount, NetEase typically pays out a quarter of its net income to owners of its American depositary shares each quarter. This helps to make the relationship between company profits and  even more explicit.For example, NetEase paid out $0.23 in dividends based on $0.91 in earnings per share in the first quarter. When its EPS rose to $2.44 in the second quarter, the company raised its payout to $0.61. And with mobile games, international expansion, and e-commerce all likely to fuel further increases in NetEase's revenue and earnings, investors can expect to receive a rising stream of dividend income in the years ahead.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $222.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $213.00 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of NTES, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $223.84/share today.Because the $222.50 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

Note that JD stock price has dropped by about 39% this year.Several factors have caused the decline of JD stock price. First of all, the aggressive tariffs that President Trump has deployed against China have created quite a bit of uncertainty about JD stock. It's tough to tell how the trade war will affect JD stock and when the conflict will end. But in the meantime, Wall Street has been selling many Chinese names besides JD.com, including  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NYSE:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ). Chinese stocks have essentially entered bear market territory.Additionally, JD stock price has declined because its CEO, Liu Qiangdong, was arrested for allegedly  . Keep in mind that he is the company's founder and, with his ownership of 80% of the voting shares of JD stock, has tight control over the company. What's more, JD does not appear to have a clear-cut succession plan.So where is JD stock headed? Even with the negatives, has a contrarian opportunity been created? Or should investors continue to stay away from JD stock?I do think that JD stock has some notable positive attributes. One is that JD.com has extensive scale in the Chinese e-commerce market, trailing only BABA. JD.com also has more than  . Moreover, it utilizes advanced automated systems, artificial intelligence and robots. Consequently, over 90% of its orders are delivered on the same day or the next day. Its infrastructure is used by many other third-parties, providing it with another lucrative source of revenue.The other main driver of JD stock is economic growth in China, and the company is poised to capitalize on that opportunity. The number of middle class citizens in China is expected to reach a staggering  . And spending on e-commerce is projected to rise from  . In other words, JD has a great deal of room to grow.Finally, JD has been aggressively forming strategic partnerships. For example,  (OTCMKTS:  ) is an investor in the company and has touted JD's e-commerce platform on WeChat, which is the most popular messaging app in China. (NYSE:  ) has also invested in JD. The two companies sell each other's products in brick-and-mortar stores and on web platforms.Those partnerships have definitely enhanced JD's distribution footprint. Consider that 300 million customers currently use JD's platform, and that  of those have come on board during the past three years.JD faces serious risks and more negative headlines will probably appear. And the Chinese market could slow down, while JD will continue to face fierce competition from BABA.But it does look like JD stock price has more than factored in any bad news that's likely to arise, as investors appear to have thrown in the towel on JD.com.But JD's growth outlook is still strong, as, on average, Wall Street analysts expect its annual revenue to increase by 30% this year. Moreover, the forward price-earnings ratio of JD stock is a reasonable 29.So for investors looking for exposure to the Chinese e-commerce market, JD stock does look interesting. And while JD.com may be volatile, it seems like a good bet that JD stock price will rise over the longer term.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["onday's session closes with the NASDAQ Composite Index at 7,924.16.

NTES stock has dropped by nearly half from late 2017 highs. NetEase stock, in fact, hit a two-year low earlier this month before a modest rebound.From a near-term standpoint, the decline makes some sense. Chinese stocks remain in a  . Many of the country's best-known and most widely held issues have tumbled.  (NYSE:  ) shares are down 25%.  (NASDAQ:  ) has dropped 49%. Macro concerns, perhaps catalyzed by trade war fears, have been a key driver of the sell-off.NetEase itself is undergoing some changes as well. It's trying to pivot away from its reliance on video games and move more aggressively into e-commerce, as Dana Blankenhorn  . So far, that strategy has had mixed results - and uncertainty surrounding the success of those efforts likely has added to the pressure on NTES stock.But that short-term bad news makes NTES an intriguing play from a long-term standpoint. If an investor believes - as Blankenhorn argued last month - that  , the entire group looks potentially attractive. And with NTES dealing with its own issues and being one of the hardest-hit Chinese stocks so far in 2018, it could be one of the best-performing if and when sentiment turns.Save for a brief rally this summer, it's been pretty much straight down for NetEase stock. Fundamentally, the numbers look reasonably strong. Revenue rose 15% year over year in the first quarter and 25% in Q2. But the growth simply hasn't been enough to satisfy the market: NTES stock actually sold off after both reports.And there are some concerns here. Online gaming revenue growth has slowed markedly, with sales rising just 7% YOY in Q2. As  pointed out last month, Chinese regulators appear to be  , which also has impacted larger rival  (OTCMKTS:  ). Those delays appear part of  to limit video game playing among children and other customers.Regulators also have  at NetEase's finance website, part of a crackdown on an online media sector that includes the company's well-known  site. Add to that the pressure on Chinese stocks and fears about the country's economy, and it's not terribly surprising that NTES has struggled.That said, ten months ago, few investors likely would have seen a 50% decline coming. And there is now a case that NTES stock is the best play for investors who believe the sell-off in Chinese stocks will eventually end.After all, there's good news here as well. E-commerce growth has been impressive, with revenue rising 100%+ YOY in Q1, and 75% in Q2. Game revenue is being restricted at the moment, but it's still growing. Mobile adoption in the country will only rise going forward, and even a more limited pipeline should allow sales and profits to rise for many years to come.The company's media and e-mail offerings may face their own regulatory pressure - but neither business is going anywhere. Margins have been pressured this year by investments in operating expenses - but the pace of increases in SG&A and marketing should slow going forward.At the end of the day, even in a tougher environment, this still is a business growing revenue in the range of 20% this year. It remains impressively profitable. NetEase stock even  , albeit a small one, and continues to repurchase stock as well. That emphasis on shareholder returns is unusual for such a fast-growing stock. And so is the earnings multiple applied to NTES.That business is available for just 20x forward earnings - one of the cheaper multiples in the space. It's a valuation that incorporates little growth going forward - and one that also has room for expansion if and when sentiment toward Chinese stocks returns. It's not that difficult to imagine NTES stock once again being priced at 25x+ earnings, particularly if growth resumes, and that suggests easily 30% upside from current levels.The question is whether there's any need to rush into NetEase stock at the moment. As I wrote about  (NASDAQ:  ) earlier this month, there's a real \"falling knife\" problem with Chinese stocks on the whole. With the dollar strengthening and emerging markets looking shaky, there's no guarantee the sell-off in NTES and its peers is at an end.But for investors willing to take on that risk, NTES stock looks like one of the more intriguing plays. Its pivot to e-commerce should help revenue growth. Regulators likely will back off at some point. Margins can expand. So can the multiple applied to NetEase stock. There's still a lot of potential upside here - it just may take some time for the market to focus on that upside and not just the risks.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (Symbol: IEMG) where we have detected an approximate $249.0 million dollar inflow -- that's a 0.5% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 942,000,000 to 946,800,000).

The Chinese online gaming pioneer hit another 52-week low last week. The stock begins this week trading 48% off the all-time highs it set just nine months ago.There are a lot of things that have gone wrong for NetEase, but there are some signs that the shares may be finally bottoming out. Let's go over some of the reasons why the former dot-com darling is worth a second look at nearly half of its peak pricing.Image source: NetEase.comNetEase shares began to buckle earlier this year after shocking investors with a year-over-year drop in online gaming revenue in the  . Providing PC and now mobile games has been NetEase's bread-and-butter business, accounting for $5.6 billion -- or 67% -- of the $8.3 billion in revenue it scored last year.The bad news continued into the first quarter of this year, but after back-to-back years of double-digit percentage declines in revenue NetEase recovered with a slight uptick in its latest quarter. The  isn't going to get investor tongues wagging, but it's a step in the right direction.Wall Street wasn't impressed with NetEase's overall 22% top-line growth in local currency during the second quarter because profitability went the other way. Adjusted earnings fell 22% in the second quarter.Sometimes value investors flock to an out-of-favor company because its stock slide has overshot the slump in its fundamentals. A stock's earnings multiple can grow more attractive if a company's earnings power remains intact during the correction, but that's not entirely the case here. Analysts see NetEase earning $8.11 a share this year after ringing up $11.80 a share a year earlier, recovering slightly to $9.97 a share come 2019. NetEase is now fetching 24 times this year's projected profit, not a bargain based on NetEase's historical standards. However, the multiple drops to the mid-teens if would be able to return to last year's profitability.The secret to NetEase's growth despite the earlier hiccup in online gaming is that it's been allocating some of its capital resources to two fast-growing e-commerce businesses. Kaola and Yanxuan are making waves as platforms that provide affordable copycats of brand-name merchandise and offer up overseas goods to China's widening middle class.Investors are overlooking the stellar growth in e-commerce, choosing instead to focus on how the emphasis is weighing on the bottom line. NetEase is going through a transformation, and it may be an awkward look at this stage, but it's a good time to diversify with regulatory agencies cracking down on the online game services industry.

Massive growth of the low-margin e-commerce business, as well as a slowdown in the video gaming business, has eroded the Chinese internet giant's earnings power, and the situation was no different last quarter.NetEase's  22% year over year in the second quarter even though revenue rose by the same percentage, driven by massive cost increases. Not surprisingly, NetEase  , and rightly so, as the company seems to be stuck in a vicious cycle of reporting weak margins quarter after quarter, as it is now relying on low-margin businesses for growth.However, there is a silver lining that could work in NetEase's favor in the long run.Image Source: NetEase.NetEase's e-commerce business is growing at a very rapid pace and now accounts for a fourth of its total revenue. It supplied $660 million in revenue last quarter, an increase of 75% from the prior-year period. But at the same time, the segment's gross margin fell from 12.6% last quarter to 10.1% this time thanks to promotional offers that it had to run to capture more market share.NetEase management made it crystal clear during the latest conference call that its target is to achieve scale in the e-commerce business at a \"reasonable\" gross margin. So the company is willing to compromise its margins in a bid to sustain the rapid growth, which is the right move, in my opinion, given the opportunity and competition.NetEase is going up against well-established e-commerce giants such as  and  , which is why it is busy spending billions to shore up its offerings and corner a bigger slice of China's e-commerce pie. For instance, the company will be  over the next three years to purchase foreign goods to sell in China.This will help it satisfy Chinese consumers' thirst for foreign goods, as eMarketer estimates that 25% of the country's population will purchase foreign goods by 2020 through cross-border transactions. NetEase's Kaola platform reportedly commands nearly a quarter of Chinese cross-border e-commerce at present, and because this niche is expected to generate $75 billion in sales by the end of the decade, the company needs to sustain its impressive market share by adding more goods.Assuming that NetEase manages to hold even 20% of China's cross-border e-commerce market by 2020, and it manages to maintain a 10% gross margin, its earnings will get a big shot in the arm. So NetEase's strategy of attaining a bigger e-commerce scale at the expense of margins right now is a smart one from a long-term perspective.NetEase's online games revenue was down 19% during the first quarter of the year, but it turned around in Q2 as sales increased 7% annually. More importantly, the segment's gross margin inched up 1 percentage point year over year to 64%, even though mobile games supplied 75% of the total revenue as compared to 72% last year.The fact that higher mobile gaming revenue didn't affect NetEase's online gaming margin negatively is a step in the right direction, as it indicates that the company is becoming better able to monetize its titles. For instance, NetEase's mobile gaming titles are striking a chord with gamers in foreign markets such as Japan. So it can now generate more revenue without having to incur a substantial increase in development costs and enjoy stronger margins.NetEase is now looking to expand into more markets such as Europe and North America, and success there could help shore up its online gaming gross margin further. What's more, the company's online gaming business can gradually shift into a higher gear, as it has recently launched new PC and mobile gaming titles that have helped boost revenue.NetEase is attractively valued right now. The stock's trailing  (P/E) ratio of 27 is significantly lower than the 42 industry average, while a forward P/E ratio of 18.9 indicates that bottom-line growth is in the cards. What's more, NetEase is undervalued on a  basis as well, with a ratio of 3.7, which is nearly half the 7 industry average, so investors can get to enjoy its rapid sales growth on the cheap.Now, there's no denying that NetEase has burned investors badly this year, but it might be a good time to accumulate its shares despite the recent headwinds as success in the e-commerce business and a recovery in online gaming should eventually help NetEase reclaim its mojo.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Chinese online services reported a higher-than-expected net income but missed on revenue as the costs of its new e-commerce division weighed on the stock. With promising signs of growth in e-commerce, however, the recent slump in NTES stock could present a buying opportunity.NetEase reported second-quarter earnings per share () of $3.15 (on a non-GAAP basis). This beat analyst estimates by 33 cents per share, although it also represented a drop from the $3.86 EPS reported in the same quarter the previous year. Revenue increased by 24.7% from the same quarter last year. Although the company reported revenues of $2.46 billion for the quarter, that missed expectations by $20 million.This sent NTES stock reeling in the next trading session. NetEase lost almost 11% in Thursday's trading alone and is down 14% overall. Worries related to the trade war with the U.S. as well as unexpectedly high sales, general and administrative expenses weighed on the stock. Interestingly, the previous quarter saw a similar story. Following the Q1 earnings report, NTES stock fell by 7.5% following that trading session.Despite these setbacks, shareholders, especially the long-term owners, have enjoyed a nice run. NTES stock fell to as low as $15 per share at the height of the 2008 financial crisis. From there, it's risen in value by almost 2500%. However, since hitting a high of over $377 per share in December, it has lost over 40% of that value.Another factor involves NetEase expanding its business lines.  own Dana Blankenhorn  that NetEase was like  (OTCMKTS:  ) but wanted to become  (NASDAQ:  ). I disagree with this view as Tencent has also moved into e-commerce. However, such a transition from gaming to e-commerce certainly weighs on both marketing and shipping costs.For this reason, I see the selloff as an overreaction. While such a change sounds daunting, readers should remember that NetEase started out as an internet services company before the move into gaming. Also, if its primary rival Tencent can make such moves, I see little reason why NetEase cannot do the same.In my view, I see NetEase has become a buying opportunity for those that want to buy an internet conglomerate but missed the chance to buy Tencent years ago. Despite the massive increase in NTES stock over the last ten years, the market cap stands at under $30 billion. This compares with Tencent's market cap of over $450 billion.This creates a tremendous advantage for NTES stock regarding the laws of mathematics. If Tencent's almost $450 billion market cap doubles in value one time, it becomes one of the top five largest companies in the world. NetEase's $30 billion market cap would have to double five times to come in striking distance of the record trillion-dollar market cap reached only recently by  (NASDAQ:  ). And despite the 40% drop in NTES stock, it has doubled almost four times over the previous ten years. Doubling four times again would place it near Tencent's current value.NTES stock also compares well from a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio standpoint. Tencent trades at over 37 times earnings. The P/E for NetEase stands at just under 26. Analysts forecast higher growth next year for Tencent (38.2% vs. 25.7%). Still, for all of the criticism that NetEase received for moving into e-commerce, it grew revenues in this segment by 75.2%. Its core game services segment increased by only 6.7% in the same period. I see that as an encouraging sign that NTES stock can successfully follow in Tencent's footsteps.The recent decline in NTES stock could present investors the opportunity to buy the next Tencent. NTES stock saw a massive selloff despite beating estimates and reporting an enormous increase in revenue that slightly missed forecasts. The cost of e-commerce and fears of a trade war have rattled investors.However, due to a recent 40% decline in the stock, NTES trades at under 26 times earnings. Moreover, with its 75.2% increase in sales on the e-commerce side, signs have emerged that like Tencent, NetEase stands as a gaming company that can also succeed in e-commerce. Due to its much smaller size, NTES stock shows more potential for long-term growth compared with Tencent.

Since last December, the company's shares have lost more than a third of their value, and macroeconomic concerns about the trade relationship between China and the U.S. have weighed on investor sentiment about Chinese stocks more generally.Coming into Wednesday's second-quarter financial report, NetEase investors hoped that the company would be able to get its key metrics moving back in the right direction. NetEase did find ways to produce some improvement from last quarter's tough conditions, but even though the Chinese video game giant appears to be fully back on track, not everyone was satisfied.Image source: NetEase.NetEase's second-quarter results at least showed a bit of sequential improvement compared to a  . Revenue rose 22% in local-currency terms during the period, translating to $2.46 billion. However, adjusted net income fell about 22% to $411.8 million, which resulted in adjusted earnings of $3.15 per share.On the positive side, NetEase was at least able to get top-line gains from all of its key segments. Online game revenue saw sales climb 7%, leading to a 9% rise in gross profit for the segment. E-commerce performed much more strongly, posting top-line gains of 75%, and email and other revenue managed a better-than-40% climb. Advertising services was relatively weak, though, with sales rising just 6% and gross profit picking up 5% from year-ago levels.Fundamentally, NetEase saw a number of recent trends continue. Mobile games continued to account for a greater portion of overall online game revenue, approaching the 75% mark for the quarter. Self-developed mobile games like  ,  , and  helped to support the game unit as well. Meanwhile, on the e-commerce side, the rapid development of marketplaces Yanxuan and Kaola.com helped to produce rising gross profit figures. Seasonality also gave a boost to advertising revenue. However, NetEase said that the email and other businesses suffered segment losses due to higher music licensing costs and reduced performance from key online platform businesses.Costs also weighed on NetEase, with operating expenses climbing by just less than half from figures from 12 months ago. Of particular concern were rising marketing expenditures, research and development, and staff-related costs. Shipping costs also weighed on the bottom line. Reduced income taxes helped to cushion the blow to some extent, but they still didn't provide a perfect solution for NetEase.CEO William Ding celebrated the news. \"We are pleased with the solid growth we achieved across all of our business segments,\" Ding said, \"including online games, e-commerce and advertising services, and the strong improvement to our bottom line.\" The CEO also noted that both PCs and mobile devices have combined to give NetEase considerable engines for growth in the future.NetEase wants to keep expanding in key ways. Initially, the company did best with its massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), but NetEase has been able to reach the top of the gaming charts with new releases outside the MMORPG space. Moreover, the company is paying more attention to ensuring that its games are accessible and suitable not just to Chinese players but to a worldwide audience, and that could open up the possibility of much wider distribution of its games in the near future.Dividend investors got some good news from NetEase. Under its variable dividend policy, the company will make a distribution of $0.61 per share to its shareholders later this month. That's more than double what investors got last quarter, reflecting at least a sequential boost to the company's income.Yet most NetEase shareholders didn't choose to see it that way, and the stock fell 10% at midday Thursday following Wednesday night's announcement. Without a clearer path back to accelerating growth, NetEase could struggle to keep up with the rapid pace of progress among both traditional and new players in the video game industry.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The first quarter of 2018, which the company reported on in May, is quite representative. Revenue increased just 3.9% over the first quarter of 2017, to $2.3 billion. This modest improvement paled against Q1 2017's revenue leap of 72% versus its own comparable 2016 quarter.Image source: Getty Images.Online game services, NetEase's largest segment, experienced a top-line slump of 18% during the first three months of the year, to $1.4 billion. Gross margin in online games dropped 1.8 percentage points to 62.1%, which the company blamed on a lower revenue contribution from its in-house-developed mobile games. Specifically, NetEase identified weaker sales in its Onmyoji game and the mobile-based version of New Ghost, which dampened the relative success of the Knives Out and Chu Liu Xiang titles.Of course, for a company that derives the lion's share of its revenue from gaming, revenue can be cyclical, as the success of individual products fluctuates. However, without enough bona fide new hits, NetEase has lost profitability as it allocates higher selling costs and marketing expense to generate equivalent levels of revenue. For example, first quarter 2018 cost of revenues jumped 33% to $1.3 billion, and marketing expenses roughly doubled to $397.1 million, even as revenue barely advanced.As my colleague Harsh Chauhan points out  on NetEase's current state, NetEase will likely continue to invest in marketing to win back market share, especially as competitors like  have recently achieved levels of growth in online gaming that used to typify NetEase's prospects.Still, the company has many opportunities to turn its fortunes around, from traction in massive multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) like Chu Liu Xiang, to additional monetization of its Minecraft license. NetEase now claims 60 million Minecraft users in China, and it's opening up a platform for third-party developers to increase content on the site, which should advance revenue opportunities. Overall, it's not out of the question for NetEase's vaunted research and development department to re-energize the top line with new hit titles as it builds on core properties.

Fan claims that Bilibili's games act as a \"first point of contact\" with Gen Z customers, and gives it the foundation to serve up ads, live streams, or other online services.Bilibili's revenue more than quadrupled to 523.3 million RMB ($80.4 million) in 2016, then  to 2.47 billion RMB ($379.4 million) in 2017. Its net loss widened from 373.5 million RMB ($57.4 million) in 2015 to 911.5 million ($140.1 million) in 2016, but narrowed significantly to 183.8 million ($28.2 million) last year.During the first quarter, Bilibili's revenue jumped 105% annually to 868 million RMB ($138.4 million).

However, its net loss narrowed slightly from 67.4 million RMB to 57.8 million RMB (US$9.2 million), buoyed by its robust revenue growth. On an adjusted basis, which excludes stock-based compensation and amortization expenses, its loss narrowed from 59.6 million RMB to just 3.2 million RMB (US$0.5 million).For the current quarter, Bilibili expects its revenue to rise 66% to 72% annually. Analysts expect 72% sales growth for the full year. Based on that forecast, Bilibili trades at about 8 times this year's revenues.For comparison,  (NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) and  (NASDAQ: NTES) , the two biggest names in Chinese mobile games, trade at about 9 times and 3 times this year's sales, respectively.

Not surprisingly, NetEase investors have been a happy lot, as their investment in the Chinese internet specialist has experienced five straight years of double-digit percentage gains.However, 2018 looks to be a year worth forgetting for NetEase. The company seems to be losing its growth engines, sparking panic among investors -- who haven't hesitated to book profits. data by The above chart clearly shows that NetEase's earnings power has been waning for almost a year now. The market was kind enough to  in 2017 as the company was busy expanding its ecommerce income streams -- but NetEase was just one step away from losing its earnings power, as mobile gaming and ecommerce are low-margin businesses. And it didn't take long for the company's bottom line to move south once mobile gaming started showing signs of faltering.Last quarter NetEase's online gaming revenue fell nearly 19% year over year. As this segment supplies close to 64% of the company's total revenue, that triggered a 4% drop in NetEase's top line. But the real kicker was the massive drop in the company's earnings: NetEase's adjusted net income fell almost 70% year over year in local currency terms, and that sent the alarm bells ringing.Mobile gaming and ecommerce are big businesses in China. Chinese consumers spent $11 billion on mobile games last year, up from just $3 billion in 2015. ecommerce is another fast-growing opportunity, as online sales in the country spiked 39% in 2017.The problem, however, is both are highly competitive spaces, and tough businesses from a margin perspective.

But the company is trying to get back on its feet. It recently unveiled a pipeline of over 20 mobile and PC games, and it will try to extend the life of its current games by launching expansion packs.In all, NetEase will spend more money to get its mojo back, so expect more bottom-line pressure in coming quarters. Its comeback cannot be guaranteed at this point -- Tencent has stolen the show in China's gaming scene with its wide portfolio of games to cater to the tastes of over 500 million gamers.The ecommerce story isn't much different, as NetEase is being forced to offer discounts to gain customers. Its ecommerce revenue doubled last quarter compared to the prior-year period, but gross margin fell from 13.1% last year to 9.5%.In fact, the ecommerce business' margins have been contracting consistently for the past several quarters.

Its revenue rose 4% annually to 14.2 billion yuan ($2.3 billion), which beat estimates by $120 million. Unfortunately, its non-  net income plunged 69% to 1.34 billion yuan ($213 million), or $1.61 per diluted ADS (American depositary share) -- which missed estimates by 36 cents.NetEase's stock has declined nearly 30% for the year, making it one of China's worst-performing large-cap tech stocks. However, contrarian investors might be wondering if this stock can finally rebound after some catalysts kick in. Let's dig deeper to find out.Image source: NetEase.NetEase's core gaming revenues dropped 18% annually to 8.8 billion yuan ($1.4 billion). That decline was partly attributed to sliding revenues from its top mobile title  . The gross margin of its online games segment also fell 180 basis points annually to 62.1%.Those declines were alarming, since NetEase's biggest rival in mobile gaming,  (NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) ,  that its mobile gaming revenue rose 68% annually to 21.7 billion yuan ($3.4 billion) during its first quarter -- supported by hit games like  (also known as  ),  , and the mobile versions of  .On a sequential basis, NetEase's gaming revenue rose 10% and its gross margin expanded 70 basis points -- thanks to the introduction and monetization of several new mobile games, including the  clone  and  . If these games gain momentum throughout 2018, they might offset its declines in aging titles like  ,  ,  , and its core  series.Meanwhile, NetEase's cost of revenues rose 33% annually to 8.2 billion yuan ($1.3 billion). That big jump in spending, which it applied to refreshing its gaming portfolio and expanding its digital ecosystem, was exacerbated by unfavorable foreign-exchange headwinds.Image source: NetEase.NetEase booked a foreign-exchange loss of 375.1 million yuan ($59 million) during the quarter, compared to 48.5 million yuan a year earlier, due to unrealized forex losses from dollar-denominated bank deposits and short-term loan balances. That pressure caused its operating cash flow to drop from 4 billion yuan a year ago to just 1.9 billion yuan ($297 million).NetEase's non-gaming businesses all posted solid top-line growth. Its e-commerce revenues, from its Kaola and Yanxuan marketplaces, more than doubled annually to 3.7 billion yuan ($595 million).However, investors should be cautious about Yanxuan, since it uses a  of selling unbranded products which are \"identical\" to their branded counterparts. The e-commerce unit's gross margin also fell 360 basis points year-over-year to 9.5%, due to higher discounts -- but that still marked a sequential expansion of 210 basis points.The company's \"email and other\" revenues also more than doubled annually, to 1.2 billion yuan ($194 million), fueled by the growth of its live streaming platforms CC and Bobo, and its music streaming platform NetEase Cloud Music. The unit posted a negative gross margin of 9.9%, compared to positive 20.3% a year earlier, and negative 3.3% in the fourth quarter.Lastly, NetEase's advertising revenues rose 4% annually to 462 million yuan ($74 million), supported by growing demand across the real estate, internet services, and auto industries. The unit's gross margin of 59% was an expansion from 57.3% a year earlier, but a drop from 71.2% in the previous quarter -- mostly due to a seasonal downturn in ad sales.NetEase might regain its footing in the competitive gaming market, but Tencent clearly has the upper hand, with its expanding portfolio of homegrown hits and investments in overseas winners like  and  .Meanwhile, NetEase's e-commerce business faces tough questions about its \"unbranded\" strategy, and its ad business is facing off against giants like  and Tencent, while its video and music streaming units are chasing market leaders like  and Tencent Music.Simply put, NetEase doesn't dominate any of its key markets, so it needs to spend a lot more money to stay competitive.

Sporting a $30 billion market cap, NetEase works in a consumer-facing industry, and share prices have bounced between $222 and $378 over the last year. And these are the hallmarks of the market's most-discussed tickers.But other than around the time of the company's earnings reports, NetEase rarely receives much press coverage. As of this writing,  on the Yahoo Finance feeds is five days old. Excluding The Motley Fool's efforts to keep investors informed, the newest article from other sources was published 12 days ago.So what's the deal with the radio silence?NetEase could rightly ask: Is anybody listening? Image source: Getty Images.First and foremost, NetEase is huge in China but doesn't do any business anywhere else. That makes it nearly invisible to American consumers, which leads to less interest in NetEase's headlines. In a news cycle where clicks and views often drive the editorial decisions, it just makes sense to give outsiders like NetEase less coverage.Furthermore, American investors are often intimidated by foreign stocks that report their results under different market rules and reporting standards. Converting Chinese yuan to U.S. dollars can be a hassle, and who knows what accounting practices NetEase might use? This goes for both readers and writers, by the way -- I can't write about companies I don't understand.I can't really rebut the fact that NetEase works in a very different market with nearly zero ties to North America. That's going to keep a lid on NetEase coverage until the company decides to explore international expansion. The company is looking at some international expansion opportunities, but it's not an easy play. NetEase hasn't saturated the Chinese markets yet, and Beijing's regulators can make it difficult to get any overseas operations going.On the other hand, NetEase's stock is only listed on the all-American Nasdaq exchange. There is no underlying stock on the Beijing exchange, so the financial reports must comply with Nasdaq's rules and the same SEC accounting rules as any American company. NetEase recently adopted the same Topic 606 revenue accounting rules that have resulted in large changes to many earnings reports over the last quarter and a half. Management also supplies most of its financial information in both Chinese and American currencies, allowing U.S. investors to skip the currency conversion step when analyzing NetEase's results.So it's actually not that hard to keep an American eye on NetEase and its financial progress. In a nutshell, it's a solidly profitable video gaming and online media player in  . Earnings have seen annual growth of 24% over the last five years, while annual sales skyrocketed 46% higher. Right now, NetEase offers a modest price-to-earnings ratio of 19 times forward earnings as share prices have plunged 35% lower in the last six months.It might not be a slam-dunk buy today, but NetEase could sure use increased media interest at the very least.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Penney suffered a 4% drop in revenue during its first quarter, and even though that came from the closing of almost 140 locations last year, comparable-store sales gains amounted to just 0.2%. Penney's bottom line swung to a loss on an adjusted basis, due largely to weak margin figures. CEO Marvin Ellison blamed unseasonably cold weather in the early spring for the shortfall, as it left shoppers unmotivated to get a jump on warmer-weather spring and summer fashions.

Penney. after the company reported first-quarter financial results. Revenue growth for the Chinese video game and e-commerce giant slowed to just 4%, and big boosts in spending sent adjusted net income down 70% compared to the year-earlier quarter. Most of the weakness came from NetEase's core video game segment, where some of the company's self-developed games didn't perform up to expectations. E-commerce efforts continued to go well, but even though that portion of the business is growing, it's not big enough to overcome challenges with the game division. Until NetEase can demonstrate that it can compete in an increasingly tough environment in China, investors could remain nervous about its prospects.Finally, shares of Jounce Therapeutics plunged 35%.

Impressive growth in revenue and profits in past years helped fuel  , and the appetite for more from consumers in China and elsewhere has seemed insatiable. Yet in every growth stock's experience, a company eventually starts to face challenges in sustaining growth, and the key question becomes what that company does to restart its growth engines.Coming into Wednesday's first-quarter financial report,  for some declines in earnings, but they expected to see solid performance on the top line. That's largely what NetEase produced, but the extent of its weaker net income was surprising. Although the company sees itself on course for a good 2018, shareholders don't seem nearly as confident that it'll be easy for NetEase to get back on a growth path for the remainder of the year.Image source: NetEase.NetEase's first-quarter results took a step down even from the troubling slowdown that it saw in the fourth quarter of 2017. Revenue in local currency terms rose just 4% from the year-ago quarter, working out to $2.26 billion. But adjusted net income was down roughly 70% in local currency terms, and the resulting $1.61 per share in adjusted earnings fell well short of the consensus forecast for $1.97 per share on the bottom line.Online games were once again the huge problem for NetEase. Revenue for the key segment dropped 18% from year-ago levels, sending gross profit down more than 20%. As we've seen in previous quarters, self-developed games such as  and  didn't perform as well as the company was counting on. Stronger contributions from other games, such as  and  , weren't enough to fully offset those declines.By contrast, the  . Revenue doubled compared to the first quarter of 2017. And despite even faster growth in expenses related to the unit, gross profit was still higher by nearly 50%. NetEase pointed to the success of Kaola.com and Yanxuan in driving results there, noting that sales discounts put some pressure on margin levels but also helped support the speed of development of the two sites.NetEase's other segments were mixed. Advertising services had relatively flat performance, with sales inching higher by 4% and driving a 7% rise in gross profit. Email and other businesses saw their revenue more than double from year-earlier levels, but costs nearly tripled, swinging the segment to post negative gross margin and adding pressure to NetEase's bottom line.CEO William Ding seemed to see everything as working out according to plan, saying, \"We believe the advancements we made across our business segments in the first quarter put us on track for a successful year.\" Ding also pointed to player loyalty and flagship game performance as key elements of NetEase's long-term success.NetEase has ambitious goals. Although the company has historically had great success with the massive multiplayer format, it's also looking more closely at reaching those who aren't interested in that style of game. With expectations that marketing costs will drop back toward normal levels, Ding sees a good opportunity for bottom-line improvement.Nevertheless, because of the way that NetEase pays dividends, investors had to suffer along with the drop in net income. NetEase will pay just $0.23 per share in dividends this quarter, down by almost 40% from the fourth-quarter payout three months ago -- making it four down quarters in a row for dividend investors.NetEase shareholders were extremely displeased with the trends that the company is seeing, and the stock fell 9% in  Thursday following the Wednesday night announcement.

From operating  's popular games such as  and  to building a solid portfolio of  , NetEase has kept its finger on the pulse of the video gaming market to clock terrific growth.NetEase also has been gradually building its e-commerce presence over the years. This is a smart move because China's online retail market is the largest in the world, surpassing an estimated $1 trillion in sales last year as per eMarketer's estimates.The good part: NetEase's e-commerce business is already gaining scale. E-commerce supplied almost 22% of its total revenue in 2017, up from 12% in the prior year. What's more, NetEase's e-commerce sales shot up 156% last year to $1.8 billion, outpacing the gaming business' 29% growth. The company is now looking for ways to grab a bigger pie of the Chinese e-commerce space, which is dominated by the likes of  and  right now. Here's how.Image Source: Getty ImagesYanxuan, the online marketplace launched by NetEase in 2016, has been instrumental in the company's booming e-commerce business. Yanxuan is NetEase's private-label e-commerce brand that aims to offer quality products to Chinese customers at a cheap price. This is evident from Yanxuan's slogan: \"A better life doesn't have to be costly.\"For instance, a pair of shoes sold for around $205 on JD.com can be bought for less than $57 on Yanxuan. The only difference is that while the shoes on JD.com are from the well-known UGG brand, the ones sold by Yanxuan are a lookalike that's made by an original design manufacturer (ODM).These ODMs are generally big contract manufacturers in China that make items for well-known global brands. NetEase contracts these ODMs directly, which allows it to cut the premium commanded by the brands, while also eliminating other overhead costs as it sells directly to the customer through its online portal. So, customers can buy a lookalike of a well-known product at a fraction of the price.NetEase has struck gold with this model, so it has expanded the product selections that it offers through Yanxuan. It was selling 7,000 items on Yanxuan in September last year, which it has now expanded to 10,000. Not surprisingly, NetEase management now expects to earn $3 billion in revenue from Yanxuan this year. This would be a massive jump from the monthly average sales of $9 million that the site was reportedly clocking a year ago.Additionally, NetEase is looking to open up offline Yanxuan stores in the next few months. This means that the company will be going up against Japanese lifestyle retailer Muji, which has already been slashing prices to try and fight cheap offerings from the likes of NetEase.Kaola, the company's cross-border e-commerce arm, can also contribute meaningfully to its e-commerce ambitions thanks to its strategy of making a play on Chinese consumers' interest in imported goods.In November last year,  reported that NetEase will be buying $11 billion worth of inventory from Europe, Japan, and the U.S. over the next three years for sale through Kaola. The company has also sidelined funds to purchase goods from Australia and South Korea.Adding such massive inventory of imported goods to Kaola will help NetEase carve a bigger slice of this e-commerce pie, driven by the growing thirst of Chinese consumers for foreign items. For instance, foreign products accounted for 63% of total sales during the recent Spring Festival that concluded in February. This trend favoring purchases of imported goods will continue as a quarter of the Chinese population is expected to make cross-border purchases by 2020, according to eMarketer.Kaola is already the leading player in China's cross-border e-commerce space with an estimated market share of 24% in the first half of 2017. NetEase believes that this market could be worth as much as $75 billion in the next three years, and the company's decision to buy such huge inventory from foreign markets should ensure that it doesn't miss the opportunity.More importantly, NetEase has been shoring up its distribution channels to ensure that consumers don't have to wait long for its goods. Starting this year, Kaola plans to use a massive automated facility to improve logistics so that it can bring down delivery times from as long as 15 to 20 days to as short as one to three days.Such improvements are necessary if Kaola wants to maintain its lead in the Chinese cross-border space, where Alibaba's Tmall Global reportedly held the second-largest position with a 20% market share. Alibaba has been aggressively pushing cross-border e-commerce, recently collaborating with Thailand to launch a distribution hub that will be built at a cost of $352 million.NetEase's rapid e-commerce growth is coming at a cost -- weak margins. This business had a gross profit margin of 10.3% in 2017, down from 12.2% in the previous year. Now, it is well-known that e-commerce businesses have very thin margins as they require a lot of investment in the form of inventory and distribution channels.So, NetEase's e-commerce business will be a drag on its profitability as mobile gaming business carries a 60%-plus gross margin. Not surprisingly, NetEase's net income in fiscal 2017 fell nearly 8%, driven by a massive 53% jump in operating expenses that was primarily attributed to the growth of the e-commerce business.In fact, NetEase's shipping and handling costs more than doubled in 2017, and they will keep increasing as the company goes all out to boost its e-commerce presence. The e-commerce business can only contribute toward NetEase's bottom line when the company is able to generate enough volume here.These aggressive investments in e-commerce should eventually boost its bottom line. For instance, if the company retains even 20% of the cross-border e-commerce market in 2021, Kaola could contribute substantially to the company's top line if the end-market turns out to be as big as NetEase projects.Kaola, in fact, could be a serious driver of NetEase's sales as the average customer transaction value on the site is \"more than double the average transaction value in the cross-border e-commerce industry,\" according to the company. Yanxuan, on the other hand, is set to report impressive growth this year, which it should be able to sustain in the long run thanks to its smart business model.In all, NetEase investors need to remain patient. NetEase's strategy could reap rich rewards in the long run given the size of the Chinese e-commerce industry.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Chinese online gaming pioneer hit another 52-week low earlier this month, and it's trading nearly 30% below the all-time highs it hit late last year.The good news is that NetEase offers up its latest financial results after Wednesday's market close, and a strong report can catapult the shares back into favor. The bad news is that investors hoping for the same thing last time out got burned. NetEase stock took a big hit after posting  in early February.Image source: NetEase.Analysts aren't holding out for much. They see revenue climbing a mere 1.5% to $2.18 billion, NetEase's weakest top-line growth since 2009. This will also likely put an end to a 15-quarter streak of at least double-digit revenue growth.The news gets even hairier on the bottom line. Wall Street pros see NetEase checking in with a profit of $1.97 a share, less than half of the $4.66 a share that it posted a year earlier. This will be the third quarter in a row with NetEase posting a decline in profitability. Investors were cool with the step back the first time. The stock actually moved sharply higher after last year's  , hitting those  a few weeks later. Things are different these days.NetEase's margins are getting squeezed as its revenue mix shifts away from the high-margin online gaming business that made it a market darling through most of the past decade. NetEase stunned investors in February when its online game services division reported an 11% drop in revenue. The decline was more than offset by a 175% surge in its newer e-commerce initiatives and a 55% pop in its older ad-supported email platform, but those offerings can't match the profitability that NetEase has enjoyed on the gaming front.Analysts have approached the stock's retreat with mixed reactions. Some firms including CLSA and Macquarie argue that the valuations are compelling after the sell-off in recent months. Other Wall Street pros aren't as easily convinced that the nearly 30% slide off of late December's highs isn't warranted. Alex Yao at JPMorgan resumed coverage of the stock with an underweight rating. He sees this as a transition year as it enters a less profitable stage of its cycle given diminishing gamer monetization trends.Absent new online gaming hits and the profit-slurping nature of its Kaola.com and Yanxuan e-commerce platforms, it will be hard for NetEase to bounce back.

Activision stock is up more than 200% over the past three years. Like Activision's customers, its shareholders have also been playing to win.Activision's competitors are also surging.\u00a0  \u00a0(NASDAQ:  ) is up 6x since the beginning of 2014 and 78% over the past 12 months.\u00a0  (NASDAQ:  ) is enjoying an amazing run as well. It is up from 25 in early 2014 to 133 - a new all-time high - this week. In general, I'd say investors are getting overly excited for the sector. But for folks who want to stay exposed to the trade, I'd argue that Activision stock is the best pick at this time. Here's why:Gaming purists don't like the way the overall market is evolving. But for investors, the switch to casual and mobile games must be respected.\u00a0  2017  found that a stunning 89% of gaming revenues on the mobile and PC platforms came from free-to-play games. In general, these types of games monetize via microtransactions (and to a lesser extent advertising) rather than earning a sales price up front.This sort of strategy gives a game a lot more revenue durability, rather than front-loading income in the quarter where the game comes out. Superdata found that 2.5 billion people, or roughly one in three humans alive globally, use free-to-play games regularly. Amazingly, console game sales made up just $8.3 billion in revenue out of the approximately $100 billion market. This gives Activision a big leg up versus, for example, Take-Two - which is much more reliant on traditional game sales.Unfortunately for the U.S. video game-makers, a large portion of the free-to-play game market is located in Asia. These users have largely gravitated to locally-produced games there from the likes of\u00a0  (OTCMKTS:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ). However, of the U.S. game-makers, Activision has potentially the most upside in the mobile market, due to the timely purchase of\u00a0  .Activision's King Digital division continues to dominate on the U.S. apps chart ranked by gross revenues. King has had at least two top 10 games for 18 quarters in a row. For the past two quarters, two of its  games have ranked No. 1 and No. 2 for highest-grossing games. These microtransaction-based revenue streams have much higher profit margins than other games, driving up Activision's overall profitability, and making the business more consistent and less reliant on new hit releases.Activision released earnings this past week. They topped expectations, with earnings-per-share coming in at 65 cents. That was way above the consensus estimate of 50 cents. The company's revenues also beat expectations solidly, and posted a 15% year-over-year growth rate.Activision stock initially dipped 5% on the earnings release. Investors were looking for blowout numbers. But after further reflection, people jumped back into the stock. It's now several points above where it was when the earnings release came out. And it's understandable why. That's the company's fifth-straight earnings beat. Over the next year, analysts expect earnings to nearly triple to $3 per share versus the last 12 months at $1.19.For the year, Activision raised guidance moderately, although it offered a soft outlook for this quarter in particular. Regardless, the overall earnings momentum here is strong. With a multi-quarter growth story ahead, you'd expect Activision stock to trend higher in the absence of other intervening factors.There's a decent chance that video game stocks, as a sector, will retreat somewhat in coming quarters. They'll all run up a ton, and it seems unlikely that they can all keep rallying simultaneously. Sure, the gaming market is expanding quickly, but so is the competition, especially from overseas firms and independent developers.Activision stock is the cheapest of the big three American video game producers. But don't mistake cheapest for cheap. Take-Two is at 70x trailing, 24x forward. EA is at 36x trailing, 27x forward. Against those comparisons, Activision wins out at 60x trailing, 24x forward. But they're all vulnerable to a sell-off if investors focus on valuations.Additionally, as mentioned above, the Asian gamemakers are taking much of the market share in the fastest-growing segments of the industry. Titles such as\u00a0  and\u00a0  are capturing a large chunk of the pie, leaving Activision and other U.S. game-makers out. On top of that, the big viral game of the moment,\u00a0  , is produced by privately-held  . Epic, however, is 40% owned by Tencent.More specifically to Activision, its legacy money spinner,\u00a0  , continues to slowly decline. This is a well-known issue for Activision stock, as  is an old property that's been trailing off for years now. Still, it's a major source of high-quality subscription revenue that will continue to fade out.I view all the American video game stocks as overpriced at the moment. However, if you're inclined to own one of them, despite the stretched valuations, Activision is probably the best bet. Of the big three, Activision has the clearest earnings growth story and is pulling solid numbers in mobile gaming.That's not to say Activision stock is without risk. It's quite expensive, and should be expected to sell-off sharply in the face of a broader market correction. Additionally, competition from Asian gamemakers for mobile and American ones for the console market is only intensifying. As far as 2018 goes, though, ATVI stock should outrun the competition.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the iShares MSCI All Country Asia ex Japan ETF (Symbol: AAXJ) where we have detected an approximate $61.7 million dollar outflow -- that's a 1.3% decrease week over week (from 63,800,000 to 63,000,000).

This makes NetEase the only Chinese publisher that stands a chance against Tencent's gaming empire.NetEase's Fantasy Westward Journey. Image source: Google Play.Unfortunately, Tencent has much deeper pockets than NetEase. Tencent finished last year with 105.7 billion RMB ($16.9 billion) in cash and equivalents, compared to 43.2 billion RMB ($6.9 billion) for NetEase. That superior cash position, combined with Tencent's stakes in  which it can bring back to China, make it a clear threat to NetEase's long-term growth.Tencent's WeChat monthly active users (MAUs) rose 11% annually to 989 million last quarter. WeChat's initial growth nearly sank Weibo, often dubbed the \"  of China,\" before the microblogging site rebounded by locking in more celebrities and brands and securing more hardware partnerships. Weibo finished last quarter with 392 million MAUs.But this battle isn't over. Tencent is striking back at Weibo by luring top celebrities and brands to official accounts on WeChat. It's also dabbling with live video broadcasts, which have been a major source of sales growth for Weibo in recent quarters.iQiyi, Baidu's former streaming video unit which was recently spun off  , often claims to be the top video streaming platform in China, with over 420 million MAUs on PCs and mobile devices and over 50 million paid subscribers.Image source: Getty Images.However, Tencent Video, which was launched in 2011, hit 457 million MAUs last August, according to QuestMobile and Jefferies. Tencent stated that the platform had 43 million paid subscribers last November. iQiyi and Tencent Video are  than Alibaba's Youku Tudou, which hit 325 million MAUs last August.As for music, Tencent Music -- which merges QQ Music, KuGou, and Kuwo into a single ecosystem -- controls over three-quarters of China's  market, according to DCCI. Its only notable competitor is NetEase Cloud Music, which holds a 16% share.Tencent's WeChat Pay and Alipay, which is owned by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial, are the two largest mobile payment platforms in China. AliPay controls about 54% of the market, according to research firm Analysys, while WeChat Pay controls 40%.Alibaba is still the top e-commerce player in China, but Tencent owns a big stake in its biggest rival,  . Tencent has also partnered with a growing  , including  and  , to expand its payments ecosystem. Alibaba is fighting back with big brick-and-mortar investments of its own, but Tencent remains a stubbornly  .Lastly, Tencent has been expanding its cloud platform, which already services over a million developers. The platform, which is supported by its QQ and WeChat platforms, is smaller than Alibaba and Baidu's cloud offerings, but it's rapidly growing.Last quarter, Tencent reported that revenue from its \"other\" businesses surged 121% annually to 14.1 billion RMB ($2.2 billion), fueled by the growth of its cloud and payment services.Tencent's expansion in the cloud complements its investments in new AI technologies, which crunch all the data it gathers from its social media and gaming ecosystem. That's why Tencent poached Baidu's AI expert Zhang Tong to lead its own AI Lab -- which consists of 50 AI scientists and 200 engineers -- last year.Tencent won't crush NetEase, Weibo, iQiyi, Alibaba, or Baidu anytime soon. But investors in these companies should understand that Tencent is a growing beast, and that its expansion could cause pain for companies caught in the blast zone.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

And chances are if you are a longtime Motley Fool member, I would hope you own at least, let's say, two or three of these.I had the pleasure here in Washington, D.C., last week of MC'ing an event at the National Building Museum for 500 Tar Heels. That's right, it was a University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill alumni gathering and a celebration of the campaign that the school is endeavoring to run to raise literally billions of dollars for the University of North Carolina, but in front of that audience with my Fool cap on, I picked a few stocks and suggested that these would be good stocks for my fellow Tar Heels for the next three-plus years.So, I'm pulling that list from that event to share with you this week. Yup, I own each of these stocks and let's kick it off alphabetically as I tend to do, unless we're trying to be cute and use an acrostic and name our series after a month. Nope, this one's going to go back to the traditional alphabetical order by company name.Stock No. 1: The first one up is  (NASDAQ: ATVI) . ATVI is the ticker symbol. Activision Blizzard is, for me anyway, the worldwide leader. There's some good competition [  and others] in interactive entertainment.Now, the company's not as dominant in China as some very large Chinese companies, so you and I could debate who the real worldwide leader is. The good news is with a stock like  , which is a big Chinese video game maker and one of those conglomerates, we own that one, too. I like to think that we've got this industry cornered, but I love the future of interactive entertainment, whether it's playing digital card games like  , which I do almost every day, even though it's in its fourth or fifth year. I love  to great games like  , which has been a huge hit and is the big e-sport of choice with clubs these days.You might be following the  , some of you. Cities in the U.S. and abroad paying tens of millions of dollars to have the rights to have a team that's competing in  So, e-sports is a big part of Activision Blizzard.  The list goes on of this company's properties. Love Activision Blizzard. Bobby Kotick, the CEO. I've talked about him before on this show. He's a brilliant asset allocator. He's not even a video gamer.He also, by the way, had a cameo appearance in one of my favorite films,  when Bill James's great story and Michael Lewis's non-fiction book was turned into a movie with Brad Pitt. You'll see Bobby Kotick playing the owner of the Oakland A's in an early scene in that movie. A little trivia tip for Activision Blizzard fans. Anyway, ATVI is Stock No. 1.Stock No. 2: Stock No. 2, alphabetically, pun intended, is Alphabet. Alphabet, of course, often known as  with lots of other stuff attached. The ticker symbol is even just still GOOG. I had a good exchange with my friend Scott Phillips, who helps run Motley Fool Australia, and he was taking me to task by email, in a fun way, for organizing alphabetically by ticker. And Scott said -- and quite rightly [I agree, Scott] -- \"Aren't we much more about the companies, themselves, and the businesses? Tickers are more for trader talk and people who don't necessarily think about the businesses, often, but the tickers more.\"And I agree with you, Scott, so I'm going to order this one by company name and I expect to continue that going forward. And I know if I screw up, first of all, I'll try to blame Rick Engdahl because he's my filter. He's my whipping boy. He's my producer. I would immediately try to blame Rick. But if he didn't accept the blame, or people started realizing my game, here, then you could hold me accountable, Scott, and say, \"Hey, Dave! You screwed that up. Make sure you keep these company names ordered alphabetically.\"So, thank you, Scott! And yes, thank you Alphabet for being such an amazing company! A company, as I said to my gathered Tar Heels last week, that a lot of us associate, naturally, Alphabet with Google today and search, but 20 years from now our kids will think about Google as the AI company, the artificial intelligence company as artificial intelligence, as Kevin Kelly said on this show a month or two back. It begins to become a ubiquitous thing around us. You know how Wi-Fi is kind of ubiquitous these days and 30 years ago nobody knew what Wi-Fi was?Well, 30 years from now Kevin Kelly says [I agree with him], AI will be all around us like Wi-Fi, and people will wonder what the world was like before that, and that's the future we're moving into and Alphabet is the leader.Stock No. 3: Let's go back to the well. So, April last year what was the \"I?\" Quick quiz at home? That's right. It was  (NASDAQ: ISRG) . I own the company, and in front of my gathered fellow Heels last week, I put Intuitive Surgical on this list, as well, so I present it for you again today. It reminds us to continue to add to our winners. It was a winner a year ago. It had a three for one stock split, something that I don't personally care about. I don't think we should spend a lot of time talking about stock splits. I realize some people think they're exciting or are confused by them.I'll just point out that Intuitive Surgical, which has split a few times over our nearly 15 years of acquaintance. I like that stock just as much today, over the next 15 years, as I did 15 years ago. In fact, Intuitive Surgical is more clearly in the lead with more resources today than it was 15 years ago.This is a company that spends about $250 million a year just on R&D inventing the future. A lot of upstart competitors would dream of having that as their revenues or, even more, their profits. Well, Intuitive Surgical is spending that much just on R&D. Love the company and I look forward to an increasingly minimally invasive future.Stock No. 4: We're down to the M's.  (NASDAQ: MTCH) . Match.com. A lot of older people my age in our 50's or so, we grew up with that over the last 10 or 20 years. To me that's almost like the LinkedIn, but for dating. That's kind of the more corporate, professional world site, but many other people know and use Tinder, which is maybe for a younger generation. I'm sure it's used by people of all ages. Never by me, as a happily married man.If you've ever heard of Tinder or you like Tinder, guess what? You could be a shareowner in the company that owns Tinder, and beyond just Match.com and Tinder, Match Group has 30 to 40 other sites appealing to many different types of people helping them find other people that they might fall in love with. Maybe get married one day. This is something that sounded bizarre 25 years ago and yet, meeting other people online and forming long-term relationships is increasingly in the top three of how we, as humans, interact with each other. Match Group is the out-and-out leader. Love the company. That's Stock No. 4.Stock No. 5: And finally, at my speech last week, my joke was the \"U\" stock [I went down to the letter \"U\"], and it was University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill we hope you'll give money, and that was the joke. So, I don't think that's appropriate for this five-stock sampler. I think I do need to present a fifth and final stock.Let's go to Z and let's go with  (NASDAQ: ZG) . Zillow and Zillow Group. You know, Zillow has about 150 million people who click in on a monthly basis. They're looking at listings of their house, of other houses in their neighborhood or places that they might want to move. Or just clicking around and looking at celebs' dream houses. All these things can happen on Zillow but, increasingly, the company is clearly the leader and is the friend of realtors.And last week the company announced it's going to start buying homes, itself. So, you might end up selling your house over Zillow to Zillow. It was a move that was met with some consternation. The stock actually dropped 5% that day, but whether or not the iBuyer approach works for Zillow, which I think it probably will [I think they're very smart], this is the clear leader as we talk about finding properties online, which is a big, robust market and will be for years to come so let's close it out with my fifth stock, Zillow.And there you have it. The 14th five-stock sampler we've done, here, on  . I hope and trust that these stocks will perform over the following three years. I never insist that they do well in one year, and I'll be astonished if we can beat the market once again, here, because I am way overrated at this point. But they're great companies. It will be fun. I own these stocks and as I said, to kick it off, I hope you own them, too. I think you should.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["hina's e-commerce market is dominated by  (NYSE: BABA) and  (NASDAQ: JD) . Alibaba's Taobao is the country's largest C2C (consumer-to-consumer) marketplace, and its Tmall platform leads the B2C (business-to-consumer) market. JD ranks second in the B2C market.Many smaller C2C and B2C rivals have faded away over the past few years. However, an overlooked underdog,  (NASDAQ: NTES) , has been quietly gaining ground. NetEase is known primarily as a  publisher, but it also owns the e-commerce platforms Kaola and Yanxuan.Image source: Getty Images.Kaola, which focuses on cross-border purchases, is often dismissed as an also-ran in China's crowded e-commerce market. But two years ago NetEase launched Yanxuan, a private label marketplace that sells clothing, furniture, and appliances from Chinese suppliers of international brands like  's Gucci,  , and  ' (NYSE: DECK) UGG.Instead of selling brand name products like Alibaba and JD, Yanxuan sells unbranded products that are identical to their branded counterparts. For example, an original pair of UGG boots costs about $200 on JD and Tmall. However, a pair of unbranded, identical boots from an \"UGG manufacturer\" costs about $45 on Yanxuan.Yanxuan's portfolio now includes over 10,000 products from these manufacturers. The marketplace's growth boosted NetEase's e-commerce revenues by 160% to 11.7 billion RMB ($1.8 billion) last year, which accounted for 22% of the company's top line. NetEase expects its e-commerce revenues to hit $3 billion this year.$3 billion is a tiny figure compared to the $39 billion and $74 billion in revenue which analysts expect  to generate, respectively, this year. Nonetheless, Alibaba and JD already responded to Yanxuan with their own private label sites.Alibaba launched Taobao Xinxuan last year, while JD introduced its Jingzao brand in January. However, neither Alibaba nor JD claims that its private label products are made by suppliers of top international brands.Alibaba and JD avoided that claim for an obvious reason: They didn't want their marketplaces to be associated with counterfeit goods. Yanxuan's claim that its products are made by the same manufacturers of leading international brands suggests that their suppliers are stealing designs and IP to sell unbranded products -- which would likely violate their manufacturing contracts.Speaking to  , American Apparel & Footwear Association VP Steve Lamar raised concerns about Yanxuan's \"potential theft of intellectual property,\" while an UGG spokeswoman noted that \"Yanxuan's promotion would mislead consumers to believe they are buying authentic UGG products.\"Image source: Getty Images.NetEase's strategy with Yanxuan also contradicts Alibaba and JD's attempts to purge their marketplaces of counterfeit products. JD often claims that its tighter control over its fulfillment and logistics network blocks out more counterfeit products than Alibaba, which  on C2C and B2C transactions fulfilled by third-party logistics providers.That's why JD's stock tumbled in mid-March after renowned Chinese novelist Liu Liu accused JD's cross-border marketplace, JD Worldwide, of selling counterfeit products to a friend. JD stated that the customer received the wrong product with a similar name rather than a \"fake\", but the damage was done.As Chinese consumers with rising incomes start scrutinizing the authenticity of their products, the flaws in Yanxuan's business model will become more apparent. Lower income shoppers might still buy Yanxuan's goods, but NetEase is shouldering a lot of risk to grow the business.International brands could drop Yanxuan's suppliers, customers could demand proof that their goods are actually made by those suppliers, or the company could be pilloried by the Chinese government, which has been cracking down on counterfeit goods over the past few years. Alibaba and JD -- which likely see Yanxuan's reckless strategy as a threat to their own businesses -- could run marketing campaigns likening \"unbranded\" goods to counterfeits.NetEase will likely generate big gains from Yanxuan over the next few quarters, but that growth could quickly evaporate. Instead of expanding Yanxuan's marketplace, NetEase should figure out how to legitimize it before it becomes the \"Tmall of knockoffs.\"When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and NetEase wasn't one of them!

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Chicago, IL - April 11, 2018 -  highlights  as the Bull of the Day and  as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on  ,  and  .Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: has found its niche as health and wellness trends have boosted sales of its sparkling water system. This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) is expected to grow revenue by the double digits in 2018.SodaStream makes and distributes home beverage carbonation systems called Sparkling Water Makers. These allow consumers to turn tap water into sparkling water and flavored sparkling water. Products are available at more than 80,000 retail stores in 45 countries.On Feb 14, SodaStream reported fourth quarter results and crushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 45%. The company reported $1.13 versus the consensus of $0.78.It was the 10th earnings beat in a row as the company has turned around the business.The holiday quarter was strong with revenue jumping 19.6% to $157.7 million from $131.8 million a year ago.The hottest markets were Germany, Canada, Australia and the US.Operating income rose 36% to $25.7 million, an all-time record.For the year, revenue rose 14.1% to $543.4 million from $476.1 million in 2016.It's plan to expand household penetration and increase usage of the home carbonation system has been working.SodaStream has been generating a nice cash flow. As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had cash and investments of $155.2 million, up from $57.3 million at the end of December 2016.SodaStream gave bullish guidance for 2018 with revenue expected to rise another 12%.Earnings guidance is forecast to be 5% higher than 2017 or $3.29.However, the analysts estimates are already above the company's guidance.2 estimates have risen in the last 60 days to $3.42 from $3.24.2019 estimates have also been on the move higher with two rising in the last 2 months. That pushed up the 2019 Zacks Consensus Estimate to $3.93 from $3.44.On Mar 12, SodaStream announced it would release its newest automatic sparkling water maker, the Fizzi One Touch, in the United States this summer.The system will be available as of June 2018 on  in either piano black or pure white.It will be available in retail locations in September 2018. : continues to see shrinking earnings due to changes in the video game industry. This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) is expected to see an 8% decline in earnings in fiscal 2018.GameStop operates over 7,200 stores in 14 countries. It operates in digital sales including Game Informer magazine and ThinkGeek. It also has a Technology Brands segment which includes 1,400 Spring Mobile AT&T and Simply Mac stores.Spring Mobile sells AT&T products including DIRECTV and Simply Mac sells the full line of Apple products including laptops, tablets and smartphones.On Mar 28, GameStop reported its fiscal fourth quarter 2017 results and beat the Zacks Consensus reporting $2.02 versus the consensus of $1.96.It has beaten 8 out of the last 9 quarters, so the earnings beats aren't a problem.The fourth quarter was driven by Black Friday and holiday promotions as well as growth in the hardware business, especially with the Nintendo Switch.Total global sales rose 15% to $3.5 billion with comparable store sales up 12.2%. The US saw 14.2% while international comparables were 8.3%.New hardware sales was the driver, rising 44.8% thanks to demand for Nintendo Switch, while new software sales rose 12.4%.Collectibles sales was another bright spot, as those rose 22.8%, driven by continued expansion of licensed merchandise offerings and targeted promotions during the holidays.Pre-owned sales, however, slumped, falling 2.6%.Given the tough year-over-year comparable comps of the Nintendo Switch, which launched in the first half of 2017, the company expects earnings to be substantially back half weighted.It's looking for a range of $3.00 to $3.35.Comparable store sales, which don't include the technology brands, are expected to be flat to down 5%.Given the guidance, which was more bullish than the Zacks Consensus, it's not surprising that the analysts have cut their estimates.5 estimates were cut in the last 30 days pushing the Zacks Consensus down to $3.07 from $3.33. Apparently, the analysts are not optimistic that earnings will be on the high end of the company's range, hence the earnings revisions.That's a decline of 8% as GameStop made $3.34 in 2017.Estimates were also cut for fiscal 2019, pushing down the consensus to $2.76. That's another decline of 10%.GameStop is paying a dividend currently yielding 11.2%.It's among the highest on the Street.The company has said that the dividend is safe, for now.It expects to do $300 million in free cash flow in fiscal 2018 which can easily pay for the dividend given the share count.Chinese ADRs are extremely popular investment options for U.S. investors, with no company attracting more attention than Alibaba. The e-commerce behemoth is, of course, one of the largest publicly-traded tech companies in the word, but the popularity of the stock also comes from its use as method to gauge the health of China's economy and invest in its consumer marketplace.Alibaba is a dominant force in global retail and an exciting growth pick in industries like financial services, smart vehicles, artificial intelligence, and digital media. Considering the company's expansion opportunities and rising popularity among investors, it makes sense that the stock has soared a remarkable 57% over the past year-making it one of Wall Street's hottest options.But this strong momentum has also stretched Alibaba's valuation, adding some of the risk that typically comes alongside high-growth investing. The stock is trading with a Forward P/E of about 25, which is a noticeable premium to the broader market average. What's worse, BABA's P/S of 12.8 and P/B of 6.6 are in runaway territory.To traditional value investors, these ratios make BABA look like an expensive stock-one that the market is overvaluing compared to the company's actual earnings, revenue, and book value.In contrast, these investors consider \"cheap\" stocks to be those that offer better bang for their buck in terms of these financial metrics. After all, buying a stock makes one a partial owner of that company, so investors are inherently interested in these measurable fundamentals.There are plenty of investors willing to pay a premium for the unique exposure that Alibaba offers, but there are a few traditionally \"cheaper\" options that compete with the company in certain markets. Here's a closer look at two of those stocks.Baidu is also of China's largest internet companies, owning a more than 75% share of the country's search engine market. Here's a look at its forward 12-month earnings multiple versus that of Alibaba over the past year:BIDU and BABA have traded with a similar earnings multiple for the better part of a year, but we can see that Baidu is offering a slight discount compared to Alibaba right now. Alibaba bulls would argue that the company deserves its premium, but Baidu is working to break into new growth markets as well.For instance, Baidu is reportedly in the process of recruiting investors for its wholly-owned finance unit, Baidu Financial Services Group. This unit operates Baidu Wallet, a digital wealth management platform and online credit service. An expansion of this unit would be a direct blow to Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial, which operates the Alipay mobile payments service and offers wealth management and insurance products.Alipay is frequently cited as one of Alibaba's key growth opportunities, so the fact that investors can get exposure to a comparable catalyst at a lower valuation might pique the interest of those concerned about maximizing value.NetEase is smaller company with a tighter focus on gaming and digital content, and as we can see, the stock has consistently traded at a significant discount to Alibaba recently:Alibaba clearly presents a more diversified exposure to the Chinese economy than NetEase, but there is likely another reason that investors would be willing to pay more BABA right now: analyst sentiment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NetEase's full-year EPS estimates has shed $2.32 within the past 90 days, with 100% agreement to the downside among revising analysts. Overall, analysts now expect the company to witness EPS growth of just 1.2% this year. This negative revision activity has earned NTES a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Each individual investor has their preferred strategies for valuing stocks, and the Chinese internet space is one that sees a number of these theories take precedent. Alibaba's valuation might be stretched right now, but those that believe in the company's growth initiatives will say that premium is justified.

For the First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund ETF (Symbol: TDIV), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $41.34 per unit.With TDIV trading at a recent price near $35.19 per unit, that means that analysts see 17.47% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.

This escalation of tensions stoked fears of a trade war, and sank stocks in both countries.Some of that fear is justified. The tariffs could hurt US companies, which rely heavily on China, as well as Chinese companies, which export products to the US. However, companies which don't rely heavily on trade between the two countries -- including all-American or all-Chinese companies -- should be insulated from those headwinds.Image source: Getty Images.Today, I'll take a closer look at three high-growth Chinese stocks that remain far from the tariff blast zone --  (NASDAQ: BIDU) ,  (NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) , and  (NASDAQ: NTES) .Baidu controls about 60% of China's online search market. Its expanding ecosystem also includes portal sites, cloud services, mobile payments, and online-to-offline (O2O) services. It also owns iQiyi, one of the top video streaming sites in China, which it will soon spin off  . It's also expanding into adjacent markets like artificial intelligence, driverless cars, virtual assistants, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.Baidu was founded nearly two decades ago, but its growth remains robust. Analysts expect its revenue to rise 17% this year and 20% next year. However, its earnings are expected to drop 7% this year  the divestment of its non-core businesses (like mobile games and its food delivery services), changes to its accounting methods, and higher operating expenses at iQiyi.But after Baidu moves past those headwinds and completes its spin-off of iQiyi, analysts expect its earnings to surge 24% next year. Baidu's stock isn't expensive at 25 times forward earnings, and the company enjoys a wide moat as it remains one of the default choices for internet advertising in China.Tencent is the top social networking player in China and the biggest video game publisher in the world. It owns WeChat, the  most popular mobile messaging app in China with 989 million monthly active users (MAUs), as well as the older messaging app QQ and the social network Qzone.WeChat's mobile app. Image source: iTunes.Tencent is expanding WeChat into an all-in-one \"super app\" for O2O services like ride hailing, deliveries, and online purchases. It links all that together with its mobile payment platform WeChat Pay. Its gaming portfolio includes hit titles like  ,  , and  . Tencent also controls the top music streaming platform in China, and its video platform Tencent Video is iQiyi's  .Tencent's stock recently stumbled due to several issues. Its fourth quarter earnings, released on March 21, were solid, but some investors were spooked by margin pressures related to the expansion of its ecosystem. South African media company  , one of Tencent's top investors, then sold 2% of its shares to raise capital. Lastly, the tariff headlines exacerbated the sell-off.Nonetheless, analysts still expect Tencent to grow its sales by 42% this year and 33% next year. Its earnings could also rise 18% this year and another 33% next year. The stock isn't cheap at 37 times forward earnings, but it remains one of the top tech plays in China.Tencent's most resilient rival is NetEase. NetEase's top mobile games -- which include  and  -- nearly match Tencent's  in terms of gross revenues on iOS and Android.NetEase's Onmyoji. Image source: Google Play.Its music platform, NetEase Cloud Music, is also the second largest music streaming platform in China after Tencent Music (QQ Music, Kugou, and Kuwo), according to research firm DCCI. NetEase is notably the  (electronic dance music), according to iiMedia.NetEase generates most of its revenues from mobile games, but some of its revenue still comes from older PC games, its e-commerce platform Kaola, and other online services. Wall Street expects the company's revenues to rise 29% this year and another 25% next year.Its earnings, which were previously weighed down by a transition from higher-margin PC games to lower-margin mobile ones, are still expected to rise 11% this year and 16% next year. Those are impressive growth rates for a stock that trades at just 19 times forward earnings.Investors should keep up with the recent tariff developments, but they shouldn't panic. Baidu, Tencent, and NetEase's businesses should all flourish regardless of trade conflicts between the US and China, so investors should consider any big dips to be good buying opportunities.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The e-commerce behemoth is not only one of the largest publicly-traded tech companies in the world, but also a popular method for gauging the health of China's economy and investing in the growth of its consumer marketplace.Alibaba is clearly a dominant force in the global retail sector, as well as an interesting growth play in industries like financial services, smart vehicles, artificial intelligence, and digital media. And considering the company's expansion opportunities and rising popularity among investors, it makes sense that BABA has been among the hottest stocks in the world over the past year, having gained about 73% over this timeframe.Alibaba has worked to prove that it deserves this type of momentum by delivering solid earnings and revenue results. This trend is expected to continue, with our latest consensus estimates calling for the company to see EPS growth of 50% and net sales growth of 66% in the current fiscal year.Nevertheless, Alibaba still feels like a speculative stock. BABA is currently trading with a Forward P/E ratio of 26.8, coming in well above the broader market average and slightly higher than the 23.1 average of its wholesale retail peers.But considering how unique Alibaba is, this might not paint a complete picture. After all, investors interested in this stock are likely placing a certain premium on the continued potential of the Chinese internet and consumer markets, which are still growing at rates not seen in many comparable economies.With that said, a quick glance at Alibaba's historical Forward P/E reveals a much more interesting story about the stock's valuation:This \"peer group\" includes four other major Chinese internet stocks: JD.com  , Baidu  , Tencent  , and NetEase  . None of these companies are structured exactly like Alibaba, but they all compete in various markets and help show how investors value China's internet industry in a more general sense.There are few key trends to notice here. First of all, BABA is currently trading with its lowest in valuation in terms of forward earnings since its historic IPO in 2014. While the stock might still be \"expensive\" compared to the broader market, investors have never been able to purchase it at this cheap of a level.The second thing we notice is that Alibaba has traditionally traded at a premium compared to its Chinese internet peers. However, over the past month or so, the average Forward P/E of this group has risen while BABA's has slumped-and now for the first time in at least a year, Alibaba is trading at a discount to the rest of this group.However, Alibaba is actually not the cheapest stock in this set. In fact, BIDU's current P/E is slightly lower, and NTES is trading at a significant discount. Here's how Alibaba's valuation compares to that of online gaming giant NetEase:As we can see, BABA has traditionally traded at a premium to NTES, and although that gap has narrowed slightly over the past few months, the difference in valuation is certainly still noticeable.Of course, Alibaba bulls will be quick to point out the reasons for this premium. For one, the company gives investors more diversified exposure to the Chinese economy than NetEase, which is focused on specific markets like gaming and digital content. It is also possible that Alibaba has more exciting growth potential because of its investments in new revenue sources.BABA is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), as well as an \"A\" grade for Growth in our Style Scores system. The company is clearly set to see massive earnings and revenue growth this year, but recent analyst activity has been mixed. Within the past 60 days, we have seen five positive revisions and four negative revisions to Alibaba's full-year earnings estimates.Alibaba will likely maintain its lightning-fast expansion for the next few years at the very least, but mixed analyst sentiment can cause short-term headwinds for the stock.

Investors saw the unexpected drop in the company's online gaming revenue and decided that was enough to hit the \"sell\" button despite a robust performance on the whole.NetEase beat expectations on revenue and earnings. Its top line jumped 21% year over year to $2.25 billion, while consensus estimates were calling for $2.2 billion in revenue. The Chinese company also sprung a surprise on the bottom line, reporting adjusted earnings of $2.18 per share as compared to the $2.11 consensus forecast.The problem, however, was a 10.6% drop in the company's online gaming segment, which supplies close to 55% of its total revenue. By comparison, NetEase had reported a massive year-over-year jump in online gaming revenue in the year-ago quarter.

For instance, the company clearly stated that it kicked off the early phases of monetizing  and  in December, and will start monetizing  in the first half of 2018.NetEase doesn't provide a forward-looking guidance. But if its monetization efforts are correct, then the online gaming business should start picking up the pace going forward. So, investors shouldn't be scared by the recent drop in video gaming revenue, as the company seems to be figuring out how to monetize the millions of users it has scored with its new titles.More important, NetEase doesn't rely solely on its online gaming business anymore, as evident from the rapid growth of its e-commerce revenue.NetEase's e-commerce business was on fire during the holiday quarter. Revenue from this segment shot up 175% year over year last quarter, driven by the company's efforts to expand its product portfolio. As it stands, the e-commerce business now supplies close to 32% of its total revenue, and it could keep improving thanks to NetEase's recent moves.The company is focusing on giving users a wide range of items to choose from its e-commerce portals -- Kaola.com and Yanxuan -- and has been investing heavily in the businesses. Last November, NetEase announced that it will be buying $11 billion worth of inventory over the next three years from overseas markets such as the U.S., Europe, and Japan in a bid to attack the e-commerce opportunity in China.The company is also boosting its infrastructure by opening warehouses in the country to shore up its fulfillment channels. China's e-commerce market could be worth $956 billion in 2022 as compared to less than $500 billion last year, so NetEase preparing itself to make the most of the opportunity in this space.However, the growth of the e-commerce business will negatively impact the company's margins. More specifically, NetEase's gross margin from e-commerce stood at just 7.4% last quarter, a sharp drop from the 12.5% gross margin reported in the year-ago period.NetEase's aggressive e-commerce push is coming at the cost of its margins because of the huge investments it's making -- such as the massive increase in selling and marketing outlay -- which is why its earnings fell last quarter. But the company can make up for the drop in margins by keeping up the rapid top-line expansion.This is probably why Yahoo! Finance analysts expect the company's earnings per share to increase over the next two years despite a deteriorating margin profile. Investors shouldn't overreact, as NetEase is sitting on a number of catalysts that could boost its growth going forward. What's more, the recent crash in its stock price has made the stock cheap -- it trades at just 18.7 times last year's earnings, well below the 47.4 industry average.The recent drop in NetEase shares could be an opportunity for investors to take advantage of both the growth in e-commerce and video gaming in China.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Five years ago only 46% of the Chinese population had internet access, a number that's expected to jump to 56% this year. This growth rate might seem slow at first, but China's huge population means that even a small percentage jump translates into millions of additional users.During the first half of 2017, China's internet population increased by 20 million, or 1.3%, as compared to the end of 2016.

In fact, 95% of China's internet population uses a mobile device to get online. Not surprisingly, the country is now crazy about mobile gaming, and users are spending a lot on in-game purchases.According to App Annie, mobile gaming in China has grown from a $3 billion industry in 2015 to $11 billion last year. NetEase has used this trend to its advantage, clocking terrific revenue and earnings growth over the past few years, as shown below: data by The Chinese mobile gaming market should keep getting better since both smartphone and internet penetration in the country have a lot of room for growth. Newzoo estimates that China's smartphone penetration is currently just under 52%, so as more users get smartphones and go online, demand for mobile gaming will increase.Asian market research company Niko Partners estimates that China's mobile gaming revenue will hit $23.5 billion by 2021. NetEase is in a strong position to tap into this growth -- with an impressive portfolio of mobile gaming titles --  in the recently reported quarter.

The stock trades at just 20 times forward earnings, significantly lower than the 55 industry average, making it an attractive bet on China's mobile gaming growth.Baidu missed the mobile revolution in China despite being the country's leading search engine provider, but it has a new way to tap China's growing internet penetration. The company has  to get toBaidu has been aggressively investing in AI in several areas, such as self-driving cars,  , and  . Its moves in these markets are beginning to bear fruit -- revenue in fiscal 2017 increased 20% year over year. Looking ahead, Baidu can sustain its impressive growth thanks to the integration of AI in fast-growing areas such as the cloud.The company released a hybrid cloud platform last September to help enterprise customers integrate and deploy more than 60 types of AI capabilities in their operations. Using Baidu's platform, customers can perform tasks such as image, facial and speech recognition; and video content analysis.Baidu's customers are already using this new platform to improve their businesses, allowing Baidu to consolidate a share of the fast-growing cloud computing market in China, which is expected to be worth $103 billion by 2020.The company is also seeking to tap into China's growing hunger for video content. Its content investments in its online video platform -- iQiyi -- increased 70% in fiscal 2017 to $2.1 billion as it tries for a bigger share of this booming market. Baidu is currently in a fight with  for leadership in this space, so it has decided to file for an initial public offering to float iQiyi in the U.S.It's being reported that Baidu plans to raise around $1 billion with this offering, which should allow it to bolster its position in China's online video streaming market, which is projected to be worth almost $18 billion by 2020.Investors looking to take advantage of China's rapid internet growth should definitely consider Baidu, especially given its attractive valuation.

NetEase's news wasn't as good as many had expected, and a substantial drop in revenue from online games wasn't well received.Let's take a closer look at NetEase to see what it told investors about its recent experience.Image source: Getty Images.On their face, NetEase's fourth-quarter results weren't so bad. Revenue rose 21% in local currency terms to the equivalent of $2.25 billion, which was stronger than the $2.2 billion that most investors were looking to see. Adjusted net income of $288.8 million translated to adjusted earnings of $2.18 per share, which was a bit higher than the $2.11 consensus forecast among those following the stock.But the big surprise came in NetEase's segment breakdown. The key online game services division saw revenue fall almost 11%. That wiped out a good part of the gains from e-commerce, which jumped 175% from year-ago levels, and email, which was higher by 55%. The advertising services segment also bounced back, posting gains of slightly more than 10%. Yet the size of the online game division is so large that its losses were instrumental in holding back NetEase's overall growth.NetEase said decreased revenue from self-developed mobile games such as  were primarily responsible for the fall in online video game revenue. Mobile games made up 68% of net revenue, continuing to rise from previous-year figures. Strength in the automobile, internet services, and real estate sectors helped to boost advertising services revenue, while the rapid development of NetEase's Kaola.com and Yanxuan sites boosted the company's take from e-commerce.NetEase also  . Operating expenses jumped 66% from the fourth quarter of 2016, as selling and marketing expenses almost doubled. Research and development costs and overhead expenses were also up sharply. Gross profit also fell as NetEase's cost of sales climbed disproportionately.CEO William Ding tried to put the results in context. \"Although a few mobile titles such as  and the mobile version of  experienced a decline,\" Ding said, \"we have introduced new content for these games to attract players.\" The CEO also pointed to investments to build high-growth parts of its business as bearing out well for the company.NetEase is still optimistic despite its setback. The company hopes that promotions to support battle arena games will translate to new sales and extend its reach beyond its core audience. Ding also noted that new titles and partnerships with industry leaders could make its video game offerings even more robust in 2018. Combined with e-commerce expansion, NetEase wants to boost its scope and be an even more important part of the Chinese internet market.Yet NetEase disappointed investors with a big dividend decrease. The company will pay out just $0.38 per share, down by nearly half from what it paid in the third quarter and marking the third straight decline this year.NetEase shareholders weren't happy with the report, and the stock plunged 7% in after-hours trading following the announcement.

The broader markets are selling off, thanks to concern over higher interest rates. After a brief dip, the 10-year treasury yield is soaring once again. That is putting pressure on stocks, which continue to broadly sell-off.In this sense, Zynga stock is victim to broad market turmoil.But there is another part to the story which is specific to ZNGA. The guide wasn't great. Although revenues are expected to continue to grow at a healthy rate, the margin expansion narrative that has been so hot recently looks like it's starting to cool off. Robust revenue growth but slowing margin expansion isn't a winning combination against the backdrop of markets deep in the red.So what's the move? I do see Zynga stock potentially getting to and above $5. But it's a stretch. And this stock is risky at current levels. All in all, ZNGA stock is a speculative investment, not a sound investment.Zynga is a story of pivots, and its most recent pivot into mobile is perhaps its most promising pivot yet.Zynga used to be a mega-popular browser game company with tons of users. But then the company overreached by branching into games that had heavy overlap with the traditional video game market, like sports titles. They couldn't compete in that market. Eventually, the over-extension sparked user churn, and ZNGA spiraled downward.Zynga proceeded to pivot, transitioning its business model from web-focused to mobile-first while narrowing its gaming title focus. This pivot was supposed to streamline operations, re-invigorate top-line growth, cut costs and improve profitability.Indeed, it has. Zynga just recorded total company revenue growth of 22%, its best since the first quarter of 2013. Mobile daily actives hit 20 million in the quarter, up 24% year-over-year and the highest daily active number in four years. Margins are exploding higher. The company turned a huge $100 million-plus loss last year into a $26 million profit this year.All appears well. But my hesitations with this company are that this is still a narrowly profitable business in a really tough market that I don't see growing by much. Yes, mobile engagement is rising, especially on a global basis. But a majority of that incremental engagement is going towards  , not gaming.Granted, the mobile gaming market is growing globally, but most of that growth is happening in China, thanks to smartphone usage proliferation.In that market, mobile gaming is  by  (OTCMKTS:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ). On the domestic front, where Zynga rules, there are signs that the mobile gaming market may have already reached its  .For those reasons, I'm hesitant on Zynga stock. But if things go right for this company, this stock could easily zoom past $5.Under bullish assumptions, it's reasonable to project 10% revenue growth per year over the next five years into $1.4 billion in revenues in 2022. EBITDA margins are supposed to break into the 20% range this year, and build into perpetuity thereafter. Consequently, 25% EBITDA margins in 2022 seem reasonable, putting EBITDA in five years at just under $350 million. That would represent roughly 20% EBITDA growth per year over the next five years.The growth premium for the  is currently  . That implies a fair forward EBITDA multiple for Zynga stock of 26 (30% premium on 20% growth). I think EBITDA will be roughly $166 million this year (18% margins on $920 million in revenue). A 26 multiple on $166 million implies a market cap of $4.3 billion, or about $5 per share.This stock could roar to $5 if the company can grow its international presence, continue its margin ramp, and maintain domestic market dominance.Those are big \"ifs,\" so I'm not terribly bullish on the stock here.

The Netease story is his story - starting with raw technology, moving into entertainment, now substantial and selling an e-commerce lifestyle.It's also possible this may all work. Yanxuan and Kaola are unique sites and their early results are very promising. But retail is not as profitable as gaming. Retailing, even online, requires infrastructure.

The retailer is Mattel's second largest customer and generates between 15% and 20% of the company's U.S. sales, along with 11% of international revenue.There was no respite to be found in the most recent quarter, as things went from bad to worse.Things for Mattel just go from bad to worse. Image source: Getty Images.For the fourth quarter of 2017, Mattel's net sales of $1.6 billion declined 12% year over year, below analysts' consensus estimates of $1.69 billion. The company posted a net loss of $281 million, down 262% year over year, resulting in a per-share loss of $0.82, compared with a $0.51 profit per share in the prior-year period, and far worse than the $0.15 per share profit analysts expected.In North America, which accounts for the majority of Mattel's business, fourth-quarter sales fell 17% from the prior year. International sales fell 4% as reported, and 9% on a constant currency basis.Cost of sales skyrocketed to 69% of revenue, up from 53% in the prior-year quarter. Mattel attributed the worsening gross margin to inventory management, an unfavorable product mix, and higher freight and logistics expenses.For the full year, Mattel lost a massive $1.05 billion, or $3.07 per share. It is important to note that the company took a $457 million charge related to recently enacted U.S. tax legislation. Excluding the effect of this one-time charge would have reduced Mattel's net loss for the year to $1.08 per share.Declining sales were widespread across most categories. Revenue from the construction arts and crafts brands fell 25% year over year, while American Girl sales fell 23%, and Fisher-Price sales dropped 12%. Revenue in the other girls segment fell by 35% year over year, while the wheels segment fell 7%. The bright spot was increased sales of Barbies, which increased 9% over the prior-year quarter.Mattel CEO Margo Georgiadis tried to reassure investors:Mattel has been working to revive its flagging business. The company announced details for its \"transformation plan\" at an investor day in June of last year, which includes reducing costs by $650 million, the majority of which the company hopes to achieve in 2018. Unless the company is able to revive its falling sales, the rest will be academic.There are a couple of other things that may be of interest to shareholders.

The label plans to promote EDM across the region by signing talent across Asia and the world.Tencent Music Entertainment (TME) CEO Cussion Pang told the  hat Liquid State's goal was \"to create an unmatched culture exchange between the East and the West through the power of electronic dance music.\" The songs will be streamed exclusively on TME's streaming platforms.Image source: Getty Images.Liquid State marks TME's first move toward owning a music label, and its arrival spells trouble for  's (NASDAQ: NTES) Cloud Music -- its biggest rival in China's  .Tencent owns a 62% stake in TME, which was formed after it spun off its music unit and merged it with China Music Corporation in 2016. The merged company -- which united China's top streaming platforms QQ Music, Kugou, and Kuwo -- controls about 76% of the country's music streaming market with over 600 million monthly active users (MAUs), according to DCCI.TME holds the streaming rights for songs from Sony Entertainment,  's Warner Music, and  's Universal Music, along with additional rights from labels in mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea.Image source: Getty Images.TME is clearly the 800-pound gorilla in this space, but NetEase -- which is better known as a PC and mobile games publisher -- still controls about 16% of the streaming market with the NetEase Cloud Music platform. NetEase sub-licenses most of its content from TME, but it's still locked in a legal battle with QQ Music over the exclusive rights to certain songs.NetEase is an underdog compared to TME, but it's still the market leader in EDM, which gained popularity across Asia over the past few years. Last September, research firm iiMedia named NetEase Cloud Music the top platform for EDM in China, placing it ahead of QQ Music, Kugou, and Kuwo -- in that order.NetEase notes that 40% of listeners surveyed between 2016 and 2017 listened to EDM, making it the second most popular genre after pop music. Looking ahead, NetEase expects the total number of EDM listeners in China to surge from 286 million in 2017 to 455 million in 2020. Unfortunately, TME and Sony's Liquid State could lure away NetEase's EDM listeners.Tencent crushed many smaller companies  to becoming China's biggest social network provider and the world's top video game company. But NetEase is one rival that refuses to die.In addition to holding its ground in streaming music and dominating the EDM genre, NetEase is the only company that has consistently halted Tencent's dominance of China's mobile gaming market.Tencent's  is currently the highest grossing mobile game on iOS and Android in China, according to research firm Newzoo. However, NetEase's  ranks second on iOS, while its other hit title  ranks second on Android.NetEase's Onmyoji. Image source: Google Play.NetEase's games currently hold four of the top ten spots in China's iOS store, and two of the top ten spots on Android. Tencent's games control five of the top ten spots on iOS, and three of the top ten spots on Android.Therefore, NetEase is a persistent thorn in Tencent's side, and analysts still expect its revenue to climb 39% this year on the strength of its PC games, mobile games, and side bets like its streaming music, e-commerce, and online service platforms.However, NetEase's earnings could dip 1% as it shifts from higher-margin PC games to lower-margin mobile games. Higher investments in underdog platforms like NetEase Cloud Music could also dent its margins.Tencent's partnership with Sony is clearly a strategic move against NetEase, which remains a stubbornly resilient rival in the music streaming market.

TME's streaming services are also tethered to Tencent's WeChat, the most popular messaging app in China with 980 million worldwide MAUs.TME has secured the streaming rights for songs from  Entertainment,  's Warner Music, and  's Universal Music, as well as streaming rights from South Korean label YG Entertainment and Taiwanese labels JVR Music and LOEN Entertainment.Last September, TME signed a  with  's much smaller Ali Music (Xiami) platform. That deal gave Ali Music access to TME's streaming portfolio, while TME gained access to Ali Music's library of songs from Taiwan's Rock Records, HIM International Music, B'in Music, and Hong Kong's Media Asia. That deal significantly strengthened TME's presence across Taiwan and Hong Kong's pop music markets.TME is expected to go public later this year as Tencent Music in an eagerly anticipated IPO. Last December, Tencent Music and Spotify -- which is also expected to go public this year -- agreed to buy minority stakes (of up to 10%) in each other.The TME megamerger made it tough for smaller competitors to gain much ground. Yet NetEase, which is best known for publishing PC and mobile games, still controls about 16% of the streaming music market with NetEase Cloud Music, according to DCCI.Image source: Getty Images.NetEase launched the platform in 2013, and it had about 60 million MAUs as of last March according to research firm QuestMobile. However, NetEase claimed that the service had 300 million total users last April, but didn't disclose how many of those users were active on a monthly basis.NetEase sub-licenses most of its music content from TME instead of securing direct partnerships with record labels. To further complicate matters, NetEase and QQ Music (but not the other TME platforms) have been suing each other in an ongoing copyright battle over exclusive rights to certain songs.NetEase Cloud Music is clearly David to TME's Goliath, but investors still funded it with 750 million RMB ($119 million) in Series A financing last April, which gave it a valuation of 8 billion RMB ($1.3 billion). NetEase has also been adding social networking features to its app, which could help it compete against Tencent's WeChat, and the platform remains the market leader in electronic dance music, according to iiMedia Research.Baidu is practically tied with Tencent in the  , but it remains a distant underdog in the music streaming one. Baidu Music only controls about 4% of the market, according to DCCI, which is surprising considering that Baidu's search engine handles over 70% of all online queries in China.Back in 2008 Baidu was sued by several major record companies for allegedly linking to pirated music with its music search engine. The record companies lost that case, but Baidu subsequently agreed to pay them compensation for each downloaded or streamed song. Baidu attempted to recoup those costs with ads.In late 2015 Baidu merged Baidu Music with the record company Taihe Music Group, which owned over 700,000 copyrights along with licenses with overseas record labels, to expand its music library. Baidu hasn't said much about Baidu Music over the past few quarters, but it could  integrate the platform with its more popular video platform, iQiyi, as a streaming music option.These three platforms all generate small portions of their parent companies' revenues, but they could grow in importance over the next few years. For now, all three platforms are focused on converting free ad-supported listeners to paid subscribers, which could generate more sustainable and higher-margin revenues over the long term.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But will the company be able to sustain its great form?Image Source: Getty Images.Wall Street expects NetEase to report $2.12 per share in earnings on $2.19 billion in revenue. By comparison, the company earned $4.40 per share in the prior-year period on revenue of $1.91 billion, which implies that it is going to take a big hit to the bottom line.NetEase didn't provide fourth-quarter guidance, but there is a good chance that the company will trump analyst expectations because of its recently launched game titles.For instance, NetEase completed the launch of the highly popular  franchise in China across the PC, iOS, and Android platforms by the end of last October. This title boosted NetEase's user count by 30 million by the end of that month.The complete launch of  during Q4 should give a nice boost to its top line for the December-ended quarter, allowing it to report stronger year-over-year growth than the 14.6% jump expected by analysts. And NetEase's international expansion gained momentum during the final quarter of 2017 with its  title being launched in Korea.What's more,  was well received by users in North America during the test phase, setting the stage for the game's launch outside Asia.However, the bottom-line performance will weaken as compared to the prior-year period because of lower margins in NetEase's mobile gaming and e-commerce businesses. For instance, the company's gross margin from the online gaming business, which supplies almost two-thirds of the revenue, fell 2.5 percentage points year over year during Q3 of 2017.The situation was worse in the email and e-commerce business, which accounts for almost 30% of total revenue. The gross margin from this segment was down to 11.9% as compared to 33.5% from the year-ago period.Video gaming will continue being a big catalyst for NetEase in 2018 and beyond. That's because the company is going all out to boost its mobile gaming business by venturing into international markets and striking lucrative partnerships.For instance, the company recently announced that  will be launched in markets outside Asia during the current quarter across the Google and  app stores, as well as  's Gameroom for PC. This game is already quite popular in the Asian market with more than 200 million registered users, so it can give NetEase a shot in the arm going forward.Meanwhile, NetEase has entered into two notable partnerships of late that could help it carve out a bigger slice of the video gaming market. One of these partnerships is with toy maker  , which is looking to leverage the popularity of properties like Hot Wheels and Barbie. Mattel executive Sid Mathur wants to go after the $58 billion mobile gaming market using NetEase's expertise in this space.The two companies have entered into a 50-50 joint venture, and have already announced that Mattel's popular card game  will make its debut this year on Facebook, Android, and the Apple app stores. Going forward, the joint venture will focus on developing content based on other Mattel properties like Barbie and Fisher-Price. NetEase can use the popularity of Mattel's intellectual properties to boost its mobile gaming portfolio.The other important partnership that NetEase has struck of late is with Niantic, which developed  . NetEase has reportedly invested in Niantic's latest round of funding, allowing the former to launch both old and new games from the developer in the Chinese market. It is anticipated that NetEase will launch  in China in the second half of 2018.Additionally, Niantic is said to be working on a Harry Potter video game utilizing augmented reality. This partnership could turn out to be lucrative for NetEase as it will have access to highly popular video game properties.And NetEase's e-commerce business should keep getting better this year because of its recent  to source new products from the U.S. and Europe for sale in the Chinese market. In all, NetEase looks well placed to sustain its top-line momentum in 2018 and beyond, which should eventually filter down to the bottom line and help the stock deliver more upside.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Onmyoji's November release in Thailand and December's expansion pack brought back earlier players and brought in brand new players. For New Ghost, players are also delighted by the new content, including new characters and promotion with other traditional Chinese animation IP.In terms of new mobile games, Knives Out and Terminator 2, along with its global version Rules of Survival, were launched in early November. Both games became immediate blockbusters. To date, Knives Out boasts over 100 million registered users, and Terminator 2 has accumulated a lofty 80 million registered users. We also started early monetization efforts for these titles in December.Moving on to e-commerce. This business segment has grown substantially, with revenues in the fourth quarter increasing nearly 175% year-over-year to RMB4.7 billion, by partnering with leading providers, Kaola.com and Yanxuan, focused on providing customers with highest quality product and services. Our primary objective in this market is to create an elevated user experience that sets the standard for what online e-commerce should be. Our goal is to provide our growing users community with the best in class interface, as well as broad purchase options.

Our online games pipeline will focus on expanding and diversifying our portfolio, as well as increasing our global footprint. January has been a busy month as we have already begun executing on this strategy with the handful of thrilling new releases. We introduced the English language version of Onmyoji to Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Scandinavia. Additionally, players greeted the highly anticipated mobile version of Onmyoji with great enthusiasm, and the game's early performance has exceeded our expectations. We also launched MMORPG Chu Liu Xiang, and the game is currently available for play on all major platforms. With an extremely receptive fan base and its innovative game play, Chu Liu Xiang has been recognized as one of the top grossing games on iOS since its launch. We plan to launch new mobile games across a variety of genres, strengthening our position by appealing to a broad range of players and user preferences. Our release schedule presently calls for an array of new genres, including the asymmetrical battle arena game Identity V, RPG Sky, and 2.5D casual battle arena game Alive.To further strengthen and diversify our product offerings, we will continue to invest in self-developed games.

Our strategy calls for diversification across our business lines. Our games pipeline is strong. Our e-commerce business is developing rapidly, and our advertising services and email and other businesses are also growing. Each of this offers growth opportunities where we can generate value for our partners, shareholders, and community.This concludes William's comments.I'll now provide a brief review of our fourth quarter 2017 financial results. Given the limited time on today's call, I'll be presenting some abbreviated financial highlights. We encourage you to read through our press release issued earlier today for further details. I would also like to remind our audience that effective beginning the fourth quarter of 2017, we move from three to four reporting segments. We are now reporting financial results for our e-commerce business, which primarily includes Kaola.com and Yanxuan. All historical quarterly and year end amounts for 2016 and 2017 that we will be discussing today reflect this change.Net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB14.6 billion, or US$2.2 billion. This represents an increase of 17.1% and 20.7% compared with the preceding quarter and fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The increase was mainly led by our e-commerce business, and partially offset by a decline in revenue contribution from our online game services.Our gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was RMB5.7 billion, or US$882.9 million compared to RMB5.9 billion and RMB6.5 billion for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. Our gross profit for our online game segment declined year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter in the fourth quarter as a result of decreased revenue contribution from some of our self-developed mobile games. Margins for our online games segment were relatively stable at 61.4% in the fourth quarter, compared to 60.7% a year ago and 62.5% in the preceding quarter.With the record development and expansion of Kaola.com and Yanxuan, gross profit for our e-commerce business increased. Gross margin decreased to 7.4% which was primarily impacted by larger-scale promotions and certain sales discount in the fourth quarter of 2017 such as Single's Day on November 11, 2017. This compares with gross margins of 11.5% and 12.5% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016 respectively.Gross profit and margin for advertising services business increased year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter in the fourth quarter of 2017. Gross margins were 71.2%, compared to 68% and 66.5% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016 respectively. Gross loss margin for our email and others business was 3.3%, compared to gross profit margin of 13.1% and 46.9% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016 respectively.Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB4.3 billion or US$663.6 million, this compared to RMB3.4 billion and RMB2.6 billion for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The increase in operating expenses was mainly due to increased selling and marketing expenses, research and development investments, staff-related costs, and increased operating expenses due to our e-commerce businesses. E-commerce related shipping and handling costs included in selling and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB393.3 million or US$60.4 million. This compares to RMB294.8 million and RMB177.2 million for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 18.2%, compared to 8.1% and 19.2% for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. The changes in the effective tax rate were mainly due certain of our subsidiaries being recognized as Key Software Enterprises in the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2017, and subject to a preferential tax rate of 10% for 2016. We recognized related tax credits in the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2017 accordingly.Our net income attributable to shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 was RMB1.3 billion or US$197.6 million. This compares to RMB2.5 billion and RMB3.7 billion for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. Non-GAAP net income attributable to our shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled RMB1.9 billion or US$288.8 million. This compares to RMB3.0 billion and RMB4.0 billion for the preceding quarter and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively.For the fourth quarter of 2017, our basic and diluted earnings per ADS were US$1.50 and US$1.49, respectively. Our non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings per ADS were US$2.20 and US$2.18, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2017.Turning to some highlights from the full year 2017 financials. Total net revenues for fiscal year 2017 were RMB54.1 billion or US$8.3 billion, compared to RMB38.2 billion for the preceding year. Gross profit for fiscal year 2017 was RMB25.9 billion or US$4.0 billion, compared to RMB21.7 billion for the preceding fiscal year. The increase was mainly due to: one, increased revenue contribution from our self-developed mobile games such as Onmyoji and the mobile version of New Ghost; two, the increased monetization effort for mobile applications, primarily our mobile news app; and three, the expansion of our e-commerce business.Total operating expenses for fiscal year 2017 were RMB13.8 billion, or US$2.1 billion, compared to RMB9.0 billion for the preceding fiscal year. The increase in operating expenses in 2017 was primarily due to increased selling and marketing expenses, research and development investments, and higher staff-related costs, as well as increased operating expenses related to our e-commerce businesses. E-commerce related Shipping and handling costs included in selling and marketing expenses for fiscal year 2017 were RMB1.2 billion, or US$181.8 million, compared to RMB503 million for the preceding fiscal year.The effective tax rate was 16.6% for fiscal year 2017, compared to 15.1% for fiscal year 2016. The changes in the effective tax rate were mainly due to the higher withholding tax recorded for fiscal year 2017.Net income attributable to our shareholders for fiscal year 2017 totaled RMB10.7 billion or US$1.6 billion, compared to RMB11.6 billion for the preceding fiscal year. Non-GAAP net income attributable to our shareholders for fiscal year 2017 totaled RMB12.7 billion, or US$2.0 billion, compared to RMB12.9 billion for fiscal year 2016.

This compares with RMB36.9 billion as of December 31, 2016. Our cash flow generated from operating activities was RMB11.9 billion or US$1.8 billion for fiscal year 2017, compared with RMB15.5 billion for the preceding fiscal year.Returning value to our shareholders remains the top priority. For the fourth quarter of 2017, we plan to pay a dividend of US$0.38 per ADS in accordance with our 25% dividend distribution policy. Under our current share repurchase program, which began November 16, 2017, we had not yet purchased any ADSs as of December 31, 2017.Thank you for your attention. We would like now to open the call to your questions. Operator, please go ahead?Yes, thank you. If you would like to ask a question, you can signal us by pressing *1 on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. Just as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question only, and please provide an English translation if asking a question in Mandarin. Once again, that's *1 to ask a question. And we'll pause a brief moment.We will take our first question from Alicia Yap with Citi. -- Hi, good morning, William and Charles. Thanks for taking my questions. I actually have couple of questions if I may. Number one is related to the sales and marketing spend and overall margin. So, can management share with us the step-up spending in the more aggressive to promote your e-commerce and your gaming business? What is the rationale behind the strategic decisions? And how should we be thinking and modeling in the upcoming spend for 2018? Should the fourth quarter level be the similar level that we should be thinking for 2018? Thank you. -- Thank you, Alicia. This is Charles. So, first of all, sales and marketing expense is a format of our strategic investment to build a very solid foundation for NetEase's long-term growth objectives. And specific to Q4, there are certain seasonality impacts, for instance, in Q4 sales and marketing expenses, e-commerce is relatively higher due to the promotional season, Double 11, Double 12, Black Friday.For games in Q4, as you all know, we have very successfully launched a couple of very promising titles, and related sales and marketing expenses on those titles are relatively higher comparing to the preceding quarters. Overall, I'd say we remain very, very confident about the return of our investment in the format of sales and marketing. And also, as I noted in the transcript just now, embedded in the sales and marketing are also the e-commerce related shipping and handling costs which you can get the numbers from our earnings release.Next, we move to Eddie Leung with Merrill Lynch.Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have questions on the cross border Kaola pieces. So, when we look at the very fast growth of your e-commerce revenues. I am just curious, how much think that's driven by industry growth and how much that's driven by successful market share gain over some of over competitors? And then along the line, I am just curious on your thought in terms of your longer-term strategy. How you can differentiate from a couple of the more general e-commerce platforms which potentially have better economic scale in terms of the infrastructure? Thank you. -- So, Eddie to answer your question let me do a quick summary and translation. For Kaola, since the inception of our Kaola business, we have focused on the cross-border e-commerce segment, which over the past years we've already built a leadership in terms of market share. And we are the fastest growing player in this cross-border segment. Talking about competition, we do not think is hat-to-hat competition with the major players for this cross-border segment because there is huge Chinese consumption demand when you see Chinese tourist spending overseas when they do a physical travel. So, that we are talking about trillions of spending. And that's obviously a very, very potential market, addressable market for our cross-border e-commerce Kaola business.With respect to Yanxuan, again our strategic position and rationale is that China is now already the largest manufacturing base for the world. A lot of Made in China products represent very high quality. So, we have close partnerships with the select manufacturers in terms of designing and manufacturing product specific tailoring to the Chinese consumer user demand and this consumption upgrade trends. So, longer-term, we are very confident that we are going to sustain a very fast growth of our both Kaola.com and Yanxuan e-commerce business.Next, we will move to Thomas Chong with Credit Suisse. -- Hi. Good morning, William, Charles, and Margaret. And thanks for taking my questions. I have a couple of questions. The first question is about survival games. Can management provide us some color about our expectations in terms of user and monetization by year-end in China and overseas market? And follow up on that, how should we think about the competition of the survival games in China and overseas?And my second question is about the e-commerce business. Can management provide us some additional color because we have the shipping expenses, but how should we think about operating profit level in terms of the operating profit and the timing of profitability? And my third question is about the trend in terms of the operating expenses in 2018. And my final one is about the online game broadcasting business, that we recently see that NetEase want to invest around RMB1 billion in this area. Thank you. -- Okay. Thomas, that's four questions in total. Let me translate for William. --  -- Okay. So, for your first question we have already established an early mover advantage in the survival genre both domestically and globally. And we also very glad to see that the games that we have launched has achieved its success in both domestic and overseas market. The way we think about this genre is this is a very, very exciting genre with very promising long-term sustainability by combining the survival battle arena sand box element into the new and innovative game play. So, we are very confident that this genre will be a very long-lasting genre that can create different innovative game play and apply that into different genres. And accordingly, we have also deployed our strategic resources in new games pipeline in this broader survival battle arena and sand box genre. --  -- For our e-commerce in terms of the trend for operating margins, given we are -- comparatively speaking we are relatively new entrants into e-commerce, so in the near term our primary focus will be gaining broader user recognition and providing an elevated experience to the users. So, margin profitability is not an imminent near focus. However, given our continued growth and skill-up effect, margins will continue to improve, and we are very, very confident about the future profitability of our e-commerce business. --  -- Thomas, for your question on the trend, overall trend for the operating expense and margins. So, as I explained earlier question, Q4 was a little bit unique with a couple of one-off impact e-commerce seasonality, as well as the promotion of newly launched games in Q4. For those strategic investments we made in Q4 based on the results now we continue to receive were very satisfactory with respect to the returns on those investments. For R&D throughout the year and going forward, we will continue to focus and invest because that is building our core confidence. And so overall, we think margin trend we are confident; and William also commented that in Q4 there were certain copyright-related one-off expenses in relation to our online music business that is also one-off. --  -- So, online broadcasting and e-sports are becoming increasingly more important elements of the overall game industry ecosystem. We observe that from the newest trend that players they do not only play and experience the games, but they also enjoy watching and participating in the games from another format. So, with that trend and also given that NetEase, we have very suitable and relevant IPs, both self-developed as well as licensed, that we are making very prudent and strategic deployment of our capital and resources in terms of online game broadcasting e-sports, which we think will also bring positive value to our games ecosystem overall.We will move next to Natalie Wu, CICC.Hi, good morning, management. Thank you for taking my question. This is [Cho] speaking on behalf of Natalie. Actually, I have a follow up question regarding all the survival-type game. We noticed Knives have launched a couple of new survival games recently. Could management share your thoughts on the positioning of these new games and how they differentiate it from previous ones and how they differentiate from the Knives Out and Terminator 2? And how they differentiated from each other in terms of the positioning? And also, could management give us some color on your promotion plans for these survival games going forward especially during Chinese New Year? Thank you. --  -- Okay. So, in terms of the survival battle arena sand box genre, we do have very strong pipeline with differentiated games, differentiated from multiple aspects. Some differentiate from the view angle; some differentiated from 2.5D, 3D, different highest qualities in their respective category. Some are differentiated in terms of play mode with some new and innovative concept embedded into these games. We think those will be very strong supplements to our existing games. With respect to the upcoming Chinese New Year, for our exiting games Knives Out and Terminator 2, we will have a series of interesting new contents and new game plays being introduced. At the end of January, Terminator 2 has introduced 8x8 biggest map with that kind of accommodate 300 concurrent players which again set a record for game this in genre. Knives Out very recently have introduced a 50v50, a new concept of game play. Again, these are just some specific examples of a series of innovative action we plan to bring exciting and creative concepts to the players.We will move next to Marcus Yang with Macquarie Research.William and Charles, hi.  So, I got three questions. So, first of all, regarding Chu Liu Xiang, which has been performing pretty well since launch last month; so, can you share some like data like your ARPU at the moment? And is, is this kind of mix genre, i.e. a sandbox MMORPG in this case, its high freedom become a key direction for NetEase to work on? And how does that compare to typical MMORPG or sandbox gaming in terms of our pool of user base?And my second question is about the survival genre. Can you share the customer acquisition calls for Knives Out and Terminator 2? And my third question is regarding the overseas retention? Can you share some monetization strategy comparison between the overseas market and domestic market especially for Knives Out and Terminator 2? Thank you. --  -- Okay. So, I will do a very quick translation of the answers. First question regarding Chu Liu Xiang, this is highly anticipated game we recently launched. We call this is MMO 2.0, it represents a highest quality. As you all know, MMORPG games is among the most complicated genre with the highest entry barrier. And NetEase has a core competence in this genre. We think in terms of ARPU and overall performance of Chu Liu Xiang, this will be in line with our other previous legacy games that have a very sustainable long-term growth.For the second question, for the user acquisition cost for Knives Out and Terminator 2, as William earlier commented, we incurred relatively higher selling and marketing expenses in Q4 when the games were initially launched. But longer-term we think the trend on the user acquisition these survival battle arena game should be comfortable and in line without our other games.With respect to overseas monetization, currently the monetization assets are more or less consistent with the monetization attempts we launched in domestic market. Going forward, we'll also gradually introduce more tailor-made monetization offerings dedicated to differentiated overseas market for the global audience.Next, we will move to Jialong Shi with Nomura Securities International. -- Hi. Good morning, William and Charles and Margaret. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two follow up questions. I think management mentioned in previous question, in Q4 there were some expenses related to the royalty fees for your online music service. So, I just want to know how big that expense was in Q4. And second question regarding Chu Liu Xiang. Just wondered if management can share some colors on the popularity expand of this game? I will do the translation myself. -- Jialong let me answer your first question in English directly. With respect to our copyright expenses for online music, there are two components. One is the natural ongoing accrual basis of the copyright. The one-off copyrights we talked about are with respect to certain additional copyrights that expect to incur. So, from accounting perspective we will need to do expense provision. And the magnitude is -- we don't disclose the specifics but it's in line with the copyright expense increased as the general market trend.Your second question I would refer to the rest of the management. --  -- As you all know, at NetEase, we hold our core competence and track record in operating some of the most successful MMORPG games in the industry. So, equally, we are highly confident about the ongoing sustainable performance of Chu Liu Xiang. And this represents, like previously mentioned, elevated experience in the MMO, recall is the MMORPG 2.0 new generation.And due to time constraints, we are not taking any more questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing or additional remarks. -- Thank you once again for joining us today. If you have further questions, please contact NetEase's IR Director, Margaret Shi based in Hangzhou or TPG Investor Relations. Have a great day.Everyone, that does conclude our conference call. We do thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect. --  --  --  --  -- When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

ATVI stock hasn't been the biggest winner in the sector though. By comparison,  (NASDAQ:  ) is up 127% over the past year. ATVI stock has clearly outpaced the other big dog,  (NASDAQ:  ), which is up a lesser 42% over the past year.What's led to the boom in gaming stocks, and Activision's middle of the pack performance within the sector? Activision, like its peers, has enjoyed surging profit margins as the game industry increasingly goes digital. The company's mobile strategy has led it to new levels of financial success. On the downside, ATVI stock is expensive and  isn't getting any younger.Let's take a closer look: : Activision Blizzard purchased  in 2016 for $5.9 billion. King Digital was struggling at the time, as the company's momentum had skidded following its initial public offering.However, Activision has gotten King - and its pivotal  game back on track.  has recovered its position as the top-grossing American mobile game. King's monthly average users are still sliding. Their MAU has dropped from 500 million three years ago to just 300 million now. But with improved in-app purchasing rates and the return of in-game advertising, revenues are moving the right way for Activision. : Last month, Brandon Ross of BTIG launched coverage on the big three gaming stocks. He rated Take-Two and Activision as buys, while pegging EA stock at merely neutral.The analyst called out ATVI stock in particular as the best of the bunch. He slapped an $80 price target on it, suggesting that the sector has transformed gaming and that Activision has the best approach of the bunch for making money off mobile gaming. : Activision is creating an eSports league for its mega-smash hit game  . The Overwatch League is set to kick off its first regular season this month and go until June of 2018.The league currently sports nine American teams, along with one each from China, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. Famous traditional sports icons, including Robert Kraft of the New England Patriots, are investing in the Overwatch League. Chinese internet company  (NASDAQ:  ) owns one of the teams as well. It's too early to project what it will mean for ATVI stock exactly, but it could be dramatic if the league finds enduring popularity. : Activision has benefited greatly over the past few years as a large portion of the gaming market has moved from retail stores to the internet. While retailers such as  (NYSE:  ) have struggled, the gamemakers have won out. Money that previously went to the middleman-retailer now stays in Activision's coffers.However, this trend will slow going forward. Activision already derives 80% of its revenues from digital sources. Thus, there's not much room for further improvement on this front, removing one of ATVI stock's previous tailwinds. : All of the big three gaming stocks are expensive. Even EA, which has by far performed worst of the three recently, is still selling for 30x earnings.ATVI stock takes it to the next level though, with its shares selling at 46x trailing earnings. Analysts forecast 15% compounded annual earnings growth over the next five years. Even so, that's hardly a high enough growth rate to justify such a starting valuation. Additionally, ATVI stock offers a paltry dividend yield of just 0.5%. : Activision used to rely on  for the lion's share of its business. That has faded over the years.  peaked at 12 million subscribers in 2010. It held largely stable around the 10 million-mark for several reasons but then plummeted. By 2015, the count was down to under 6 million. At that point, Activision stopped reported the active user number.It appears that  activity further declined in 2016, however 2017 brought some attempts to stabilize the franchise. On Activision's last conference call they stated that: \"  released a new content update in the quarter, leading to stable Monthly Active Users for the franchise quarter-over-quarter and continued participation in value added services.\"This somewhat vague statement indicates that the user base isn't declining further at the moment, but revenues are probably stagnant to declining. In any case,  still generates a lot of stable high-margin income for Activision. But don't count on it to last forever. The franchise is 12 years old, and is well into old age in gaming terms.The gaming stocks had an amazing 2017. But there's little reason to expect lightning to strike twice in a row. All three are pricey now, with ATVI stock in particular at a hard to stomach valuation.Yes, the company has some strong positives too. The mobile business is the best of the three. And the Overwatch League, if it truly takes off and turns into another pro sport, could be a game-changer. But there's little to indicate that 2018 will be another historic year for ATVI stock.

Momentum investors, while gravitating toward well-performing stocks, are doing so in; (1) a rule-based manner with entry and exit plans in place, and (2) with a view toward the short- and intermediate- term, rather than the long-term view of value investors.At Validea, we run a stock screening model that combines a momentum approach (both at the stock and industry level) with a series of fundamental factors. The portfolio has returned 423 percent over the last fifteen years, outperforming the S&P 500 for 9 of them, and was our top performer in 2017 with a return of 57.2 percent (nearly triple the S&P 500's 19.4 percent gain).Earnings-per-share represents an integral part of a momentum strategy, which looks for persistent year-over-year growth and both quarter-over-quarter and annual growth to be a minimum of 18%.Share Price-is preferred to fall within 15% of the 52-week high, as this would indicate that the stock is potentially close to reaching a new high if trading volume were to climb to above-average levels. Relative strength (price performance compared with overall market) over the past year should be no less than 80, but preferably 90. This is a good indicator as it can keep investors from buying stocks that are on the decline.Leverage: This strategy prefers companies that have consistently reduced debt over the last 3 years or have debt-equity ratios of less than 2 (this criterion does not apply to financial firms).Shares outstanding of under 30 million is preferable, as fewer shares leads to bigger price jumps when demand surges.Insider ownership of at least 15% is preferred under this strategy because where there is strong insider ownership, management is more likely to act in the best interest of the company.Industry appeal is considered adequate if at least one other company has a relative strength of above 80.Like most investment strategies, the momentum approach doesn't work all the time and has its own set of challenges. If not executed well, it's high-turnover structure can end up being costly or lead to tax inefficiencies. The strategy can also be tricky since it attempts to benefit from the irrational behavior of other investors which, by its very nature, can also reverse quickly and leave a momentum investor holding the bag (to avoid this, many investors use stops, or automatic sells that are triggered if a stock falls by a certain percentage). But an investor can identify momentum stocks that are built on a solid foundation by combining a momentum factor with other fundamental criteria.Using my momentum-focused stock screening model, I have identified the following four high-scoring stocks:\n  \n is a supplier of cloud networking solutions that use software innovations to address the needs of Internet companies, cloud service providers and data centers for enterprise support. The company scores highly according to our momentum investment strategy based on the consistency and growth in EPS as well as its current share price level of $260.79, which is well within 15% of its 52-week high ($261.81). Return-on-equity of 29.7% is nearly double the required minimum level of 17% required by this model, and insider share ownership of 25% exceeds the required minimum of 15%. manufactures a range of recreational vehicles (RVs) in the United States and sells those vehicles primarily in the U.S. and Canada. Strong quarterly EPS growth (63%) is well above the minimum 18% that this methodology favors.

In October, investment banking firm Jefferies had downgraded the Chinese video gaming specialist, stating that a lack of new game launches would take a toll on revenue.But a 35% year-over-year jump in revenue in the most recent quarter clearly shows that NetEase's mobile gaming business has continued improving, while its e-commerce business is improving rapidly with each passing quarter. These two businesses will be the cornerstone of NetEase's long-term growth, as evident from management's comments during the latest .Image Source: NetEaseNetEase's revenue from mobile games shot up to 68% of its total online gaming revenue in the quarter, up from 57% in the prior-year period. More specifically, mobile games now account for just over 44% of NetEase's top line, and their contribution will keep increasing thanks to the company's expansionary moves on multiple fronts.For instance, NetEase is moving into international markets to grow its mobile gaming business beyond China. It has already introduced its  franchise in Japan and Southeast Asia, and added South Korea to the list in the latest quarter. Looking ahead, NetEase is likely to launch this title in the U.S. and Canada soon as the company has received positive feedback regarding this title from developers.NetEase's expansion into the Asia-Pacific and North American markets is a smart move as these two areas will account for 72% of overall gaming revenue this year, according to Newzoo. More importantly, these markets will get bigger by 2020 as global gaming revenue is expected to increase from $108.9 billion this year to $128.5 billion by the end of the decade.Therefore, NetEase is doing the right thing by not restricting itself just to the highly competitive Chinese online gaming market. More importantly, it is not just trying to launch its existing games in new territories, but is creating region-specific content to win over gamers. For instance, NetEase introduced a Japanese-themed role-playing game last quarter that should help it connect better with users in that country.Additionally, the company's strategy of introducing expansion packs to extend the lifecycle of its existing games is bearing fruit, as evident from the impressive revenue growth. The new content and storylines delivered through expansion packs help NetEase keep gamers engaged in the absence of any new title launches, and this keeps its revenue sources intact.Looking ahead, NetEase's monetization opportunities will increase as the company has a strong mobile gaming pipeline, with no less than six titles on the way. Additionally, the successful launch of  should prove to be another tailwind for the Chinese internet giant. is already a  in international markets, especially the Asia-Pacific region. When  subsidiary Mojang decided to launch this game in the Chinese market, it chose NetEase to distribute the franchise across mobile and PC devices for a five-year term. NetEase officially launched this game in China recently, receiving a tremendous response by clocking 30 million users by the end of October.More importantly, NetEase is already starting to monetize this title. Therefore, NetEase's mobile gaming business should go from strength to strength in the future as the company is pulling out all stops to achieve growth.NetEase's e-commerce business grew at a faster pace than its video gaming business last quarter, clocking year over year growth of almost 80%. This business now supplies almost 30% of NetEase's total business, with its two e-commerce platforms -- Kaola and Yanxuan -- accounting for 71% of the segment's revenue.Not surprisingly, NetEase has decided to invest aggressively in these two platforms to expand their reach and appeal among Chinese consumers. Earlier in November, NetEase announced that it will purchase $3 billion worth of products from U.S. brands over the next three years to cater to China's 109-million-strong middle class.This move will increase the number of U.S. brands on Kaola from 900 to 3,000 over the next few years, allowing NetEase to tap the growing demand for foreign products in China. This is on top of the  that NetEase has to source European products for its e-commerce platform.Furthermore, NetEase is building out its fulfillment infrastructure by increasing warehousing capacity in both the U.S. and China to expedite shipping times. It plans to add a new warehouse in New Jersey before 2017 ends, as well as increase the capacity of three other warehouses in New York and Los Angeles.NetEase is also planning to build nine new warehouses in Europe, spanning markets such as Italy, Spain, France, and the U.K.Despite enjoying almost 50% gains in the past year, the stock looks poised to move higher as strong catalysts in the gaming and e-commerce business pay off.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But he was a failure as a stock boy because he was so forgetful, and so was demoted to floor sweeper, which he enjoyed. He drew laughs from his bosses when he told them about his plans to get a university degree in mathematics. Simons says he also failed as a computer programmer, saying he kept forgetting notations; inevitably he was fired.That same man went on to earn a doctorate in math, and ended up heading a university math department. But he grew restless in that position, and wondered about applying mathematical principles to investing.The rest, as they say, is history.The hedge fund billionaire was born in 1938 and grew up in the Boston area, where his father owned a shoe factory. He earned a Bachelor of Science in mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a doctorate in mathematics at the University of California, Berkley. He finished his latter degree at the age of 23.In 1964, with his newly minted doctorate, he began working as a code breaker at Institute for Defense Analyses. Simons was fired again when he publicly voiced anti-war sentiments during the Vietnam War, a position at odds with that of the general who was his boss. After teaching mathematics part time at MIT and Harvard University, he became a member of the math faculty at Stony Brook University and chairman of the department in 1968.During the 1970s, he developed an interest in finance, and how financial data could be analyzed using mathematical models. In 1978, he started his own investment firm, initially known as Monemetrics, and from 1982 onward, Renaissance Technologies. The firm was one of the first \"quants,\" which, in simple terms, means using complex mathematical models to analyze and trade. Beyond that, he is not saying much; Business Insider quotes him as saying, \"Of course I'm not going to tell you the various predictive signals --Unless... No, I'm definitely not. [Laughter erupts] That's even bigger secrets than those at, down there [the Defense Analysis at Princeton].\"Simons retired as CEO of Renaissance in 2009, becoming the firm's non-executive chairman. Until recently, his vice-chairman was Robert Mercer. Between the two, we have an odd couple, according to OpenSecrets.org.Simons is a staunch Democrat and is said to have donated at least $11.5 million to liberal causes. Mercer is staunch conservative; he is well known as an anti-establishment Republican. He has commited some $18.5 million, which includes buying a stake in the far-right media Breitbart.com, donations to Ted Cruz's presidential bid in 2016 and later to then-presidential candidate Donald Trump; he is also said to have introduced Trump to political strategist Steve Bannon.Behind the mathematics and code breaking is an exceptional ability to find patterns within and among unrelated or nonconsequential events and relationships. Combining that ability with robust computing technology, Simons can find opportunities others miss.New York-based Renaissance Technologies LLC describes itself as an investment management firm in its Form ADV Part 2A (March 30). It goes on to say it acts as a partner or manager to U.S. and non-U.S. private investment funds, and two institutional accounts.It provides its services through four \"feeder\" funds:In addition, it has two other funds for employees and employee-related investors. These funds invest in the four funds listed above.As of March 30, Renaissance had $97 billion of discretionary assets under management.Simons and Renaissance begin with quantitative analysis. In their case, that means developing and using mathematical and statistical models. The objective is to find technical indicators that have predictive values, according to the Form ADV Part 2A.The analysis is a starting point; going forward, they use the analyses to create proprietary computer models, models that use publicly available financial data. The output from the models is then used to identify buy or sell points and \"implement trading decisions.\" Highly complex computer models are being used to make buy and sell decisions, and to execute those decisions.Each of the four strategies has its own unique twist on the general strategy:While the firm, its principals and employees are extremely tight-lipped, some examples come out.Welcome to the exotic world of quant trading, where huge volumes of data are pushed into one end of a computer, and actionable information comes out the other. Theoretically, at least. As the \"nice morning\" example indicates, not all patterns are equally robust and guarantees are nonexistent.Simons has a portfolio that just about every other fund manager would find impossible: 3,170 different equities. This  shows the sectors:Such a large portfolio is possible because it is managed with computer algorithms, rather than with human minds. These are his top 10 holdings as of Sept. 30:GuruFocus also reports quarter-over-quarter turnover is 24%; that means he bought or sold 761 different stocks in the third quarter, or an average of 11.7 trades per day. Again, something that is only feasible with computer-managed trading.The top 10 list would fit with the portfolios of many investors. There is nothing new or unique in terms of names, just how the decisions are made and the speed with which they are traded.As with most hedge funds, information about returns is private, and it is necessary to put together some pieces to get a sense of overall results. Also, it is necessary to recognize the funds do not necessarily have similar returns. For example, the Wall Street Journal reported in May 2009 investors were unhappy because the Medallion Fund did so well in 2008 and the Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund lost money (and lost again in 2009). Medallion, which gained 80% in 2008, is only available to current and past employees and their families. The Institutional Equities, which lost 16% in 2008, was owned by outsiders.The non-Medallion funds apparently have done quite well since; a Forbes article on May 12 reports, \"Renaissance's funds that still include outside investor capital keep posting solid returns. Renaissance Institutional Equities fund, the firm's biggest hedge fund, is up 6% net of fees in 2017 after surging by 21.5% in 2016. Renaissance Institutional Diversified Alpha, another large fund, has returned 7.5% in 2017 after posting gains of 10.7% last year. The smaller Renaissance Institutional Diversified Global Equities fund is up 8% in 2017.\"This GuruFocus chart provides a look at equity holdings, presumably for the three strategies open to outside investors:This may or may not reflect actual performance, but is potentially a proxy for investors who want the bigger picture.It seems investors in non-Medallion funds have done quite well, while the insiders who were able to invest in Medallion did extremely well.Two phrases, from the same sentence, stick out in this profile of Simons. First, \"technical indicators,\" which means technical analysis tools such Moving Averages, Bollinger Bands and literally hundreds and hundreds of others. We have no idea which Simons and Renaissance use, but clearly they are not analyzing fundamentals such as price-earnings, earnings or return on equity.The second phrase is \"predictive signals,\" indicating a focus on what could happen in the future rather than what has happened in the past. Again, it is not the world view of most investors, who examine a stock's history in hopes of gaining some future guidance.But, of course, Simons is not most other investors. He is one-of-a-kind, for better or for worse and an example that proves there is more than one way to be a successful investor.Disclosure: I do not own shares in any of the stocks listed in this article, and I do not expect to buy any in the next 72 hours.This article first appeared on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ne of last week's biggest winners was  (NASDAQ: NTES) , moving 21.3% higher after posting its  on Thursday afternoon. Analysts issued largely positive updates on the Chinese online gaming and portal darling following the fresh financials, though CLSA did buck the trend by downgrading the shares.It was a strong quarter for NetEase. Revenue rose 36% to $1.88 billion. A 24% increase in its online gaming revenue -- the key driver at 65% of NetEase's total top-line results -- got a lift from headier growth from the rest of its advertising, email, e-commerce, and other online businesses. Revenue was roughly in line with the $1.89 billion that analysts were targeting. Adjusted earnings growth was flat, as a spike in its e-commerce initiatives also generated a surge in related operating expenses. However, that profit also met Wall Street expectations.Image source: NetEase.A few Wall Street pros jacked up their price targets late last week. Han Joon Kim at Deutsche Bank is giving his price goal a modest lift from $325 to $334, eyeing a gradual recovery through next year. Alicia Yap at Citi is slightly more encouraged, raising her price target from $320 to $351. She's upbeat on NetEase's efforts to broaden its game offerings. She sees monetization for  -- which NetEase introduced as a licensed partner during the quarter and quickly ramped up to 30 million registrations -- and other new releases picking up next year.The biggest bullish move came from Jialong Shi at Nomura Instinet. He upgraded the stock to buy from neutral, upping his price target on the stock from $297 to $428. He sees earnings climbing 25% next year, fueled by a recovery in mobile gaming revenue as a result of a strong pipeline of 2018 releases.The lone worrywart last week was Man Ho Lam at CLSA, who downgraded the stock from underperform to sell. He's concerned that unfavorable revenue and earnings momentum will continue into the first half of next year. He has his concerns on some gaming titles, and his $283 price goal represents 23% of downside off last week's record close.Ultimately, the well-received report was a welcome recovery from its  that sent the shares 10% lower the next day. There is uncertainty in the stock even after last week's bullish market reaction. There's a lot riding on recently introduced licensed games and the promising pipeline of 2018 releases. We'll also have to see if NetEase can keep costs in check as it  on near-term profit-slurping e-commerce initiatives including Kaola.com and Yanxuan.

Mizuho cut its price target on Teva by 20% to $12 per share, keeping a neutral rating on the stock but raising some concerns about the company's future. On one hand, Teva faces the threat of a bond-rating downgrade that could push it into high-yield junk bond territory, making it much more difficult to access credit markets affordably.

Earlier this year, the government of Venezuela  and other assets owned by  , resulting in a one-time charge by the company of approximately $100 million.Potentially one of the greatest underlying risks when investing in China, however, is a common but controversial corporate structure that gets little attention in the West. This complicated legal agreement is the variable interest entity (VIE), often referred to as the Sina model, after Chinese online media company  (NASDAQ: SINA) , which was the first to use the structure, in 2000.Investors in China are likely unaware of this potential risk factor.

Other high-profile examples include online retailer  (NASDAQ: JD) and internet gaming pioneer  (NASDAQ: NTES) .Chinese law bars foreign ownership of companies in a variety of industries including mining, steel, telecommunications, internet, and education. Complicated legal structures were devised as a workaround, whereby a series of contracts are drawn up that take the place of actual ownership in the company.In order to circumvent foreign-ownership restrictions, a VIE is established in a country outside the jurisdiction of the Chinese government. Then, certain intellectual property -- such as operating licenses -- are transferred into the VIE, and contracts are drawn up between the company and the VIE. The entity is thus entitled to all or a portion the company's profits without owning any of its assets.When U.S. investors buy stock in a Chinese company listed in the U.S., they are actually investing in the VIE, not the company itself. So, while they have access to companies in highly regulated sectors, they have no voting rights and none of the legal remedies that are typically available to investors.While allowing their use in practice, China has never specifically addressed whether VIEs fall within the law. Since they were devised as workarounds to existing regulations, the government could potentially declare these entities illegal. This would force the companies that use them into uncharted waters, and investors could pay the price.While the risk seems significant, the news isn't all bad. China is unlikely to ban these entities outright. Chinese companies, and by extension the government, are eager to obtain the massive amounts of financial capital available in Western markets. Banning the structures would cast China in a negative light on the world stage, while throwing its own markets into turmoil.In a positive development for investors, the Supreme People's Court of China earlier this year upheld a lower court's ruling that a framework agreement that was very similar to a VIE was valid. While it was not a wholesale endorsement of the structure, and the court didn't specifically address the legality of VIEs, it is now more likely that the entities could be viewed favorably by Chinese courts in the future.While knowledge of the existence of VIEs may give investors pause, it shouldn't necessarily keep them from buying stock in these potentially high-growth opportunities. But it's important to be aware of the risk when deciding what allocation Chinese companies should have in a diversified portfolio.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In addition, an investor presentation and a webcast of this conference call will be available on the NetEase corporate website at ir.netease.com.Joining us today on the call from NetEase's senior management, is Mr. William Ding, Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Charles Yang, Chief Financial Officer, and Mr. Hilton Huang, Co-president of NetEase Game. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Yang, who will read the prepared remarks on behalf of Mr. Ding. -- Thank you, Brandi. And, thank you, everyone, for participating in today's call. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that all percentages are based on renminbi. With that said, I am pleased to deliver opening remarks on William's behalf.Since establishing NetEase in 1997, our focus has been on innovation, high-quality content, and community. 20 years later, we are pleased to be implementing these same values as we develop and operate some of China's most popular mobile and PC-client games, as well as some of the country's most prominent advertising, communication, and e-commerce services.The cornerstones of our future success are based on these principles, along with our ability to continue to broaden and diversify our portfolio of online products and services, enhance our brand equity, and extend our global footprint.During the third quarter, we did exactly that. We advanced each of core business segments year-over-year, growing our quarterly net revenues by nearly 36%. Our growth was spearheaded by our online game services sector and in particular our mobile games, which accounted for approximately 68% of this segment's net revenues, led by our self-developed mobile games, including Onmyoji, New Ghost, Land of Glory, Invincible, and Demon Seals.The popularity of several of our legacy games continues to grow and our PC-client game, Fantasy Westward Journey online, and mobile game, Invincible, achieved another record quarterly revenues during the third quarter.In addition to our legacy titles, Players are also responding enthusiastically to our newer hit games, such as Onmyoji. Although Onmyoji's performance in China slowed down in the third quarter, this popular title regained traction when we introduced new content and game play supported by promotional activities through media, literature, and merchandise collaborations.To further expand the success of the Onmyoji brand, and to captivate players, we are developing a Battle Arena game based on the Onmyoji IP. The initial testing for this game is progressing well and on track with our expectations.In line with our expansion strategy to bring exciting titles overseas, Onmyoji's international presence remains strong. After being introduced in Japan and Southeast Asia, Onmyoji was also successfully launched in Korea, followed by promising user feedback during closed beta testing in the US and Canada.We also strengthened our portfolio in the third quarter by introducing a number of new expansion packs that extend the life cycles of our games as well as launched new mobile titles.The highly anticipated release of Minecraft in China went exceptionally well as we introduced the game for PC Java and IOS in the third quarter, and Android shortly thereafter in October. On its first day of release, Minecraft was ranked the number one downloaded mobile game on both the iPhone and iPad. Minecraft has received considerable accolades in China and, by the end of October, the game had accumulated nearly 30 million registered users.Early monetization efforts for Minecraft are underway with server rental and partial content monetization for the PC Java version, which began in mid-September. We have also initiated monetization taxing for high pixel server and we plan to commerce small scale monetization for the mobile version in early 2018.Our renowned portfolio of games continues to delight Chinese players. In addition to Minecraft, we also introduced Index, a Japanese-themed ARPG to millions of gamers and fans during the third quarter.We are focused on growing our portfolio with a number of new, exciting games in our pipeline that broaden and diversify our offering in a variety of genres. We have a rich pipeline that leverages our top resources in R&D and talented pool of developers and an optimal strategy to license and operate marquee games.In the coming quarters, we are looking forward to bringing new titles across different genres to gamers, including MMORPG such as Chu Liu Xiang and Tribes and Empires: Storm of Prophecy, Japanese-themed ARPG Forever 7 and card game Kari\u2010ri-sei Million Arthur, as well as a battle arena game based on Onmyoji IP and our 3D PC-client game Conqueror's Blade.In addition to our domestic offerings, we are bringing our vision to audiences across the globe to markets where mobile games are growing at a steady pace. International expansion allows us to grow our brand worldwide and introduce our games to audiences around the world. Eager for the thrilling, high-quality game experience that NetEase players love -- games like Onmyoji and Crusaders of Light are performing very well overseas. Crusaders of Light has now been recognized as one of the top growing games in more than 20 different countries since its launch.Now, turning to our other business segments. Leveraging our technology advantage, premium brand, and larger user base, we continue to strengthen our market position with NetEase Media. During the third quarter, we grew our advertising services net revenue by approximately 12% year-over-year with automobile, real act stage, and Internet services as our top performing verticals.Our entertainment marketing program is supporting a growing number of high profile projects and we are also seeing an increase in demand for performance-based advertising to support our growth in an otherwise mature market. Investment in both original and third-party high-quality content, customized smart push technology, video content, and innovative marketing solutions amid an evolving advertising climate support our ability to remain one of the most sought-after advertising platforms in China.Our email, e-commerce, and other business also continue to grow in the third quarter with net revenues increased by nearly 80% year-over-year, primarily due to increased revenue contribution from our e-commerce business, such as Kaola and Yanxuan. These e-commerce platforms are prospering the net revenues from Kaola and Yanxuan of RMB2.7 billion, accounting for approximately 71% of the segment's net revenues.Each of our business lines is integral to our growing brand. As we continue to amass one of China's preeminent game portfolios, we are simultaneously focused on advancing our Internet service offerings to support our healthy business platform. We will continue to invest in the growth of each of these business segments. Together, they strengthen not only the NetEase brand but our commitment to our investors and user community.This concludes William's comments.I will now provide a review of our third quarter 2017 financial results. Given the limited time on today's call, I will be presenting some abbreviated financial highlights. We encourage you to read through our press release issued earlier today for further detail.Our gross profit for the third quarter of 2017 was RMB5.9 billion, US$893.9 million compared to RMB6.7 billion and RMB5.3 billion for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2016 respectively. Our gross profit grew year-over-year for our online game segment in the third quarter. However, as mobile games become an increasing revenue contributor, gross margin for our online games business decreased slightly. For the third quarter of 2017, gross profit margin for our online games was 62.5% compared to 63.1% and 65% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2016 respectively.Gross profit margin for our advertising services business increased year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter in the third quarter of 2017 with gross margin of 68% compared to 67.6% and 65.3% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2016 respectively.Gross profit decreased year-over-year for our email, e-commerce, and other businesses for the third quarter of 2017 with gross margin of 11.9% compared to 11.3% and 33.5% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2016 respectively. This is mainly a result of a change in product mix with Kaola and Yanxuan representing increasingly significant revenue contribution.Total operating expenses for the third quarter of 2017 were RMB3.4 billion or US$510.7 million compared to RMB3.3 billion and RMB2.5 billion for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2016 respectively.For the third quarter of 2017, we recorded a net income tax charge of RMB225.5 million or US$33.9 million compared to RMB703.5 million and RMB427.2 million for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2016 respectively.The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2018 was 8.1% compared 19% and 13.3% for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2016 respectively. The changes in the effective tax rate were mainly due to the recognition of tax credit related to key software enterprises for certain subsidiaries in the current quarter and the third quarter of 2016.Our net income attributable to shareholders for the third quarter of 2017 totaled RMB2.5 billion or US$379.9 million compared to RMB3.0 billion and RMB2.7 billion for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2016 respectively.Non-GAAP net income attributable to our shareholders for the third quarter of 2017 totaled RMB3.0 billion or US$454.6 million compared to RMB3.5 billion and RMB3.0 billion for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2016 respectively.For the third quarter of 2017, our basic and diluted earnings per ADS were US$2.88 and US$2.86 respectively. This compares to basic and diluted earnings per ADS of US$3.39 and US$3.37 respectively for the preceding quarter and US$3.14 and US$3.12 respectively for the third quarter of 2016.Our non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings for ADS for the third quarter of 2017 were US$3.45 and US$3.43 respectively. This compares to US$3.96 and US$3.94 respectively in the preceding quarter and US$3.46 and US$3.43 respectively for the third quarter of 2016.Our cash position remains strong. As of September 3, 2017, our total cash and cash equivalent, current and non-current time deposits, and short-term investment balance total RMB40.7 billion or uS$6.1 billion. This compares with RMB36.9 billion as of December 31, 216.Our cash flow generated from operating activity was RMB1.7 billion or US$248.8 million for the third quarter of 2017 compared with RMB2.3 billion and RMB3.7 billion for the preceding quarter and the third quarter of 2016 respectively.Returning value to our shareholders remains a top priority. For the third quarter of 2017, we plan to pay a dividend of US$0.72 per ADS in accordance with our 25% dividend distribution policy. Under our current share repurchase program, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million ADS for approximately US$306.1 million as of November 14, 2017, the last day of this program. To continue this activity, our board has approved a new 12-month share repurchase program beginning on November 16, 2017, for up to US$1.0 billion....Thank you for your attention. We would like now to open the call to questions. Operator, please go ahead.Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Hillman Chan with Citigroup. -- Good morning, management. Thank you for taking my question. This is Hillman on behalf of Alicia. My first question is regarding the monetization strategy and potential for Wilderness [speaks Mandarin] and also Minecraft, please, for both PC Java and mobile. And, regarding [speaks Mandarin] Wilderness how do we see the competition from several games of similar genre in the market? [Repeats questions in Mandarin] And then I have another follow-up question. -- [Response in Mandarin] -- Okay, so let me translate the response from William. Firstly, to address the competition. Wilderness is a SimBot battle arena game. Currently, it's in the internal testing stage, so we will continue to optimize this game to inject innovation and bring this exciting new game to our global audience. In terms of monetization, for Minecraft this is a sandbox platform. Essentially, you can think of this as a marketplace. We encourage developers to come to this marketplace, this platform, to come up with exciting, innovative molds and users willing to pay for these molds to get enhanced user experience on Minecraft platforms.For Wilderness, as you know, this is an FPS game. It is also based on a sandbox concept. You should take full confidence in NetEase's almost two decades of experience in developing games and bringing innovations. We have full confidence in this game and we think of this quite many opportunities in terms of monetization in this game without compromising the user experience of this fair battle arena game. At this stage, we are not really rushing out for any of the monetization initiatives for these games.Next, we'll move to Natalie Woo with CICC. -- Good morning, management. Thanks for taking my questions. I actually have three questions. The first one is regarding your deferred revenue as we noticed that your total deferred revenue this quarter increased to 2.7 sequentially. So, what are the drivers behind this sequential increase? My second question is about international expansion. Can management please share your current progress and future plans for the overseas expansion? What are the rough contributors from the overseas market at the current state and how should we expect this contribution going forward?My third question is regarding your music business. Could management please elaborate more about your current strategy for this business, especially the competition of music copyrights are getting fierce among major players. Can management please share your thoughts for current competition landscape? Any comments would be helpful. Thanks. -- Natalie, let me answer your first two questions on financials and then I will translate the third question to William and the management. On deferred revenue, this quarter's deferred revenue has been stabilized. This is largely because of our game grossing performance has been stabilized in the recent quarter. As you know, deferred revenue -- we never changed any accounting policy for the revenue deferral. So, the numbers reflect the stability of the performance of the games.For your second question on international expansion, as you know, we are continuing with this initiative. Overseas revenue this quarter accounted for approximately 2.4% of the total revenue, which has been quite stable comparing to the preceding quarter and the significant improvement comparing to prior year.For your third question, I will translate for the management. -- [Response in Mandarin] -- Okay. So, our cloud music is quite unique in terms of a competitive landscape. Our smart push technology is the best in class. But, beyond that, we've also been quite focused on original music. There are millions of independent musicians in China that create very exciting music. And cloud music, this platform, is dedicated to be the priority choice of the platform to help these independent musicians to broadcast and distribute their music to a broader audience of music lovers.Next, we'll move to Jialong Shi with Nomura Securities. -- [Questions in Mandarin] I will translate my questions. My first question is about the e-commerce business. I was quite impressed by the strong growth of NetEase e-commerce service in the past quarters. NetEase e-commerce revenue -- e-commerce business has reached such a big scale and I just wonder if NetEase may consider partnering with any external strategic investors. If yes, what types of investors does NetEase like to work with?My second question is about a recent media report that is based on the report where NetEase recently reviewed one of the game live broadcasting platforms for live streaming NetEase online games. I just wonder what's the rationale for NetEase to take this action and how does NetEase think of its relationship with this external game live broadcasting platforms. -- The first question, for our e-commerce. As you know, e-commerce remains one of our pivotal focuses of broadening our Internet products and services. We remain openminded. We welcome all strategic partnerships, particularly on the business level. At appropriate times, we will also consider bringing in external strategic shareholders. For now, I think our top priority is to continue to build up Kaola and Yanxuan brand equity among the users by focusing on the user experience by bringing in a new e-commerce concept to the Chinese users.The second question I will defer to the management. -- [Response in Mandarin] -- So, to your second question, Jialong, this incident was actually referring to three years ago, in 2014, when that platform was broadcasting Fantasy Westward Journey. During the broadcasting, they inserted an advertisement that directed the audiences to a suboptimal quality web game. We think that is not appropriate. We have been following written communications with the platform because we did not get the reasonable response within a reasonable timeframe. So, we have initiated this litigation process.But, overall, in terms of our relationship to all of the live streaming platforms, we remain very openminded. We, in fact, welcome all of these partnerships and broadcasters to come and experience our NetEase games. We have a lot of exciting games. Minecraft, Overwatch, Hearthstone, as well as our own self-developed games. All of these are very suitable content for game live streaming. But, of course, we will require reasonable and rational restrictions not to do things inappropriate and jeopardize the user experience when other platforms are broadcasting our games.And we'll move next to Ji Sing with HSBC. -- Hi, thank you for taking my questions. This is Wing Wong speaking on behalf of Ji. I have a question regarding the monetization of Wilderness. As management has mentioned that they will come up with some interesting ideas about monetization, so I have noted that. There recently some advertisement for Wilderness -- for example, the advertisements on the plane. Will that be the majority main monetization approach in going forward? Will that be included in the advertising services segment or online games segment? Also, in this quarter -- in margin, you have need to recover. So, what's our long-term expectation about the email segment margin to get Q-on-Q slightly improved? So, how should we see the long-term indication about the second margin or maybe the e-commerce margin going forward? Thank you very much. [Questions repeated in Mandarin] -- [Response in Mandarin] -- So, let me first translate for William's comments. First of all, for Wilderness -- or, more broadly, for these survival category games. This is a new genre and we will take a holistic approach in terms of monetization, just like this high-quality game as surprised users. Just give us some patience and confidence. As you know, we will have a very comprehensive approach to monetize this game in due course. At this stage, do not worry too much and we are not overly rushed out in terms of this monetization asset.To your second question on the margins, overall, we are happy to see that email, e-commerce, and other segments, the margin has now been stabilized. I think, going forward, we remain -- the margins will be stabilized at this level as we further grow our e-commerce and other business units within this segment. Over the longer term, we think the scale factor will start to kick in. But, that would also require some time.Next, we'll move to Tian Hou with T.H. Capital. -- Okay, so good morning, management. I have a question not really related to your game. I do believe you guys have a strong capability of coming out with surprising good content. The question is really related to what is really the bad word -- AI, big data. At NetEase, you have lots of lots of data. Emails, dictionaries, games, commerce, and news. I haven't heard a word from you about the big data, about AI. I wonder how NetEase actually benefits, or uses, such property to benefit your own content creation. That's my question, William. -- Okay. Let me translate for the management. -- [Response in Mandarin] -- So, to answer your question, AI -- we also agree in recognizing the importance of AI toward the future success. However, we are also a little bit concerned that, in media in particular, AI, big data, and these buzz words have been overly exaggerated. To NetEase, we invest significantly into AI, big data, and all of these new trends of technologies. But, ultimately, we believe these technologies are best reflected out of the product -- the user experience of the product. To give some concrete example, for instance, our Youdao dictionary. We have been adopting the AI technology into this product and it can now utilize this app for verbal translation as well as translating the contents when you take a photo, for instance.In this regard, we think we are very advanced. Another cloud is in our cloud music. We've also been embedding AI technology into our daily push. So, this is our belief. We think, instead of overexaggerating AI as a mysterious science, our approach is that we take this very modern technology, embed them into the products, and the users eventually will feel the difference because they don't necessarily need to recognize the science behind it. What they get is the product experience they ultimately have and it represents an elevated and enhanced user experience.Next, we'll move to Han Joon Kim with Deutsche Bank. -- Great. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two. One is on Wilderness versus Terminator II. I think they're similar games, but why do you think we're seeing better responses from one of the other, apart from the IP? If you could just give us some qualitative color on that, that'll be great. And then, the second one is on Minecraft KPI. If you could just give us a little bit more on TAU or time spent or any other metrics apart from registration. That would be helpful. Thank you. -- Let me translate for the management. -- [Response in Mandarin] -- To answer your first question, Wilderness and Terminator II -- broadly speaking, they fall into the same genre, the same category. But, there are very subtle differences in terms of user experience. On the technology perspective, both games are self-developed and we utilized two different self-proprietary engines for these games. They bring different -- subtle, but they bring different experiences catering to different user demands. So, in terms of the data we see, the user profiles of playing these two games are actually quite different. [Speaks Mandarin]For Minecraft, as you all know, this is at a relatively early stage and we are starting early monetization in recent months, as well as in early 2018. So, at this stage, other than accumulated users, we don't plan to disclose any other additional KPIs. But, to reiterate, we have full confidence in this game in the longer run.Next, we'll move to Fan Liu with Goldman Sachs. -- Hi, management, this is Seth asking on behalf of Fan. Thank you for taking my question. I have two questions. The first question is on e-commerce. Given the rising revenue contribution, perhaps when could we expect maybe a separate disclosure of the segment on a quarterly basis? And the second question is on whether management could share some color on the game performance of Blizzard. [Repeats questions in Mandarin] -- So, for the first question, let me answer you. We are actively exploring the possibility of separating out our e-commerce. We're actively discussing that among our auditors and counsel. We hope to materialize that as early as next quarter.For the second question, let me defer to the management. -- [Response in Mandarin] -- With respect to Blizzard, they are a very close business partner with us. A couple of key titles that we license from Blizzard are performing well in China. We expect to further deepen our strategic relationship with Blizzard. With Starcraft II, we are in the process to make it free-to-play mode. Overall, because of this close partnership with Blizzard, we are actually keeping a very active dialogue to collectively bring the best product experience and user experience to the Chinese gamers.Next, we'll move to Marcus Yang with Macquarie. -- Thanks for taking my question, management. I have two questions. First of all, regarding survival territory games, can you share the rationale behind the popularity of this genre, in your view? I guess, one thing could be the social community element. Do you think that factor will continue for the upcoming potential new hit sharers? Anything that you can share regarding the key element for the next potential sharers. My second question is regarding how are the regulation issues being fixed here? Regarding the survival game genre -- from your perspective, is this a winner-take-all genre or market? That is my question. [Repeats questions in Mandarin] -- [Response in Mandarin] -- First of all, I would like to correct a concept. This genre -- we don't agree to call this genre as a survival type of game. To us, this broadly falls into a sandbox category. One important element of this sandbox category is that you enjoy the total freedom every time you're entering into the game. You have the total freedom to experience the game with endless possibilities. This is the same for Minecraft, for instance, and same for our Wilderness and Terminator II. We don't' encourage anyone to view this game as, so to speak, a survival type of game. So, that's something we would like to elaborate here.And due to time constraints, there are no further questions. I will turn the call back over to management for any closing or additional remarks. -- Thank you once again for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please contact Julia Yang, NetEase's Senior IR Manager or Hangzhou at  or TPG Investor Relations. Thank you....And everyone, that does conclude our conference call for today. Thank you all for your participation.

When a company gets better established as a key player in its field, as Chinese video game giant  (NASDAQ: NTES) has,  becomes at least as important to demonstrate its leadership in the industry.Coming into the third-quarter financial report on Nov. 15, NetEase investors were ready to see  even as they anticipated another big jump in revenue. NetEase saw the expected boost to its sales, but a substantial jump in operating costs held back any potential profit gains. Let's look more closely at NetEase and what its latest results indicate about its prospects.Image source: Getty Images.NetEase's third-quarter results had their ups and downs. Revenue once again showed considerable strength, with a 35% rise in local currency terms working out to $1.88 billion, which was roughly in line with what investors were expecting to see. Adjusted net income growth continued to deteriorate, with the number climbing by just 0.25% and working out to $454.6 million, or $3.43 per share. That was flat compared with year-earlier figures, although it did beat the consensus forecast among those following the stock.NetEase's segment performance was fairly similar to  , although growth in some key areas decelerated. The massive online game services business saw net revenue climb 24%, or only about half of the growth rate that NetEase saw in the second quarter of 2017. Mobile games continued to important, although the proportion of revenue that came from the mobile side of the business actually fell sequentially from what the company saw three months ago. Meanwhile, the email, e-commerce, and others segment posted 80% year-over-year growth in its top line, approaching 30% of the overall business. The advertising services business brought up the rear in terms of revenue growth, with the segment seeing a 12% increase in sales on strength in ads from automobile, real estate, and internet services customers.Yet one key challenge that NetEase hasn't yet overcome is controlling its costs. Operating expenses soared 37%, and the company blamed higher staff-related costs from higher headcounts and average compensation, as well as higher selling and marketing expenses. Costs from the e-commerce business also weighed on NetEase's ability to maximize its earnings. As the gaming segment has shifted more toward mobile gaming,  , because monetizing mobile has proved more difficult than doing so for traditional online games.CEO William Ding took the results in stride. \"We continue to amass one of China's preeminent mobile game portfolios,\" Ding said, although the CEO also noted an expected slowdown in the game  among Chinese players.Even with headwinds, NetEase has high hopes for the coming year, pointing to new launches of expansion packs and new mobile titles that have customers have warmly received. In Ding's words, \"There remain ample growth opportunities in China as we further diversify our portfolio by exploring a variety of genres.\"As we saw last quarter, however, weaker profits spurred NetEase to cut its dividend yet again. With a payout tied to after-tax net income, NetEase decided to pay out just $0.72 per share in dividends for the quarter, down from $0.83 last quarter and $1.08 per share in the first quarter of 2017.NetEase shareholders seemed satisfied with the results despite the sluggish growth in some key metrics, and the stock was up about 2% in after-market trading following the announcement. Investors would prefer to see stronger bottom-line growth, but NetEase still seems to be working toward solidifying its dominant position in the Chinese gaming industry while looking at smart international expansion plans as well.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Soft macroeconomic conditions in China and significant restrictions on online search and other social networking activities in the region remain concerns.Further, the company is also seeing some headwinds with regard to obtaining new media rights for sports in China. Moreover, it faces tougher year-over-year comparison. In third-quarter 2016, the company's revenues were largely driven by Olympic Games.

Analysts Ani Tu and Karen Chan believe that a lack of new game releases in the near future, and the tepid performance of NetEase's existing lineup, will hurt the Chinese video game specialist's top and bottom lines.The analysts carried out  showing a drop in the average monthly gross of one NetEase title --  -- while other titles remained largely stable. Jefferies believes that this lack of growth could reduce the company's mobile game revenue by 20% sequentially during the third quarter (which ended in September).Image source: Getty Images.Investors, however, should ignore this downgrade and stop focusing on the short-term headwinds that NetEase faces. There is enough evidence that the company is built for long-term growth, and any hiccups along the way should be treated as buying opportunities. Here's why.It seems Jefferies is trying to play it safe before the next earnings release, as the firm admits that NetEase's recent updates to its mobile games have helped build some momentum. For instance, the company added to the popular mobile MMORPG (massively multiplayer online role-playing game)  with a new expansion pack known as  . This update will give players more reasons to stick around thanks to the addition of new levels and rewards, adding to the company's revenue going forward on the back of higher in-app purchases.The analysts also indicated that the updated anniversary version of  boosted the title's gross-revenue ranking. But the update was launched at the end of the quarter, so it might not help NetEase much when it releases its next report. Regardless, Foolish investors need to look beyond the single quarter, as NetEase is setting up the  franchise for long-term success.The company recently revealed that it's launching an English-language version of the franchise on both the iOS and Android platforms.  will be available for download in the U.S. and Canada later this year, as NetEase tries to replicate the popularity of the game in these big mobile gaming markets. In fact, the game has already been downloaded over 200 million times, so it brings a strong track record to North America.Newzoo forecasts that the U.S. alone will generate $25 billion of video gaming revenue this year. A substantial portion of this revenue should come from smartphones and tablets, as these two platforms are expected to account for 42% of global gaming revenue. NetEase's latest move will open the doors to a massive new opportunity beyond its home market of China.To boost the mobile business, NetEase has also brought the highly popular  franchise to China. The company launched a Chinese iOS version of the game in September, while the Android version is expected this month.  is an extremely popular game, with more than  . What's more important is that more than half of  players in the Asia-Pacific region are on the mobile platform, so it should give NetEase's mobile gaming revenue an additional shot in the arm.These are just some of the games that NetEase is banking on to drive growth. Earlier this year, the company had revealed a pipeline of more than 30 titles, including 13 new mobile games set to be launched in the coming quarters.In all, NetEase's mobile gaming business is unlikely to slow down given the number of titles it has up its sleeve, especially in mobile, as that segment already makes up almost three-fourths of total revenue.NetEase is trying to augment its mobile gaming business by hunting for opportunities in the e-commerce and email markets. Last quarter, revenue from this business jumped an impressive 69% to $494 million thanks to the improving adoption of its Kaola and Yanxuan e-commerce platforms, outpacing the 47% annual growth in the gaming business.Encouraged by this growth, NetEase has decided to spend over $3 billion on European products over the next three years to bring more than 2,000 brands into the Chinese market (on top of thousands of additional brands from the U.S., South Korea, and Japan). The company believes that this move will increase the appeal of Kaola to the big spenders in China, as European products rank second for online sales in the region.The company is trying to differentiate its e-commerce platform by reducing delivery times, with plans to build an automated warehouse spread across 2.7 million sq. ft. next year, so Chinese consumers can get faster access to foreign goods. This should help NetEase claim a larger piece of the fast-growing Chinese e-commerce market, which is expected to exceed $956 billion in revenue by 2022, according to one estimate.NetEase is one of the most undervalued Chinese internet stocks out there.

Yet the company still seems like a plucky startup. As of this writing, for the year so far, Alibaba has logged a sizzling return of 110% bringing the BABA stock price up to $184.89. Source: ShutterstockBut on Thursday, we'll get more details on how things are progressing, as the company will disclose its quarterly numbers.So here's what the Street is looking for. Earnings are expected to hit $1.03 per share, up 30% on a year-over-year basis, and revenues are forecasted to reach $7.85 billion, up an impressive 52%. These numbers are essentially on par with the outlook from BABA's management.The quarter also saw some notable announcements, such as the following:The rise of BABA stock should be no surprise. The company is the dominant player in the Chinese e-commerce market with 454 million active buyers.And yes, the growth is likely to continue for some time. By  , e-commerce spending in China is expected to jumped from $470 billion this year to $839.54 billion.But when it comes to BABA stock, the story is more than just about e-commerce. During the past few years, the company has leveraged its user base into other important categories like video (with the  acquisition), cloud computing and even entertainment. There have also been savvy investments in operators like  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ).Interestingly enough, in a  , the executive chairman of BABA, he called the opportunity the \"Alibaba economy.\" The focus is primarily on the long term, with the bold forecast that by 2036, the company's digital platform will \"support commerce activity with a combined transaction value that will rank as the world's fifth-largest economy.\"Now this is not to imply that BABA stock is not without its risks. Let's face it, the Chinese market is heavily controlled by the government. In fact, during the summer, the authorities had a crackdown on some of the social networks because of political speech.Besides, BABA does face more competition. One of its fiercest rivals is  (NASDAQ:  ), which has been gaining traction. But Tencent could be a major problem too, as it controls massive digital platforms like WeChat.However, perhaps the biggest risk for BABA stock is that the investor sentiment is almost giddy. For the most part, investors are looking for a solid beat.True, over the past couple years, BABA has done fairly well on earnings. But then again, there have been misses too. So with the upcoming earnings report, it's probably best to wait on the sidelines and see what happens.

Therefore it might seem tough to find decent Chinese tech plays trading at reasonable multiples. So today, I'll highlight three Chinese stocks which still trade at surprisingly low valuations --  (NASDAQ: NTES) ,  (NYSE: YRD) , and  (NYSE: CHL) .NetEase publishes PC and mobile games. It also develops social, news, and media apps, provides online services like email and note-taking services, and owns the e-commerce site Kaola.com. However, the lion's share of its revenue comes from its gaming business, which publishes popular Chinese games like  ,  , and  .NetEase's Onmyoji. Image source: Google Play.NetEase published three of the top ten highest-grossing games in both the Chinese iOS and Android app stores in July. This makes it the only major game publisher that can effectively compete against  (NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) , which dominates the charts with hit games like  , the  in China.NetEase is  by bigger tech companies in China, but its growth is impressive -- its revenue and earnings respectively rose 68% and 73% in 2016. Analysts expect its revenue to rise 40% this year, but for its earnings to rise just 8% on higher game production expenses. However, its earnings are expected to rise 17% next year after it launches new titles.NetEase trades at just 18 times earnings, which is lower than Tencent's P/E of 53 and lower than the industry average of 37 for internet information providers. It also pays a forward dividend yield of 1.4%, which is supported by a low payout ratio of 25%.Yirendai is a peer-to-peer (P2P) lender that cuts banks  . This business model has proven wildly popular in China, where outstanding P2P loans hit 816.2 billion yuan ($123 billion) in 2016 -- compared to just over 100 billion yuan in 2014.However, the P2P market is also a risky one due to fraud and problematic loans. Last year, Chinese regulators claimed that about three quarters of all P2P lenders had troubled loans on their balance sheets. In response, the country started capping loans from a single lender and limiting maximum loans per individual, and banned P2P lenders from taking public deposits and selling wealth-management products.But despite those headwinds, Yirendai's growth remains robust. Its revenue rose 137% annually in 2016, while its net income and adjusted EBITDA respectively jumped 356% and 217%. Wall Street expects its revenue to rise 59% this year, but for its earnings to rise just 7% this year on higher expenses before growing another 37% next year.Those growth figures make Yirendai look remarkably cheap at 13 times earnings. However, the stock is cheap due to ongoing concerns about tighter regulation and the company's dependence on subprime loans. Last quarter, only 5.8% of loans on its platform were provided to top-tier \"Grade I\" lenders -- which could be a red flag for its long-term growth.China Mobile is the  in China, with a wireless customer base of 874 million. Only 617 of those customers are on 4G networks, which leaves the telco room to boost its average revenue per customer with upgrades. It also serves 99 million customers with its newer wireline business, which can be bundled with wireless plans.Image source: Getty Images.China Mobile, along with its two industry peers  and  , are state-backed enterprises. The government periodically rotates the management of all three telcos and oversees deals so that one company doesn't overwhelm the other two. While that system ultimately throttles China Mobile's growth, it prevents margin-crushing pricing wars and makes it a fairly low risk investment.Unlike NetEase and Yirendai, China Mobile is a slow growth play. Its revenue and earnings respectively rose 1% and 7% last year, and analysts expect both figures to rise about 5% this year. But China Mobile's stock is also cheap at 13 times earnings, which is well below the industry average of 22 for telecom companies. It also pays a 5.5% forward yield (paid semi-annually), which is supported by a payout ratio of 44%.These three Chinese stocks all have low valuations, but they have very different risk profiles. Conservative investors should stick with China Mobile, investors looking for a little more risk can buy NetEase, while speculative investors can nibble on Yirendai -- which could either generate huge gains or incur big losses with its wobbly loan portfolio.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Several questions surfaced in the wake of the news, including: How big is the opportunity here? Is the opportunity yet reflected in the current Alibaba stock price?Though the company has quietly tinkered with video games in the recent past, it officially entered the fray late last month with its  . The acquisition was made in conjunction with official word from Alibaba Digital Media and Entertainment Group that it was establishing a standalone gaming division.This is a 180-degree turnaround from Ma's previous feelings and statements about video games. He said in 2008 that Alibaba \"would rather starve to death than live on games.\"Either way, Alibaba stock holders should be celebrating the change of heart, as there's a good deal of money to be made in the business. How  money is up for grabs largely depends on which sliver of this market you're talking about.Games developed for consoles like those made by  (NYSE:  ) or  (OTCMKTS:  ) are an entirely different breed of games from those only meant to be played online with other online players. Some games lend themselves to be played as an eSport, while others are ideal for playing by yourself, including offline.

What the eSports outlook from Newzoo doesn't factor in is all the ancillary revenue the fledgling industry indirectly drives, as would-be competitors try to play their way into a tournament.The likely focus for Alibaba's new gaming unit will be mirroring the development of multiplayer online gaming, akin to what Tencent and NetEase have already established. Clues pointing in that direction are the fact that former NetEase COO, Zhan Zhonghui, will be taking the lead of the new division, and that two of the leads for EJoy's multiplayer-hosted games like  and  are also remaining in place.There's more down the road though.  is already a  , and Alibaba has convinced overseers to include  at 2022's Asian Games to be held in Hangzhou. The company is also petitioning to add video games as an official Olympic sport. In fact, it's already  and clearly sees enough there to up the ante, so to speak.Realistically speaking, much like its Chinese and American counterparts, Alibaba may not exactly know where it's going with video games. Nobody can accurately predict what this ever-changing business will look like even just five years from now. Alibaba simply knows there's opportunity, and it's better to stake its claim now rather than later by buying a presence and securing the talent it needs to make sure it can succeed no matter what the future holds.Whatever that future looks like, Alibaba stock holders can take comfort in the fact that the company is quickly catching up on this previously ignored front.The post ) Stock Enters the Video Game Business appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (Symbol: EEM) where we have detected an approximate $123.7 million dollar inflow -- that's a 0.3% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 803,250,000 to 805,950,000).

These gaming stocks have outperformed the broader market handsomely in 2017. data by  .The popularity of video game stocks isn't a surprise. Video game sales have been growing at a staggering pace. In July, for instance, overall video game sales jumped 19% year over year in the U.S., per estimates from NPD Group. Looking ahead, the trend is expected to continue as global video game revenue is forecasted to grow 27% by 2020 compared to last year.Therefore, it won't be surprising if these video game companies, especially Glu Mobile and NetEase, keep rising given their smart moves to tap the secular end-market growth.Image source: Getty Images.Glu Mobile has staged an impressive comeback this year. Its games have started bringing in the dough thanks to its strategy of developing franchise-based titles in place of one-hit wonders. These franchise-based titles are capable of generating revenue on a recurring basis as they are regularly updated with new features and gameplay experience, encouraging users to  on in-game purchases.More importantly, Glu has outlined a strategy of relying on big-name titles going forward. For instance, the company is developing a game in collaboration with  that will feature names and likenesses of wrestling superstars and legends. Glu has made it clear that it is going to use the storylines usually seen on WWE to build an easy-to-play game with simple controls, tapping the same studio that has developed its highly popular  franchise.Glu Mobile expects to launch this title sometime in 2018 to tap the casual sports gaming genre. Once launched, the title could become a big deal for the mobile gaming specialist given the popularity of WWE across the globe. As it stands, WWE's two marquee shows, RAW and SmackDown, pull in more than 5 million viewers a week, setting the stage for potential windfall gains in the future.Additionally, Glu is going to rely on celebrity firepower to boost its financials. Back in 2016, it had signed a partnership with Taylor Swift to develop a mobile game for her, and this title is set to be launched late in 2017. Glu has already made big money with a celebrity-centric game as its  title has roped in revenue of  in just the year and a half since its launch, so the Taylor Swift-based game could turn out to be another hit and catalyze Glu's revenue in the long run.NetEase has been increasingly relying on the mobile gaming business for more of its revenue. Last quarter, the company pulled 73% of its total revenue from mobile. As it turns out, mobile's contribution to the company's business has taken off remarkably in recent quarters, rising from just 61% a year ago.The massive growth in NetEase's revenue in this space can be attributed to its strategy of porting its already-popular PC client games to the mobile platform, as well as developing new titles from scratch. This is a shrewd strategy as Newzoo forecasts that global mobile gaming revenue will jump from $38.6 billion last year to almost $65 billion in 2020.More importantly, China is set to account for almost a third of global mobile gaming revenue by the end of the decade. NetEase, therefore, is doing the right thing by changing gears and setting itself up to benefit from the secular growth opportunity in mobile gaming.NetEase's commercial launch of the  -owned  title on the mobile platform in China this year could substantially enhance its revenue given the game's popularity in international markets. As it stands,  has more than 100 million registered users globally, and over half of its players in the Asia-Pacific region are on the mobile platform.What's more, investors get a cheap entry into the video game market with NetEase since it trades at less than 19 times last year's earnings. This is way lower than the industry median of over 33, and it makes the stock a value play given its long-term potential.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

NetEase, Inc (Symbol: NTES) presently has an above average rank, in the top 50% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most \"interesting\" ideas that merit further research by investors.But making NetEase, Inc an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Tuesday, shares of NTES entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $259.44 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of NetEase, Inc, the RSI reading has hit 29.4 - by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by  currently has an average RSI of 46.7. A falling stock price - all else being equal - creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, NTES's recent annualized dividend of 3.32/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 1.25% based upon the recent $266.83 share price.A bullish investor could look at NTES's 29.4 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on NTES is its dividend history. In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, NTES makes up 11.58% of the NASDAQ China Technology ETF (Symbol: QQQC) which is trading lower by about 0.7% on the day Tuesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (Symbol: EEM) where we have detected an approximate $60.3 million dollar inflow -- that's a 0.2% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 797,400,000 to 798,750,000).

For the PowerShares QQQ ETF (Symbol: QQQ), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $158.43 per unit.With QQQ trading at a recent price near $144.65 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.52% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.

The Chinese video gaming giant easily surpassed Wall Street's expectations on both revenue and earnings, but its shares fell as part of a broader decline in Chinese stocks.But investors shouldn't get bothered by the post-earnings stock price drop. NetEase's latest quarterly report shows that it is pulling the right strings to tap the massive opportunity in the Chinese mobile gaming market, while also harboring international ambitions. Additionally, the company has built a strong pipeline of new games that should act as long-term catalysts.Here are some of the key takeaways from NetEase's second-quarter report that show why it is built for growth.Image Source: Getty ImagesMobile gaming now supplies 72% of NetEase's overall revenue as compared to 61% in the second quarter of 2016. This impressive growth was driven by the company's shrewd strategy of using the popularity of its PC games to gain more users on the mobile platform. Additionally, NetEase has kept refreshing its legacy games with new content to keep players engaged.Looking ahead, NetEase's mobile business is set up for stronger growth thanks to the impending launch of the highly popular  franchise. The PC version of this game is already in the beta-testing phase, and the mobile beta-test phase is expected to start soon.The company expects to commercially launch this game in the current quarter, paving the way for stronger top-line growth as this game is played by more than  . What's more, over 50% of  players in the Asia-Pacific are on mobile, so it won't be surprising if the game turns out to be a hit in the Chinese market.But the good news for NetEase investors is that it is looking to expand beyond China into markets such as Europe, North America, and other areas of the Asia-Pacific region. The company's  title has already gained impressive traction in Japan and Southeast Asia, clocking a record number of downloads last quarter.NetEase is now optimizing this game for the other international markets mentioned above. This sets the company on its way to tap a $50 billion-plus mobile gaming opportunity in North America and Europe combined. So, NetEase's mobile gaming growth won't run out of steam anytime soon if it manages to make a dent in these new areas.NetEase's increased contribution from mobile games has a downside in the form of weaker margins. The company's overall gross profit margin fell to 55% last quarter as compared to 59% in the prior-year period as mobile games have a relatively lower gross margin profile. More specifically, NetEase's gross margin from the online gaming business was down 3.1 percentage points year over year.Looking ahead, the decline in NetEase's gross profit margins should continue on the back of its growing mobile gaming business. But as has been the case so far, rapid top-line growth should help it mitigate the lower margin profile and lead to a better earnings performance. data by NetEase shares continue to remain cheap despite the company's rapid growth. The company trades at 21.6 times last year's earnings, which is significantly cheaper than the industry median of 33. Additionally, a forward  of 17 signifies that its bottom line is expected to keep growing.Consensus estimates indicate that NetEase's earnings could jump to $16.02 per share in 2017 from $13.06 last year.

In addition, some of China's larger players (  (  ) and  (  )) have pursued growth via Western gaming markets. New games and new potential market combinations - such as fantasy sports and entertainment - have kept analysts amped about the industry's prospects.China's NetEase and  (EA) of Redwood City, Calif., are two of the biggest names in global video games. NetEase shares have pumped up a 45% advance, and Electronic Arts' stock has soared 48% since Jan. 1. But the stocks driving growth above 50% begin with  (ATVI).

A six-week advance has left the stock  at 92.04.The stocks of national homebuilders have rallied despite what most in the industry describe as extremely taut market conditions. Tight land and labor markets, rising materials and labor costs, and an undersupply of existing homes have combined to hold the homebuilding industry well below its potential, although the demand for new homes is largely seen as healthy.Housing starts are on track for a gain of around 9% this year, which would put them near 855,000 - well below the industry's sustainable level of production, which is near 1.3 million starts, says Chief Economist Robert Dietz with the National Association of Home Builders. The NAHB forecasts that the industry will creep up to 1 million starts in 2019.In the meantime, homebuilders walk a tightrope, attempting to maximize growth and profit in a limited-growth market, while their bottom lines face pressure from rising costs.Despite those pressures, big names like  (DHI) and  (PHM) rose more than 30% since Jan. 1. But the strongest growth came from Reston, Va.-based  (NVR) and  (LGIH), in The Woodlands, Texas.

That's natural: If a stock has recently had a big run-up in price, it's easy for investors to feel that they've missed the boat -- or put another way, that there's nowhere to go but back down.Sometimes, though, a stock trading at a new high is just  its run-up. In fact, some investors have learned that (with certain stocks, anyway) a new high might be a  signal, a sign that something has recently changed for the better.Of course, you need to look closely at such stocks before concluding that the growth story is just beginning.

Here's why they think  (NYSE: RACE) ,  (NASDAQ: ATVI) , and  (NASDAQ: TTWO) still have a lot of growth left, despite their recent price surges.Demand has been very strong for the latest Ferrari, the ferocious V12-powered 812 Superfast. Despite a starting price well over $300,000, it's already sold out until 2019. Image source: Ferrari N.V. Supercar maker Ferrari was a private company for decades, owned by Italian automaker Fiat and the Ferrari family. But Fiat, now part of  , decided to spin off its 90% stake in Italy's automotive crown jewel late in 2015, bringing Ferrari to the public markets for the first time in its long history.At first, investors didn't know what to make of Ferrari, which limits its annual production to preserve exclusivity. How would a company that refuses to increase sales generate the profit growth that investors seek? A few months after the IPO, CEO Sergio Marchionne answered that question -- and then this happened: data by  .Ferrari's stock took off like, well, a Ferrari. Now it's trading at a  rich valuation -- about 32 times its expected 2017 earnings. But despite that very rich valuation, Ferrari's shares might still be a buy. Consider the following:Marchionne has argued (persuasively) that Ferrari deserves a valuation in line with luxury companies, in the neighborhood of 25 times earnings. It's ahead of that right now -- but if it can boost its bottom line substantially over the next few years, as seems likely, then there's still room for growth here. Shares of video game giant Activision Blizzard are up nearly 70% year to date, and trade within a grenade's throw of all-time highs as of this writing. But with eight game franchises now generating annual sales of at least $1 billion, the  and  creator's recent strength is unique in that it easily  for the second quarter despite a relatively light slate of new releases.More than 80% of Activision's revenue last quarter came from digital channels, which means it's not leaning nearly as hard on retail sales of new consoles or physical game releases to drive revenue and earnings. And for those who doubted its $5.9 billion acquisition of mobile game leader King Digital in late 2015, King has grown bookings per paying user for each of the past eight quarters, and maintained two of the top-10 highest-grossing titles in U.S. mobile app stores for the past 15 quarters.In addition, Activision is looking forward to the impending launches of  and  in September and November, respectively. Management has stated that both pre-order momentum and hands-on feedback have been strong for the two blockbuster titles.Over the longer term, Activision also remains poised to benefit from the rise of esports. The company says 285 million people worldwide watched esports events last year. And just last month, Activision announced the sale of the first Overwatch League teams for major global cities to several entrepreneurs and sports/esports leaders, including the likes of Kraft Group CEO and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, New York Mets VC and COO Jeff Wilpon,  (NASDAQ: NTES) , and Kabam co-founder Kevin Chou.In my opinion, as arguably the best-positioned company to capitalize on the stunning momentum of the gaming world, Activision should be able to continue generating market-beating returns for years to come.

Investors in  (NASDAQ: NTES) have been pleased with the video game giant's  because of its leading position in the Chinese gaming market, but in the back of their minds, they've wondered just  without interruption.Coming into Wednesday's second-quarter financial report,  in key business fundamentals that they've come to take for granted in past quarters. NetEase's report had solid numbers in it, but a decrease in earnings growth was enough to spook some shareholders, sparking new concerns about the company's longer-term prospects. Let's take a closer look at NetEase to see whether its results have anything to say about its future.Image source: Getty Images.NetEase's second-quarter results definitely showed continued growth. Revenue grew by nearly half in the Chinese currency, translating to $1.97 billion and topping the consensus forecast among those following the stock of about $1.9 billion in sales. However, adjusted net income was higher by only 8%, and that worked out to $512.2 million, or $3.86 per share. Those numbers were below investor expectations.Taking a closer look at the report, NetEase kept getting very strong revenue growth from most of its key segments. The online game services unit brought in 47% higher revenue compared to the year-ago quarter, as mobile gaming continued to take more share of overall activity, climbing by more than 10 percentage points to 72% of segment sales. The email, e-commerce, and other business segment posted nearly 70% growth in local-currency revenue. Yet the advertising services unit once again failed to post very strong results, with gains of just 12% on its top line. The company said that the automobile, internet services, and real estate industries were primarily responsible for advertising unit performance during the period.As we've seen in previous quarters, NetEase wasn't able to make as much profit from its rising sales. Gross margin in the key online games business fell by more than 3 percentage points to 63.1%, as the company once again noted that its mobile game products have lower-margin figures than its traditional desktop online games. Advertising services margins rose slightly, but gross margin for the email and e-commerce business plunged by two-thirds to just 11.3% as NetEase saw a different mix of e-commerce-related business.CEO William Ding was happy with how NetEase did. \"We continued to invest in new content development,\" Ding said, \"that broadens our offering and engages our community across our business lines.\" The CEO also pointed out that mobile gaming is still the company's best path forward to growth despite the rising importance of e-commerce.NetEase is still optimistic about its future. The company pointed to its pipeline of games, including the hit  along with two Japanese-themed role-playing games. Moreover, Ding said that its markets are far from saturated, as \"additional penetration in China's mobile market as well as overseas markets offer considerable room for NetEase's ever-increasing portfolio\" of games.Yet the company did signal signs of its tougher times on the bottom line by reducing its dividend. NetEase approved a $0.83 per share dividend for the second quarter, down from $1.08 per share in the first quarter of 2017. NetEase's dividend policy reflects the company's anticipated after-tax net income after each quarter, and so the weaker results flowed through to the payments that shareholders will receive.NetEase shareholders weren't happy to see the company facing any signs of future challenges, and the stock fell more than 6% in  Thursday morning following the late Wednesday announcement. Growth on the top line is good, but investors will want to make sure that NetEase doesn't neglect profit considerations. If the company doesn't bounce back in the remainder of 2017, then worries about NetEase's long-term prospects will only worsen over time.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Revenue surged, but a profit shortfall and an analyst downgrade weighed on the stock. Shares of NetEase were down about 9% at 12:45 p.m. EDT.NetEase reported second-quarter revenue of $2.0 billion, up 49.4% year over year. Online game services revenue soared 46.5% to $1.4 billion, while email, e-commerce, and other revenue rose 68.9% to $494 million.Advertising revenue increased 12.1% to $87.9 million. CEO William Ding explained that online games are the company's biggest opportunity:Image source: Getty Images.Non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings per share came in at $3.86, up from $3.60 in the prior-year period but down from $4.82 in the first quarter. Analysts were expecting EPS of $4.02. The profit shortfall led CLSA to downgrade the stock to \"underperform,\" citing a sequential slowdown in online games and the drag on margins created by e-commerce. Ding commented during the conference call that profitability was not the near-term focus for the e-commerce business.Shares of NetEase have soared over the past five years, up about 430% in that time even after Thursday's plunge. NetEase is not a particularly cheap stock, trading for around 21 times earnings.

It has nearly 1 billion email users and has a respectable advertising and e-commerce division as well.Unlike its chief Chinese rival,  (OTCMKTS:  ), NetEase is gaining a large share of mobile MMORPG market, arguably the hottest sector in gaming. And even if you compare NetEase to its American compatriots  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ), it has been performing like its U.S. cousins.

And its email and e-commerce businesses were up 68% over the same time period.Yet the stock doesn't reflect these impressive gains, which is good for anyone interested in the stock. It means even after its run, you're still buying in at a discount, since NTES stock is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of only 20.Also remember that China has been slogging through a recession and gaming is a cheap form of entertainment, especially for the younger demographic. And the MMORPG platform means all these young professionals that have moved to the big city can play with their new friends as well as their old ones back home. There are few technologies that are as transformative in the new online world.Given that while NTES is game-driven - about 65% of its revenue is derived from gaming - the bigger its email business grows and its games business grows just multiplies the opportunities to expand its e-commerce and advertising businesses. Look no further than  (NASDAQ:  ) to see how advertising can become a game changer for a social media business.As the Chinese economy revives, there's little doubt that MMORPG will continue its rise, since this type of gaming is just as much about developing a social network as it is about playing a game.

But can the gaming giant trump expectations once again? Let's find out.Image source: NetEase.Wall Street expects NetEase's second-quarter earnings to come in at $3.79 per share on revenue of $1.91 billion. The estimates suggest that the company's revenue and earnings will grow quite substantially given the year-ago earnings of $3.05 per share on sales of $1.32 billion.But NetEase doesn't provide any specific guidance, so it is difficult to judge how the company is foreseeing the quarter. However, NetEase had said earlier this year that it will grow at a faster pace in 2017 as compared to last year, which can give us an idea about its potential second-quarter performance.NetEase's top line had jumped just over 13% on a quarter-over-quarter basis during the second quarter of the fiscal year 2016 to $1.32 billion. An identical increment this time will push the company's revenue to $2.26 billion as compared to the first quarter of 2017, which is much higher than what analysts expect.If the company can deliver on its promise of growing at an improved pace in 2017 it should deliver higher-than-expected results.

That long-term trend is easy to spot in the following chart:Source: On the bright side, those margins remain high and should stabilize as NetEase finds its ideal balance between PC and mobile titles.NetEase trades at just 21 times earnings, which is lower than the industry average of 37 for internet information providers and its projected earnings growth this year. It also pays a forward dividend yield of 1.4%, and its low payout ratio of 22% indicates that it has plenty of room to raise that dividend.Those figures make NetEase a rare find -- a tech company that's posting double-digit sales and earnings growth, yet trades at a discount to its peers and pays a  .NetEase isn't a stock for queasy investors, since it's volatile and often stumbles on headlines about China or potential regulations on the mobile-gaming industry.

The growth was across all Top-Level Domains (TLDs) as both .com and .net grew during the quarter. On a combined basis, .com and .net domain names improved 0.8% year over year to approximately 143.6 million in the first quarter.VeriSign is the exclusive registrar of the .com, .net and .name domains per its agreements with The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).The company is benefiting from strong gTLD prospects. New gTLDs (\"ngTLD\") represent 7.7% of total domain name registrations.Reportedly, new .com and .net registrations were 9.5 million compared with 10 million in the year-ago quarter. VeriSign reported that .com continued to maintain its #1 position as the largest TLD, followed by .cn (China) and .tk (Tokelau).We believe that increasing domain name registration coupled with price hikes for the .com and .net domain names will drive top-line growth. | Moreover, in order to maintain its growth trajectory, VeriSign needs to keep expanding in the international market, particularly in emerging markets like India and China.Per a recent study, India's domain name industry has grown nearly 12% in the last three years compared to the global average of 8.7%. China has also been showing a consistent improvement in ranking, which indicates increased demand for domain name registration in the country.The company also enjoys strong growth opportunities in the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) security market and the network security products space. Increasing instances of cybercrime have expanded the scope for cybersecurity companies like VeriSign.Notably, its shares have massively outperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shares of Chinese online services company  (NASDAQ: NTES) have gained nearly 50% in value since the beginning of the year, according to data provided by  , fueled by the torrid growth of China's video game market.Image source: Getty Images.NetEase got off to a fast start in 2017,  in February on the heels of a strong fourth-quarter earnings report that revealed a 53% year-over-year revenue leap to 12.099 billion Chinese renminbi (RMB), or roughly $1.74 billion.

It's been a mutually beneficial partnership, and NetEase has become the licensing partner for most --  -- of Activision's rollouts into restrictive but game-happy China.Shareholders have been the real winners here. Activision shares have soared 559% since the original springtime 2009 licensing deal was announced. The gains get even better for NetEase, up 1,019% in that time.It only makes sense for NetEase to buy a team. NetEase's participation will keep Activision happy and close. It also may prove to be $20 million well spent if esports continues to gain in popularity.There are already more than 30 million  players worldwide, with millions of those games sold through NetEase into China.

The first season's matches will take place at an esports arena in the Los Angeles area, but franchise owners will be working on formal venues in their home markets to create a true home-field advantage against visiting teams in future seasons. The participating team owners stand to rake in plenty of dough through advertising and revenue-sharing deals, juicy rewards given how much marketers are willing to pay to reach an audience that isn't easily accessible these days.The Overwatch League is the right product at the right time. There are 285 million viewers of esports worldwide.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 5 different analyst targets contributing to that average for NetEase, Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $280.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $330.00. The standard deviation is $26.551.But the whole reason to look at the  NTES price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with NTES crossing above that average target price of $309.00/share, investors in NTES have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $309.00 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

Advisory services contribute most of the remainder, or more than 55% of revenue each year.Investment banking and asset management are attractive businesses because they require little capital investment to grow. Instead, growth comes by way of hiring new people, growing headcount to increase the volume of business that Lazard can complete each year. Thus, Lazard can send virtually all of its earnings out to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. In 2016, the company paid regular and special dividends that gave it a yield of 7.5%. Including repurchases, total capital returns added up to roughly 10% of the company's market cap last year.Shares trade at about 14 times last year's earnings, an attractive multiple for a company that should be able to reliably pay out a total yield above 5% for a very long time to come. Some of the greatest stocks out there are connected to utterly boring businesses. That's exactly what you get from Cintas.The company specializes in corporate uniform rentals and so-called facility services, a term that includes restroom cleaning operations and weekly shipments of freshly sanitized mops. It's the kind of business that nobody really wants to do but needs to be done, so Cintas steps up like a champ.The boredom doesn't stop there. This mundane business has generated annual sales growth of 5.2% over the last five years while earnings rose 19.5% on average. Here's a chart to illustrate those fundamental growth trends: data by  .Cintas generates $366 million of annual free cash flows on sales of $5.1 billion these days, and 39% of that spendable cash is returned to shareholders in the form of dividend checks. Don't let me bore you with stories of Cintas' equally generous share buyback policies, which absorb most of the remaining cash flows every year. Cintas has reduced its total share count by 17% over the last five years, or 34% in a decade.No, you're really here to learn more about Cintas' dividend habits. There, the company has increased its annual payouts without fail in every year since 1984, come what may. Sure, the current yield stands at a skimpy 1.1%, but that's only because share prices have skyrocketed in recent years. It's hard to maintain a generous dividend yield when share prices have tripled in five years.

On American shores, the name NetEase might be familiar to hardcore video game fans or investors who keep a close eye on the technology sector, but it's still relatively unknown compared to other companies operating in the video game and online services spaces. Much of that likely has to do with the fact that the company is based out of and mostly operates in China, but its stock packs a combination of growth potential and returned income that deserves attention from stateside investors.NetEase is partnered with American companies including  and  for the distribution of hugely popular games like  and  , but it also releases popular domestic video game properties and runs social and e-commerce platforms.

The company only began distributing dividends in 2014, but it's delivered payout increases in each subsequent year, and the annualized cost of distributing its current quarterly dividend represents just 25% of trailing free cash flow -- indicating that it has plenty of room to continue payout increases down the line.Trading at roughly 17 times forward earnings estimates, NetEase looks like a worthwhile stock for investing in Chinese internet and video game growth, and the fact that it will pay you to own it further sweetens the pot.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

China Mobile trades at just 14 times earnings, compared to the industry average of 22 for telecom companies.China Mobile pays semi-annual dividends, which are declared every half year based on its earnings growth. This makes it less predictable than its western counterparts, but its trailing yield has remained between 2.75% and 5% over the past five years. Its current yield of 3.3% is easily supported by its payout ratio of 43%.Lenovo is the largest PC maker in the world. It generates most of its sales from its PC and Smart Devices division, which sells PCs, 2-in-1s, and tablets. That business posted year-over-year growth in recent quarters, fueled by stronger demand for high-end laptops and 2-in-1 devices.Source: Lenovo.Lenovo's mobile business, which sells Lenovo and Moto devices, is struggling in the saturated Chinese market but growing in overseas markets like Latin America.

Its top franchises -- like  and  -- are popular in China but aren't widely recognized in other countries.Wall Street expects NetEase's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 40% and 22% this year, making it a much higher-growth play than its Western counterparts. The stock is also surprisingly cheap at 22 times earnings, which is well below the industry average of 37 for internet information providers.NetEase pays a forward yield of 1.5%, and it's hiked that dividend every year after it started quarterly payments in 2014. That dividend will likely keep rising, since it's supported by a low payout ratio of 23%.Shares of video game retailer GameStop dropped nearly 20% this year due to a seismic shift in brick-and-mortar retail and video game purchases. Over the past few years, digital distribution platforms (like Valve's Steam and EA's Origin) became a win-win situation for gamers and publishers. Gamers found it easier to download digital copies, and publishers expanded their margins by cutting retailers out of the loop and ditching disks, packaging, and manuals.GameStop, which was already struggling with sluggish mall traffic, was left out in the cold. That's why its revenue and earnings respectively fell 8% and 3% last year. To offset that slowdown, GameStop diversified away from games into collectibles and mobile devices, started selling more digital games online, and  its own games.Robust sales of collectibles, along with strong demand for the  Switch, helped GameStop grow its revenue by 4% annually last quarter, marking its first quarter of annual sales growth following four straight quarters of declines. Analysts expect GameStop's sales to rise 1% this year, but its earnings are still expected to fall 12% due to the aforementioned headwinds.However, GameStop trades at just 6 times earnings, compared to the industry average of 44 for specialty retailers. It pays a forward yield of 7.4%, and it's hiked that payout annually for five straight years.

At the same time, other businesses, including its email and e-commerce unit, have contributed to NetEase's overall growth, with sales gains whose rates rival those of the gaming unit.NetEase has several paths to growth. Partnerships with other game-makers put NetEase in a position of being a vital gateway for international video gaming companies to tap the Chinese market, allowing NetEase to reap the rewards of being an intermediary. At the same time, the company has gone beyond China's borders, seeking to launch games in other promising markets like Japan.

Value investors looking for a growth stock might just find the ticket in AMC Entertainment, the world's biggest movie theater operator that's capitalizing on the blockbuster films coming out of Hollywood, all the while offering a discounted stock price. Same thing for growth investors looking to buy into a value-oriented stock.Shares of AMC have lost 35% of their value since hitting $35 a stub at the end of last year over concern that premium video on demand will draw moviegoers away from theaters, hurting revenues. There is some reason to the fear as Tinseltown has produced a string of poorly received films while ticket prices have climbed higher. The cost of an average movie ticket is $8.84, making a night out a pricey proposition, particularly when you have mediocre fare on the big screen to choose from. The Memorial Day weekend box office was the worst since 1999. It's easier to stay home and watch something on demand.Some might even compare the fate of films to that of newspapers, but the movie industry isn't the same thing as the newspaper business, even if both are suffering from the way people consume their entertainment and news. With newspapers, the information you're getting is stale the minute you open one, and the internet allows for 24/7 updates.With movies, while the ability to achieve instant gratification by watching  when you want to has similarities to the plight of papers, you still get something of an \"experience\" by going to the theater. There's something to be said for seeing a movie on a huge screen as opposed to your television, or worse, laptop (and don't even bring smartphones into the equation).All of this means AMC Entertainment's beaten-down stock is attractive. It goes for a market-like 24 times earnings, but just 18 times next year's estimates, while trading at just a fraction of its revenues. The movie mogul also pays an annual dividend of $0.80 per share that's currently yielding a tasty 3.6%. That allows investors to get paid for owning the stock while waiting for the next installments of Star Wars, Transformers, and more.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

You see, NetEase has diversified its operations so that revenue comes from three different sources. The company's revenue stream is derived from its Advertising Services, Email and E-commerce and Online Gaming divisions.The latter is generally not found outside of the Chinese marketplace, though. Some of the bigger social media companies and online content providers also have gaming divisions that are usually an incredibly profitable part of their business models.In NTES' case, its massively multi-player online role-playing games (MMORPGs), which are growing in popularity, are the engine of its business model and the force behind NetEase stock. And, the beauty of these games is they're not expensive.In a relatively young society with a growing middle class, people don't tend to rush out and buy big-ticket items with the extra yuan that come their way. Instead, they buy a name brand shoe or a designer dress, a nicer phone, or a few extra games to play with friends.China is also a society that is transitioning from a largely spread out, agrarian population to one where mega-cities are popping up all over. This movement of people means that new city dwellers are looking for some kind of connection with people like them, as well as the people they left behind.And, NTES' most recent Q1 numbers bear this out.Revenue for the quarter was up 72% compared to the same quarter last year.

If so, we might be seeing another rotation as energy and financials have taken the lead. Congratulations to traders who made bets on the bank stress tests.This important topic has already attracted expert attention, as we see in today's Trading Tips.And also, this\u2026.I'll share my own observations in the conclusion.This week's choices cover a wide range - different sectors, market caps and risk-reward. : It's been a long year for Hertz (  ). This stock has been on a steep decline for nine months, but there's a good reason to like it in the long run. The chart shows why:Apart from a small bump in early November, this is pretty ugly. Now that the price has declined from $50 to $11, this is a buying opportunity. The segment from mid-May to late June could be something Jeff calls a \"reverse head and shoulders.\" : It requires a lot of imagination to see an upside-down-head and shoulders in that chart! I suggest you read my post from earlier this week - The Limits of Technical Analysis. The  had a spirited debate in the comments. There are some examples of chart-reading like yours. : I suppose that you will next show a chart from a fundamental analyst, like  . : Of course. His tools are the best! Anyone serious about buying a stock should begin with a look at Chuck's analysis. : You can see the huge decline in earnings both last year and this year. The soft market for used cars, which they depend upon to turn over their fleet, is a problem. The rise of Uber (UBER) is another. Many are choosing the inexpensive ride service rather than a car rental. : That may be the reason for the decline, which I do not care about. I am focused on the rebound. : Are you paying any attention to the SEC? : Why would I do that? : Your purchase of the stock at nine and change was within hours of the company's announcement of an  (  ). The SEC monitors \"insider trading.\" The stock spiked $2. : You mean the story about Apple leasing six (count 'em, six) cars for testing? : That might not impress you, but rightly or wrongly, the stock soared after that news. : Sometimes the prior chart action provides a clue. That was the case here. I had no inside information, but some other buyers might have. That is often the reason behind technical buy signals. : Would you still buy the stock now - after the instant gain? Most traders would be selling, and moving on to the next trade. : At the moment, the stock still meets my buying criteria. : How did you do today? : My portfolio was unchanged - not bad on a tough day. : How did you do so well? : I hold some energy names, which did well, and little in technology. : That is not completely reflected in your rankings. : I wish that readers would submit more diverse questions. You and Vince will not let me just post a list of the top stocks. : That would be OK, if we were charging for a newsletter or something. We invested a lot in developing your method, and we execute it in a timely fashion for our clients - just as you would expect. What we publish here is a sample. No one should expect it to work as well as our own trades.  My pick this week is the biotech company, Incyte Corporation (  ). I know Holmes and RoadRunner have held this earlier. I also see this stock has been through quite a lot of ups and downs over the last six months. I made my pick when the stock showed some strength in the face of the short-term downtrend. In my mind, that is a strong reason to buy. I expect upward price slopes for the stock in the coming weeks. I will not even bother with the earnings chart. This is strictly a \"story stock.\" The pipeline will come through, or it will not. : My holding time will be much shorter than the resolution of the pipeline question. : How did you do today? : In line with the market. It is normal trading. This week, my pick is Oceaneering International, Inc. (  ). Early this week, the stock touched new lows trading at just above the 20-mark. I found this a good point to buy-in at its lowest point. The stock has since picked up and is now hovering around its previous-week levels. I certainly look forward to more upside gains from here. : Here is the F.A.S.T. Graphs chart. Enough said. : I have no concern for the earnings picture in that time frame. As usual, I just look for a rebound. : How did you do today? Almost no change. My stocks have already sold off, so I had little tech exposure. My most recent pick is NetEase (  ). Others might not think this is the world's most attractive chart, but I like it. Let's have a look:As you can see, this stock nearly hit the very top of its channel twice in the last month. It also scraped along the bottom of its channel twice. This suggests to me that this could be an attractive target for a 2-week holding. We've already moved from the June 27 low up to the current price. For me, this is just a question of how high this can move in the next 8 days. : Haven't you picked this stock twice before? : Yes. The first time, in March, resulted in a decline of about 3%. The last time, earlier this month, featured a gain of over 10%. It is a good channel. : Very good. We should not expect winners every time. This week I have no new choices. : You had a tough day today. : Yes, although my biotech holdings had given me a good lift going into today. : Last week you featured bonds. How are those working? : Not so well. I do not choose based upon diversification, but I do follow the action. Bonds and stocks are getting hit together. Normally I would expect better results from my position. : You do not hold tech stocks or chip stocks, even though those are at the top of the ratings. : The list shows requests from readers. With those in hand, I report results. : You are saying that they are not asking the right questions? : Let us just say that the list reveals the interest of readers - which might be misdirected. I do report honestly, each week, on a featured sector.The buzz over basing decisions on evidence is rather surprising. This has been the standard practice of many, including us. I certainly endorse the improvement in methods. What I do not understand is why those who are so late to the party have such pride in their discovery. There also is a bit of confusion about what evidence tells us. Evidence should provide a strong, quantitative basis for finding undervalued stocks. It can provide a warning about \"storms ahead\" in economic conditions. It can highlight attractive technical setups.There are many ways to profit in the markets, including all of the above.What Victor Niederhoffer accurately calls \"counting\" and looking at winners versus losers is a routine procedure for a good system developer. All of our models are trained on one period for setups, with thousands of cases. They are then tested on an out-of-sample data set on thousands of other potential cases. We monitor the real-time results closely to make sure that each model is trading as expected.Anyone who reports a super-high level of winners is probably making a rookie mistake or pulling a Madoff-style move. Our models show a modest +/- ratio usually accompanied by greater wins than losses. That is what you should expect.Here is a summary of the cast of our characters.

But the online video gaming specialist's momentum isn't going to die down anytime soon, if its latest results are any indication.As it turns out, NetEase knocked the ball  with terrific first-quarter fiscal 2017 results that were way better than expected, thanks to rampant growth in the company's mobile gaming business and expansion beyond China. These two trends, along with NetEase's spot-on execution, should help the company sustain its impressive growth rates, creating the potential for more upside.Image source: NetEaseMobile games now make up 73% of NetEase's total revenue as compared to 64% in the year-ago quarter. In fact, the company currently has over 100 mobile gaming titles under development, including expansion packs for legacy games to keep its existing user base hooked.NetEase is setting itself up for stronger long-term growth by aggressively rolling out new mobile titles, as global revenue in this space is predicted to jump to $65 billion in 2020 from $38.6 billion last year, according to a research report from Newzoo. More specifically, NetEase's home base of China is predicted to experience the most growth with mobile gaming revenue expected to jump to $21 billion in 2020 from $11.2 billion last year.NetEase has drafted a smart strategy to capitalize on this transition by porting its already-popular PC client games onto  . The strategy has worked wonders for the company so far, as its rapid mobile gaming growth shows. The trend should continue as it launches expansion packs and looks to integrate new features such as augmented reality (AR), while also expanding internationally to add to its user base.As it turns out, NetEase's AR-enabled title  has been a massive hit among users in the international markets, setting the stage for the company's expansion beyond China.Image source: Getty Images.Europe, North America, and Asia-Pacific are going to account for the lion's share of video gaming revenue for 2017, according to Newzoo. Not surprisingly, NetEase is targeting these markets quite aggressively to boost its revenue.For instance, NetEase released  in Japan this February, and the game was a tremendous success, as regular content additions and the international push helped it cross 200 million downloads. The company has big plans for this game; it's reportedly working on a Western version for launch in markets such as Europe and North America.The good news for NetEase investors is that the Chinese version of  has been received well in English-speaking countries such as Australia and New Zealand, so it won't be a long shot if it succeeds in other Western markets as well.But  won't be the only game NetEase is going to take international.

The company is going to rebrand this title as  for the Western markets, making it available to international users later in 2017, which could help it achieve more mobile gaming revenue globally.NetEase and  penned a deal last year to bring the highly popular video game  to China. The deal allows NetEase to distribute the PC and mobile versions of the title in the Chinese market, which could be a big deal, considering  has sold over 100 million copies globally and boasts 40 million monthly users.The game is currently being beta-tested by NetEase and is set for a July launch.

These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" reported first-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings (including stock based compensation) of 22 cents per share, which was much better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 28 cents.Non-GAAP earnings (excluding stock based compensation) of 52 cents per share surged a massive 139.3% from the year-ago quarter.Adjusted net revenues of $275.4 million topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $263 million and increased 40.5% year over year.We note that SINA's shares have gained 58.7% on a year-to-date basis, vastly outperforming the Zacks categorized  industry, which gained 31.3% during the period.Advertising revenues moved up 40% (48% on a constant currency basis) year over year to $228 million, driven by the momentum of the Weibo segment.

At the end of the quarter, daily active users went up to 154 million, up 28% from the year-ago quarter.Weibo non-ad revenues grew 49% to $29.9 million, mainly attributable to an increase in membership revenues.

Also, its expanding collaboration with Alibaba  is a positive.Moreover, SINA Pay has strong growth prospects in our view.However, SINA's business is likely to be impacted by soft macroeconomic conditions in China. Also, significant restrictions on online search and other social networking activities in the region remain concerns.Moreover, Weibo is expected to face continued stiff competition from the likes of WeChat in China, which may hurt its user base.

We also provide contrast, and often dissent, from a fundamental analyst. Usually we get to celebrate winners and consider new picks. This week a couple of our participants need to face the music, discussing a losing choice.Our  highlighted healthcare and biotech. The sector was OK after a mid-week dip. Some of the specific names did not fare well. Even worse, two weeks ago, Road Runner picked [[RH]]. As I write this, the stock is down over 20% after hours. Earnings and revenues were fine, but the announced outlook was terrible.It is time for a frank discussion.The two examples of losses are both interesting, but our team's approach differs. For the key lesson, we turn to trading expert (and trading coach) Dr. Brett Steenbarger.Brett has a great discussion in this post from 2014,  . He explains the value of a well-chosen stop. He notes that a trade involves both a direction and a path.Being stopped out means that you were wrong about the anticipated price path. It doesn't necessarily mean that your underlying idea was wrong. The loss can be a prod to help you better manage price paths, and it can also be a prod to take a fresh look at your idea. In both cases, the loss can help make you better.This is a first-rate article, with both pluses and minuses about stops. Too many traders view stops as some magical method that generates only winners. They set stops too tightly, and instead miss out on winners.It is crucial to right-size positions, knowing how much risk to take.  :There is no answer that fits all situations. Many years ago, I offered some help, with  of the Kelly Criterion and some practical examples.I'll comment further on this in the conclusion. Meanwhile, let's see what the team members have to say for themselves: : Oscar, what about the weakness in biotech? : This kind of fluctuation is completely normal. No one should be surprised. : What action did you take? : Just like I do at the track. I don't want my money on a loser, so I move on. Sometimes my pick is OK, but something else is more attractive. : How many sectors do you hold at a given time? : Three. : So the risk control comes from a limited amount of sector diversification as well as trading stops. It is like the first of Dr. Brett's methods. : I guess so. That is what I do. : Road Runner, what about that pick of RH? : You said there was news after hours? I will evaluate the price tomorrow. : It appears that the company guidance was so bad, it will completely break your lower channel. How do you deal with such losses? : It is a percentage game. I right-size each position. I know that most picks will win, and the wins will be larger than the losses. I trade about 5% on each pick. : So you are careful about \"over betting your bankroll.\" : I'm not sure what that means. A single loss - even a big one - hurts my performance, but I do not take excessive risk. There is some expression about \"betting the farm\" that strikes close to home. Even a loss like RH will not make me jump off a cliff or something. : The loss puts you behind Holmes in the yearly standings. You were leading before this (I can hear some enthusiastic barks in the background). : I'll get back on top. : What do we have for this week? I have once again discovered my favorite chart pattern NetEase (  ). Here is the rising channel and the current position at the bottom:: I suppose you will once again invoke . : I suppose you will once again invoke  . : Naturally. This time you have some support from the master instead of that silly coyote. It could be a good entry point for long-term investors, as well as a potential trade. : I am delighted that Mr. Carnevale finally agrees with one of my excellent picks. Beep Beep! I have a new sector favorite: Utilities. You can readily see that the market has resumed the love affair with this sector.Just look at the exciting jump above the 50-day moving average. And all of the trends are rising. : Aren't you distracted by any sports streaks? How about the Cubs? : A short losing streak is not always meaningful. : Exactly. Neither is a winning streak. Let's take a look at NextEra Energy (  ). It is the largest component of [[XLU]] at 10%.: We do not actually own NEE. We have our own basket of representative utilities, each weighted equally. : I plan to keep a close eye on this one. : Right. We do this because of erratic trading in the ETFs. There are plenty of choices. With a little work, you can find a collection of choices that has a near-perfect correlation. That said, our own choices have a F.A.S.T. graph that is very like that of NEE.  : It might be affected by a Fed rate hike decision later this month. : What's a Fed? Do you mean the Nationals? : Get your mind out of the dugout. How about your updates on reader requests? : OK. Here is the current list. : Why no XLU? : I respond to reader requests. Our readers are not on that bandwagon. I love dips, followed by a period of basing. My most recent purchase, Credit Suisse (  ), is a good example. Let's review:For this stock, it is helpful to look at a longer time period - beyond my normal holding period. Here you can see the rebound a few weeks ago from this same level. There are also prior examples. : Are you encouraged by the French election? Worried about the British vote? : I do not worry about elections or which humans are conducting one. The chart shows the dip and the potential. That is really all that you need to know. : I have nothing new this week. : I am not surprised. When we have a sideways market, you have few chances to spot momentum. : That is exactly right. You and Vince always tell us not to reach. We are just following orders. : We? I suppose you mean that Athena has nothing fresh either? : Right. She said to tell you that you will see her again when something is happening. : This is the longest vacation in company history. How about your weekly stock rankings? Still buy, hold, or sell, depending on the color? : Yes, and I welcome new questions. That is how the list is built.Whatever trading method you use, you must analyze risk and anticipate losses. A record with no volatility is a sign of faked data. Most of the failed traders in my experience - including many good ones - did so by getting too big.There was a test of this idea where a group of subjects with PhDs were given a bankroll and invited to play blackjack. They were accurately informed that the game was rigged to give them a 5% edge. A few hours later, they were all broke. Even smart people underestimate the chance of a losing streak, even when the odds favor them.Here is a summary of the cast of characters.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 6 different analyst targets contributing to that average for NetEase, Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $192.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $330.00. The standard deviation is $53.343.But the whole reason to look at the  NTES price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with NTES crossing above that average target price of $289.50/share, investors in NTES have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $289.50 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

(NASDAQ: NTES) has been at the  in China, and it has set its sights on trying to expand beyond its home nation to capture more of the Asia-Pacific market.Coming into Wednesday's first-quarter financial report, NetEase investors were looking for the company to sustain its rapid growth into 2017. NetEase was happy to oblige, putting up what it called \"stunning results\" and anticipating even greater success in the future. Let's look more closely at NetEase and what its results mean going forward.There's more to video gaming than just console games. Image source: Getty Images.NetEase's first-quarter results kept up an impressive pace of growth for the video game specialist. Revenue soared 72% in local currency terms, translating to $1.98 billion and exceeding the consensus forecast among investors by a staggering $250 million. Similarly, adjusted net income climbed 63%, translating to $630 million, and that produced adjusted earnings of $4.75 per share. That compared quite favorably to calls for just $4.03 per share on the bottom line.Looking more closely at NetEase's results, the video gaming company kept seeing solid contributions from its segments, and their respective positions within the company stayed largely the same. Sales from online games led NetEase forward, climbing by nearly four-fifths from year-ago levels. The company said that mobile games have continued to make up a bigger portion of total gaming revenue, with the latest figure of 73% up nearly 10 percentage points over the past 12 months. Meanwhile, the email, e-commerce, and other revenue division enjoyed a growth rate in excess of 60%. Only the advertising services unit posted more modest growth due to seasonal factors, with gains of 13% stemming from good performance from advertisers in the automobile, real estate, and telecommunications services areas.However, gross margin again weakened, falling more than three points to drop below the 55% mark. NetEase said that the rising percentage of revenue from mobile games kept weighing on its profitability, because margins are generally narrower on mobile than on traditional online game offerings. Higher staff costs weighed on margin in the advertising segment, and a decline in sales at high-margin e-commerce businesses pulled down margin for the email and e-commerce business.CEO William Ding put the results in the broader context of NetEase's long-term vision. \"During the period, we advanced our strategic initiatives by rolling out new mobile games and expansion packs for our PC-client games,\" Ding said, \"enhancing the monetization capabilities of our advertising services and expanding our growing e-commerce businesses.\" The CEO noted as well that popular games have been a key to its success, and he sees further hits in the near future.NetEase has high hopes that it can hang onto the secret of its lightning-fast revenue and profit gains. In Ding's words, \"Ingenuity remains the cornerstone of our success across each of our core business lines, where there are ample opportunities for growth.\" In addition, the launch of  in Japan added to its performance, and the company sees more opportunities to make games available globally rather than just in its home market.One thing in particular to watch closely is the  , which has been a hit in the U.S. market. NetEase said that it started closed beta testing on the game in April, and having the opportunity to release  to the Chinese market could be a huge long-term boost to NetEase's prospects going forward.NetEase is also being smart with its capital. On one hand, the company again raised its dividend, giving investors a 7% increase to $1.08 per share. Yet NetEase isn't falling into a trap that many companies have, choosing to keep stock buybacks to a minimum. Despite having a $1 billion authorization, NetEase has only spent $23.7 million to buy back just 83,000 shares. Given how far its stock has soared, NetEase is being prudent by not chasing shares higher.NetEase shareholders were once again pleased with how the company did, and the stock gained more than 3% in  Thursday morning following the late Wednesday announcement. For now, NetEase is seeing huge growth in its core businesses, and that fundamental strength should continue as the company looks at other geographies going forward.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But before you \"sell in May\" as the old saying goes, you might be better served to buy right now -- especially if it's one of the top stocks below.Our contributors have put their analysis skills to work and come up with these great companies that it might be smart to buy shares of now:  (NASDAQ: NTES) ,  (NASDAQ: BOFI) ,  (NYSE: UA) (NYSE: UAA) C shares,  (NYSE: AZO) , and  (NASDAQ: AOBC) .Image source: Getty Images.Keep reading below to learn what makes these top stocks worth buying now. With all the strength in the U.S. stock market lately, investors haven't paid nearly as much attention to international markets as they did in the past. However, despite some general economic challenges in many parts of the world, there are still several pockets of strength, and Chinese video game giant NetEase has continued to produce impressive growth even as competition in the industry has increased.Image source: Getty Images.In its most recent quarter, NetEase posted revenue gains of more than 50%, and the gaming company boosted its adjusted earnings by about two-thirds. Online gaming was strong, and NetEase made key inroads into the mobile-device market. The company's head start in focusing on mobile advertising has been extremely valuable, and NetEase has been able to pass on its profit growth to shareholders in the form of big increases in dividends. At the same time, the gaming giant has also been able to keep growing its revenue from other sources, including email and e-commerce channels.This month, NetEase will report its first-quarter results, and all indications suggest that the growth story at the video game company should continue. At this rate, if NetEase can continue to gain name recognition not just among Chinese online video game players, but also among customers using its services for other reasons, then the company could capitalize even more strongly on the long-term growth story in China going forward. Over the past couple of years, few stocks have been as divisive as BofI Holding. The company and its executives have dealt with a bevy of accusations by short-sellers of all sorts of bad deeds, nearly all of which have been proven false. Over this period, BofI has undergone multiple regulatory reviews, made acquisitions that required additional scrutiny, and had its financials audited multiple times.Image source: Getty Images.Also, BofI has steadily grown assets and profits and delivered some of the best rates of return in the industry. Last quarter, earnings per share increased 12.5%, while tangible book value per share increased 20%. And management isn't standing pat, instead investing in growing multiple business lines, including commercial and industrial lending, auto loans, business equipment leasing and financing, and expanding partnerships with other financial organizations. Not only should this increase profits, but it will help offset its exposure to residential mortgages.Not that BofI is necessarily a high-risk bank. To the contrary, BofI reported only 39 basis points of non-performing assets to total assets last quarter, and the vast majority of its residential mortgages have loan to values that give it a solid margin of safety.Lastly, BofI is cheap right now. It's rare to find a bank trading for 1.9 times tangible book value and less than 14 times earnings, while generating returns on equity far better than most banks, and boasting an efficiency ratio that's twice as good as its average competitor. Given a cursory look at Under Armour's first-quarter 2017 results announced last week, it might seem crazy to nominate the athletic apparel and footwear specialist as a top stock to buy this month. After all, revenue only climbed 7% year over year, to $1.1 billion, marking the company's first time below 10% growth in over a decade. That notably included a 1% decline in Under Armour's core North American business following multiple bankruptcies of retail distributors like Sports Authority last year. On the bottom line, Under Armour incurred a quarterly net  of $2.3 million, or a penny per share.Asia continues to grow like wildfire for Under Armour. Image source: Under Armour.But those results were in line with Under Armour's expectations and ahead of Wall Street's models. To be sure, shares  the following day as the market cheered the news. Of course, it helps that Under Armour has struck new retail partnerships with the likes of  and  to help pick up the slack. Its international business also remains strong, with revenue climbing 52% year over year, but still representing just 20% of total revenue. And that's not to mention the long-term potential for UAS, or Under Armour Sportswear, which was only just introduced last year to mark Under Armour's  fashion-centric sportswear industry.In the meantime, Under Armour management also told investors to expect revenue growth in to reaccelerate as 2017 progresses, with year-over-year growth returning to a mid-teen percentage rate in the second half. With Under Armour C shares still down more than 25% year to date as of this writing, I think investors would do well to open or add to their positions before that happens. Automakers have been improving the quality of their vehicles for years. That has allowed consumers to hang on to their older cars and trucks for extended periods of time. This aging of the auto fleet has steadily increased the demand for aftermarket auto parts, which is a market opportunity AutoZone has beautifully capitalized on over the last decade.AutoZone's strategy has been to invest in its store count and customer service capabilities to make it easier for consumers to quickly get the part they need. This simple but effective strategy has lead to consistent growth in same-store sales and revenue. When combined with steady margin improvements and the company's habit of buying back stock, the AutoZone was able to report 41 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth.Image source: Getty Images.However, that streak recently came to an end. Last quarter, AutoZone's same-store sales were flat, and EPS only grew by 8.8%. Management blamed the slowdown primarily on a delay in tax refunds, which many customers have historically used to make vehicle repairs.While that excuse makes sense to me, Wall Street wasn't thrilled with the news and sold off the company's stock. That has knocked down the company's valuation as shares are currently trading for less than 14 times next year's earnings estimates. I think that's a bargain price for a recession-resistant retail concept that promises double-digit profit growth over the next five years. Sometimes, and in some ways, the market just gets it wrong. That's the case with American Outdoor Brands, which remains significantly undervalued because the market is interpreting gun sales data all wrong.The federal gun buyer background check data for April showed more than 2 million applications for the month, and the market took that as another signal that demand for guns was declining. The figures were 16% below March's numbers and almost 5% below year-ago levels, so it would seem the market has it right: that demand is ebbing and American Outdoor's stock price drop was warranted. Except the market is looking at the numbers wrong.First, April is historically a quieter month than March, and background checks typically decline by double-digit percentages. Second, 2016 was a unique year in that gun sales were driven by politics and the expectation that the presidential election would have a different outcome. There were more than 27.5 million background checks processed last year, more than any time since the FBI began tracking such data in the late 1990s.Image source: Getty Images.A better comparison would be the 2015 data, which, while still a record-setting year at the time, was not especially skewed by politics or elections. When compared to April 2015, we find background checks running almost 20% higher. In other words, just because this year's gun buyer data isn't as high as the all-time biggest surge in gun buying doesn't mean demand isn't still enormous.The market is misreading the signs and discounting American Outdoor Brands' stock, and that's a buying opportunity. The gunmaker trades at just nine times trailing earnings, around 12 times next year's estimates, and at a fraction of its projected earnings growth rates. It also goes off at an incredibly discounted seven times its free cash flow.Few stocks are as cheap as American Outdoor Brands yet have a phenomenal growth trajectory in front of them, and for that, investors can thanks the market for getting it completely wrong.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now...and American Outdoor Brands Corporation wasn't one of them!

Meanwhile Nintendo announced a new addition to its 3DS console, 2DS XL. Activision posted  adjusted earnings of 27 cents and revenues (including deferrals) of $1.196 billion, which easily beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate of 16 cents and $1.103 billion. However, on a year-over-year basis, revenues (including deferrals) were down approximately 18%.For second-quarter 2017, Activision anticipates GAAP revenues of $1.425 billion and earnings per share of 15 cents. On a non-GAAP basis, revenues and earnings are likely to be $1.425 billion and 38 cents per share, respectively. Deferral revenues are expected to be around negative $225 million.Currently, Activision carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Zynga reported first-quarter 2017 loss per share of 1 cent that came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues of $207.4 million beat the consensus mark of $190.9 million. Zynga's mobile daily active users (DAU) grew 16% year over year to 18 million. Zynga carries a Zacks Rank #3. Glu Mobile reported first-quarter 2017 loss per share of 17 cents compared with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 9 cents and a loss of 6 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. Revenues of $56.8 million beat the consensus mark of $53.6 million and grew 4.2% year over year. Also, the company said that the MLB Tap Sports Baseball 2017 game with MLB and Kris Bryant launched recently was ranked #1 free game on the U.S. App Store for iPhone for six consecutive days following its release.Glu Mobile carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see  Sony reported  earnings per share of \u00a521.45 (19 cents), against the year-ago quarter's significant loss of \u00a570.03 per share. The bottom line benefited from decent top-line growth, as well as fall in selling, general and administrative, and financial services expenses.Sales and operating revenues at the Game & Network Services (\"GN&S\") segment increased 21% year over year to \u00a5381.8 billion ($3,409 million). Improvements in the PS4 software sales (including sales through the network) and impressive market traction of the recently launched PlayStationVR boosted sales.Currently, the company expects total sales to be around \u00a58,000, up 5.2% from fiscal 2016 driven by impressive sales at G&NS, Pictures and Semiconductors segments. Sony Corp carries a Zacks Rank#2 (Buy).2. Per media reports, Nintendo is gearing to launch yet another 3DS console, namely 2DS XL. The new portable console will be priced at $150 and will be available on store shelves in July 2017. Much similar to 3DS, the new console reportedly has a C Stick and ZL/ZR Buttons and is available in Black and Turquoise, and White and Orange color combinations.At present, Nintendo is basking in the success of back-to-back hits in the form of NES mini and Switch. Last week, Nintendo announced its quarterly results and stated that Switch, released on Mar 3, 2017 - has sold 2.74 million units. Its new game, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of Wild Fire has sold 2.76 million units. Nintendo is also coming up with the mini version of another hit console, SNES.At present Nintendo sports a Zacks Rank #2.We note that Nintendo has massively outperformed the Zacks  industry in the last year. While the industry gained 35%, the stock returned 82.54%.The following table shows the price movement of the major video game companies over both the past five trading days as well as the last six months:\n  \nOver the last five trading sessions, Activision was up 6.48% whereas NetEase  was down 1.35%.In the last six-month period, Take Two Interactive  surged the most (31.8%). The company continues to benefit from its popular offerings like GrandTheft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online (though sales are slowing down), along with its other releases like NBA 2K17. In fact, higher sales of the digital version of the games add to the company's margins. Take Two continues to expect growth in digital revenues, driven by higher sales of full game downloads and increase in recurrent consumer spending.The company recently forayed into the free-to-play games space with the acquisition of game developer, Social Point. The acquisition will help it boost its performance going ahead. Also, the company is well positioned to benefit from the highly-anticipated launch of Red Dead Redemption 2 later this year.Take Two also inked a  with NBA to launch NBA 2K eLeague, making it the \"first eSports league operated by a U.S. professional sports league.\" The NBA 2K league will be functional in 2018.Before looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

While it's had its shares of ups and downs over the decades, the technology giant has still gone on to enjoy a total return to investors of more than 104,000%. Yes, you read that right.Such growth is rare indeed, but finding the next Microsoft is still a worthwhile pursuit. So we asked three Motley Fool contributors to name a company they think is similarly positioned today. Read on to find out why they believe  (NASDAQ: TSLA) ,  (NASDAQ: NTES) , and  (NYSE: WDAY) are just where Microsoft was back in 1986.Image source: Tesla. Tesla has been a public company for seven years, putting it not quite at the same point in its growth stage as Microsoft in 1986, and it has already offered up returns of nearly 1,200% for investors, far outstripping the performance of the tech icon. But there's no reason it can't continue growing at such a torrid pace in the decades to come.There are, of course, its electric cars, which are transforming the automotive industry. In its first-quarter earnings report, Tesla reported that deliveries surged 69% to 25,051 vehicles, more than  for the period while losses narrowed.Perhaps more notable is what's about to come. The Model 3 is due in July, and that will be where the rubber of Tesla's car ambitions hits the road. These will be its first cars priced for the mass market, and that should help it quintuple annual production by next year to its planned 500,000 vehicles.What could be of even greater importance down the road, though, even though it's currently just a small fraction of its portfolio, is its energy generation and storage division, which is looking to become profitable rather than just driving growth for its own sake. Tesla's earnings release noted, \"Rather than prioritizing the growth of (megawatts) of solar deployed at any cost, we are selectively deploying projects that have higher margin and generate cash up front.\" So even though deployments have fallen year over year, they generated better results.From its residential energy storage products such as the Powerwall 2, and inverters for the home or business and industrial uses, as well as solar roofing tiles that should begin production very soon, Tesla has the potential to ramp up phenomenal growth in what promises to be a burgeoning business.Pursuing profits instead of simply growth in futuristic industries that exist and are needed today, Tesla can easily rival what Microsoft achieved, and perhaps sooner.Image source: Getty Images. Chinese online media, communications, and commerce company NetEase is a powerhouse in the gaming industry. The company makes a mint hosting online games that it created, as well as third-party products, serving as the gateway partner for gaming companies seeking to enter the lucrative Chinese market. The company earns attractive margins on that business, averaging more than 60% during the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, that business continues to grow at a brisk pace, up 60% during the fourth quarter.But while NetEase has already done a fantastic job expanding its gaming business over the years, its best days still appear to lie ahead. First of all, only about half of China's population is even online at the moment, suggesting plenty of growth potential as more people in that country discover the internet and then NetEase's portals. Meanwhile, the company is looking to expand into countries other than China, which could increase the number of gamers on its network.However, gaming is just part of the NetEase story, because the company is investing to diversify beyond just that industry. It already owns briskly growing email and e-commerce businesses that currently deliver a quarter of its revenue. Meanwhile, the company is investing in new technologies such as virtual reality that have the potential to add more sources of growth.Because of the company's rapidly expanding core online gaming business and growing opportunity set, when I look at NetEase, I see a stock that feels like it that has the potential to deliver Microsoft-like market-smashing returns for decades to come.Image source: Workday. Way back in 1986, Microsoft was a company poised to make many of its early investors extraordinarily wealthy by 2000. Of course, it's incredibly difficult to uncover the next Microsoft, but Workday offers investors explosive growth and could be a long-term winner.Workday is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider offering enterprise resource planning software for medium to large enterprises. Basically, Workday sells cloud-based applications for finance and human resources, and its products have been on fire, in a good way. Workday's fiscal 2017 revenues jumped 35% over the prior year and totaled $1.57 billion. Its subscription revenue was up 39% year over year, and the fourth quarter put the finishing touches on a strong year, as it was the best quarter in company history.The advantage for Workday is that most companies have finance and human resources software that serve as expensive corporatewide solutions requiring updates. Workday is different in the sense that it sells its software on an as-needed basis, and that software is continually updated on the cloud. Now Workday enters into its potential growth-story phase and has introduced additional applications for hiring and recruiting, payroll processing, and even supply-chain planning and management software.Workday is far from a guaranteed winner for investors, however, and the young company battles two huge competitors in  and  . But Workday has won more than its fair share of customers, and if the company can string together a couple of big-time customer wins and develop its newer applications, it could be the beginning of a long-term success story for investors.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Ironically, mobile-gaming specialist  (NASDAQ: GLUU) has failed to capitalize on the mobile-gaming craze, and its revenue has suffered. data by Not surprisingly, Glu Mobile shares have dropped in the past year, though they  despite the absence of any notable catalyst. Glu is trying to shift its business strategy away from one-time hits to longer-lasting games that generate recurring revenue, but does this make it a better bet over the more diversified NetEase?Glu has been trying to capitalize on social fads to drive its business with titles such as  and  that made big money when launched but had weak staying power. For instance, the Kim Kardashian game was launched in June 2014 and pulled in $100 million in revenue in just 18 months before losing steam in 2016 with just $33 million in sales.Image Source: Glu MobileTherefore, Glu is now trying to develop games that can generate a consistent revenue stream over a longer time period. CEO Nick Earl now wants the company's platform-centric games to bring in \"repeatable, predictable revenue that stacks year over year.\"The good news for investors is that Glu has already started working on such games. Its  franchise gained tremendous traction last year, and its bookings more than doubled to $27 million. The franchise could do better this year, now that Glu is licensing intellectual property from Major League Baseball, giving it access to exclusive features that provide better game play.NetEase's biggest advantage over Glu Mobile is that it can leverage the popularity of its existing PC games on the mobile platform. The strategy has reaped dividends for NetEase, which has been developing mobile versions of popular PC games such as  . As it turns out, the Chinese video-gaming specialist has over 100 mobile games in its portfolio and is set to raise the bar this year with seven new self-developed mobile games.But  's  could be NetEase's biggest win this year, as the latter has a five-year license to operate the PC and mobile versions of this wildly popular game. As it turns out, 51% of  players in the Asia-Pacific region access the game on mobile, so the partnership should boost NetEase's mobile gaming business once it goes online in the second half of the year.More importantly, NetEase is looking beyond mobile gaming toward augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality to drive future sales. The company has already integrated AR capability into its popular role-playing game  , which was downloaded over 10 million times in China within a month.Such feature additions should ensure a strong gamer base for NetEase titles. What's more, the company is now taking  into international markets such as North America, Europe, and Japan that could open up new revenue streams.NetEase is already executing the model that Glu Mobile has just adopted. The former's long-standing expertise in PC games gives it an edge over the mobile-gaming specialist, but this is not where the differences end.Glu Mobile's cash hoard of $102 million pales in comparison with NetEase's cash position of $5.29 billion, giving the Chinese company a lot of financial muscle to market existing titles or develop new ones. NetEase also has an impressive profit margin of 30%, while Glu is deep in the red, making the latter a better bet since it has a proven and profitable business model.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["arnings dominated video game space last week with Sohu.com Inc  , Changyou.com Ltd.  , Nintendo  and Microsoft  reporting quarterly results.

Shares were down 6.44% yesterday.However, Sohu's revenues of $374.1 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $366.7 million. On a year-over-year basis, revenues decreased 8.3% due to lower revenues from advertising and online gaming. RMB depreciation had a big impact on results, adds management.For the second quarter of 2017, Sohu expects revenues in a range of $390-$420 million.The company expects non-GAAP loss per share between $1.80 and $2.05. Currently, Sohu carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Changyou reported adjusted first-quarter 2017 earnings of 56 cents per share that topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 54 cents.

You can see  Microsoft's third-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings of 73 cents and revenues of $23.56 billion easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Though gaming is a very small part of the company's business, Xbox is an important aspect of the overall video game industry. Microsoft's gaming revenues grew 6% in constant currency. Xbox Live monthly active users were up 13% to 52 million active users. During the quarter, the company unveiled Project Scorpio, its upcoming gaming console that supports 4K technology. Nintendo reported consolidated results for the year ended Mar 31, 2017. Reportedly, for the year, sales were down 3% to \u00a5489.1 billion. For 2018, the company projected revenues to be \u00a5750 billion and operating income to be \u00a565 (up 121% year over year). Nintendo said that its much anticipated new console-Switch, released on Mar 3, 2017-has sold 2.74 million units. Its new game,  , has sold 2.76 million units.Switch, priced at $300, combines the functionalities of both conventional consoles and handheld devices. It is designed to attract casual gamers who are increasingly using mobile. After staying away for long, Nintendo has finally started focusing highly on mobile games now. Last year's smash hit,  , gave it the much needed impetus. Going ahead, there are many games like  (April),  (June),  (July) and  (Nov-Dec 2017) that should boost Switch sales.2. Per media reports, Nintendo also struck a deal with McDonald's to offer its video game characters as part of the Mc Donald's Happy Meal for a limited time period. Reportedly, from Apr 26 to May 22, kids across the U.S will find Mario, Luigi, a Red Koopa Shell, Princess Peach, Bowser, Yoshi, Invincible Mario, and 1-Up Mushroom with their Happy Meals. In the 90s, Nintendo toys were a regular Happy Meal fixture. However, changing times gave way to newer and more popular toys.Nevertheless, Nintendo is back with a bang.

The company continues to benefit from its popular offerings like GrandTheft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online (though sales are slowing down), along with its other releases like NBA 2K17. In fact, higher sales of the digital version of the games add to the company's margins. The company continues to expect growth in digital revenues, driven by higher sale of full game downloads and increase in recurrent consumer spending.Take Two recently forayed into free-to-play games space with the acquisition of game developer, Social Point.

Per research firm, NPD Group, Nintendo's  Switch sold 906K units in March alone. The company is now reportedly looking to launch a miniature version of its Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), this holiday season. Moreover, players across the globe are set to rejoice as Electronic Arts  announced that Star Wars Battlefront 2 will be out on Nov 17, 2017.1. Per NPD Group, Japanese giant, Nintendo's latest console sold nearly 906K units in March, which is phenomenal, given the fact that most news games/ product launches are usually reserved for the holiday season to benefit from the gifting frenzy. Switch was launched on Mar 3, 2017. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild also boosted Switch sales. The game reportedly has sold some 925K units for Switch and 1.3 million units in total. Going ahead, there are many games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (April) and Super Mario (Nov-Dec 2017) that should boost Switch sales.Switch, priced at $300, combines the functionalities of both conventional consoles and handheld devices. It is designed to attract casual gamers who are increasingly using mobile. After staying away from mobile gaming for long, Nintendo has started focusing highly on mobile games now. Last year's smash hit Pok\u00e9mon Go gave it the much needed impetus.At present Nintendo carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).We note that Nintendo has massively outperformed the Zacks  industry in the last one-year. While the stock gained 57%, the industry returned 25.8%.You can see 2. Citing sources familiar with the matter, Eurogamer.net reports that Nintendo is gearing to launch a mini version of SNES. Reportedly, Nintendo is working on the product console which was a huge hit in the 90's and aims to make it available in the market over the holiday season (around Christmas) this year. SNES was the company's second console after the monster hit NES. The news comes on the heels Nintendo's announcement regarding the discontinuation of NES Classic Mini. Released last year, mini NES classic found many takers.3. Meanwhile, Electronic Arts  that the sequel of its hugely popular mobile game, Star Wars Battlefront (2015) will be out this November. Battlefront sold about 14 million copies. The release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens gave it a major boost. However, players complained about the lack of single player mode. Nonetheless, with Battlefront 2, players can have both player modes-single as well as multiplayer.We believe that Battlefront will benefit greatly from Walt Disney's  ambitious plan to revive the Star Wars franchise. Disney has already announced two more sequels following Force Awakens and three standalone movies to be released over the next few years. Released last December, Rogue One (first standalone movie) was one of the top grossing movies of 2016 with over $1 billion in worldwide box office collections.A couple of days back, the first trailer for  was unveiled and has already garnered over 6 million views on YouTube so far. Last Jedi releases in December this year. Holiday gift-giving frenzy, combined with the excitement build-up prior to any Star Wars movie release should boost sales of Battlefront II.At present, Electronic Arts carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The following table shows the price movement of the major video game companies over both the past five trading days as well as the last six months:\n  \nOver the last five trading sessions, Take Two Interactive  was up 6.09% whereas NetEase  was down 4%.In the last six-month period, Take Two Interactive surged the most (37.91%). The company continues to benefit from its popular offerings like GrandTheft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online (though sales are slowing down), along with its other releases like NBA 2K17. In fact, higher sales of the digital version of the games add to the company's margins. The company continues to expect growth in digital revenues driven by higher sale of full game downloads and increases in recurrent consumer spending.Take Two recently forayed into free-to-play games space with the acquisition of game developer, Social Point. The acquisition will help it boost its performance going ahead. Also, the company is well positioned to benefit from the highly anticipated launch of Red Dead Redemption 2 later this year.Take Two also inked a  with NBA to launch NBA 2K eLeague, making it the \"first eSports league operated by a U.S. professional sports league.\" The NBA 2K league will be functional in 2018.Zynga  was down 3.09% over the same time frame owingto a slowdown in its user growth for a while, which remains a major concern. Moreover, a slowing web business along with intensifying competition from the likes of Glu Mobile  , Electronic Arts and Nintendo remain concerns.Before looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 5 different analyst targets contributing to that average for NetEase, Inc, but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $192.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $326.00. The standard deviation is $50.406.But the whole reason to look at the  NTES price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with NTES crossing above that average target price of $275.60/share, investors in NTES have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $275.60 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

Calling the move a threat to its own interests, China barred a number of South Korean companies from, among other things, the world's largest mobile games market.South Korea's mobile games developers reported they were no longer able to obtain licenses and, in turn, publish their products within China's borders. Investors mashed the \"sell\" button. Shares of Korean gaming companies plunged.In an odd way, the exchange signaled that the industry - which has grown from arcades, \"Pong\" and \"Pac Man\" into PC bangs, e-sports, \"Pokemon Go\" and \"Mobile Strike\" - had finally reached some form of adulthood.The global video game industry became a roughly $100 billion market last year. The total number of gamers is expected to reach 2.2 billion this year, according to industry tracker Newzoo. But that growth, as it does for any industry with 12-digit revenue, has begun to slow. That fact has begun to turn attention to China's prospects in the West, virtual reality's chances of a breakthrough, and options for the industry outside of gaming.The global video game market turned out double-digit growth in 2014 and 2015. But that rate of acceleration cooled to 8.5% last year. Newzoo expects the market to ease to 5.4% growth by 2019.\"I don't think there's a reasonable expectation that we're gonna see double-digit yearly growth,\" Gartner analyst Brian Blau said. \"That is hard to imagine, because there's a limit to the number of devices that people are going to buy and the amount of time they have. And we are starting to see some of those limits.\"\"After 40-plus years \u2026 this is something that's mature,\" Blau said. \"And investors have to treat it like that.\"Consistent double-digit growth might be out of reach, but IBD's Computer Software-Gaming industry group rose 17.2% in the eight weeks to Thursday - the second-best advance among the  . That moved the group to a No. 65 ranking on Thursday, up from No. 101. (  ) and  (  ) are two of the group's biggest names.

(  ) is arguably the world's largest gaming provider.  (  ) is a staunch competitor and listed as  in the industry group.Unlike many maturing markets, video gaming still offers some opportunity for explosive, IPO-type gains.Game publishers, Blau said, can rise to worldwide popularity with a single introduction - think Rovio's \"Angry Birds\" or King's \"Candy Crush Saga\" of years past. (Activision Blizzard acquired King for $5.9 billion in February 2016.)Publishers can also get significant boosts from game franchises, like EA's ever-enduring \"Madden\" NFL series, Blau said. Sales come either after customers buy the games themselves - a one-time purchase - or by downloading a game for free and then making smaller in-game purchases over time that enhance the game overall.There is also the industry's old standby, console makers - essentially  (SNE) and its PlayStation;  (MSFT) and its Xbox - and online gaming platforms from companies like Tencent.The overlap between video games, sports and the broader entertainment industry may deepen, analysts say. Gaming, through virtual reality and other means, is becoming more immersive, and professional gamers are building athlete-like status.\"E-sports is the future of entertainment and is accelerating the convergence of industries such as telecom, sports, entertainment and media,\" Newzoo CEO Peter Warman said over email. He later added that as competitive gaming becomes more popular, \"prizes are becoming an integral part of any game in development.\"Virtual reality appeared to be among the main take-aways from this year's Game Developers Conference, which ended March 3 in San Francisco. Demonstrations there made the technology seem almost certain to reshape the industry's game development and storytelling, and expand its hardware offerings.Processing chip sets from  (QCOM) have provided the foundation for new headsets using inside-out tracking, including a new headset on display at the conference from Pico Interactive, reportedonline magazine AnandTech. Inside-out tracking attempts to more closely tailor the view seen through a headset to the dimensions of the wearer's actual physical space. Inside-out tracking has also attracted the likes of Microsoft and  's (FB) Oculus. Other developers are tinkering with eye-tracking technology.As films, television and online shows move beyond the two-dimensional TV screen into 3-D digital space, VR development and engineering talent will probably migrate accordingly, said Gartner analyst Tuong Nguyen. Game play and design - and the cues to move a player through a particular setting - will have to be rethought and made more about the way a player moves their entire body.VR could also help strengthen the prospects of PC gaming, which has done well amid doubts in an expanding world of mobile devices. Graphics-card makers  (NVDA) and  (AMD) have found more ways to deepen screens with additional pixels, and their technology could potentially make virtual reality gaming seem less virtual.Analysts debate whether we're ready for VR. But Blau also notes that people have been tweaking the technology for generations. To an extent, the culture is always open to its advances - glitches and all.\"So when you say, 'Are we at a time that's ready?' Well, people have wanted it since the beginning,\" Blau said.But he said that VR is unlikely to suddenly be everywhere within the next year or two.\"I think it's going to be a slower transition,\" he said. \"I think, five to 10 years from now, when we're looking back, we'll say, 'Oh yeah, that was kind of fast.' But in reality, day-by-day, it doesn't seem like that.\"China's lockout of South Korea is a reminder that its plans for expansion depend in large part on how it handles other countries.\"Will the China ban hurt the Korean games industry? Yes, but to be honest both markets are dominated by local players anyway,\" Warman said, adding that retaliation from South Korea would only hurt that nation, given China's size.What's more, Tencent, the gaming world's leader by sales, and NetEase control roughly 70% of China's video game market. As a result, Pacific Epoch analyst Benjamin Wu said over email, \"there is little potential for (China's) gamer population and mobile game penetration rate to expand over the next few years.\"But as China looks outward to compensate, it faces problems in engaging the rest of the world.NetEase's mobile games have yet to show signs of doing well in Korea, Warman said. And games from China's developers that focused on martial arts and Asian culture haven't really appealed to audiences outside of Asia, Wu said, so they have been trying to incorporate themes with a more global appeal. NetEase, in particular, is hoping for a crossover hit with its game \"Onmyoji.\" It eventually plans an English version of the game for release in the U.S.Yet China's understanding of the gaming landscape in the West, despite many attempts to get a read on it, is still limited, analysts say.\"I think probably the wiser move is to buy content that's popular already in the West, understand why those games work in the West, and understand the data systems behind those games that are necessary,\" IDC analyst Lewis Ward said.Tencent has already acquired its way into Western markets. The company bought a majority stake in Riot Games, which develops \"League of Legends,\" for $231 million in 2011, than acquired the remaining 7% of the company in 2015. It also reportedly holds a 12% stake in Activision Blizzard. Tencent and others last year also agreed to buy an 84% stake in Supercell, the Finland-based maker of \"Clash of Clans,\" from Japan-based  (SFTBY).NetEase, meanwhile, has partnered its way in. It has worked with Blizzard to offer \"World of Warcraft\" in China, and also offers \"Overwatch\" in the nation.\"By embracing this type of model,\" Wu said, \"Chinese developers are also able to expand their pipeline and release blockbusters in the local market, while providing their development teams with opportunities to learn from top game developers and rapidly improve their in-house capabilities.\"Still, working with China comes with considerable financial risk, Ward said. \"Warcraft,\" \"Overwatch\" and EA's FIFA online games have done well there. But companies outside China looking to do business would have to form a joint venture, clear regulatory hurdles and pass muster with the Ministry of Culture, then split profits, he said.\"China's still kind of a walled garden,\" Ward said, \"so everything in there is different, more complex than it is elsewhere.\"Newzoo's Warman sees gaming technology being incorporated into loyalty programs, point-of-sale interfaces and mobile services. The more people obsessively pour their time into gaming, the more gaming companies gather tons of consumer intel. That data can be directed into all kinds of lucrative and useful purposes.In just one unexpected example, the free-to-play game giant Machine Zone, which makes \"Game of War,\" has lent its tech capabilities to Auckland, New Zealand's public transit system. Machine Zone hopes to develop a way to provide \"a real-time view of every single bus on the road, down to the second,\" the New Zealand Herald reported in October.\"Similarly,\" Warman said, \"who has put the first driverless connected minibuses on the ground in Japan?

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the NTES options chain for the new May 19th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $275.00 strike price has a current bid of $11.70. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $275.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $263.30 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of NTES, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $282.29/share today.Because the $275.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

Many had thought that the nation would succumb to an economic crisis in recent years, but China keeps growing at an impressive clip anyway, and it is managing to diversify its economy beyond heavy manufacturing too.But with the election of Donald Trump, some investors are having doubts regarding Chinese investments again. After all, the rhetoric from the Trump administration-including chief trade adviser Peter Navarro-has been less than friendly (to put it mildly) and some are worried about tensions or worse between the U.S. and China as a result. But is this sort of pessimism warranted?To get to the bottom of this important question, I spoke with Brendan Ahern, the CIO of KraneShares for this edition of  . His company is a China-focused ETF shop, so he is a top-notch resource for all things investing when it comes to China.I get his take on the Trump question, as well as what the future holds for Chinese-American relations in the near term. Additionally, we talk about other major risk factors to China and what is going on in the economy right now that investors need to know about.We also go beyond politics though, since the China economic story is much bigger than worries about relations with a single country. In particular, we take a look at the shifting focus of the Chinese government and the idea of their 'Five-Year Plans'.These plans tend to be the priorities for the Chinese government and can be indicative of where big investments or help will go towards in the near term. For the latest Five-Year Plan, China is moving towards growth industries further up the value chain, and is trying to shift away from sectors like materials and energy in the process. We talk about what this means for investors, and KraneShares' approach to tackling these trends with their  ETF as well.KraneShares' KFYP dives deep into these trends by selecting stocks based on which appear to be important to the government's most recent Five-Year Plan, while also looking at fundamental factors too. This technique gives investors more of a focus on consumer and technology industries while also running the gambit of different Chinese share classes as well. We also discuss the pros and cons of this more sector-focused approach, which includes allocations to somewhat well-known Chinese companies such as Tencent (  ) or Netease (  ), and skews away from energy and banking sectors.This difference is especially important when you consider what the current crop of most popular China ETFs focus on these days.

So, make sure to tune in for that, and more, in this week's podcast.China is an economy that cannot be overlooked. And while there could be some rockiness in the next few years, it is hard to bet against continued growth in the nation and a further push towards the diversification of their economy.

The gains were broad-based, with NetEase enjoying solid sales increases across its product lines.\"Led by mobile games, we saw year-over-year net revenue increases in the fourth quarter of 62.8% from online games, 9.2% from advertising services, and 38.2% from our email, e-commerce and others segment,\" said CEO William Ding in a press release.Helping to fuel this growth is NetEase's impressive ability to pump out popular new games.\"With more than 40 new mobile titles in 2016, we have introduced a number of chart toppers to China's thriving mobile market,\" Ding said.All told, adjusted net income was $4.30 per diluted American depositary share (ADS), representing year-over-year growth of 68%. In turn, NetEase's board of directors approved a nearly 30% increase in its quarterly dividend to $1.01 per share.NetEase's shares have pulled back about 5% so far in March, but the stock still fetches about double what it did just one year ago.

In particular, a select few stocks have managed to double investors' money over the past year, and many investors wonder whether these stocks have more room to run.  (NASDAQ: NTES) ,  (NYSE: X) , and  (NASDAQ: GBT) took different paths to get to their strong performance, and each has different potential catalysts that could move its stock in the months and years to come. data by  .The Chinese video gaming industry has been a pocket of strong growth for a long time, and NetEase has done a good job of capitalizing on the potential of this key market. In its most recent quarter, it managed to boost its sales by more than half, and net income was up by more than two-thirds, continuing a streak of impressive gains for the gaming giant. NetEase has adopted a smart approach toward the industry, working to sustain its profits from the online gaming segment even as it expands into mobile and also looks at email, e-commerce, and other revenue streams to supplement its success. The result has been a 101% move higher for the stock since March 2016.Looking ahead, NetEase sees the mobile industry as the key to its future. The company believes that with mobile becoming the most important advertising platform in China, it needs to ensure that it gets in front of as many potential customers as possible. For investors, the fact that NetEase shares its profit gains in the form of dramatically rising dividends has only been icing on the cake for the dramatic share-price increases that the stock has produced over the past year.Image source: U.S. Steel.The steel industry has suffered from the slowdown in economic activity across the globe for years. Beginning when the fast-growing Chinese economy started to slow down, construction and infrastructure activity levels declined, and that hurt demand for steel at a key moment for the U.S. producer. Yet as you can see from the chart above, the November election results marked a turning point for U.S. Steel's stock, as investors looked forward to promises that President Trump made to reinvigorate American manufacturing and make long-needed improvements to infrastructure.More recently, U.S. Steel has given back some of its gains as investors worry about whether the Trump administration will be able to follow through on all of its planned initiatives. Nevertheless, the stock is up 144% over the past year, and with U.S. and global economic conditions looking more favorable, U.S. Steel has the potential to keep serving the world with the construction materials it needs to keep moving forward.Finally, Global Blood Therapeutics has delivered extremely strong performance recently with its gains of 131%. Investors have been enthusiastic about the prospects for the company's GBT440 treatment for sickle cell disease, and in January, Global Blood enrolled its first patient in its phase 3 HOPE study of the treatment for sickle-cell sufferers. Even after taking advantage of the jump in its share price to raise cash through a secondary offering, Global Blood has maintained its upward momentum.Now, some investors think that Global Blood Therapeutics might be a takeover target. Rumors have surfaced that  might be interested in acquiring Global Blood. It's too early to tell whether those rumors will pan out, or whether the two companies will agree to a deal even if one is in the works. Yet investors can count on Global Blood to be in high demand if GBT440 lives up to its full potential for both sickle cell disease and other health issues.Stocks don't double every day, but these companies have been successful enough to warrant big moves.

While that does include the financial crash of 2008, the market has grown modestly since its pre-crash 2007 highs 10 years ago. However, the three stocks below each blew right past the market to post a more than 1,000% gain during the last decade -- and they could all have plenty of growth potential from here.Data source: Yahoo! Finance. (NASDAQ: AMZN) might be an obvious choice for a list like this as its stock has continued to grow by leaps and bounds, especially in the last few years, as it successfully disrupts industries like retail, media, and many others. In 2016, the company grew sales to $136 billion, about 13 times annual sales notched in the company's more humble days in 2006. As a result, the stock is up nearly 1,300% in the last decade.What's next for Amazon? Currently, about two-thirds of Amazon's sales are made in the U.S., but the company is investing heavily to grow its international operations with focus on key areas such as India, which could lead to massive new opportunities for rapid growth. The company has a lot of moonshot projects now as well, including package delivery drones. One such project that's turned out to be highly successful is Amazon Web Services. AWS provides cloud-based information technology to enterprises, and in 2016, Amazon grew AWS sales more than 50% to roughly $12 billion, or about a tenth of total sales, and that revenue is likely to continue climbing quickly.An Amazon package delivery drone. Image source: Amazon.com. (NASDAQ: NTES) , the Chinese internet conglomerate that owns various online media brands, e-commerce services, and email providers, has been even more impressive than Amazon by gaining more than 1,500% in the last 10 years. NetEase has been a great play for the growing Chinese internet market, which continues to boom as smartphones make it possible for more of the population to get access to the web. By most recent count, more than 700 million people in China had internet access, but that is still just over half of the population, and that penetration rate is expected to continue growing rapidly in coming years.One of NetEase's most successful ventures has been creating and/or distributing online gaming, which has led to a good deal of success in recent years. The company has created many of its own games and is also the distributor of games from major labels like  . Even with rising earnings -- which were up more than 72% in 2016 over 2015 -- NetEase still looks reasonably cheap at just 23 times earnings, and less than 17 times forward earnings estimates.Image source: Ulta.Finally, there's  (NASDAQ: ULTA) , which is the operator of nearly 1,000 locations across the U.S. While perhaps not as interesting in terms of technology as the two other companies on this list, Ulta is one of the most compelling growth companies because has been succeeding in an industry that has been mostly in decline (largely thanks to Amazon), where retailers are scrambling to regain traffic and maintain margins in the face of necessary discounting.Ulta has largely bucked the trend of woe-is-me retail by providing in-store experiences such as product demonstrations and salon-services that have helped same-store sales to continue climbing by double digits year over year, while also creating a robust and growing e-commerce presence. The brand has also created a loyalty program, which grew 28% in 2016 to nearly 24 million members. The benefits of the loyalty program seem to have gone a long way toward keeping customers in its ecosystem instead of venturing to other online outlets.Looking ahead, Ulta has updated what it thought could be a future store count of around 1,200 locations in the U.S., to as much as an eventual 1,700 -- and that's not including the brand's international aspirations. Ulta's stock is already up more than 1,000% in the last 10 years, but just like Amazon and NetEase, this stock looks to have plenty of growth opportunity left.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Based on that decline, investors might initially think the company missed analyst forecasts.But on the contrary, Weibo crushed Wall Street estimates on both the top and bottom lines,  its first-quarter sales guidance topped expectations. Let's look at six of the most impressive numbers from that report and see why they failed to lift Weibo stock.Weibo's Android app. Image source: Weibo.During the quarter, Weibo's revenue rose 43% annually to $213 million, beating expectations by $6 million and marking an acceleration from its 42% growth in the third quarter. By comparison,  (NYSE:  ) -- which Weibo is frequently compared with -- grew its top line by less than 1% annually last quarter.Weibo's advertising and marketing revenue, boosted by its growth among smaller to medium-sized businesses, rose 45% to $188 million. That growth represents a stark contrast to Twitter, which reported a 0.5%  in ad revenue last quarter.That's because Twitter tries to reach smaller businesses with a cost-per-engagement model that lets advertisers merely pay for the interactions (click, reply, retweet, or favorite) they want. That move backfired, since it let advertisers merely pay less money for fewer clicks.Weibo generates VAS (value-added services) revenue from premium memberships, which offer personalized pages, voice posts, better security, and other features; data licensing, which sells a feed of Weibo data to companies for data analysis; and microtransactions from games and live video streams. Revenue from these services rose 28% annually to $25 million last quarter.Like Twitter, Weibo approaches live video with personal Periscope-like broadcasts and major contracts with content providers such as the NFL. But its live broadcasts have a revenue-generating twist on Weibo -- fans can buy virtual gifts for their favorite broadcasters, who keep a cut of each sale.Weibo's iOS app. Image source: iTunes.Weibo's monthly active users (MAUs) rose 33% annually to 313 million, and 90% of those users accessed the service from mobile devices. Daily active users (DAUs) grew 30% to 139 million. That impressive growth indicates that Weibo will soon eclipse Twitter -- which only grew its MAUs 4% annually to 319 million last quarter.Weibo's growth probably won't peak anytime soon, since China has an internet penetration rate of just over 50% -- compared with a penetration rate of almost 90% in the United States. Moreover, it's the biggest \"weibo\" site (\"weibo\" means \"microblogging\") by a wide margin -- rival platforms such as  Weibo and  Weibo reach much smaller audiences.On the bottom line, Weibo's GAAP net income rose 125% annually to $43 million, or $0.19 per share. That also marks an acceleration from 122% growth in the third quarter. Its non-GAAP net income rose 134% to $77 million, or $0.34 per share, beating expectations by $0.06. Its adjusted EBITDA rose 111% to $78.2 million.Those numbers make Twitter, which still isn't profitable on a GAAP basis, look very weak. Twitter's GAAP loss widened from $90 million a year ago to $167 million last quarter, and its non-GAAP net income grew just 3% to $119 million.Weibo topped off all those impressive growth figures with a forecast for 55%-59% annual sales growth for the current quarter -- which crushed analyst expectations for 51% growth. Analysts expect Weibo's revenue to rise 46% this year, compared with 37% growth in 2016. Its non-GAAP earnings are expected to rise 56%.These six numbers indicate that Weibo stock should have soared, not crashed, after the fourth-quarter earnings report. However, investors should remember that Weibo stock already rallied more than 240% over the past 12 months, so it wasn't surprising to see some investors take profits. Moreover, the stock still trades at over 100 times GAAP earnings -- making it a pricey play in a frothy market.Despite those valuation concerns, I believe that Weibo is still a great long-term buy for investors who believe it can maintain its streak of stellar top and bottom line growth. I'm still holding on to my position, and I'll consider any significant decline to be an opportunity to add more shares.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Japanese giant Nintendo  , released it much anticipated console, Switch amid much fanfare. Also, Facebook Inc  slashed price of its VR headset, Rift by $100 while Sony Corp's  PS VR breaks sales records.1. Nintendo's Switch had a \"smooth debut,\" reported Bloomberg. According to the report, the units were soon outsold following the release \"signaling Nintendo is on track to reach its goal of shipping 2 million units by the end of the month.\"Switch, priced at $300, combines the functionalities of both conventional consoles and handheld devices. Switch is designed to attract casual gamers who are increasingly using mobile. Nintendo, after staying away from mobile gaming for long has now become highly focused on mobile games. Last year's smash hit Pok\u00e9mon Go gave it the much needed impetus.The new Zelda game which has a Metacritic rating of 98 out of 100 should boost Switch sales. Nintendo needs a hit in the form of Switch, following the debacle of its last console Wii U. However, a hefty price and apparent lack of any ground-breaking/differentiating features from the consoles that are available in the markets right now could cost the company heavily. Nintendo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).2. Facebook has slashed the price of its VR headset Rift and Oculus Touch Motion controllers by $100 each. The step is widely viewed as a measure to boost sales. FB chief Mark Zuckerberg earlier commented that he expects Rift to sell about 50 to 100 million units over the next 10 years. However, Bloomberg quoting SuperData Research, reports that only 350K units were sold last year. Price has been a major deterrent for Rift having failed to gain a mass adoption. Rift was originally priced at $599, much higher than Sony's PS VR.Facebook had acquired Oculus for $2 billion in 2014. With Oculus, the company is trying to fuel the company's ambitious AR/VR efforts. Oculus has long been labeled as a multibillion dollar opportunity along with Facebook's other subsidiaries like Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp. Facebook carries a Zacks Rank #3.3. While Facebook is trying to boost sales of Rift, Sony's PS VR witnessed  since its release in October 2016. As on Feb 19, 2017, Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE), the gaming division of the company, reported that it had sold 915,000 PS VR units in the four months following its launch.It was prudent on part of Sony to capitalize on its powerful installed base of over 53.4 million PS4 customers to drive VR sales. Plus, the company's decision to price headset at just $399 was considered a smart ploy as it offered the device for a discount of over $200 compared to other headsets available in the market. Sony carries a Zacks Rank #3. You can see 4. Meanwhile, Microsoft Corp (  ) launched a subscription based gaming service, Xbox Game Pass. Reportedly, with Xbox Game Pass, users can \"download unlimited games\" from Xbox One and Xbox 360 games roster for a subscription of $9.99 per month. Though similar to Netflix Inc's (  ) streaming service, Xbox game pass differs a lot from Netflix. Per media reports, users are required to download games rather than stream. This alleviates the concerns of having a strong bandwidth and internet connectivity all the time.Microsoft carries a Zacks Rank #3.However, the news caused  (  ) to fall as the Game Pass emerges a threat to its business. Analysts observe that GameStop is a video games retailer which buys and sells video games both new and used. However, with most new games available for download, GameStop's business thrives on selling used games. With Xbox Pass even this is highly at risk. At present, GameStop carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The following table shows the price movement of the major video game companies over both the past five trading days as well as the last six months:\n  \nOver the last five trading sessions, Glu Mobile Inc.  was down 7.28% whereas Activision Blizzard  was up 2.98%.Over the last six-month period, NetEase  surged the most (34.35%). Recently, NetEase reported solid fourth-quarter 2016 results. The increasing popularity of mobile-based games and the strength of PC games (licensed & self-developed) continue to keep investors interested in the stock. NetEase's online gaming revenues grew 62% in the quarter. Also, NetEase has announced a new $1 billion buyback program for its ADRs over a one-year time frame.Glu was down 17.67% over the same time frame owingto underperformance of most of its releases. To improve its performance, Glu announced that it has inked a deal with MLB and Kris Bryant and many more for releasing a new title under its Tap Sports Baseball franchise.

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["hinese social network  (NASDAQ: WB) has surged more than 240% over the past 12 months, fueled by quarter after quarter of double-digit sales growth and triple-digit earnings growth. But as we all know, stocks never go up in a straight line, and Weibo plummeted 16% on Feb. 23 after reporting its fourth-quarter earnings.However, Weibo's fourth-quarter numbers actually crushed analyst expectations. Its revenue rose 43% annually to $213 million, beating estimates by $6 million, and its non-GAAP earnings grew 134% to $77 million, or $0.34 per share -- topping forecasts by $0.06. It also expects its first-quarter revenues to rise 55%-59% annually -- well above forecasts for 51% growth.Image source: Getty Images.Weibo's big sell-off might simply be caused by investors booking profits after the stock's monstrous gains over the past year. But if you plan to buy the dip, you should be familiar with the five main risks facing the company today.Weibo currently trades at 106 times its GAAP earnings and 62 times its non-GAAP earnings for fiscal 2016. Those lofty P/E ratios are much higher than the industry average of 50 for internet information providers, but they are well supported by its 211% GAAP earnings growth and 167% non-GAAP earnings growth in 2016.Analysts estimate that Weibo's non-GAAP earnings will rise 56% in fiscal 2017. That gives Weibo a forward P/E of 40, which looks reasonable relative to its growth potential. Nonetheless, Weibo's high multiples still leave it highly exposed to big sell-offs in a frothy market.Weibo is one of China's biggest social networks, but it's still dwarfed by  's(NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) WeChat, the country's most popular  . WeChat's monthly active users rose 30% annually to 846 million last quarter.WeChat isn't just a simple chat app. It's a monolithic \"super app\" that lets users share content through its \"Moments\" news feed, play integrated mobile games, hail cabs, order food, transfer money, make e-commerce purchases, and access other online-to-offline services -- all without leaving the app. The growth of that ecosystem is dangerous for any rival, like Weibo, which provides similar services.WeChat's mobile app. Image source: iTunes.The term \"weibo\" means \"microblog\"\" in Chinese. The Weibo we're discussing in this article was once the microblogging arm of online portal giant  (NASDAQ: SINA) , which spun off Weibo as a separate company in 2014 and maintained a majority voting stake.However, there are other rival weibos in China, including Tencent Weibo,  (NASDAQ: SOHU) Weibo, and  Weibo. All these weibos act as social extensions of these internet and media companies' ecosystems. None of these weibos is bigger than Sina Weibo, but they could eventually steal market share away from the company. Tencent Weibo is particularly dangerous, because it's integrated with QQ, its older PC-based messaging platform, which still has 877 million active users.Weibo's biggest backers are Sina and e-commerce giant  , which respectively control 51% and 32% of the company. The support of Sina gives Weibo streamlined access to the portal site's news stories and content, while Alibaba integrates e-commerce and payment features into Weibo's app.That support helps Weibo, but it could also potentially block Sina and Alibaba's rivals from integrating their services with the platform. That means Sina rival Sohu or Alibaba's business-to-consumer competitor  probably won't partner with Weibo anytime soon. Both companies have already partnered with WeChat instead -- which could throttle Weibo's growth potential in the ongoing ecosystem wars in the Chinese internet market.Lastly, Weibo isn't a platform for free speech. The Chinese government expects Weibo to self-censor posts related to controversial subjects and frequently orders the company to delete posts. The government once threatened to shut down all of Sina's news services for spreading \"illegal\" information, so it wouldn't be surprising to see regulators attempt a similar crackdown on Weibo.Weibo could also face regulatory pressures in the United States. The SEC has probed the accounting firms that audited U.S.-listed Chinese companies, and it recently put Alibaba under the microscope over allegations of falsifying sales figures. If the SEC hits Weibo with a similar probe (although there's no evidence that it ever will), investors will undoubtedly start questioning the company's growth story.I believe that Weibo is a risky and volatile stock, but I still believe it has room to grow. Its impressive top- and bottom-line numbers, expanding user base, and strong growth in adjacent markets such as data licensing and live video streaming all indicate that it won't peak anytime soon. However, Weibo isn't for risk-averse investors, and you should fully understand these risks before buying the stock.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Sohu's revenues of $412 million decreased 12% on a year-over-year basis due to lower revenues from advertising and online gaming.

The strong showing was enough to motivate a couple of bullish analysts to boost their price targets on the stock while a more cautious Wall Street pro changed its tune.It was an encouraging report out of the Chinese online gaming giant. Net revenue for the quarter shot 53% higher to hit $1.74 billion, fueled mostly by a 63% spike in the online games revenue that now accounts for all but a quarter of NetEase's business. Adjusted earnings soared 68% to $4.30 a share. Analysts were only holding out for revenue and earnings per share to climb 37% and 38%, respectively.NetEase pays out roughly a quarter of its earnings as dividends, so the strong growth was enough for it to declare a record payout of $1.01 a share for the quarter. NetEase is growing at a heady pace despite its large size, and investors are benefiting from both the beefier distributions and the buoyant stock price.Image source: NetEase.Analysts were generally encouraged by the strong performance. Jialong Shi at Nomura stuck to his buy rating, boosting his price target from $315 to $322 following the report. Shi's bullishness was fortified by deferred game revenue growth accelerating from 36% during the third quarter to 62% this time around. Strong deferred revenue should translate into healthy growth through at least early 2017.Deutsche Bank analyst Han Joon Kim also raised his price goal -- going from $288 to $298 -- while sticking to his buy rating. The strength of NetEase's success on both the PC and mobile fronts is a good sign, and Kim feels as if the market is underestimating the potential of the dozens of games that NetEase plans to introduce through 2017.NetEase's strong results even encouraged one naysayer to become less bearish. Mizuho upgraded the stock from underperform to neutral.It's not just NetEase's stock moving higher. Analysts have been juicing up their profit targets. They now see NetEase earning $15.17 a share this year, up from the $14.48 a share just a week ago. The stock moved higher than the forward earnings estimate last week, so it's not as if the stock is cheaper than it was a week ago. However, NetEase stock seems reasonably priced at less than 20 times this year's earnings and 17 times next year's forecast.Stateside investors have been burned by the fickle nature of publishers of mobile games that are hot one quarter and cold the next, but NetEase has debunked those concerns in China. It has been able to grow its empire consistently for more than a decade. NetEase is trading at a discount to its current and historical growth rates, making it a compelling bargain stock even after last week's pop.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  (NASDAQ:  ),  (OTCMKTS:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NYSE:  ) and  (OTCMKTS:  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. China's stocks are making a blistering comeback this year after a dismal 2016. In fact, a cursory analysis indicates that the world's second largest economy's financial markets are outperforming all of their Asian peers. This is particularly true for ADRs, since the MSCI China index, a gauge of the country's stocks listed in New York and Hong Kong, is up 10.6% year-to-dateSuch an increase compares favorably with the S&P 500's 4% increase and the MSCI Emerging Markets index's 8.5% gain over the same period. Currently at its highest level since Oct 2016, the index's success indicates that this may be a good time to pick up and profit from China's stocks.Ever since President Trump took office, speculation has been rife that his administration will implement policies detrimental for China. Such concerns first emerged during his campaign, when Trump said he would impose stiff tariffs on the country and designate it as a currency manipulator.However, investors and fund managers have ignored such fears and chosen to focus on the improvement in corporate results. Companies included in the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index have experienced a decline in their EPS over the past two years. But most analysts and market watchers think earnings will rebound this year.One estimate puts the increase in earnings at 7.84%, with a similar gain projected for next year. Questions still remain about whether such growth will at all take place. However, stocks from the region still offer great value, given that the MSCI's forward price to earnings ratio for 2017 stands at 12.5, significantly lower than the S&P 500's reading of 17.8.Meanwhile, recent economic data is also urging investors took take a fresh look at China's stocks. According to data released on Tuesday, the country's PPI increased to its highest level since Aug 2011 in January, registering an annual increase of 6.9%. Several economists believe that reform measures being pursued on the supply side have begun to take effect.Many of these programs were aimed at reducing overcapacity in China's heavy industries. Their success was evident by last September itself, when a four year decline in factory input costs came to an end. Meanwhile, CPI increased at tis fastest rate in nearly two and a half years in January, by 2.5%, indicating that some of the rise in costs are being passed on to consumers.Despite all this evidence, a section of investors remain apprehensive about the fortunes of emerging markets this year. But even though Credit Suisse announced on Monday that it was now \"tactically neutral\" on Asia's equities, its preferred market in the area is still China.Also, Trump's promised protectionist policies could snap this rally. But such fears are being ignored by most market watchers and fund managers. After all, straining trade ties with China beyond a point would also hurt the U.S.This is why this may be a great time to add China's stocks to your portfolio. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our  comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.

Shares of  (NASDAQ: NTES) raced to fresh all-time highs this week, fueled by another blowout quarter after Wednesday's market close. The Chinese online gaming and internet giant saw its fourth-quarter revenue soar 53% to $1.74 billion.The key growth driver is its flagship PC and mobile games, as revenue there soared 63% to $1.24 billion. Online games now account for 74% of the revenue mix. Advertising services revenue rose 9%, with its email, e-commerce, and others segment moving 38% higher.NetEase's blazing quarter was actually a deceleration from the pace it had established in 2015 and through the first half of 2016, but a step up from the third quarter's more human 38% growth. That was a rare  for a stock that's been one of the market's bigger winners over the years. NetEase still closed out the year in fine fashion. The 67% top-line surge for all of 2016 is NetEase's second best showing over the past decade. As big as NetEase has gotten by topping $5 billion in annual revenue for the first time, you have to go back more than a decade to find the kind of growth that it has rattled off in 2015 and 2016.Image source: NetEase.com.NetEase started its publicly traded life as an internet portal that dabbled in PC games. NetEase's success in transforming its homegrown PC game releases into hits attracted  (NASDAQ: ATVI) as a partner. Activision Blizzard turned to NetEase to distribute  and eventually  through China.NetEase is keeping up with the times these days, making the most of the mobile migration. It put out 40 game apps last year. One of its biggest self-produced releases --  , an anime-style RPG -- has been on fire since its early September release. NetEase rolled out the game through Southeast Asia late last year, and its targeting several world markets including the U.S. hotbed for a rollout later this year.There's no point in forgetting its PC roots, especially when some of the franchises that put it on the map including  and  -- as well as Activision Blizzard's  -- are still going strong with updates and expansion packs.Gross profit margin contracted for the period, as NetEase leaned on the heady growth of mobile games and licensed games that carry leaner gross profit margins. Net income still managed to grow faster than revenue given the scalable nature of the business, skyrocketing 68% to $4.30 a share.Investors will naturally cheer on big bottom-line gains, but it pays off in a major way with NetEase.

Adjusted net income was $4.30 per diluted American depositary share (ADS), up from $2.56 in the same year-ago period.

Yet gaming has made many advances over the years, and it's important for companies to keep up with the times and to find ways to gain competitive advantages over rivals.Coming into Wednesday's fourth-quarter financial report, NetEase investors had extremely high expectations for the company to continue stellar growth rates on the top and bottom line, and the video-game giant was able to meet all those expectations and then some.Let's take a closer look at NetEase to see how it did and what 2017 will bring.Mobile games are making consoles obsolete. Image source: Getty Images.NetEase's fourth-quarter results were extremely attractive even by the company's own very high standards. Revenue jumped by more than half compared to the year-ago quarter, weighing in at $1.74 billion, and that was far above the 37% growth rate that most investors were expecting to see. Adjusted net income soared by roughly two-thirds, working out to $569.9 million, and that equated to adjusted earnings of $4.30 per share. That compared very favorably against the consensus forecast for $3.44 per share on the bottom line.Taking a closer look at the numbers, NetEase continued to see some similar trends drive its business forward. Sales from the key online game segment jumped more than 60%, making up almost three-quarters of NetEase's total revenue. The email, e-commerce, and other revenue category saw growth slow from previous quarters, climbing 38%, and advertising revenue growth continued to lag behind the rest, posting gains of just 9%.However, NetEase suffered renewed pressure on its gross margin. Gross margin figures for the online gaming segment fell by more than six percentage points to 60.7%, and the company said that mobile and licensed games made up a larger portion of its overall sales. Those products tend to produce lower margins than other sources of revenue. Gross margin rose in email, e-commerce, and other revenue, but it fell in advertising services.CEO William Ding was pleased with NetEase's performance. \"We achieved growth across our business in 2016,\" Ding said, \"as we continued to introduce internet content to entertain and inspire our community.\" The CEO also pointed to new mobile titles that have performed extremely well in China, building positive momentum coming into 2017.NetEase doesn't see its growth stopping anytime soon. As Ding said, \"As we move through 2017, we will look toward the future, designing products and services that address fluid market dynamics, enabling continued growth and value creation.\"One opportunity that NetEase has identified is that the internet in general and the mobile internet in particular is becoming the primary advertising platform in the Chinese market. That has helped NetEase's advertising services business, and its mobile games also help take advantage of the fact that its consumers are already on their devices anyway. It also helps to bring customers to its e-commerce business, producing growth in that segment as well.Even better news came for shareholders who count on getting income from the online gaming giant. NetEase gave investors a huge bump in its quarterly payout, declaring a dividend of $1.01 per share. The move reflects NetEase's ongoing policy to return about 25% of its net income each quarter in the form of a dividend. The boost amounted to almost 30%, which was a welcome sight after the disappointment of flat dividend payments last quarter.NetEase shareholders were quite happy with the company's results, and the stock climbed 7% in after-hours trading following the announcement to reach new all-time record highs. Yet even after its gains, NetEase still has fundamental momentum on its side, and further growth appears not only possible but also likely in 2017 and beyond.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(NASDAQ: NTES) isn't a name many investors are familiar with, largely because the appeal of its PC and mobile games rests largely on gamers in China. However, NetEase has proved to be one of the biggest winners out of the world's most populous nation among the stocks trading on stateside exchanges.Expectations are high. Analysts see revenue of $1.57 billion for the fourth quarter, up 37% since the prior year. It's an aggressive bar, but NetEase grew its top line at a 38% clip last time out, and 37% in revenue growth would be the online speedster's weakest growth in more than two years.Wall Street pros are holding out for an equally impressive bottom line. The $3.40 a share analysts are modeling is 43% ahead of the prior year's fourth-quarter showing. That's another bar that may seem to be raised high, but NetEase has a habit of barreling through net income expectations. NetEase has topped analyst earnings estimates consistently over the past year.Image source: NetEase.com. http://tx3.netease.com/thread-2689768-1-1.htmlNetEase has been one of the market's biggest winners over the past decade.

The last analyst to chime in on the stock -- Bhavtosh Vajpayee at Bernstein -- initiated coverage on the stock with an \"underperform\" rating last month. He slapped a $200 price on the stock, suggesting 23% of downside from current levels.Meanwhile, the other two Wall Street pros to update their opinions on NetEase last month -- CLSA and Standpoint Research -- upgraded the stock. NetEase is also making its own luck, aggressively buying back stock in a move that improves profitability on a per-share basis.NetEase shares aren't exactly cheap, fetching 21 times trailing earnings and less than 18 times this new year's estimate. However, the company's revenue and earnings are growing faster than that. There are risks involved when one invests in China, of course. Gaming is also a very fickle niche, though NetEase has managed to keep its popularity growing over the past decade.There's a lot riding on Wednesday's report. NetEase stock has taken a hit in three of the past four quarters, despite posting better-than-expected earnings. NetEase will need a blowout report if it wants to revisit last year's all-time highs, proving most of the analysts covering the stock right in the process.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The  managed to post an eight-point rise that represented a new record, but other market benchmarks posted small losses. After a huge run upward over the past couple of weeks, today's market actions seemed like nothing more than an acknowledgement that stocks can't move straight upward forever. Yet few things changed about the average investor's views on the current state of the stock market, and several stocks climbed higher as earnings season begins to draw toward a close.  (NASDAQ: NTES) ,  (NASDAQ: DENN) , and  (NASDAQ: TIVO) were among the top performers on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so well.NetEase stock soared 14% after the company reported strong fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 results Wednesday night. The Chinese online gaming giant saw revenue jump by more than half from year-ago levels, and earnings were up even more sharply with a rise of about two-thirds. Adoption of mobile gaming in China continued to build, and NetEase sees the mobile space becoming the key audience for advertising opportunities in the world's second-largest economy. In addition to the big bottom-line gains, NetEase gave shareholders a nearly 30% increase to its quarterly dividend, and CEO William Ding believes that the company is well positioned to keep taking advantage of favorable trends to drive not only its gaming empire but also ancillary businesses like e-commerce forward.Image source: Denny's.Denny's stock climbed 12% in the wake of the company's fourth-quarter financial report. The restaurant chain managed to post only tepid comparable-restaurant sales growth of 0.5%, but its bottom-line growth was exceptionally strong, climbing more than 40% on an adjusted basis. CEO John Miller credited Denny's \"brand revitalization strategy, [which] delivered an improved and differentiated experience for our guests across food, service, and atmosphere.\" Denny's saw market share gains over the course of the year, and the restaurant company sees further modest comps growth of 0% to 2% for 2017. Those results might not look all that strong, but in an environment in which many restaurant chains are struggling just to sustain revenue and profit levels from previous periods, Denny's performance was above average.Finally, shares of TiVo climbed 10%. The maker of digital recording technology reported its fourth-quarter financial results Wednesday afternoon, which included a nearly 70% boost in revenue following the acquisition of TiVo Solutions. Adjusted pre-tax income climbed by more than half, and the company said that it expects further gains in sales to a range of $800 million to $835 million for 2017. In light of the strong performance, TiVo chose to declare its first dividend of $0.18 per share, with the intent of continuing the move on a quarterly basis. At the same time, a $150 million stock repurchase authorization showed even more confidence in TiVo's shares, and CEO Tom Carson said that the company's product leadership and strong licensing business \"position TiVo well for long-term success in our key addressable markets.\" Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

In fact, a cursory analysis indicates that the world's second largest economy's financial markets are outperforming all of their Asian peers. This is particularly true for ADRs, since the MSCI China index, a gauge of the country's stocks listed in New York and Hong Kong, is up 10.6% year-to-dateSuch an increase compares favorably with the S&P 500's 4% increase and the MSCI Emerging Markets index's 8.5% gain over the same period. Currently at its highest level since Oct 2016, the index's success indicates that this may be a good time to pick up and profit from China's stocks.Ever since President Trump took office, speculation has been rife that his administration will implement policies detrimental for China. Such concerns first emerged during his campaign, when Trump said he would impose stiff tariffs on the country and designate it as a currency manipulator.However, investors and fund managers have ignored such fears and chosen to focus on the improvement in corporate results. Companies included in the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index have experienced a decline in their EPS over the past two years. But most analysts and market watchers think earnings will rebound this year.One estimate puts the increase in earnings at 7.84%, with a similar gain projected for next year. Questions still remain about whether such growth will at all take place. However, stocks from the region still offer great value, given that the MSCI's forward price to earnings ratio for 2017 stands at 12.5, significantly lower than the S&P 500's reading of 17.8.Meanwhile, recent economic data is also urging investors took take a fresh look at China's stocks. According to data released on Tuesday, the country's PPI increased to its highest level since Aug 2011 in January, registering an annual increase of 6.9%. Several economists believe that reform measures being pursued on the supply side have begun to take effect.Many of these programs were aimed at reducing overcapacity in China's heavy industries. Their success was evident by last September itself, when a four year decline in factory input costs came to an end. Meanwhile, CPI increased at tis fastest rate in nearly two and a half years in January, by 2.5%, indicating that some of the rise in costs are being passed on to consumers.Despite all this evidence, a section of investors remain apprehensive about the fortunes of emerging markets this year. But even though Credit Suisse Group AG  announced on Monday that it was now \"tactically neutral\" on Asia's equities, its preferred market in the area is still China.Also, Trump's promised protectionist policies could snap this rally. But such fears are being ignored by most market watchers and fund managers.

Weibo consistently posts impressive growth, but the stock's 200% rally over the past 12 months and triple-digit P/E ratio made it seem too hot to handle. But after taking a closer look at the company, I finally decided to buy some shares of this hot stock for five simple reasons.Beijing, China. Image source: Getty Images.Weibo was launched by Chinese internet giant  (NASDAQ: SINA) in 2009. Sina subsequently spun off Weibo in an IPO in 2014, and retained an 11% stake in the new company. Chinese e-commerce giant  eventually took a 32% stake.  The strong support from these tech giants gives Weibo easy access to partnerships and integrated features, like its payments platform powered by Alibaba's Alipay.Weibo isn't the only \"weibo\" (microblogging site) in China. Other weibos include  Weibo,  Weibo, and  Weibo -- which are all tethered to their own internet ecosystems. Yet Weibo remains the biggest and most active of all these platforms.Last quarter, Weibo's monthly active users (MAUs) rose 34% annually to 297 million, and 89% of those users accessed the service from mobile devices. Its daily active users (DAUs) rose 32% to 132 million. By comparison, Twitter's MAUs only rose 3% to 317 million last quarter, and its DAUs grew just 7%.At this rate, Weibo will easily eclipse Twitter in the near future. Weibo still has plenty of room to grow -- China has an internet penetration rate of just 52%, compared to a penetration rate of 89% in the U.S. Furthermore, the ongoing Chinese ban on Twitter,  , and other foreign social networking platforms will help Weibo remain one of the country's top social networking platforms for the foreseeable future.Weibo's rapid user growth can be attributed to the fact that it's continuously evolved its platform. Like Twitter, Weibo initially lured top celebrities and companies to its platform, which brought plenty of followers. But instead of sticking with Twitter's format of restrictive tweets, Weibo ditched its 140-character limit last January and added new mobile, video, social gaming, and chat functions, which made it much more similar to Facebook.By building better communication channels between users, Weibo avoided Twitter's fate of becoming a one-way digital soapbox for celebrities and companies. Weibo also launched a live streaming app similar to Twitter's Periscope, but the oddly successful twist is that viewers can buy virtual gifts (from Weibo) for their favorite broadcasters.Weibo's mobile app. Image source: Google Play.Weibo's revenue rose 42% annually to $176.9 million last quarter. Advertising and marketing revenues rose 48% to $156.7 million, while Value-Added Services revenue (from virtual gifts, gaming, payments, and other features) grew 7% to $20.2 million.Weibo attributes much of its advertising growth to its growing user base and its new advertising tools for small and medium-sized businesses. That growth probably won't slow down anytime soon -- analysts expect Weibo's revenue to rise 36% this year and accelerate to 44% growth next year.Unlike Twitter, which is only profitable on a non-GAAP basis, Weibo is profitable by both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics. That's because Weibo generates much stronger revenue growth and spent just 6% of that revenue on stock-based compensation expenses last quarter. Those expenses, which are much higher in the San Francisco Bay Area, gobbled up 26% of Twitter's revenues in its most recent quarter.As a result, Weibo's non-GAAP net income rose 147% to $54.6 million last quarter, its GAAP net income increased 122% to $32.1 million, and its adjusted EBITDA surged 117% to $57.7 million. Analysts expect Weibo's non-GAAP earnings to rise 138% this year and 66% next year. Based on those figures, Weibo's trailing P/E of 128 and forward P/E of 39 don't look terribly expensive.Weibo looks like a solid growth stock, but investors should also be well aware of the risks. Weibo currently self-censors its content, but Chinese regulators could enforce stricter censorship laws or clamp down on the site -- as they once did to its former parent company, Sina.Tencent's WeChat, the most popular messaging app in the country, could also hurt Weibo by expanding its ecosystem via its monolithic app -- similar to Facebook's approach with Messenger. Lastly, a slowdown in the Chinese economy could throttle Weibo's advertising revenue growth. Therefore, I've started a small position in Weibo for now, and I'll wait to see how those situations play out before adding any more shares.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Among the largest underlying components of IEMG, in trading today Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (Symbol: BABA) is down about 0.3%, Baidu, Inc. (Symbol: BIDU) is up about 0.1%, and NetEase, Inc (Symbol: NTES) is lower by about 0.2%.  The chart below shows the one year price performance of IEMG, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, IEMG's low point in its 52 week range is $34.97 per share, with $46.54 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $45.47. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ideo-game stocks have seen a lot of growth lately, but the gaming industry could still give publicly traded gaming companies such as  (NASDAQ: EA) ,  (NASDAQ: ATVI) , and  (NASDAQ: TTWO) even more room to run. With the growth of online gaming, mobile gaming, and new hardware and software that's preparing a tech overhaul for this industry, here's why EA and these other companies could be some of the best video-game stocks now.The gaming industry itself looks to be continuing to grow nicely, up to $91 billion in 2016, according to analysts at SuperData, and is expected to continue growing in the years to come. There are multiple growth drivers pushing the market up, one of which is the growth in online gaming, not only via computers but also gaming consoles seamlessly connected to the internet.Image source: Getty Images.Data source: Yahoo! Finance.The behemoths in this space, Activision and EA, continue to look like two of the best gaming stocks, as they consistently put out top content and pivot toward the future of video games. The rise of online gaming and internet-connect consoles has helped traditional console gaming content makers such as Activision and EA to sell more games that can be downloaded digitally, and also help to push more in-game purchases.Activision shares jumped nearly 20% the day after 2016 full-year earnings were announced on Feb. 10, when the company reported sales up 42% in 2016 year over year. The company also announced plans to use its excess cash to buy back $1 billion in stock over the next two years. With rising total monthly active users, as well as increased user engagement and monetization from its top-performing franchises, the company looks to have plenty of room to run from here.EA has also been a top content creator in the industry with its highly successful  ,  and  franchises. EA is one of the most important players in the growing e-sports segment, which could be a major growth driver with its already popular games. While EA's sales haven't been growing as quickly as Activision's -- EA's sales rose 7.4% for the first nine months of 2016 year over year -- it still looks to be on a long-term growth trajectory with rising earnings, up 56% during that same time. The stock also looks cheaper by price to earnings than most of its competitors.Speaking of reasonable valuation for plenty of expected growth ahead, another gaming stock that looks especially interesting now is  (NASDAQ: NTES) . This Chinese internet media company, among many other offerings, gives users online games both of its own and through distribution partnerships with companies such as Activision. NetEase has released many new games in 2016, helping its sales continue to grow nicely as a result, and the company said it would continue its drumbeat of new games in 2017. Even with rising sales and earnings, both of which rose by double digits in the most recent quarter year over year, the stock looks cheap now at just 18 times forward earnings.Another growth driver for the gaming industry has been the rise in mobile gaming, particularly with low-feature games that drive huge initial demand, as well as increasingly sophisticated games with more storylines and longer-term engagement.  fighting for the mobile-game market has done well lately, but one standout in this space is Take-Two Interactive. The company recently acquired Social Point, a free-to-play mobile game developer, which should help Take-Two continue growing in this space.Image source: PokemonGo.com.Take-Two also upped its own game in e-sports with a new partnership with the NBA as part of Take-Two's NBA2K e-league game. Take-Two's earnings have yet to catch up to the company's growing stock price as a result of its investments in new growth, hence the seemingly absurdly high price-to-earnings ratio, but the stock's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 21 looks reasonable. (NASDAQOTH: NTDOY) is another interesting gaming company, and one that made a big splash throughout 2016 following the release of game developer Niantic Inc.'s  in partnership with Nintendo. The augmented-reality game took the world by storm, getting over half a billion downloads in the first few months on the market.The following release of Nintendo's  mobile game was less well received, and the company missed sales and earnings estimates in its most recent quarter, but Nintendo hopes to continue making headlines with its new console, called Switch, that comes out in early 2017. Nintendo's stock does look expensive now for its limited recent history of consistent hits, but the company still has a lot of intellectual-property assets, and its more aggressive mobile strategy could make for more big hits in the near future.The gaming industry is not only growing but also constantly evolving, and there are many players in this space set to benefit both directly and indirectly -- such as computer companies that make consoles, and chip companies that power the technological growth of this space. The future of gaming looks rosy and these look like some of the best gaming stocks you could own now.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Vajpayee's goals are between 13% and 22% below where they closed yesterday.Bernstein's Vajpayee isn't the only Wall Street pro who's cautious on China's internet-based platforms.

The online marketplace operator is coming off a rough quarter where it warned of headwinds in its housing-related operations.

Meanwhile Nintendo Co., Ltd.  announced the release of its most anticipated console, Switch, on Mar 3, 2017.1. GameStop's  continues to be marred by changingretail backdrop, aggressive discounting and depleting store traffic, which badly impacted holiday sales. Worldwide sales of $2.5 billion fell 16.4% year over year while comps decreased 18.7%, reflecting a fall of 26.6% and 13% in November and December, respectively. Management pointed that comps improved sequentially and expects the trend to improve further in January.The news sent the stock price plunging on Jan 13. Over the past one year, shares of GameStop have declined 7.46% as against 45.62% growth witnessed in Zacks categorized  industry.Given the dismal performance, management now expects fiscal 2016 comps to decline between 10% and 12% compared with the earlier estimate of 6.5%-9.5% decline. Despite the disappointing performance, GameStop is positive about non-physical gaming business and expects it to reach approximately 40% of earnings in fiscal 2016.At present, GameStop carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see 2.Nintendo's much anticipated new console, Switch will be  from Mar 3, 2017. Switch combines the functionalities of both conventional consoles and handheld devices. Analysts observe that Nintendo needs a hit in the form of Switch, following the debacle of its last console Wii U. But the apparent lack of any ground-breaking/differentiating features from the consoles that are available in the markets right now could cost Nintendo heavily. Plus, analysts were expecting a lower price tag for Switch compared to Wii U, PS4 and Xbox One. The hefty $299 price tag may become a deterrent going ahead per analysts. Also, Nintendo announced the launch of Fire Emblem for both Android and iOS platforms.Nintendo carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). However, the success of Pok\u00e9mon Go helped the company's share price. Over the past one year, shares are up 65.33% compared with Zacks  industry's gain of 18.53%.3. Meanwhile, Facebook's  VR subsidiary, Oculus has been  with a $2 billion lawsuit filed by video game company, ZeniMax. Per media reports, ZeniMax claims Oculus \"stole\" its intellectual property to boost its own VR research. ZeniMax reportedly claims that current Oculus CTO John Carmack who previously worked for its company, idSoftware, helped Oculus develop the VR technology by sharing software details of ZeniMax.CEO Mark Zuckerberg appeared in a Dallas courtroom to testify against the allegations. Apparently, Zuckerberg has denied all allegations and stressed that \"The idea that Oculus technology is based on someone else's is just wrong.\" Facebook had acquired Oculus in 2014 and since then has launched only one product, Rift, a VR headset, which is primarily liked by gamers.At present, Facebook has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). In the past one year, Facebook's shares have generated a return of 35.19%, compared with the Zacks  industry's gain of 15.52%.The following table shows the price movement of the major video game companies over both the past five trading days as well as the last six months:\n  \nOver the last five trading sessions, NetEase Inc  was up 5.30% whereas Zynga Inc  was down 3.31%.Over the last six-month period, Take Two Interactive  surged the most (29.70%). The company continues to benefit from its popular offerings like GrandTheft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online (though sales are slowing down), along with its other releases like NBA 2K17.In fact, higher sales of the digital version of the games add to the company's margins. The company continues to expect growth in digital revenues driven by higher sale of full game downloads and increases in recurrent consumer spending.Glu Mobile  was down 14.39% over the same time frame due to the underperformance of most of its releases.

Image source: Electronic Arts. According to analysts at SuperData, 2016 has been the best year yet for video games, with the total market value hitting $91 billion this year. Driving this growth is exciting new technology and expanding platforms bringing in new gamers worldwide.Gaming stocks have had quite a year as well, with some of the biggest names in the industry underperforming, such as  (NASDAQ: ATVI) , and some companies out of left field rising to the top, such as  (NASDAQOTH: NTDOY) . Looking to the year ahead, here are the top gaming stocks to buy now.By far the biggest story of 2016 has been mobile gaming, led in large part by the cult-like following for  . This augmented-reality game has started the whole industry thinking of new ways to serve content to gamers.  , created by Niantic Labs in partnership with Nintendo, has helped Nintendo's stock to surge as much as 80% before a mid-December sell-off that resulted from a less-favorable launch of Nintendo's attempt at follow-up success with  .Images source: Nintendo / Super Mario RunAnother exciting technology shift in 2016 has been the increased focus on virtual reality (VR), led in large part by  (NYSE: SNE) and its new VR gaming bundle for the PlayStation 4 console. VR has been somewhat of a pipe dream, as high costs and limited content has made it a novel concept but without mass-market appeal. Sony's new VR equipment, along with new VR-specific games, could change that situation.For the year to come, it's important to recognize which companies performed especially well in 2016, but also to look at what these companies are doing now, along with their valuations, in an attempt to decide which are in the position to growth the most this year.\n  \nP/E = price-to-earnings ratio. TTM = trailing 12 months. Data source: Yahoo! Finance.While 2016 hasn't been a big year for Activision Blizzard shares, it has been a transitional year in which it has expanded its footprint in mobile, including a changing business model to more digital in-game purchases and subscription revenue.  (NASDAQ: EA) has gone on a similar journey that should continue to pay off in 2017. These two companies consistently make up many of the top games in the industry, and now that their stocks have come down in valuation (especially true for Activision, which in months past was trading above 45 times earnings), 2017 could prove to be a year in which their stock prices see impressive gains.Image source: Activision Blizzard. (NASDAQ: NTES) is one of the best plays on the thriving Chinese gaming market. This Chinese internet services company offers online gaming packs and also partners with companies such as Activision Blizzard to distribute many of their games throughout China. NetEase recently announced a slew of new PC and mobile games, 29 in total, and has promised to continue releasing new games in 2017. By valuation, NetEase is also the cheapest company on the list despite its great showing in 2016.One of the best performing stocks in the game content space in 2016,  (NASDAQ: TTWO) , could certainly keep its momentum going in 2017 with fresh new content and an increased focus on digital and mobile growth. Take-Two's sales rose 21% in the most recent quarter, year over year, though its growth strategy has left earnings still relatively low, which is the cause of its absurdly high P/E ratio. Still, its forward P/E is just 19, and the company seems in a great position for continued long-term growth.Image source: NVIDIAThis past year has shown the importance of the behind-the-scenes power generators -- such as graphics-chip makers -- that are benefiting from the rise in the gaming industry.  (NASDAQ: NVDA) is an example of a company that has made some of the exciting growth in things like VR possible. Gaming makes up only part of this company's total revenue, so it's not a pure play on gaming growth like Activision Blizzard, but its success in this industry made it a top gaming stock of 2016, pushing its stock up 220% during the year.Going into 2017, NVIDIA continues to look like a best bet on the gaming industry growth, especially as one of the prime makers of VR-ready laptops and some of the important gaming hardware in the market. Apart from gaming, NVIDIA's growth in connected cars, artificial intelligence, and data centers make it a top stock for some of the most exciting tech around.Two other things to watch in 2017 are the new gaming consoles expected to launch at Nintendo and  (NASDAQ: MSFT) . Switch is meant to be a hybrid between a console and portable gaming system and will replace Nintendo's older systems like the Wii. Microsoft's \"Project Scorpio\" console won't be released until late 2017, and very little has been released about its specifications, but it's almost certainly going to include some VR components.While these two consoles look like wild cards in the gaming industry in 2017, the growth of the industry itself looks solid going into this year.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

NetEase stock has deteriorated further since then: data by  .As is often the case with fast-growing emerging-tech companies, missed revenue expectations caused a sell-off in the NTES ticker after the earnings release. The company actually posted extremely fast top-line growth of 38.1% versus the prior-year quarter, but investors were expecting more, and profit-taking ensued.Regardless of shareholder reaction, each of the company's segments showed healthy expansion during the quarter. For example, the online game services segment, at roughly 71% of total revenue, grew by 26% over the comparable prior-year quarter. Several NetEase gaming titles found traction in Q4, including the company's latest 3D mobile offering,  , which launched in September and quickly became one of the top-grossing games for iPad and iPhone in the China iOS store.While revenue growth remains extremely vigorous, gross profit margin slipped a bit during the last three months, from 67.6% in Q3 2015 to 65% this quarter. Executives cited the increasing role of mobile and licensed games in the company's online portfolio, which carry a lower profit margin than core online titles, for the profit drift.NetEase followed its earnings report five days later with the announcement of a $1 billion share repurchase program, which by board specification must be completed no later than 12 months from Nov. 15, 2016.If you glance at the chart above, you'll notice that if NetEase stock finishes the year where it currently trades, it will end 2016 with a roughly 20% gain.

Also, Glu Mobile  released the Nicki Minaj game to cash in on the holiday fervor.1. Reportedly, Sony's PS4 has sold 50 million units since its launch in Nov 2013, way ahead of 30 million units of Microsoft's  Xbox One sold so far. In fact, media reports add that PS4 has been the \"fastest selling PS console\" with over 10 million units sold from May 2016 to Dec 6, 2016. Sony is facing  in a number of its business segments, but it has been leveraging its games business that has consistently performed well on robust sales of consoles. PS4 leads the way for Sony's gaming division.A few days back,  in a bid to maintain a competitive edge in the video games console market.

It offers additional storage and supports 4K resolution.PS4 is designed to support Sony's PlayStation VR virtual reality headset. Sony also unveiled a sleeker and more energy-efficient PS4 to replace the original fourth-generation PlayStation machine. At present, Sony carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see 2. Sony is also rapidly making inroads into the lucrative mobile gaming space. Reportedly, the company is planning to launch as many as six mobile games based on its popular Playstation franchises. However, in the beginning, the availability of games will be limited to Japan. Details of the rollout in other countries are not yet available. Mobile games started emerging as a lucrative business option as titles like Candy Crush and Angry Birds caught the imagination of the world.As per an Apr 2016 report, research from Newzoo estimates the global games market to grow 6.6% to $118.6 billion in 2019, of which $52.5 billion will come from mobile games. Most video game companies are now focused on expanding their presence in mobile gaming.Most video games are now striving to expand their presence in this space. Activision Blizzard  , which had a limited presence in mobile gaming, snapped up leading mobile games maker King Digital Entertainment for a hefty $5.8 billion price tag. Recently, Nintendo  , Sony's rival, tasted tremendous success with the launch of Pok\u00e9mon Go.Pok\u00e9mon Go solidified Nintendo's position in the lucrative mobile games space, which should help it to sustain the momentum going ahead. Nintendo will launch its highly anticipated title Super Mario Run for iOS on Dec 15.3. Generally video game companies reserve their best titles for release during the holiday season. Recently, Glu Mobile Inc  released its much anticipated celebrity lifestyle game, Nicki Minaj: The Empire. The company's roster of celebrity games is one of its biggest positives.The company is still best known for Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, a freemium game that was released in 2014. Kardashian continues to be a top contributor to Glu's revenues with reportedly $100 million in revenues earned since its release. However, not all celebrity games have been blockbuster successes. For instance, the Katy Perry game bombed badly. So will Nicki Minaj be as successful as Kardashian? Only time can tell. Glu Mobile carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)The following table shows the price movement of the major video game companies over both the past five trading days as well as the last six months:\n  \nOver the last five trading sessions, Activision was up 5.09% while Electronic Arts was down  1.76%.Over the last six-month period, NetEase  surged the most (28.82%). Recently, NetEase reported solid third-quarter 2016 results. The increasing popularity of mobile-based games and the strength of PC games (licensed & self-developed) continue to keep investors interested in the stock.Moreover, higher mobile advertising revenues were an added incentive. NetEase has announced a new $1 billion buyback program for its ADRs over a one-year time frame. The development comes close on the heels of NetEase launching its first VR game, Twilight Pioneers on Google's VR platform, Daydream.Activision was down 1.92% over the same time frame. However, we believe that the increasing digital revenues, strength in Call of Duty title and the super success of its latest franchise, Overwatch should help it in the long run. Plus, the company's efforts at becoming a broad-based media entertainment giant and expansion into e-sports bode well for the future.Want to learn more about video game stocks?

Jefferies analyst Karen Chan upgraded NetEase stock to Buy this morning. She feels that NetEase's mobile gaming unit will bounce back this quarter.Chan feels that this is a good entry point, now that the stock is trading 17% below the all-time high it hit just last month. She's sticking to her $261 price target, an indication that this is a move based more on the opportunity presented by the current valuation than the potential for improving fundamentals. The price goal represents 15% of upside from Friday's close.She isn't the only one that's taking a shine to NetEase stock following the nearly 10% hit it took on Nov. 10, the day after it posted third-quarter results. Brean Capital's Fawne Jiang jumped in right away, sticking to her earlier Buy rating and bumping her stock's price target from $235 to $310.NetEase posted healthy growth in its latest quarter. Revenue soared 38% to $1.381 billion, with growth of at least 23% across each of its three businesses. Earnings grew even faster, climbing 46% to $3.11 per share.Analysts were expecting a smaller profit, something that always seems to be the case at NetEase. However, revenue fell short of market expectations for $1.43 billion in revenue.NetEase's bottom line is a particularly big deal since the Chinese dot-com pays out 25% of its reported profit to its stakeholders in the form of a dividend. This time around it translates into a $0.78 per share distribution.NetEase also took advantage of the stock's initial sell-off following the report to announce a new $1 billion share repurchase plan, another way that it's returning money to its investors. NetEase is good for the money. It closed out the third quarter with $4.8 billion in cash and investments.NetEase has quietly become one of the most rewarding stocks over the past decade, soaring 1,838% -- a 19-bagger -- since being recommended to  subscribers in late 2004. It got there by consistently surpassing Wall Street's quarterly expectations, so the mixed showing earlier this month won't do.The stock is trading at a reasonable 19 times this year's earnings and just 16 times next year's forecast. NetEase is growing a lot faster than those multiples, but there will always be the risk that fickle gamers move on or that the climate for investing in Chinese growth stocks cools. Right now the price seems to offer a good risk/reward proposition, but there's no mistaking that there's a lot of risk and a lot of reward at stake.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and NetEase wasn't one of them!

This caused widespread concern since November is generally one of the biggest months for video game companies given the holiday season shopping rush. Separately,  released its much anticipated iOS game, Super Mario Run this week.1. As per a VentureBeat report,  for the month of November. As per NPD, overall sales plunged 24% year over year to $1.97 billion. In fact, every category witnessed a record drop. Despite the release of Sony's  PlayStation 4 Pro and Nintendo's NES Classic (sold 196K units), hardware sales fell 35% to $723.8 million. Declining sales of Xbox One and PS4 were the main reasons. Tougher year-over-year comparisons marred console software sales, which fell 18% to $955.2 million.Per a NPD analyst, sales in the year-ago period benefited from the super success of Activision Blizzard's  Call of Duty; Black Ops 3, Electronic Arts'  Star Wars Battlefront and Bethesda's Fallout 4. However, this year's top three games, Call of Duty; Infinite Warfare, EA's Battlefield 1 and Nintendo's Pok\u00e9mon Sun didn't make that big an impact. In fact, sales of Infinite Warfare are reportedly down 50% from last year's Black Ops 3 sales. Though nobody expected Infinite Warfare to outsell Black Ops 3 as the former is a relatively less recognized series, a 50% drop was unexpected. Together, the sale of the top three titles was down 43% year over year in November.Further, NPD adds that PC software tanked 28% to $27.5 million and accessories sale was down 6% to $259.8 million. A decrease of 49% in interactive gaming toys accessory spending was the main reason behind dismal accessory sales numbers. The launch of PS4 did not help accessory sales either. Sony DualShock 4 was the highest selling gamepad but sales of gamepads overall were down. Nintendo  is aggressively pushing into the  after remaining aloof so far. Nintendo's much anticipated mobile game, Super Mario Run (SMR) for Apple's AAPL iOS platform released yesterday for $9.99 across 151 countries. The company, reportedly, expects to release an Android version in 2017. The game is free to play for a few levels, following which gamers will have to shell out $10 to download the whole game.Analysts differ in their opinions. Some analysts consider this a hefty price tag especially in \"developing countries\". Also, the game requires an Internet connection. On the other hand, media reports quote another analyst who is bullish on the stock and expects nearly 40% jump in price. Per the analyst, SMR is Nintendo's creation and so it stands to benefit from revenues entirely. This, however, was not the case for Pok\u00e9mon Go. Pok\u00e9mon Go was a super hit but had limited impact on Nintendo's financials as it was created by Niantic in association with Nintendo. Consequently, most of the benefit was netted by Niantic. At present, Nintendo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see The following table shows the price movement of the major video game companies over both the past five trading days as well as the last six months:\n  \nOver the last five trading sessions, Take Two Interactive  was up 6.32% while NetEase  was down 3.29%.Over the last six-month period, Take Two surged the most (34.52%). The company continues to benefit from its popular offerings like GrandTheft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online (though sales are slowing down), along with its other releases like NBA 2K17. In fact, higher sales of the digital version of the games add to the company's margins. The company continues to expect growth in digital revenues driven by higher sale of full game downloads and increases in recurrent consumer spending.Glu Mobile  was down 10.68% over the same time frame due to the underperformance of most of its releases. Its weak third-quarter results were somehow overshadowed by the announcement of a new CEO and acquisition of a majority stake in CrowdStar.Want to learn more about video game stocks?

Moreover, China's dominant oil and gas producer's total revenue for the three months under consideration fell 4% from the comparable 2015 period to RMB 411.4 billion.

But investing in quality income growers with strong growth catalysts is always a good idea. In fact, many of the holdings in our  have solid long-term growth outlooks. Source: These  aren't just income-paying investments for the New Year, but they're actually growing at an excellent clip, with each boasting multiple catalysts that are sure to drive share prices, and thus yields, further into the stratosphere.Let's take a look at 10 great long-term dividend growth stocks that have solid  and could be good fits for  .These stocks not only pay dividends you can take to the bank, but they're also setting up to outperform the broader market in 2017 and beyond. 1.3% 18.1% (NASDAQ:  ) is one of China's most popular internet portals, operating in several rapidly growing sectors, such as online gaming, email and e-commerce. Considering the size of China's population, and the decades long growth runway represented by hundreds of millions in the middle class going online and participating in its industry leading products, the growth case for NetEase is obvious. Yet, NTES stock trades at an undervalued 14 times forward earnings, less than half that of its industry peers.With the company reporting 38% sales growth in its most recent quarter (higher than its 10-year sales growth of 30%), now could be a great time to buy into this classic \"Growth At A Reasonable Price\" or GARP dividend growth stock. This is especially true given management's strong focus on investing in R&D to develop more games in house, which results in higher margins than when just licensing games from partners such as  (NASDAQ:  ).And speaking of dividends, while the 1.3% yield isn't exactly something to get excited about, the pace of dividend growth certainly is. While NetEase's dividend history is still young, (it started paying a dividend in 2013), over the past three years the payout has grown at 33.2% CAGR.Better yet, with a free cash flow, or FCF  of just 19%, NetEase's dividend is not just safe, it's growing aggressively. And that growth should last for many years to come. 1.5% 8.2% (NYSE:  ) is the third largest U.S. megabank, and was nearly destroyed along with  (NYSE:  ) by terrible risk management during the financial crisis. Under the inspired leadership of new CEO Brian Moynihan, however, BofA has done a complete 180. It's sold off risky and underperforming divisions, cutting costs by billions per year in the process.Better yet, along with this conservative corporate culture, comes a fortress like balance sheet, which has so impressed banking regulators that they have signed off on Bank of America returning massive amounts of cash to shareholders. This includes a dividend that has grown 650% in the last two years, and is likely to continue soaring in the future.That's due to three likely growth catalysts. First, management continues to work hard to make the bank as lean as possible. In fact, Bank of America expects to cut costs by another $3 billion over the next two years. Second, Bank of America is better situated than any other bank when it comes to profiting from rising interest rates. For example, each 1% rates rise will mean  in additional net income, representing more than a 30% increase over the bank's trailing 12-month profit. And thanks to President-elect Donald Trump's call for fiscal stimulus in the form of massive tax cuts and up to $1 trillion in infrastructure spending, interest rates have already soared by over  since Nov. 8 (learn more about  ).This is because the markets are pricing in the likely higher economic growth, as well as higher inflation such stimulus will likely cause. This, along with the Federal Reserve's planned three rate hikes through the end of 2017, should really help turbocharge Bank of America's profits. Finally, the potential for a repeal of certain onerous aspects to the Dodd-Frank banking regulations passed after the financial crisis has the potential to help Bank of America's bottom line even more. Now, keep in mind that this doesn't mean that management is suddenly going to return to the highly levered, casino gambling days of the past.Mr. Moynihan's dedication to solid, safe, core banking will see to that. However, the combined tailwinds of rising rates, lower regulatory costs, and a stronger economy (which will help increase loan demand, and keep default rates low), could make 2017 a banner year for most banks, but Bank Of America in particular. 1.7% 15.4% (NASDAQ:  ) is one of those blue-chip dividend growers that continues to fire on all cylinders, and yet the market has sent shares down about 9% over the past year. That's despite the company reporting a record breaking year in sales, earnings and margins, including FCF/share that soared 30%.This allowed the company to reward shareholders with a second straight year of 25% dividend growth, yet still lowering its forward FCF payout ratio to a highly secure 47%. And thanks to founder and CEO Howard Schultz's visionary growth plans for the company, long-term dividend growth investors can likely expect many more years of similarly excellent results. In other words, Starbucks is hands down  , and a true \"buy and hold\" stock.The keys to Starbucks' future growth stem from three things. First, management continues to focus strongly on innovation, both in terms of incorporating technology such as its massively successful loyalty rewards app, as well as partnerships with other tech innovators such as  . Second, the company continues to offer new, and higher-end concepts, such as Teavana and its new Roastery upscale stores, which serve as laboratories for new product ideas that can be rolled out across its more than  (and growing at around 10% a year) locations in 75 nations across the globe.This combination of new products, and better customer service (via its app that allows customers to order online and pick up at the store, avoiding lines entirely), helps to improve customer satisfaction and drive some of the highest same store sales, or comps, growth in the industry. And Starbucks is expanding both its revenues and margins at double-digit rates through a combination of international expansion (doubling its China store count to 5,000 over the next five years) and via growth in its channel development segment.This is Starbucks' highly successful and fast growing push into sales of K-cups and premium coffees via grocery channels, and the gross margins are double that of its stores. Combined with a stronger emphasis on franchising future store openings, (which is a lower capital costing, and higher FCF margin business model), Starbucks should be able to continue boosting its FCF margin over time.Add to this an accelerating rate of buybacks (due to the stock's undervaluation), and you have the perfect formula for continued FCF/share growth that should allow exceptional dividend growth for decades to come. With shares now offering the highest dividend yield in the company's history, today could be a great time to consider a position in this dominant coffee shop blue chip. 2.1% 13.1% (NYSE:  ) is another name that everyone knows, and that has made countless long-term investors massively rich (see my thesis  ). But what many don't realize is that Home Depot has all the makings of a dividend growth champion, and true \"buy and hold forever\" core holding. The secret to the company's ongoing success stems from three things. First, it has focused on building massive brand equity by becoming the one stop shop for all of a consumer's home improvement needs, including best in industry customer service and educational outreach. This has allowed it to develop a wide moat with commensurate pricing power.Thanks to its enormous economies of scale, however, and a corporate culture obsessed with innovation and efficiency, the company's massive distribution network has been honed to an ultra-efficient edge allowing for incredible returns on invested capital (while still passing on savings to consumers to maintain market share and loyalty) of 19% over the past five years.The second growth catalyst is Home Depot's huge potential tailwinds from two big factors. First the U.S. housing market, though having turned a corner after the financial crisis, is still far from recovering,  . In other words, due to the shock of the Great Recession, many young people who would be starting households and buying new homes (thus increasing demand for new construction) are choosing to rent.This has led to rent prices soaring far faster than inflation and - if the economy continues to recover in 2017 and 2018 - should eventually reverse itself as more prosperous millennials end up eventually starting new households and buying homes. In other words, the housing recovery is still early and represents a megatrend that could spur strong Home Depot sales growth for years to come. That's especially true since the company recently purchased Interline in order to break into the $50 billion professional construction market, of which is has less than 5% market share.Combined these two major factors (massive, and improving pricing power driving ever higher margins and a recovery in housing), with the company's impressive capital return program, and you have the makings of continued market crushing total returns. Specifically, Home Depot has been one of the most aggressive share count reducers in the market, buying back 6.1% of shares annually for the past five years. This has helped to drive FCF/share growth of 22.8% CAGR since the great recession.Better yet, management has shown itself committed to converting that FCF/share growth into some of the best dividend growth of any U.S. company. For example, Home Depot's 20-year dividend growth has been an astonishing 22.6% CAGR. In recent years this has actually accelerated, with one- and three-year payout growth of 25.5% and 26.7%, respectively.And with a FCF payout ratio over the past year in the mid-30% range, Home Depot still has a long dividend growth runway to help drive impressive income growth and market thumping total returns for many years to come. 2.4% 11.2%With more than 650,000 clients,  (NASDAQ:  ) is America's largest payroll servicer and benefits administrator. In other words, ADP is the largest, and often the most cost effective way of outsourcing many of a company's HR needs. And since Automatic Data earns net interest income on the short-term cash it hold before paying out wages to a client's employees (the equivalent of an insurance company's float), ADP stands to benefit very handsomely from rising interest rates.That's because the business model requires it to invest its float into risk free bonds, ie U.S. Treasury bonds. As the yields on those bonds rise over time, ADP's growing client base (due to a stronger job market) will mean exponentially more net interest income that will fall directly to the bottom line.That in turn will mean strong growth in free cash flow for this  which combined with the company's historic net buyback rate of 1.9%, should mean continued 7% to 8% dividend growth. Which should convert to long-term total returns of 9.5% to 10.5% and risk-adjusted total returns of about 12.7% CAGR.Given that the market's historical total return has been  CAGR since 1871, you can see that ADP represents a low-risk, blue-chip name that can still deliver very solid income growth and superior returns over time - especially in a rising interest rate environment. 2.8% 14.7% (NYSE:  ) is America's second largest diversified insurance provider, with a presence in numerous countries. However, the majority of its sales come from offering annuities, life insurance, retirement planning and asset management services in the U.S. and Japan.Like all insurance companies, Prudential invests its float (premiums paid upfront but not yet paid out as claims) into low-risk investments. In a low-rate environment such as we've had since the financial crisis this has resulted in a challenging growth environment.Management has managed to do a good job growing through expanding its non-insurance product lines and disciplined acquisitions. In fact, sales have doubled since the financial crisis, and the gross margin is up 150%. Prudential has been a solid dividend grower, with 12.1% CAGR payout growth over the past decade. The most recent increase of 12.4%, along with a low payout ratio of 26% indicates that there is plenty of dividend growth runway left, especially thanks to two beneficial potential tailwinds.First, rising interest rates, again a result of the Fed's tightening policy and the likely Trump stimulus, would be immensely accretive to per-share earnings. Second, Trump's transition team has indicated that it wants to roll back certain Dodd-Frank provisions, including those that specify which non-banking companies are considered Strategically Important Financial Institutions, or SIFIs.Such regulatory changes, while not necessary to make a strong bullish case for Prudential, would certainly help boost overall profitability, due to lower minimum capital requirements that currently act as a competitive disadvantage for the company. Combined with management's slow and steady dividend buyback policy, a gradual shift into higher growth international markets, Prudential should have no problem delivering double digit dividend growth for many years to come. That could result in strong 12% to 15% total returns, and perhaps much higher in 2017 and 2018 as the market may start to give shares a premium to tangible book value, rather than the current 25% discount. 3.9% 22.2% (NYSE:  ) is one of my favorite midstream Master Limited Partnerships,  . The specific investment opportunity is twofold. Shell Midstream's business model is cash rich, and largely independent of  .  (NYSE:  ), which serves as sponsor, general partner and management for the MLP, sells it pipelines it needs to operate its business.These assets come with long-term, fixed-fee contracts that ensure consistent and safe cash flow, backed by the third largest publicly traded oil company on earth. The cash flow is used to provide a fast growing distribution (tax deferred form of dividend), which is among the fastest growing in the industry;  CAGR since its IPO in early 2015 including the most recent quarterly payout hike of 28.8%.Shell Midstream is one of those great, cash rich businesses with a long growth runway, but also comes with a potential extra capital gain kicker. In essence, thanks to surprise dividend cuts from pipeline operators such as  (NYSE:  ), whose massive debt loads resulted in it having to divert distributable cash flow (what funds the payout), away from dividends and towards debt repayment, midstream MLPs usually trade along with oil prices.Now the actual distribution safety isn't affected by energy prices, and for MLPs like Shell Midstream with strong balance sheets, there is little risk to the distribution. However, should oil prices begin their inevitable, if highly unpredictable recovery in 2017 or 2018, then Shell Midstream's unit price is likely to move higher.Even if it doesn't, its sponsor's $3 billion in North America midstream infrastructure is more than enough growth runway to keep the highly secure payout (cash flow covers the distribution 1.4 fold, and anything above 1.1 is considered safe) growing at a quick clip.Which makes the current unit price, with its near-4% yield, and a payout that's likely to continue growing at 25% or so through 2020, one of the more interesting dividend growth opportunities available today, courtesy of the worst oil crash in more than 50 years. 4.7% 38.3%Like Shell Midstream Partners,  (NYSE:  ) is a fast-growing midstream MLP that has been hammered by the collapse of energy prices, despite it having little effect on its cash flow. With  (NYSE:  ), America's largest independent refiner and one of Warren Buffett's  , acting as its general partner and sponsor, the MLP has meaningful growth runway ahead of it. That's because Phillips 66 is making a giant push into diversifying its operations, with  in midstream investment planned over the next few years.Thanks to the symbiotic relationship with its MLP, Phillips 66 can offset these investment costs by selling, or dropping down, these assets to Phillips 66 Partners. Each sale comes with long-term, fixed fee contracts with minimum volume commitments, guaranteeing the MLP excellent cash flow predictability and a highly secure payout.And since Phillips 66 owns a majority position in Phillips 66 Partners, as well as the lucrative incentive distribution rights, it gets to keep a large cut of that cash flow, whose upfront investment cost is raised from debt and equity investors. Meanwhile the massive growth in cash rich assets means that the MLP's distributable cash flow, or DCF ( MLP version of free cash flow) is growing like a weed, up 58% year-over-year in the most recent quarter.With a forward yield of almost 5%, and a growth runway that will likely take a decade to journey down, even if oil prices don't recover investors in Phillips 66 Partners are likely to do phenomenally well. However, since oil prices of $46 per barrel are unsustainable in the long-term, when energy prices do finally recover, likely in 2017 or 2018, Phillips 66 Partners is likely to get a major unit price boost as well.Which makes this high-yield hyper growth (last payout increase was 24% YOY) midstream MLP, like Shell Midstream Partners, one of the potentially more appealing long-term income growth opportunities available in today's market. 4.8% 56.3% (NYSE:  ) is the ultimate in diversified global utilities, owning 40 wide moat cash producing assets spanning six continents, including the following: 17,000 km of natural gas pipelines; 13,900 km of electrical transmission lines in North and South America; 2.6 million electrical and gas connections in the U.K.; 33 ports in North America, the U.K. and Europe; 7,000 cell towers, 5,000 km of fiber optic lines in France; 16 toll roads in South America and India; the largest coal port in Australia; and Australian and South America railroads.The LP's growth model is simple. Its sponsor, manager and general partner  (NYSE:  ), which has over 115 years of experience and $250 billion in assets under management, finds it attractively priced global utility, or infrastructure assets to invest in, and BIP raises debt and equity capital from investors to take a stake in the deals.In just the last quarter BIP closed on three deals totaling  including two dozen Australian ports, Peruvian toll roads and North American gas storage assets. Management expects these investments to generate about 9% annual cash yields, making them highly accretive to adjusted funds from operations per share (what funds the fast growing distribution), which is up  year-to-date.Better yet, with another $1.4 billion in new deals currently in the process of closing, and $2.3 billion in organic (existing asset) expansion projects planned, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners is well on its way to hitting its management's long-term payout growth target of 7% per year, and generating annual total returns of 12% to 15%.And thanks to its low AFFO payout ratio of just 71.6% YTD, and globally diversified cash flow that are 90% regulated, or supported by long-term contracts, investors can rest assured that Brookfield Infrastructure's generous payout is reasonably secure. 6.3% 30% (NASDAQ:  ) is a yieldCo (a pass-through entity structured like a REIT, BDC or MLP for tax reasons, that must pay out almost all its cash flow to investors as dividends) sponsored by  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ).These are the two largest, and more importantly, among the few consistently profitable U.S. solar companies. Like an MLP, both companies finance large, utility scale solar projects, then once they have secured a 20-to-30 year power purchase agreement, or PPA, with some of the largest utilities in America, sell that project to 8Point3 to recoup the construction costs.In exchange for raising the debt and equity capital to purchase these projects 8Point3 gains cash flow that's practically guaranteed for decades. This is where the partnership's cash available for distribution, or CAFD, comes from, and is the equivalent to a REIT's AFFO, an MLP's DCF, or a BDC's NII. 8Point3's goal is to grow its distribution by 12% to 15% per year, in the form of quarterly 3.5% payout increases.There are two major bullish catalysts that make 8Point3 Energy Partners (named after how long it takes sunlight to reach earth) one of the more intriguing potential long-term utility investments.First, thanks to the recent increase in long-term interest rates, as well as the election of a President that many fear will be hostile to the solar industry (possibly an overblown concern given that congress recently extended solar tax credits through 2019), this pure play solar utility has sold off over 20% since Aug. 1 and could be undervalued.Second, the rise of solar power, both in the U.S. and internationally, (where First Solar and SunPower also operate), is one of the largest megatrends of the 21st century. This could provide a growth runway that is, for all intents and purposes, unlimited.For example, currently 8Point3 Energy Partners has 637 MW of solar power generating capacity, with another 1,132 MW under construction which the yieldCo has the right of first offer from its sponsors. In other words, 8Point3, which has already increased its assets by 50% since IPO-ing, can potentially double its production capacity, and thus its CAFD over just the next two years. Even without acquiring any new assets, 8Point3 Partners has sufficient excess CAFD coverage (a distribution coverage ratio of 1.13) that it could effectively continue raising its distribution every quarter as planned through the end of 2017.Of course in reality, the yieldCo, with its $450 million in available liquidity, is likely to continue growing at a sturdy pace. Especially given that First Solar and SunPower are working on  of solar projects (enough to grow its production capacity by 21.5 fold) that could theoretically be dropped down to the yieldCo. This is why 8Point3 Energy Partners could have a bright growth future.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ast week, Nintendo  announced the release of Super Mario Run on Dec 15, 2016.

Net revenue of $274.9 million topped the consensus mark of $255.3 million and increased 21.5% year over year.Following the strong results, shares were up nearly 2.5% in the after-hours trading session yesterday. SINA along with a consortium of buyers acquired E-House, a prominent Chinese real estate services company on Aug 12, 2016. SINA holds 43% of shares in E-House.Advertising revenues moved up 21% year over year to $233.6 million. The upside was primarily driven by strength in advertising related to Weibo (WB), though it was offset partially by weakness in portal advertising revenues. Non-advertising revenues rose 25.6% year over year to $41.2 million.Weibo  revenues surged 41.8% year over year to $176.9 million. Monthly active users went up 34% year over year to 297 million. Daily active users were 132 million at quarter-end, up 32%. The strong growth momentum of Weibo advertising was driven by increasing adoption of mobile devices (89% of MAUs were mobile users) and improved monetization.Portal revenues were almost flat year over year at $100.9 million. Portal Advertising revenues decreased over 8.8% in the quarter to $79.9 million.Non-GAAP operating margin was 21% compared with 13% reported in the prior-year quarter.SINA exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.21 billion, unchanged from Dec 31, 2015.Cash provided by operating activities in the quarter was $256.1 million. Capex stood at $2.3 million. | SINA has a strong product pipeline and is investing in product development and marketing. The company's robust user base for its e-Commerce and Weibo offerings are positives. In August this year, SINA announced that it will be distributing its Weibo stock to its shareholders on a pro rata basis. SINA has a majority stake (54% or 78% by voting power) in Weibo, which is a microblogging service available in China. Share distribution will reduce SINA's stake in Weibo to 50% or 75% by voting power. SINA will be giving away one Weibo Class A ordinary share to shareholders holding 10 shares of SINA. The move is widely observed as a way to tackle overvaluation of Weibo shares and closing the valuation gap for SINA shareholders.However, the company's business is likely to be impacted by soft macroeconomic conditions in China. Also, significant restrictions on online search and other social-networking activities in the region remain concerns.Moreover, Weibo is expected to face stiff competition from the likes of WeChat in China, which may hurt its user base. We believe that Weibo's monetization ability will be a major driving factor for SINA amid intensifying competition from the likes of Sohu.com Inc.  and NetEase  in the video and brand advertising market.Currently, SINA has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Coming into Wednesday's third-quarter financial report, NetEase investors were looking forward to ongoing gains for the company's financials. However, unlike in recent quarters, NetEase fell short in some respects, and that sent the stock down sharply. Let's look more closely at NetEase and what its latest results say about its prospects going forward.Image source: Getty Images.NetEase's third-quarter results were strong by ordinary standards, but they failed to hold pace with the even higher expectations of the online gaming specialist from its investors. Revenue was up 38% from year-ago levels in terms of local currency, but the dollar-value of that revenue was only $1.38 billion, falling short of the consensus forecast for $1.43 billion. On the bottom line, NetEase did better, posting net income of $410.9 million and working out to earnings of $3.11 per share, greater than the $2.89 per share that investors expected to see.Looking more closely at NetEase's results, many of the same positive aspects of its business kept showing through this quarter, but others weakened somewhat. The strongest source of revenue growth came once again from the email, e-commerce, and other category, where sales more than doubled from year-ago levels. Online game services revenue was up by a relatively small 26%, and advertising services revenue was up by less than a quarter compared to last year's third quarter.NetEase also reversed past declines in gross margin. In the key online gaming segment, margin fell by nearly three percentage points, but that only partially offset a big jump in profitability from email and e-commerce. Overall, gross margin rose slightly to hit 57.7%.CEO William Ding stated his general happiness with the way NetEase performed. \"We maintained steady growth across each of our primary business lines in the third quarter,\" Ding said, \"with a continued focus on providing first-rate games and products to the expanding online market both domestically and abroad.\" The CEO also noted that its new mobile games helped give NetEase a greater presence in the fast-growing mobile market.NetEase also sees plenty of reasons why it can continue to grow even faster. In the words of Ding, \"Ingenuity, quality, and diversification have provided the cornerstones for our competitive edge. As the internet technology industry expands, we will keep pushing the boundaries with new and improved products.\"In particular, NetEase pointed to the success of the new mobile 3D game Onmyoji. The company is one of the top-grossing games in China's iOS app store since its release in early September. Combined with what the company now calls \"classic\" PC-client games and its collaborative efforts with Blizzard Entertainment, video games remain a key source of future growth.Yet NetEase is also happy with how its Kaola.com e-commerce offering is doing. Direct merchandise sales have been the main goal for NetEase with e-commerce, but the company is also looking at ways to build in complementary services that could also boost profits.One slight source of disappointment was that NetEase didn't lift its dividend this quarter. Instead, shareholders will still get $0.78 per depositary share for their quarterly payment, which is unchanged from the second quarter. Moreover, NetEase allowed its share repurchase program to expire, leaving almost three-fifths of the original $500 million authorization unused.NetEase shareholders weren't satisfied with the sales growth the company posted, sending the stock down more than 5% in after-hours trading following the announcement. Nevertheless, if NetEase can continue to post solid growth, its fundamental business prospects look likely to keep improving over time well into the future.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" reported third-quarter 2016 results, wherein both earnings of $1.34 per share and revenues of $917.1 million beat the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.18 per share and $883.7 million.On a year-over-year basis, earnings and revenues grew 20.7% and 9.9%, respectively.

Among 197 industries, three semiconductor subgroups - fabless, manufacturing and equipment - were ranked in the top 10 as of Thursday.A handful of tech-related issues - such as computer software gaming firm  (  ), content delivery provider  (  ) and cloud networking provider  (ANET) - were among recent additions. They've been steady performers for investors.Some banking stocks came out of hibernation and made their way on to top funds' buy list, including  (ZION),  (MS) and  (CFG). Amid rising interest rates, banks will benefit from wider margins on money borrowed from consumers and businesses.One standout worth mentioning is movie streaming giant  (NFLX), which was grabbed by 13 best-performing funds, investing an estimated $345 million in their latest reporting periods.On Oct. 17, Netflix surprised investors with a third-quarter earnings beat and boasted higher-than-expected subscriber growth.

Liquidity level seeks to provide a measure of a company's ability to turn its assets into cash and cash equivalents in order to clear its debt obligations. Companies with favorable liquidity levels often come up with strong business growth and positive price performance.Meanwhile, high liquidity may not always indicate that the company is financially strong. It may also mean that the company is running its business inefficiently. Hence, one should give precedence to a company's efficiency level in addition to its liquidity position. Investing in a favorably placed liquid company with impressive efficiency level may provide strong returns.Liquidity ratios like Current Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio are primarily used to identify companies with strong liquidity. : It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. This ratio is used for measuring a company's potential to meet both short- and long-term debt obligations. Thus, a current ratio - also known as working capital ratio - below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always indicate that the company is in good financial shape. It may also mean that the company has failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1 to 3 is considered to be ideal. : Unlike current ratio, quick ratio - also called \"acid-test ratio\" or \"quick assets ratio\" - indicates a company's ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory excluding current assets relative to current liabilities. Like the current ratio, a quick ratio of greater than 1 is desirable. : This is the most conservative ratio among the three, as it takes into account only cash and cash equivalents, and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company's ability to pay its current debt obligations using the most liquid of assets. Though a cash ratio higher than 1 may point to sound financials, a very high number may indicate inefficiency in using cash.So, a ratio of greater than 1 is always desirable but it may not always underline a company's financial health.In order to avoid selection of inefficient companies, we have added asset utilization, which is a widely used measure of a company's efficiency, as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is a ratio of total sales over the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Since this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be called efficient.In order to ensure that these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential too, we have added our proprietary  to the screen.(While liquidity ratios of greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency)(Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company's efficiency.)(Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through. You can see  .)(Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Style Score of 'A' or 'B' when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 handily beat other stocks.)Just these few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only 16.Here are five stocks from the list: is the recognized world leader in pizza delivery.

Revenues in the quarter were down 21.4% to $410.6 million, primarily due to lower revenues from advertising and online gaming.

Per media reports, Activision Blizzard is planning to create an e-sports league based on its latest franchise Overwatch. Activision CEO was quoted by media reports saying that viewership for e-sports surpasses that of NFL and NBA and as a result the company is working on monetizing this lucrative opportunity.With continued increases in viewership as well as sponsorships and media coverage, e-sports is here to stay. Per research firm Newzoo, it is estimated that revenues from e-sports will grow 43% year over year to $463 million in 2016 and jump to $1.1 billion by 2019. To grab a share of this profitable opportunity, in October last year, Activision formed an exclusive e-sports unit spearheaded by former ESPN CEO Steve Bornstein.In Jan 2016, the company acquired MLG, a leading e-sports player for an estimated $46 million. Founded in 2002, MLG is one of the biggest names in the e-sports arena. Activision has already established Call of Duty World League. Activision carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Image source: Activision BlizzardThe gaming sector has been one of the best performing in the consumer-goods space so far in 2016, driven by new technology and an influx of new content that consumers are giving high ratings to. Content and online gaming stocks such as  (NASDAQ: ATVI) are some of the obvious best gaming companies, though other companies benefiting from this sector -- companies such as  's(NASDAQOTH: TCEHY) Riot Games, or chip companies such as  (NASDAQ: NVDA) -- could all be set for more gains. Here are the best gaming stocks for betting on continued video-game growth.\n  \nData source: Yahoo! FinanceActivision Blizzard has had a great year, and in the most recent quarter it handily beat expectations, with a 112% rise in sales and 315% rise in earnings per share year over year. This rise was due in part to a 13% increase in monthly active users. Activision is one of the top performers in the content-creation space of this market, largely because of its pipeline of new games that players are clearly loving, such as Overwatch, which was released in May and became an instant hit with, more than 7 million players in its first week after launch.Activision has also been incredibly successful with its switch to more in-game purchases and subscription content, which help revenue to stream in long after a title is purchased, making this one of the best online gaming stocks. On the mobile side, Activision bought King Digital, the maker of Candy Crush, in February and has been very successful in integrating this property to expand its mobile and digital presence. In the most recent quarter, digital sales rose to $1.4 billion, up 129% year over year.Activision's largest competitor,  (NASDAQ: EA) , has also produced some winning games as of late, such as its Star Wars Battlefront series, and has shown itself adept at making a play for the online gaming space as well. While EA's sales growth has been less impressive than Activision's -- up just 6% in the most recent quarter year over year -- it still looks as if it has plenty of potential to grow in this space, which is why analysts at Morgan Stanley said in September that both companies look like good bets. To make EA even more attractive, it also trades at nearly half the P/E of Activision.Both Activision and EA are clamoring to make a name for themselves in China, where video-game sales are booming and there are an estimated 700 million mobile users. A good play on this market specifically could be local  (NASDAQ: NTES) . This Chinese internet gaming company also offers many online services, such as email and advertising, but it's a dominating force in the booming gaming space, offering online gaming packs. NetEase also partners with Activision Blizzard to distribute many of its games throughout China. Another Chinese player worth mentioning is Tencent, which acquired the popular Riot Games in 2015. Similar to King Digital, Riot Games has had some major mobile game hits, such as Blitzcrank's Poro Roundup, and is helping Tencent to build out its own niche in the Chinese (and worldwide) gaming market.While much of the gaming focus has moved to mobile or computer desktop play, the original video-game system makers still have much to gain from the number of users of their equipment. However, new systems have proved to be only incrementally better in the most recent models, and it might prove wise to look at what new technology can really move the needle going forward. Virtual reality (VR) could be just that.VR has gotten a lot of attention lately, as companies such as  (NASDAQ: FB) invest in bringing the technology to the mass market. As VR headsets become cheaper and easier to acquire for average gamers, the companies producing this hardware could be set for big gains. Facebook is an interesting choice with its Oculus Rift, since the company also has such a large user base and a track record of online games on its platform performing very well. Of course, Facebook is such a mammoth company that even if its Oculus Rift is very successful, it may only slightly move the needle for Facebook's total sales.Sony's Playstation VR could make it a best gaming stock in the future. Image source: Sony (NYSE: SNE) , on the other hand, is much more dependent on its gaming segment, which now makes up more than 20% of its total revenue, and in the most recent quarter it was the fastest growing division, reporting sales up 14% year over year, compared with a 10% drop companywide. Sony's gaming segment growth is driven by the PlayStation gaming console and equipment, and this segment could make up much of Sony's growth in the years to come. Sony's recently launched VR system, which is used in conjunction with the popular PlayStation 4 console, is already getting great reviews ahead of the holiday season. To be fair, VR is still largely untested as to whether it will drive profits renewed for Sony, but so far the industry buzz looks positive.The content being produced and the hardware it's played on creates a stunning overall experience for players -- but none of that would be possible without the incredibly powerful chips that power those graphics and the code the games run on. One of the best companies to bet on this portion of the gaming market is NVIDIA.NVIDIA has been one of the pioneers in creating chips that can create the fast-moving and intricate visualizations in modern video games, powering games for nearly every major gaming company. NVIDIA also makes chips for the automotive industry's tech growth, and it will be an important voice in virtual reality and even artificial intelligence. NVIDIA stock has gained over 150% in the past 12 months, thanks to its incredible growth in sales and earnings, which were up 24% and 873%, respectively, in the most recent quarter year over year. NVIDIA is not cheap as a result, trading at a P/E of 47, but that price tag seems to be warranted, based on the company's ability to be the premium chipmaker not only for videogame growth but also for some of the most exciting tech growth of the decade.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors!

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  (NASDAQ:  -  ),  (NASDAQ:  -  ),  (NYSE:  -  ),  (NASDAQ:  -  ) and  (NASDAQ:  -  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Consumer sentiment surged substantially in China, according to a private survey in fresh signs that domestic demand has experienced a significant increase. This in keeping with the raft of economic data released recently as well as during last month which indicates that the economy is on a firmer footing than before. This includes encouraging data on retail sales, manufacturing and fixed asset investment.Given these developments, the luster of the world's second largest economy seems to have been restored. Picking select stocks which are poised to gain from a resurgent Chinese economy seems to be a good option at this point.Fresh signs emerged that China's domestic demand was showing resilience. The Westpac MNI China Consumer Sentiment Indicator increased from last month's level of 115.2 to 117.1, its highest level in six months. Most of this increase was attributable to substantial increases in the current household finance and improving durable buying conditions. According to Westpac Banking Group, consumers were ready to pay more for phones, appliances and other technology related products.Meanwhile, Standard Chartered Plc's Small and Medium Enterprise Confidence Index increased from 56 to 56.1 in October. According to market watchers, this was an indication that the labor market was in good health and investor momentum was being sustained. Experts believe that the government will continue to provide a significant level of liquidity and utilize appropriate economic policy to prop up growth over this year.Earlier this month, official data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed that growth had increased for the third successive quarter, by 6.7%. This was in line with the official target for the year. Such a reading has dispelled fears of growth falling under the 6.5% mark. Other economic indicators released recently have been equally encouraging.For instance, the official manufacturing PMI was flat at 50.4 for September. In August, the country's manufacturing activity had touched its best level since October 2014. Fixed asset investment rose from 8.1% to 8.2%, in line with forecasts. Retail sales increased at 10.4% on a year-over-year basis, powered by significantly high online sales.China's government can now focus on reining in some of the support measures which have helped boost economic activity. Attempt to cool down the country's overheated property market seem to be already bearing fruit. New home prices declined by 3.7% in Beijing and also moved lower in Shanghai and Shenzhen.Fresh data indicates that China's economic health has improved significantly. In fact, authorities are likely to utilize such a scenario to undertake structural adjustments which are essential to sustain long term growth prospects.Adding stocks from China may be a prudent option at this time. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.

Yesterday, we had results from Xbox One maker, Microsoft Corp  . Apart from Microsoft's earnings, Nintendo's  Switch was also in the limelight.1.  Microsoft's first quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings of 76 cents and revenues $22.33 billion easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Though gaming is a very small part of the company's business, Xbox is an important aspect of the overall video game industry. Microsoft's gaming revenues fell 4% in constant currency. But, Xbox Live monthly active users grew 21% to 47 million.2. After the blockbuster success of Pok\u00e9mon Go, Nintendo recently launched a new videogame console named Switch. Nintendo has remained tight-lipped about Switch, earlier codenamed NX, for a long time and had revealed minimum details. Yesterday, the Japanese giant provided a 3-minute long video of Switch, which combines the functionalities of both conventional consoles and handheld devices. It will be available from Mar 2017 but the company refrained from providing details on the price tag.Most analysts remain on the sidelines following the video trailer. Analysts observe that Nintendo needs a hit in the form of Switch, following the debacle of its last console Wii U. But the apparent lack of any ground-breaking/differentiating features from the consoles that are available in the markets right now could cost Nintendo heavily. Nintendo carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).3. Per media reports, Sony Corp  is likely to up its ante in the mobile game space with the launch of as many as five games by Mar 2018.The games are likely to be based on the Japanese giant's famous PlayStation franchises like The Last Guardian, I.Q.: Intelligent Qube and Hot Shots Golf. Reports further added that Sony plans to launch the games first in Japan on both iOS and Android platform through its subsidiary, ForwardWorks.There aren't any details available on the company's international roll out of these games.

However, there is no official word on the matter from the tech behemoth.Speculations of the launch of a refreshed Mac lineup have been doing the rounds for quite some time now. The launch of MacOS Sierra last month without any devices that use the operating system made the rumor mills work overtime. Plus, Apple has rescheduled its earnings release (a rare occurrence) to Oct 25, which further increased speculations.Apple is likely to host the Mac event on Oct 27 at its Cupertino headquarters, just a day after Microsoft's  Windows 10 hardware event in New York.For a long time, Apple has refrained from updating Macbook Pro, MacBook Air and iMacs. The company last announced updates (not much significant) to MacBook Pro (both 13-inch and 15-inch models) in early 2015. A major overhaul has been long overdue, which is why most experts have been advising consumers to postpone Mac purchases.Grapevine has it, Apple could unveil a new slimmer MacBook Pro with OLED display with \"customizable touchscreen keys\" to offer users shortcuts to different programs. The new MacBook is likely to feature fingerprint sensor and Siri Support along with USB-C connector.A new 13-inch MacBook Air with USB-C support could also be in the offing. Bloomberg reported that Apple was also working on a new iMac version that has an option for new graphics chips from AMD.The refresh comes at a time when the overall PC markets are witnessing a decline. Per Gartner and IDC, the PC market has been witnessing shipment declines over the past few years and the third quarter of 2016 was no exception. Per Gartner, PC shipments were down 5.7% year over year to 68.9 million units, marking the eighth consecutive quarter of a year-over-year drop, which according to the research firm, is \"the longest duration of decline in the history of the PC industry.\"However, IDC had a little positive tone. Per IDC, shipments came in above expectations and that PC companies had at last started building inventory again to \"update products to leverage new processors and operating systems, to deliver a better computing experience encompassing more mobile, secure, and faster systems, and to accelerate PC replacements.\" Per IDC, PC shipments fell 3.9% year over year to about 68 million units in the third quarter.Nonetheless, both firms agreed on the fact that Apple continues to witness a decline in shipments. We believe that this could be due to multiple factors like anticipation of updated Macs and cannibalization of its product categories rather than actual market share loss. We believe sales of Macs could witness a spurt following the launch of new models. Plus, the upcoming holiday season could also add to the sales numbers. | Currently, Apple is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.

This in keeping with the raft of economic data released recently as well as during last month which indicates that the economy is on a firmer footing than before. This includes encouraging data on retail sales, manufacturing and fixed asset investment.Given these developments, the luster of the world's second largest economy seems to have been restored. Picking select stocks which are poised to gain from a resurgent Chinese economy seems to be a good option at this point.Fresh signs emerged that China's domestic demand was showing resilience. The Westpac MNI China Consumer Sentiment Indicator increased from last month's level of 115.2 to 117.1, its highest level in six months. Most of this increase was attributable to substantial increases in the current household finance and improving durable buying conditions. According to Westpac Banking Group, consumers were ready to pay more for phones, appliances and other technology related products.Meanwhile, Standard Chartered Plc's Small and Medium Enterprise Confidence Index increased from 56 to 56.1 in October. According to market watchers, this was an indication that the labor market was in good health and investor momentum was being sustained. Experts believe that the government will continue to provide a significant level of liquidity and utilize appropriate economic policy to prop up growth over this year.Earlier this month, official data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed that growth had increased for the third successive quarter, by 6.7%. This was in line with the official target for the year. Such a reading has dispelled fears of growth falling under the 6.5% mark. Other economic indicators released recently have been equally encouraging.For instance, the official manufacturing PMI was flat at 50.4 for September. In August, the country's manufacturing activity had touched its best level since October 2014. Fixed asset investment rose from 8.1% to 8.2%, in line with forecasts. Retail sales increased at 10.4% on a year-over-year basis, powered by significantly high online sales.China's government can now focus on reining in some of the support measures which have helped boost economic activity. Attempt to cool down the country's overheated property market seem to be already bearing fruit. New home prices declined by 3.7% in Beijing and also moved lower in Shanghai and Shenzhen.Fresh data indicates that China's economic health has improved significantly. In fact, authorities are likely to utilize such a scenario to undertake structural adjustments which are essential to sustain long term growth prospects.Adding stocks from China may be a prudent option at this time.

At Call of Duty XP 2016, thousands of attendees had a chance to play paintball, watch e-sports and get their hands on the new \"Infinite Warfare.\"Besides \"Battlefield,\" EA has a number of series under its belt, including \"The Sims\" and \"Need for Speed,\" plus a slew of sports titles under the Madden, FIFA, NBA and NHL banners.\"Madden NFL 17\" topped the charts in August, said NPD, even though the game wasn't even released until the 23rd of the month. EA shares hit a then-record high that day, and have continued to peck out new highs, briefly reaching 84.50 on Friday.Of the U.S.-based publishers,  (  ) appears to be the trio's laggard here, with investors and gamers both still waiting on a promised new \"Red Dead\" title.\"(Take-Two) shares could remain range-bound in the near-term as investors contemplate the potential drivers behind the deferred announcement, and old concerns around TTWO's control over the development process likely resurface,\" Sebastian wrote this month. in September follow a summer of better-than-expected quarterly earnings reports and well-received games like Activision's \"Overwatch.\"The two primary drivers for game publishers that are prompting solid results are the \"strong console cycle, and ongoing mix shift toward digital revenue,\" Piper Jaffray analyst Mike Olson told Investor's Business Daily.IBD'S TAKE: In console news, the recent unveiling of the PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox One S from  (  ) and  (MSFT), respectively, provide what is called a \"mid-cycle refresh,\" i.e. an improved version of the current generation of consoles. The original PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were both released in 2013.With over 40 million PS4 units sold globally, \"this refresh should help reduce overall console-cycle-related volatility relative to prior iterations, a key positive for publishers, in our view,\" wrote Baird's Sebastian.But it is Microsoft's E3 tease of its next-generation Project Scorpio, which the tech giant is calling \"the most powerful console ever,\" that is changing things up.The hardware's holiday 2017 debut means that the console cycle has effectively been cut in half to just four years, according to Barclay's Merwin.Would a shortened time frame between hardware releases disrupt the publishing business? It doesn't appear that way.Unlike in generations past, console makers are now making their devices forwards- and backwards-compatible, said Merwin, meaning that an Xbox One from 2013 could handle a graphics-heavy game from 2016, and next year's mysterious Project Scorpio won't have any trouble playing a game from several years back.\"At the end of the day, gamers may or may not choose to upgrade their hardware in any given year, but they'll continue to play the few titles they're most engaged with,\" Merwin told IBD, calling it a \"de-emphasis of the hardware cycle.\"Indeed, Olson noted on Sept. 13 that \"while some investors have historically traded these (publisher) stocks around the timing of console cycles,\" he thinks it stands to reason that \"consistent growth will come over the next several years with an ongoing mix shift toward digital revenue driving margins higher.\"Olson's other highlighted driver, digital revenue, includes primarily digital-game downloads and in-game purchases. Both are proving popular. GAAP revenue from digital channels at Activision spiked 101% to a quarterly record of $1.14 billion, said the company in its Q2 release. Its acquisition of King Digital has also brought the ever-popular \"Candy Crush\" under its rubric.\"These new direct-to-consumer digital business models are particularly interesting because they are recurring and higher margin, resulting in structurally improved profitability,\" wrote Jefferies analyst Brian Pitz about Activision on Tuesday, following CEO Bobby Kotick's appearance at an investor conference.\"Over time, in-game digital revenue has the potential to be bigger than the core business today,\" Pitz said.In EA's first quarter, over half -- 54% -- of its GAAP revenue was digital.As free-to-play mobile games like \"Pokemon Go\" and \"Candy Crush\" continue to grip everyone's smartphones, microtransactions -- like buying more Poke Balls or super candies in the games -- are becoming de rigeur for gamers who were once used to simply buying a title and being done with the transaction process.\"In general, we're seeing gaming evolve,\" Olson told IBD, adding that mobile gaming was \"certainly a catalyst\" in creating an acceptance of digital add-on purchases in traditional console gaming.\"Over time it could end up resulting in console games being potentially even free to play, meaning entirely dependent on microtransactions,\" he said. \"Mobile gaming has trained the consumer base to accept different ways in which to (access) gaming content.\"That evolution is a potential key to success abroad.\"The Chinese-Asian market in general is challenging due to the free-to-play models that are prevalent in those markets vs. the console focus in North America-Western Europe,\" added Olson via email. \"However, each of the successful (Activision) Blizzard titles have been able to adapt to free-to-play and monetize via micro-transactions.\"In China, EA's FIFA online titles and Activision Blizzard's \"World of Warcraft\" and \"Overwatch\" are the publishers' respective strengths, he said. (The \"Warcraft\" movie notably did very well in the country.)Nevertheless,  (TCEHY) and NetEase have \"about 70% market share of the mobile games market,\" he said, with Riot Games' \"League of Legends\" title commanding a lot of eyeballs there.Shares of  spiked to a new high Sept. 12, on reports that the company intends to spin off its online news unit and focus on its online-gaming efforts. Shares are still burning out new highs, working on a fifth straight monthly advance and well extended, up 39% since clearing a cup-with-handle base at the end of June.\"It's difficult for any U.S. publisher to break into China without a partner, since Tencent and Netease also serve as gatekeepers to the Chinese gamer,\" said Merwin in an email, noting that NetEase distributes Blizzard games and Tencent facilitates Activision Publishing's distribution of \"Call of Duty Online\" and EA's distribution of \"FIFA Online 3\" in the country.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" reported stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 results.

The acquisition is likely to step up its hardware efforts.Nascent Objects calls itself the \"world's first modular consumer electronics platform\" that makes \"product development fast, easy and accessible\". The primary aim of the platform is to reduce costs associated with hardware designing under conventional prototyping methods.Nascent says that its technology works by fusing together hardware design circuitry, 3D printing and modular electronics, thereby cutting down on the time and resources needed for product development. This enables developers \"to go from concept to product in just weeks.\"The concept of \"Modular Electronics\" has existed for some time now but hasn't really caught the fancy of the mainstream. Modular electronics are devices with interchangeable modules for various types of components such as batteries, cameras, and speakers etc. These offer a way to reduce electronic waste by increasing the shelf life of an electronic device. However, an expensive and cumbersome manufacturing process is the biggest impediment to its commercial adoption. One of the most ambitious modular projects,  . Project Ara was directed towards building a modular smartphone. | Facebook is working to boost its hardware efforts. The company set up a DARPA style research facility, Building 8, spearheaded by Regina Dugan, a former Alphabet executive in April this year. Notably, Dugan served as DARPA's director prior to her Alphabet appointment. Recently, it unveiled Area 404, a 22,000 sq feet sprawling hardware research lab at it Menlo Park headquarters to boost \"modeling, prototyping, and failure analysis in-house\".Reportedly, the company will be spending a whopping $6 billion on research this year alone. We believe Facebook will be investing a considerable share of that money on its hardware efforts, given the recent developments.Though it is clear that Nascent Objects will be working with Building 8 but precise details aren't available. Nascent Objects CEO commented that \"we've decided to continue our mission at Facebook and Building 8. We're excited to build products that can open the world to everyone and create on a scale we couldn't have imagined before. People have become used to the idea that with software, you can have whatever you want, whenever you want it. We want to make this happen with hardware - and we think Facebook is the best place to make this a reality.\"Facebook is aiming at fostering better global Internet connectivity. Per media reports, Nascent Objects' technology could boost its ambitious projects, Aquila, ARIES (Antenna Radio Integration for Efficiency in Spectrum) and Terragraph. Aquila is a solar powered drone that will beam Internet from the sky. With ARIES, Facebook is testing ways to bring speedier connectivity in rural areas by using antennas to provide faster Internet coverage on 2G spectrum while Terragraph will boost connectivity in congested urban areas by employing WiGig antennas.Further, these reports add that Facebook could utilize Nascent Objects technology to \"prototype\" its VR headset, Oculus Rift. Plus, it can help Facebook with its Open Compute Project. OCP has been undertaken by Facebook to create the most energy efficient data center that can handle huge data in the most cost effective way. Reportedly, Facebook uses OCP designed servers, storage and switches that have slashed its expenses to a great extent by eliminating the need to buy from outside vendors.Facebook was never intended to be just a social media service. However, this year, Facebook has more than ever clearly highlighted its ambitions of becoming a tech powerhouse. We continue to be impressed with Facebook's efforts to develop cutting edge AI & AR/VR technology.

(NASDAQ: ATVI) blew expectations out of the water in the second quarter, reporting a 112% rise in sales and 315% rise in earnings per share (by non-GAAP measures). This rise was due in part to a 13% increase in monthly active users (MAUs) year over year, as well as the successful launch of its new  game that reached 15 million players for more than half a billion hours of total play time, getting to that milestone faster than any game in the company's history.

Activision is also releasing a diversified stream of new digital games following the acquisition of digital game maker King Digital in February.Another way Activision Blizzard is using its digital focus to drive higher sales is through subscriptions and in-game purchases, such as add-on gaming packs with new characters, settings, or gameplay available for upgrade after the initial standard game has already been purchased. In the most recent quarter, digital sales rose to $1.4 billion, up 129% year over year. A record $1 billion of that was in-game purchases, a rapidly growing sales generator.This focus on digital sales instead of physical games that are shipped or sold in stores is also important for driving higher profitability. Without physical products, these sales are more profitable. During the quarter, operating margin rose to an all-time high of 37%, up from 23% in the prior-year quarter.In late September, Activision Blizzard renewed its deal with Chinese company  (NASDAQ: NTES) , an online gaming giant serving China's nearly 700 million internet users.

Viewership peaked at over 2.1 million for three seconds on Twitter. Moreover, average users spent 22 minutes on the platform. In contrast the CBS and NFL network had a combined average viewership of 15.4 million. Also, the TV broadcast had an audience of 16.4 million at the peak.Twitter definitely lagged way behind as far as the numbers are concerned. Further, per media reports, Twitter is expected to generate $2 to $4 million in revenues from the Jets/Bills games, which is of course unlikely to \"move the needle\" for Twitter.However, we believe that the Jets/Bills games viewership has a little more significance. \"Live streaming\" especially sports is a lucrative opportunity. Though NFL is a onetime deal with only 10 games, it marks Twitter's foray into sports live streaming. Through the deal, the company aims to bring in more users, especially millennials. At the same time, it also intends to help marketers reach the younger demographic through its Amplify program. The company has collaborated with the likes of Anheuser-Busch InBev, Nestl\u00e9, Sony Pictures, and Verizon for ad packages for NFL games.If Twitter manages to gain decent viewership for the remainder of the games, anlaysts observe that it is likely that NFL and Twitter will join forces again in the future. Anlayts further add that the increase in viewership will also bode well for other extremely popular NHL, NBA and MLB games that Twitter will be live streaming in the near future. These deals are Twitter's way of attracting more users and advertisers to its platform. Twitter just has 313 million users whereas the world's largest social media service Facebook Inc.  boasts 1.7 billion users. Even the photo sharing app, Instagram has half a billion users.Twitter is making some changes to its platform to make it more user friendly. Recently, the company announced that has it has now changed the way it counts 140 characters by doing away with calculating media attachments and @names in the count, enabling users to express more in tweets.We have to add that focusing on \"live\" and changes to its platform, though heading the right direction, haven't had a favorable impact on its financial performance yet. This isn't a good sign because investors are losing patience. Twitter has been in trouble for long now. Shares have tanked over 34% in the past one year and are trading way below its IPO price of $25.94.In fact, Twitter's elusive turnaround has many questioning the standalone status of the company. Buyout rumors have been plenty this year.

Shares of the Chinese online gaming giant hit another all-time high yesterday, and that follows an 11.7% surge last week.Last week's pop was fueled by a  report, suggesting that NetEase is considering spinning off its online news portal or selling it outright. Sources are telling Bloomberg that NetEase could raise roughly $300 million in the process, but they also say that the spinoff is still in the planning stage and that NetEase is just exploring talks with possible buyers of the dot-com darling's news operations. NetEase naturally didn't comment on the speculation.The move to raise $300 million through a U.S. offering could prove challenging. The U.S. tech IPO market has cooled considerably this year, and the climate isn't any kinder for Chinese growth stocks.  (NASDAQ: SOHU) was able to spin off its online gaming business seven years ago without a problem, but this isn't 2009 when Chinese growth stocks were hot tickets.NetEase and Sohu were among the first Chinese internet stocks to go public. Their businesses initially consisted of online portals and offering premium mobile value-added services. They both rolled out internet-based PC gaming businesses after the dot-com bubble popped and telcos began regulating third-party providers of mobile value-added services.Sohu spun off its gaming arm to focus on its portal and search engine business. If Bloomberg's sources are right, NetEase would be spinning off its news platform to throw more of its weight behind its thriving online gaming operations.NetEase has quietly become one of the hottest stocks over the past decade. It has soared 2,000% -- a 21-bagger -- since being recommended to  subscribers in late 2004.The company is earning those gains by consistently beating Wall Street expectations. It had another better-than-expected showing last month with revenue soaring 96% higher since the prior year's second quarter. Earnings also nearly doubled.Last week's pop was hopefully about more than that just the rumored spinoff. A stock doesn't tack on more than $3 billion in market cap just because it's clearing $300 million in unloading what has become a non-core asset. Momentum also likely played a starring role in the surge. NetEase has become a reliable growth stock. It even shells out a decent quarterly dividend, something that is rate among internet growth stocks and even harder to find in Chinese dot-com darlings. The spinoff or outright sale of its news operations isn't as big a story as the consistent success that NetEase has had in online gaming, and that's what is ultimately driving the stock to new highs and market-thumping returns.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Reportedly, Facebook has collaborated with the likes of PayPal, Visa MasterCard and American Express and others for the bot payment feature.Marcus added that revenue contribution from Messenger will continue to be insignificant in the near term. However, Facebook is working on a long-term strategy to monetize the platform and it involves extension of Facebook newsfeed to Messenger. Marcus while talking to CNBC said \"There's no better product we think than Facebook newsfeed to start creating intent, but when you need to complete that intent and start creating a relationship between you, the brand and your customers, we believe Messenger is the best place to do that.\"For Facebook, its subsidiaries Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp and Oculus are extremely prized possessions.

With NFL, the company hopes to bring in more users and at the same time help marketers reach a younger demographic, mostly millennials, through its Amplify program. At its last , Twitter said that online video budgets are over $10 billion alone in the U.S and streaming deals will fuel a \"long-term shift away from desktop video to premium mobile environments and we believe Twitter is well positioned to benefit from that shift.\" The company has collaborated with the likes of Anheuser-Busch InBev, Nestl\u00e9, Sony Pictures, and Verizon for ad packages for NFL games that will be streamed this month.Apart from NFL, it has collaborated with NBA and Major League Soccer, NHL. It has also signed a deal with 120 sports and Pac-12 networks to stream collegiate sports events. | Twitter remains in trouble with its shares down over 33% in the past one year. Last week's board meeting also did little to boost shaken investor confidence. Investors were hoping that the meeting would result in some concrete plan for a sale or a turnaround. But it appears that management under the leadership of Jack Dorsey has refrained from arriving at a decision just yet and has instead bargained for some more time to \"turn things around\" so that it can stay independent.At present, Twitter carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The new range of iPhone will be available in stores on Sep 16 at a price of $649. Shares of Apple closed 3.6% higher yesterday at $111.83 and hit a 9-month high.Even prior to Apple's statement, Wall Street was abuzz with the news of iPhone 7 preorders hitting the roof, given encouraging iPhone 7 sales data from three carrier services in the United States, T-Mobile, Sprint and AT&T.Per media reports, T-Mobile said that preorders for the latest iPhone have not only shattered all records but are up fourfold compared with iPhone 6 and 6S preorders. Even Sprint gave a more or less similar report, citing a 375% surge in demand for the new phones over iPhone 6. However, reportedly, Verizon, the largest carrier service in the United States, said that preorders were in the normal range.Apple released its newest mobile device last week amid much fanfare. For long, analysts expected the launch of iPhone 7 to boost Apple's revenues. The company has witnessed muted demand for its flagship product in the last two quarters given the macroeconomic turmoil. However, during the \"turmoil\", its share price, despite falling to the $90s, bounced back to $111. Year-to-date, its shares are up 4.2%.We believe iPhone sales should prove to be a near-term catalyst for the share price. Though iPhone 7 doesn't exactly have ecstatic reviews, Apple stands to benefit from the iPhone 7 upgrade cycle, which should boost its share price further.There are many factors that could contribute to higher iPhone 7 sales. Though the new phone cannot exactly be called a revolutionary product, it is definitely an \"incremental upgrade\" from iPhone 6. iPhone 7 looks similar to iPhone 6 but has  and comes in a new \" jet black\" color in addition to black, gold and rose gold. Apple's loyal fan base is something we can count on to aid the rescue effort.Plus, research reports indicate that people generally upgrade to a new mobile device once every two years. The company banks on this trend and rolls out its biggest updates every two years. Therefore, now is a good time for iPhone 6 users to get an upgraded device. However, Apple made a smart move last year, when, along with the launch of iPhone 6s, it initiated an upgrade plan (allowing users the ease to upgrade their existing iPhone every year). This implies that a significant number of iPhone 6s users will also be upgrading their existing handsets. Moreover, the company also provides scope for an early upgrade to those who have been using their existing devices for six months but haven't completed a year yet.Moreover, analysts observe that Apple's decision to keep the ASP of the unit at the higher end will ensure robust gross margins and maintain its competitive edge in the market. Also, the upcoming holiday season should boost sales.Further, analysts point out that Samsung's troubles will help the sale of iPhone 7. Samsung and Apple are the two biggest names in the smartphone market. However, the Korean giant recently had to recall 2.5 million Samsung Galaxy Note 7 devices due to defective batteries.However, there are many who believe that the iPhone 7 cycle might get impacted because of the highly anticipated iPhone 8. Per rumors, Apple is planning to launch iPhone 8 next year on the 10 th anniversary of the first iPhone. The new iPhone, reportedly, will have unbelievable features including a glass body, a dual curved edge-to-edge OLED display with a built-in Touch ID sensor, wireless charging and so on. Analysts feel that many buyers could hold on to their current devices a little longer. | However, Apple will refrain from reporting first weekend sales figures as it stated that initial sales numbers will be governed by supply and not demand .Therefore, they are turning out to be a not-so-useful metric for both investors and customers.Currently, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Among other developments, NetEase  is reportedly divesting its news unit while Activision Blizzard  announced the pricing of senior notes.1. As per a VentureBeat report, The NPD Group issued video game sales numbers for the month of August. As per NPD, sales of new game-related products grew 1% to $573.4 million driven by Xbox One Sand new game releases from Electronic Arts and Square Enix. Hardware sales are down 6% to $178.1 million whereas console software sales increased 8% to $273.7 million.Sales of Microsoft's  Xbox One beat the likes of Sony's PS4 and Nintendo's 3DS. Release of Xbox One S caused a 37% jump in unit sales and for 3DS, unit spending was up 83% driven by the Pok\u00e9mon Go craze. However, higher sales of Xbox One S and 3DS couldn't offset the fall in sales of PS4 and other older consoles, resulting in an overall decline for the segment.On the other hand, console software sales grew mainly driven by releases of titles like Madden NFL, No Man's Sky and Deus Ex. However, Madden 17, despite being the highest selling title saw its sales fall 3% compared with NFL 16 released in Aug 2015. Take Two Interactive's  Grand Auto Theft V and Activision Blizzard's Overwatch occupied the fourth and fifth spots on the list of highest selling titles for the months. PC game software grew 18% to $14.2 million year over year.The sale of accessories also fell 5% year over year to $107 million. An increase of 10% in interactive gaming toys accessory spending was not enough to battle the 6% decline in sales for gamecards and gamepads and another 3% decline in sale of headsets/headphones. New white Xbox One S Controller was the highest selling gamepad with over 79,000 units sold.2. Nintendo will be launching a new accessory today for Pok\u00e9mon Go called Pok\u00e9mon Go Plus. Prized at $35, the accessory will help to count steps even if the game app is running in the background on the phone. At present, if a user switches to a different tab while playing the game, he is not \"accruing the vital walking distance needed to power up Pok\u00e9mon\". A Business Insider report quoted Niantic CEO saying \"the point of Pok\u00e9mon Go is to encourage people to explore the real world and make friends. Removing the need to pay attention to your phone's screen to play the most tedious parts of the game seems like a big step toward that goal - which is also why the game is coming to the Apple Watch, too\". Pok\u00e9mon Go has become a worldwide craze since its release. The game has earned over $440 million in less than two months of its release. Nintendo carries a Zacks Rank#3 (Hold).

NetEase has been in the news as it was widely anticipated that the Chinese gaming company will divest its news unit to focus on its gaming business. Plus, recently the company reported strong second-quarter 2016 results. The increasing popularity of mobile-based games and the strength of PC games (licensed & self-developed) continue to keep investors interested in the stock. Moreover, growing mobile advertising revenues were an added incentive.Glu Mobile was down 27.54% over the same time frame due to the underperformance of most of its releases. Also, the company downgraded its guidance for 2016. But its significant share repurchase authorization and the much anticipated Taylor Swift game keep hopes alive. It recently purchased Poke Radar.

The photo was taken down as Facebook has a strict monitoring policy for posts that violate its community standards by promoting child pornography, nudity or sexual exploitation.However, in this case, media/politicians observed that Facebook's strict standards somewhat undermined the historical importance of the image. As a mark of solidarity with the protests, Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg also posted the picture, which was again taken down. Subsequently, Solberg accused Facebook of trying to \"edit\" history and stated on her Facebook account that \"I want my children and other children to grow up in a society where history is taught as it was, where they can learn from historical events and mistakes.\"Talking to Reuters, Solberg further added that \"they must see the difference between editing out child pornography and editing out history. It's perfectly possible for a company like Facebook to sort this out. Otherwise we risk more censorship.\"Following the widespread flak, Facebook backtracked on its decision. Per media reports, the company has issued a statement saying \"An image of a naked child would normally be presumed to violate our Community Standards, and in some countries might even qualify as child pornography. In this case, we recognize the history and global importance of this image in documenting a particular moment in time. Because of its status as an iconic image of historical importance, the value of permitting sharing outweighs the value of protecting the community by removal, so we have decided to reinstate the image on Facebook where we are aware it has been removed.\" | Facebook has been courting controversy for a while now, given its somewhat obscure rules on censorship. Earlier this year, Facebook chose not to take down a video of an African American, Philando Castile bleeding to death after being shot by a white policeman. The video was streamed by his fianc\u00e9e on Facebook Live. The death of Castile and a few other such incidents resulted in a week of violent protests across the U.S and brought issues of racial intolerance into focus.Again, things took a nasty turn in Dallas when a sniper by the name of Micah Xavier Johnson, a war veteran who reportedly acted alone, shot dead five policemen and grievously injured another two. This time, an eyewitness, Michael Bautista live streamed the incident on Facebook Live.The disturbing and graphic video uploads on a public platform raised critical questions, prompting Facebook to issue a statement. The company said that in case of sensitive videos like those mentioned above \"context and degree are everything. For instance, if a person witnessed a shooting, and used Facebook Live to raise awareness or find the shooter, we would allow it. However, if someone shared the same video to mock the victim or celebrate the shooting, we would remove the video.\"The company's own inconsistency at monitoring posts is baffling. The Vietnam War photo reflects the horror of wars and in no way can it be considered as \"promoting\" child pornography/nudity.We believe Facebook has to bring more consistency to its review policy. Curbing freedom of expression or undermining democracy is something that users won't be very forgiving about. And for a company like Facebook, which thrives on users and engagement levels, loss of this key metric does not bode well for its financial performance. With over 1.7 billion users, Facebook remains the biggest social media service.At present, Facebook sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

You could spend hours searching ticker after ticker, only to find companies which aren't worthy of your hard earned cash. An easier way to navigate through this is by using  . Screening helps investors narrow down companies to invest in based on their ability to meet every criteria selected. Any company who misses even one of the criteria requirements will be filtered out.This lets one easily choose ideal metrics. Screens are effective because they sift out bad stocks and only keep the cream of the crop in. It isn't always easy to create an effective screen. Our  have helped with this, bringing profits to many investors over time. Our predefined criteria are chosen carefully to capture special kinds of companies. using one of our premium screens known as \"EPS Growth, Revisions, & Positive Surprises\". Some of the metrics of this screen requires a stock to have an average trading volume of at least 100,000 shares over the last 20 days, a positive EPS surprise last quarter, and positive EPS growth last year. In addition to using the metrics on this great screen, I've added an additional metric which I feel is appropriate for finding cheaper stocks.I screened for stocks with a PEG under one. This will allow us to find companies that may be undervalued relative to their expected earnings growth over the next three to five years. Let's see what our modified premium screen has found for us today.Silicon Motion focuses on making and marketing universally compatible and low-power semiconductor solutions for the multimedia consumer electronics market. They develop NAND flash controller ICs for solid-state storage drives and also make specialty RF ICs for mobile devices. SIMO has earned a \"B\" for growth, and it also has a PEG of 0.92. A PEG under 1 may suggest that there is value present.Silicon has traits which are desirable for any growth candidate. For starters, the corporation has consistently posted high gross margin levels. Over the last few years, gross margin has been in a range close to 50%. The company's net margin of 18.29% is impressive, and net income grew by over 36% last year. Sales grew by about 25% last year, and 2016 is forecasted to see even more growth, with revenues projected to increase by 45.61%.Analysts have unanimously raised their estimates upwards for the current quarter, current year, and next year over the last two months. Two analysts revised estimates in the last 60 days, and this has brought the current quarter EPS consensus up from $0.60 to $0.74. Our current year consensus estimate has also seen notable improvements over the last two months, going from $2.31 to $2.77. SIMO has beaten our EPS consensus estimate in three of the last four quarters, and it has a strong chance of topping our estimate when it releases its next quarterly earnings in late October. | Stamps.com is a company which provides online services for mailing or shipping letters, packages, or parcels anywhere in the US at any time. Their platform makes it easy for customers to select a carrier, print postage or shipping labels, schedule a pick-up, and track packages. STMP is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and it has a market cap of $1.61 billion.With a current ratio of 2.28, it is clear to see that Stamps has a good amount of liquidity. The company's earnings are projected to grow by 61.24% this year, and STMP outpaces the industry's expected earnings growth of 10.81% by a wide margin. Stamps looks to grow its top line significantly, with sales forecasted to increase by 55.97% this year. This is great because Stamps didn't see the same level of revenues growth last year (45.5%).Stamps trades at a forward PE and PEG of 17.06 and 0.85 respectively. It trades at a reasonable earnings multiple, and it is not too leveraged by any means, as it has a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.45. Stamps.com has beaten our EPS consensus estimate in each of the last four quarters. Just last quarter, it topped earnings expectations by a whopping 62.64%. Hopefully the company beats expectations once again when it reports its quarterly earnings in early November. | NetEase develops applications, services, and other technologies for the Internet in China. It offers online gaming services that are developed in-house. It also provides online advertising, community services, entertainment content, and e-mail services. NetEase is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and it has a market cap of $30.67 billion.NetEase's valuation doesn't seem to be too steep since it has a forward PE of 19.36 and a PEG of 0.67. In the last three months, NTES stock has gained 42.8% and over that span of time, our fiscal year EPS consensus estimate has improved, going from $10.50 to $11.95. Over the last three years, NetEase has seen its gross profit nearly double. In fiscal 2016, sales are expected to increase by 55.61%. EPS is forecasted to see a large jump this year as well, with expectations coming in at growth of 52.47%.In the last two months, 2 analysts have revised their quarterly EPS estimates higher, and our consensus estimate for this quarter has improved, going from $2.59 to $3.09. In the same span of time, no analysts have revised their expectations lower. NetEase has a good track record for topping our consensus, and it has beaten our estimates in each of the last four quarters.

For two months the market went absolutely nowhere and volatility was stuck close to all-time lows. But now, summer vacation is over and the volatility index has woken up after markets were spooked about a possible September Fed rate hike.Since the Brexit spike, volatility has been stuck around 12, but the last two days have seen an aggressive spike, pushing the VIX up to 20 early this morning. Traders are starting to get nervous that the Fed might hike rates twice to finish out the year. Recent Fed speak is the cause for the move, as comments on Friday led to a 2% plus selloff.This might seem silly to most investors who think long term. But in reality, the market was due for a pullback and the complacency that we saw over the summer is now making greedy longs a little nervous.So let's say the market stays weak into the Fed and continues lower. Where and what do you buy? Looking at the S&P 500 there are a couple levels that are interesting. The 200-day moving average is sitting at 2058, a spot that everyone will be watching. The 200-day was cracked on the Brexit panic, but was quickly an area of support after the bounce.However, I believe this area could be front run with a couple Fibonacci levels. The halfway back (50%) level drawn from Brexit lows to recent highs is at 2085 and could find support. If not there I will be looking at 2062, the 61.8% level for support. That level would font run the 200-day be a couple handles and force the 200-day buyers to chase when they realized they missed the entry.The levels are important to know, but it's more important to know what to trade when these levels are hit. Below I list four top ranked stocks that should be scooped up when the sellers are panicking. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a recent track record of earnings beats. (  ) is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that is a designer, developer and supplier of analog and digital semiconductor connectivity solutions. The company was founded in 2005, employs over 8,000 people and is headquartered in Singapore.Broadcom is valued at $64 billion and has a forward PE of 17. The stock sports a Zacks Style Score of A in Momentum and pays out a dividend of 1.24%.Early this month the company beat on the top line and had an 11 cent EPS beat, or almost 8%. Despite multiple price upgrades from a variety of analysts the stock sold off. If the stock continues to fall to the 200-day just under $150, the stock must be bought. However, I'm eyeing a trendline and Fib level at $157 for a starter position. is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that develops video compression and image processing semiconductors. The company was founded in 2004, has only 640 employees and is based in Santa Clara, California.Ambarella has a market cap of $2 billion and a forward PE of 41. The stock sports Zacks Style Scores of A in Momentum, but a D in Value. The high PE is the reason for the low value score and the company will need to grow into the PE to support the stock. Recent earnings have investors hopeful that this growth can be achieved.Last quarter, Ambarella surprised on EPS by 56%, while beating on revenue by $1.2 million. The stock sold off much like AVGO and will create an opportunity if it continues lower.The $61 area is the 50-day moving average, but if markets head lower it will likely break and head down quickly. While to 200-day is just under $50, I will look to start buying around the $54 area, which is a halfway back Fibonacci level. is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that is an Internet technology company engaged in the development of applications, services and other technologies for the Internet in China. The company was founded in 1997, employs almost 13,000 people and is headquartered in Beijing, China.Netease is valued at $28 Billion and has a forward PE of 18. The stock sports a Zacks Style Score of B in both Growth and Momentum and has an expected EPS growth rate of 26%.Last month the company beat on the top line, had a 33% EPS beat and raised its dividend 6.8%. Online game revenue growth continues to amaze with revenues coming in at 6.4 billion Yuan (CNY), 69% higher than the CNY3.78 Billion seen last year. Advertising revenue year over year was up 24%, from CNY428 Million to CNY531 Million. The email, ecommerce and other segments also saw impressive growth, seeing revenue jump from CNY483 Million to CNY1.98 Billion.The numbers continue to impress and a market pullback could knock the volatile stock back down under the $200 level. A pullback to the $170 level would allow a good entry above the 200-day at $168.When the markets start to panic your number one job is to stay calm and focus. There will be opportunity when there is blood and you need to be ready. Take time to make a watch list and target companies that are performing both fundamentally and technically.

Companies that effectively meet debt obligations by converting their assets into liquid cash and equivalents are expected to offer healthy returns.However, high liquidity alone does not imply that a company is financially strong. It may also indicate that the company is inefficient when it comes to utilizing its assets. Thus, one should also consider efficiency level in addition to liquidity to avoid selecting companies that have a weak financial position.Liquidity ratios - current, quick and cash - are the popular indicators of liquidity levels. Favorable liquidity ratios may help an investor to identify a company's capability of converting its assets to meet its debt obligations. While current ratio or working capital ratio seeks to measure a company's potential to meet its short- as well as long-term debt obligations, a company's quick ratio or acid-test ratio or quick assets ratio indicates its capability of meeting only short-term debt obligations.

In order to achieve its objective, cash ratio only considers cash and cash equivalents relative to current liabilities.

For two months the market went absolutely nowhere and volatility was stuck close to all-time lows. But now, summer vacation is over and the volatility index has woken up after markets were spooked about a possible September Fed rate hike.Since the Brexit spike, volatility has been stuck around 12, but the last two days have seen an aggressive spike, pushing the VIX up to 20 early this morning. Traders are starting to get nervous that the Fed might hike rates twice to finish out the year. Recent Fed speak is the cause for the move, as comments on Friday led to a 2% plus selloff.This might seem silly to most investors who think long term. But in reality, the market was due for a pullback and the complacency that we saw over the summer is now making greedy longs a little nervous.So let's say the market stays weak into the Fed and continues lower. Where and what do you buy? Looking at the S&P 500 there are a couple levels that are interesting. The 200-day moving average is sitting at 2058, a spot that everyone will be watching. The 200-day was cracked on the Brexit panic, but was quickly an area of support after the bounce.However, I believe this area could be front run with a couple Fibonacci levels. The halfway back (50%) level drawn from Brexit lows to recent highs is at 2085 and could find support. If not there I will be looking at 2062, the 61.8% level for support. That level would font run the 200-day be a couple handles and force the 200-day buyers to chase when they realized they missed the entry.The levels are important to know, but it's more important to know what to trade when these levels are hit. Below I list four top ranked stocks that should be scooped up when the sellers are panicking. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a recent track record of earnings beats. (AVGO) is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that is a designer, developer and supplier of analog and digital semiconductor connectivity solutions. The company was founded in 2005, employs over 8,000 people and is headquartered in Singapore.Broadcom is valued at $64 billion and has a forward PE of 17. The stock sports a Zacks Style Score of A in Momentum and pays out a dividend of 1.24%.Early this month the company beat on the top line and had an 11 cent EPS beat, or almost 8%. Despite multiple price upgrades from a variety of analysts the stock sold off. If the stock continues to fall to the 200-day just under $150, the stock must be bought. However, I'm eyeing a trendline and Fib level at $157 for a starter position. is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that develops video compression and image processing semiconductors. The company was founded in 2004, has only 640 employees and is based in Santa Clara, California.Ambarella has a market cap of $2 billion and a forward PE of 41. The stock sports Zacks Style Scores of A in Momentum, but a D in Value. The high PE is the reason for the low value score and the company will need to grow into the PE to support the stock. Recent earnings have investors hopeful that this growth can be achieved.Last quarter, Ambarella surprised on EPS by 56%, while beating on revenue by $1.2 million. The stock sold off much like AVGO and will create an opportunity if it continues lower.The $61 area is the 50-day moving average, but if markets head lower it will likely break and head down quickly. While to 200-day is just under $50, I will look to start buying around the $54 area, which is a halfway back Fibonacci level. is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that is an Internet technology company engaged in the development of applications, services and other technologies for the Internet in China. The company was founded in 1997, employs almost 13,000 people and is headquartered in Beijing, China.Netease is valued at $28 Billion and has a forward PE of 18. The stock sports a Zacks Style Score of B in both Growth and Momentum and has an expected EPS growth rate of 26%.Last month the company beat on the top line, had a 33% EPS beat and raised its dividend 6.8%. Online game revenue growth continues to amaze with revenues coming in at 6.4 billion Yuan (CNY), 69% higher than the CNY3.78 Billion seen last year. Advertising revenue year over year was up 24%, from CNY428 Million to CNY531 Million. The email, ecommerce and other segments also saw impressive growth, seeing revenue jump from CNY483 Million to CNY1.98 Billion.The numbers continue to impress and a market pullback could knock the volatile stock back down under the $200 level. A pullback to the $170 level would allow a good entry above the 200-day at $168.When the markets start to panic your number one job is to stay calm and focus. There will be opportunity when there is blood and you need to be ready. Take time to make a watch list and target companies that are performing both fundamentally and technically. When the market bounces you will be rewarded. :  .Would you like to see a hand-picked \"all-star\" selection of investment ideas from the man who heads up Zacks' trading and investing services?

Further, Sony Corp.  unveiled two new versions of PS4 while Activision Blizzard Inc.'s  Call of Duty XP event pushed the stock to reach an all time high of $43.10.1.Many would not have anticipated what happened at  held on Sep 7, 2016.

Miyamoto announced the launch of a new Mario game, Super Mario Run, for the iOS platform by the end of this year.Moreover, Niantic, the maker of Pok\u00e9mon Go in association with Nintendo owned The Pok\u00e9mon Company, announced that Pok\u00e9mon Go will make its debut on Apple Watch soon. The unprecedented collaboration led the  .The year has been a good one so far for Nintendo, which is basking in the success of Pok\u00e9mon Go. Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock are up over 96% year to date. Though the success of the game doesn't directly benefit Nintendo's financials, we believe that it has strengthened the Japanese video game publisher's position in the lucrative mobile games space, which should help it to sustain the momentum going ahead.Nintendo had so far remained aloof from mobile games. Nintendo finally warmed to the idea of mobile games last year and struck a deal with DeNA to bring five mobile games by Mar 2017. With Miitomo, released by Nintendo earlier this year,it has two more games lined up for release this year namely, Animal Crossing and Fire Emblem.2.  in a bid to maintain a competitive edge in the video games console market. It also revealed its plans to unveil a more powerful version of the flagship console this fall.The newly launched PS4 Pro, an upgraded version of the 3-year-old PS4 hardware, now boasts a more powerful central and graphics processing chip and enhanced image-processing capability. It offers additional storage and supports 4K resolution. PS4 is designed to support Sony's PlayStation VR virtual reality headset. Sony also unveiled a sleeker and more energy-efficient PS4 to replace the original fourth-generation PlayStation machine.Sony is facing troubles in a number of its business segments, it has been leveraging its games business that has consistently performed well on robust sales of consoles. In the fiscal year ending Mar 2017, the company anticipates its gaming business to generate about 45% of its overall operating profit. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see  .3.

The event will likely spark interest in  and the  which are scheduled to be launched on Nov 4, 2016.Apart from  , e-sports was another focal point of the event. E-sports is gaining traction and Activision, which holds a Zacks Rank#2 (Buy) is leaving no stone unturned to grab a lucrative share of this market. As per a Newzoo report, global revenues from e-sports are expected to top $1 billion by 2019.Activision had acquired Major Gaming League earlier this year to boost its prospects in the space. It recently named Fox Sports executive Pete Vlastelica as co-president and CEO of its e-sports unit.The following table shows the price movement of the major video game companies over both the past five trading days as well as the last six months:\n  \nOver the last five trading sessions, Zynga  was up 5.95% while Microsoft  was down 1.03%.Over the last six-month period, NetEase Inc.  surged the most - nearly 61.01%. NetEase recently reported strong second-quarter 2016 results. The increasing popularity of mobile-based games and the strength of PC games (licensed & self-developed) continue to keep investors interested in the stock. Moreover, growing mobile advertising revenues wasan added incentive.Glu Mobile  was down 22.23% over the same time frame due to the underperformance of most of its releases. Also, the company downgraded its guidance for 2016. But its significant share repurchase authorization and the much anticipated Taylor Swift game keep hopes alive.Would you like to see a hand-picked \"all-star\" selection of investment ideas from the man who heads up Zacks' trading and investing services?

It's great to find stocks right before they surge towards new highs, but it can be difficult for some to establish a new and consistent range.With that said, investors typically become interested in stocks as they breach 52-week highs because that momentum can oftentimes continue until a new range is established. If a stock is strong in a variety of key categories, it certainly can keep climbing well above that old 52-week high, and we can find those stocks using our Zacks methods.Here at Zacks, we place an emphasis on earnings-related data, especially earnings estimate revision activity, and this can definitely be applied to stocks approaching their 52-week highs. One way to ensure continued upward momentum is solid earnings growth, and we can use the proven Zacks Rank system to identify companies that look to impress in this regard.Using this strategy, we've found five stocks that are seeing positive estimate revisions and should post impressive earnings growth this year, which should help them move above the 52-week highs that they are quickly approaching.Previous Close: $230.07 / 52-Week High: $240.47NetEase is an internet technology company based in China that produces online MMORPG video games. In the past 30 days, its current-quarter Zacks Consensus Estimate has gained 10 cents after it beat our estimate by over 32% in its most recent report. For the full fiscal year, our consensus estimates reflect earnings growth of 52% and revenue growth of 55%. Shares of NetEase are up 34% in the last 12 weeks, and the stock should continue this impressive run if the company continues to post strong earnings results.Previous Close: $13.60 / 52-Week High: $14.08Lifeway Foods is a producer and distributer of \"Kefir,\" a yogurt-like fermented milk drink. Following a pair of earnings estimate revisions, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's current-quarter earnings is five cents higher than it was just 30 days ago. After surpassing our consensus estimate by nine cents last quarter, Lifeway hopes to continue this momentum in a year where it expects to see earnings growth of 216% and revenue growth of 8.5%.Previous Close: $72.30 / 52-Week High: $73.88Interdigital Communications is a provider of digital wireless telecommunications systems that boasts an impressive patent portfolio. The company expects a giant third-quarter, and its improved guidance has helped move the Zacks Consensus Estimate a shocking 88 cents higher in the past week. We've also seen positive revisions for its next-quarter, full-year, and next-year earnings, and our consensus estimate indicates that Interdigital could be in store for earnings growth of 17.5% this year.Previous Close: $4.12 / 52-Week High: $4.52AXT is a manufacturer of high-performance compound semiconductor substrates, as well as opto-electronic semiconductor devices. Thanks to three positive estimate revisions, its current-quarter Zacks Consensus Estimate has gained two cents over the last 30 days. Our consensus estimates also show that AXT should turn a profit this year with 5.5% revenue growth and 281% earnings growth.Previous Close: $22.82 / 52-Week High: $23.26Infoblox is an automated network controller that provides appliance-based solutions for networks and data centers. Over the last 30 days, its current-quarter Zacks Consensus Estimate has gained 12 cents. Overall, our consensus estimate indicate that Infoblox could see earnings growth of 160% on revenue growth of 2.5% this fiscal year.All of these stocks are quickly approaching their 52-week highs, and that means they should be on your radar.

Barron honored Driehaus by including his name in its All-Century Team. Risk loving investors favor the momentum strategy as it's known to be a high yielding one like Driehaus' strategy.The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns. AAII's portfolio, which was developed following the strategy, returned 13.5% and 18.1% in the five- and 10- year timeframe, respectively, compared with -1.1% and 4.2% returns registered by the S&P 500. Thus, investors with a high risk appetite may opt for this strategy to boost their portfolio returns.Regarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: \"I would much rather invest in a stock that's increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that's already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around.\" In line with this insight, AAII took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus' philosophy.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator - positive relative strength - has also been included in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focused on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.In order to make the strategy more profitable, we have considered only those stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a momentum score of 'A' or 'B'. Our research shows that stocks with a  of 'A' or 'B' when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.(Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through.)\u2022 (Strong EPS growth history ensures improving business.)\u2022 (Higher EPS growth compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)\u2022 (Positive EPS surprise indicates potential.)\u2022 (High % 50-day moving average and relative strength signal uptrend.)\u2022 (Favorable momentum score indicates that it is ideal to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success.)These few parameters narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only 25.Here are five of the 25 stocks: (  ) is involved in producing and selling of kitchen cabinets and vanities in the U.S. American Woodmark has a Zacks Rank #1 with a Momentum score of 'A.'

There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard, and which are not really quality indicators of future performance. Fortunately, with our new  we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for momentum investors in the near term.This method discovered several great candidates for momentum-oriented investors, but today let's focus in on  as this stock is looking especially impressive right now. And while there are numerous ways in which this company could be a great choice, we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for NTES' status as a solid momentum stock below:While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics-such as performance over the past three months or year-- and comparing these to an industry at large can be very useful.And in the case of NTES, the results are quite impressive. The company has beaten out the industry at large over the past 12 weeks by a margin of 20.7% to 3.2% while it has also outperformed when looking at the past year, putting up a gain of 91.4%. Clearly, NTES is riding a bit of a hot streak and is worth a closer look by investors.While looking at price performance or full year earnings can be essential to understanding a momentum stock, you shouldn't forget about the current quarter EPS and the trend in estimates there. This change can signal how a stock might perform in the next earnings season which is obviously vital for momentum investors.Right now, NTES is seeing a nice trend over the past month when it comes to this quarter's earnings estimate projections. In the time frame, EPS estimates for NetEase have gone up by 19.3% compared to an industry average move of -5%, suggesting that not only is NTES heading in the right direction, but it is seeing an increase relative to the industry too.While the great momentum factors outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors, we should also take into account broad earnings estimate revision trends. A nice path here can really help to show us a promising stock, and we have actually been seeing that with NTES as of late too.Over the past two months, 3 earnings estimates have gone higher compared to no downward revisions for the full year, while we are also seeing 2 upward revisions with no downward revisions for the next year time frame too. These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate as two months ago NTES was expected to post earnings of $10.50/share for the full year, though today it looks to have EPS of $11.98 for the full year now, representing a solid increase which is something that should definitely be welcomed news to would-be investors.Given these factors, investors shouldn't be surprised to note that we have NTES as a security with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Momentum Score of 'A'. So if you are looking for a fresh pick that has potential to move in the right direction, definitely keep NTES on your short list as this looks be a stock that is very well-positioned to soar in the near term.Beyond this Tale of the Tape, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are not available to the public?

Further, media reports stated Sony Corp.  plans to release a new, slimmer version of its base-model PlayStation 4 console next month, in addition to the new high-end model it announced earlier.1. GameStop  adjusted earnings per share of 27 cents in the quarter that beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny, but declined 12.9% year over year.GameStop's revenues fell 7.4% year over year to $1,631.8 million and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,722 million. The second-quarter results were hurt by a sharp decline in comparable store sales (comps), which were primarily affected by a fall in video games and hardware sales. Management reiterated its fiscal 2016 earnings guidance.2. Per The Wall Street Journal Report, in Sep 2016  it has already announced. However the slimmer version isn't a surprise, because Sony has released such versions of the console's previous iterations in the past. But, Sony's decision to release a new base-model alongside a high-end model of the PS4 is a big surprise because the company's typical console release schedule traditionally supports only one version at a time.3. Nintendo, fresh from the success of Pok\u00e9mon Go, has offloaded a part of its share in First Avenue Entertainment LLLP for $661 million. First Avenue operates Seattle Mariners Major League Baseball Team. The company had first announced its decision to sale a part of its stake in First Avenue in Apr 2016. Per media reports, the company's decision apparently came after Nintendo's president Satoru Iwata, who oversaw team operations passed away last year. However, it can't be denied that since the company is struggling with sales of Wii U, it will try to \"unlock more cash wherever it can\" the report further added.4. Electronic Arts  released the much awaited Madden NFL 17 on Aug 23. The game has an average metacritic rating of 83.5. Per media reports, research firm, Piper Jaffray estimates sales to touch 5.5 million units, flat year over year. However, the analyst added that the estimate could prove to be conservative. The company has a solid pipelineof releases (FIFA 17; Battlefield 1 a new Titanfall game) this year to cash in on the holiday season shopping frenzy. Also, EA and Dice announced Battlefield Premium Pass. It is a new membership program, which will give 14 days early access to the four upcoming Battlefield 1 digital expansion packs beginning with Battlefield 1  in Mar 2017.The following table shows the price movement of the major video game companies over both the past five trading days as well as the last six months:\n  \nOver the last five trading sessions, Glu Mobile  was up 5.56% while Zynga Inc.  was down 0.38%.Over the last 6-month period, NetEase Inc.  surged the most - nearly 53.04%. NetEase recently reported strong second-quarter 2016 results. Increasing popularity of mobile-based games and strength of PC games (licensed & self-developed) continue to keep investors interested in the stock. Moreover, growing mobile advertising revenues is an added incentive.Glu Mobile was down 41.84% over the same time frame due to underperformance of most of its releases. Also, the company downgraded its outlook for 2016. But its significant share repurchase authorization and the much anticipated Taylor Swift game keep hopes alive.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ: NTES) has done an exceptional job of giving Chinese gamers what they want, and shareholders have gotten used to the company's success in producing impressive financial results. Coming into Wednesday's second-quarter financial report, NetEase investors wanted to see continued evidence of strong growth, and NetEase gave them everything they could have asked for and more. Let's take a closer look at how NetEase did this quarter and whether it can sustain its fast growth pace in future quarters.NetEase's second-quarter results once again dramatically exceeded the high expectations that investors had from the online gaming specialist. Revenue nearly doubled in local-currency terms, hitting $1.35 billion, which was far greater than the $1.26 billion consensus forecast among those following the stock. Similarly, NetEase posted impressive bottom-line performance, with adjusted net income of $484.6 million reflecting a roughly 100% increase in earnings as measured in China's currency. Adjusted earnings per American depositary share of $3.70 more than doubled the year-ago figure and exceeded expectations by more than $1 per share.Taking a closer look at online gaming specialist's numbers, the same trends that NetEase has seen in the past continued to appear in its financial results. Revenue from online game services climbed by more than three-quarters to $969 million, and sales generated by email, e-commerce, and other types of revenue more than quadrupled from year-ago levels to nearly $300 million. The advertising services sector posted more modest growth of about 25%, but it has become an insignificant source of revenue for NetEase over the years.In addition, the margin compression that NetEase has suffered once again showed itself, but the pace of the declines has slowed considerably. Online gaming gross margin fell by about three percentage points to 66.2%, but gains in email-related gross margin figures offset the decline. Overall, NetEase saw gross margin fall to 59%, but a slower pace of growth in operating expenses helped to boost operating margin figures and produce impressive profit gains.CEO William Ding was once again pleased with NetEase's results. The strong quarterly results \"reflect NetEase's leadership in China's dynamic online games industry,\" Ding said, \"where we continue to introduce premium game content, innovative technology, and effective marketing strategies.\" The CEO also pointed to the way in which NetEase is looking at embracing new technology to try to deliver the experiences that gamers want.NetEase has captured a huge share of the growing mobile gaming market, with more than 100 titles that include several strong franchises. Many titles have become popular not just in China but also in South Korea, and NetEase has the potential to become much more of a regional powerhouse as it looks at its overall expansion strategy.At the same time, NetEase isn't content with what it has achieved thus far. The company is also looking at virtual reality and similar new offerings to see how it can develop content that will lead NetEase forward in the future. Collaboration with the creator of the popular  game to develop a Chinese version of the program also has NetEase excited about its position in the market.Investors have gotten used to seeing NetEase share its success in the form of higher dividends, and the company didn't disappoint this quarter. The income-tied payout rose to $0.78 per depositary share, up a nickel from the previous quarter.NetEase shareholders seemed happy with the report, sending the stock up nearly 3% in after-hours trading following the announcement. With so much positive momentum, NetEase has the potential to keep setting new all-time record highs as long as the Chinese online gaming market remains as strong as it has been in recent years.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["arkets suffered losses over last week following concerns regarding the state of the economy and also about measures being taken by the government to combat the situation.

Monthly active users went up 33% year over year to 282 million. Daily active users for Weibo came in at 126 million at quarter-end, up 36%. The strong growth momentum of Weibo advertising was driven by increasing adoption of mobile devices and improved monetization, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises.Portal revenues decreased 7.4% year over year to $97.9 million.

The company's robust user base for its e-Commerce and Weibo offerings are the positives.However, the company's business is likely to be impacted by soft macroeconomic conditions in China. Also, significant restrictions on online search and other social-networking activities in the region remain concerns.Moreover, Weibo is expected to face stiff competition from the likes of WeChat in China, which may hurt its user base.

Not only do the payments put money in your pocket, helping to hedge against any dips in the stock market, but they're also usually a sign of a financially sound company. Dividends also give investors a painless opportunity to reinvest in a stock, thus compounding gains over time.However, not all income stocks live up to their full potential. Using the payout ratio -- the percentage of profits a company returns to its shareholders as dividends -- we can get a bead on whether a company has room to increase its dividend. Generally, a healthy payout ratio is between 50% and 75% (though payout ratios outside that range are common and accepted in certain industries). Here are three income stocks with payout ratios below 50% that could potentially double their dividends. , we'll kick things off within the financial sector -- often a stronghold of solid dividends -- and take a closer look at why regional bank  (NASDAQ: FITB) should be on income investors' radars.Like most banks, Fifth Third has struggled with notoriously low lending interest rates. While they're a boon to the consumer, low yields constrain banks' interest-based income and shrink net interest margins. Furthermore, depressed  have put pressure on much of the banking sector. About 2% of Fifth Third's loan portfolio in 2015 was made up of energy loans, and crude oil's dive over the past two years has led many banks, including Fifth Third, to shore up their loan loss reserves, which can reduce profitability in the near term.Image source: Fifth Third Bank.Despite these concerns, Fifth Third has a lot of things dividend investors would like. For starters, Fifth Third's loan portfolio is probably in much better shape than skeptics have insinuated. It ended the first quarter with net charge-offs of $96 million, or 0.42% of loans and leases. Yes, this was up 8 basis points from the sequential fourth quarter, but Q1 was also the nadir for  . Since February, crude prices have stabilized between $40 and $50 a barrel, which should ease energy loan tension. Fifth Third also ended Q1 with a healthy tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of nearly 11%. Translation: Its credit quality is probably better than Wall Street realizes.The bread and butter of banking continues to work well for Fifth Third, which is based in various states east of the Mississippi River. Total commercial loans and leases grew 5% year over year in Q1 2016, while consumer loans and leases rose 1%. Similarly, total average deposits increased by 1% from Q1 2015. When lending rates do rise, this growth in loans and deposits should help lift Fifth Third's bottom line.That's another key point: Lending rates won't stay near record lows forever. At some point, lending rates will rise, and bank margins will expand.Having repurchased approximately 15 million shares of common stock during Q1, Fifth Third has signified the importance of improving shareholder value. But it's the company's $0.52 annual payout (2.8% yield) that looks even more enticing. Wall Street is forecasting EPS of $1.69 in 2017 and a good chance of $2-plus in full-year EPS if there are one or two rate hikes. Therefore a doubling in Fifth Third's dividend seems doable in the next five to 10 years.Next up for income seekers is a company that's right on the bull's-eye when it comes to potential dividend growth. I'm talking about none other than retail giant  (NYSE: TGT) .Shareholders in Target have the same concern as most retail investors: They need economic growth. Target relies on discretionary spending to drive its growth, and if the U.S. economy is struggling, or if growth is tepid, then Target's top and bottom line can suffer. Target is also battling some fierce rivals in the retail space, including  and even  , which is using its low overhead to undercut brick-and-mortar store pricing.Image source: Target.Yet Target is making plenty of smart business moves, and its business looks poised to thrive in the years that lie ahead. For instance, Target is investing heavily in direct-to-consumer sales, which rose 23% on a comparable basis during the first quarter. Target understands that convenience is vital to keeping its consumers loyal, so it has turned to omnichannel offerings, as well as its REDcard, to encourage consumers to stay within the Target universe for their shopping needs.Secondly, Target made the wise decision to admit its faults and cut its losses in Canada. After a two-year effort that saw more than $4 billion spent and 133 stores opened, Target's management realized in early 2015 that achieving profitability in Canada across this network of stores by 2021 simply wasn't feasible. Rather than hoping for a turnaround, which isn't a viable business plan, Target announced its exit from Canada and cut its losses. Doing so prevented further uncertainty from clouding Target's future results, and it gave the company new resolve to focus on the U.S. market.Target has also had great success in drawing foot traffic by focusing on brand-name merchandise at a discount. Consumers have a strong desire to own exclusive or brand-name items. Target uses its size and purchasing power to negotiate exceptional deals with its vendors, which can in turn be passed along to the consumer in the form of discounts, without impacting Target's margins much at all.Currently, Target is paying out a delectable 3.3% yield, or $2.40 annually. With the company paying out right around 50% of its profits, it would need to earn around $9.60 a year in EPS for its dividend to double. Based on its mid-to-high single-digit percentage EPS growth trajectory and the $6.78 Wall Street currently has forecast for 2020, it's quite possible that Target's dividend could double within the next decade.Lastly, dividend investors might be surprised to learn that growth stocks offer some of the best opportunities to find rapidly growing payouts. In this respect, I'd suggest that dividend seekers dig into Chinese online gaming and web portal provider  (NASDAQ: NTES) .The biggest concern for investors with a company like NetEase is whether or not it can stay ahead of the curve. We've witnessed with domestic mobile gaming companies, such as  , that consumers' appetite for games can be fleeting and incredibly fickle. If NetEase doesn't constantly innovate and give the consumer what he or she wants, then its valuation could take a hit. There's also concern that China's slowing GDP growth could hurt NetEase's business.Image source: Pixabay.Despite these risks, NetEase appears to have a solid business model conducive to profit and dividend growth over the long term. One of the big reasons NetEase has adapted so well to China's growing market was its relatively early push into mobile apps and gaming. Traditionally known to favor PC games, China now has 600 million mobile users, and many of them are eager to enjoy life's little luxuries via apps and games. This is a huge market that's just being tapped from an advertising perspective in both China and other developed countries around the world. NetEase's 90-plus mobile games are a source of pricing power when it's negotiating with advertisers.This product diversity is also a big factor in NetEase's success. NetEase has a portfolio filled with legacy games that continue to attract loyal consumers and advertisers. On the fli pside, it has a number of new games being regularly introduced, including games that target different genres. Because its product portfolio is so large, and its profits are growing so quickly, NetEase has been able to take risks on new games that other gaming developers simply haven't tried.There's also China's exceptional GDP growth rate of more than 6%. As long as China continues to grow at this quick clip, skepticism surrounding NetEase's ability to grow probably won't gather much steam.Although NetEase doesn't exactly have a set quarterly dividend, it has paid out the equivalent of $2.37 over the trailing 12-month period, which is good enough for a 1.2% yield. Yet Wall Street believes NetEase could deliver $14 or more in EPS as soon as fiscal 2018. Even with heavy reinvestment into its business, this leaves plenty of room for NetEase's dividend to grow -- and perhaps double -- in the coming years.If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings.

The deal was announced in June this year. The deal values each QLogic share at $15.50, of which $11 will be paid in cash and the rest in Cavium's stock. | QLogic reported non-GAAP earnings of 22 cents a share, compared with 3 cents reported in the year-ago period.Segment wise, Advanced Connectivity Platform (adapters and silicon for server and storage connectivity applications) revenues increased 5.9% year over year to $108.6 million. Legacy connectivity product (Switching products) revenues however plummeted 28.3% from the year-ago quarter to approximately $7.8 million.Total operating expense decreased 10.4% year over year to $53.1 million.

In 2015, the company had double-digit lead in terms of market share over its peers. Its strong balance sheet is another positive. It had $355 million in cash in hand as of Mar 29, 2015, which is included in the acquisition price of $1.36 billion.Of late, the company is seeing increasing challenges in driving growth owing to the ongoing transition from Ethernet to Fibre Channel networks on the one hand and the shift from on-premise infrastructure to cloud deployments on the other. As a result, a takeover seems to be a good idea.As per Cavium, the combined company will generate $900 million in LTM revenues with $45 million of cost synergies to be achieved by 2017. The deal will boost Cavium's 2017 non GAAP earnings by 60 to 70 cents.The deal approved by both the boards is subject to regulatory approval.

However, the company posted an average negative surprise of 80.40% over the trailing four quarters. | Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.SINA's business since the last quarter has been affected as a result of the non-renewal of the Alibaba contract. Moreover, the company has been seeing weakness in traditional brand advertising, especially for its portal business. The company also faces some challenges in its display advertising business owing to the ongoing transition from brand advertising to performance-based advertising. Furthermore, its business is also susceptible to be impacted by the soft macroeconomic conditions in China apart from the stringent restrictions on online search and other social-networking activities in the region.Apart from this, intensifying competition from the likes of WeChat, Sohu.com  and NetEase  remains an overhang on the stock.Nonetheless, there can be some respite for SINA given its robust user base for its e-commerce and Weibo offerings. Also, a strong product pipeline and investment in product development and marketing are other positives.Our proven model does not conclusively show that SINA is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. SINA has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 1 cent. SINA has a Zacks Rank #3 which, when combined with a 0.00% ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here's a stock that you may want to consider as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarterMylan, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +1.75% and a Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Shares of Facebook were up over 5% in aftermarket trading to close at a high of $128.93. Notably, this is Facebook's fourth successive quarter of earnings and revenue beat.Facebook's consistently expanding user growth remains one of its biggest growth catalysts. Facebook has an unparalleled user base of 1.71 billion (up 15% year over year) monthly active users (MAUs). In addition, at the end of the quarter, mobile MAUs were 1.57 billion, representing 20% year-over-year growth. Daily Active Users (DAUs) were 1.13 billion, reflecting 17% growth year over year while Mobile DAUs breached the 1 billion mark. Mobile DAUs were 1.03 billion, up 22% year over year.However, we were expecting more commentary on how Facebook plans to monetize Messenger. Again, there were no specific numbers related to Intsagram's contribution to revenues. | Facebook reported non-GAAP earnings of 97 cents in the quarter, up 94% year over year. Both GAAP revenues and revenues, excluding the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates basis, increased 59% year over year.Breaking down revenue components, GAAP advertising revenues came in at $6.239 billion, surging 63% year over year. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, revenues from advertising also increased 63% year over year. Advertising revenues were driven by increasing mobile engagement, higher number of marketers, continuing investment in new products and robust performance of its news feed ads. Facebook has over 3 million active advertisers and over 60 million active SMBs of which 85% are active on mobile.Mobile ad revenues in the quarter were $5.2 billion (up 81% year over year), contributing 84% to total ad revenues. Ad impressions grew 49%, driven by surging mobile ad impressions. Average price per ad increased 9% from the year-ago quarter. Average revenue per user was $3.82.Payments and other fees decreased 8% year over year to $197 million in the reported quarter owing to a reduction in payment revenues related to PC games.On the cost front, cost & expenses grew 33% to $3.690 billion, driven by increases in workforce and marketing expenses. However, robust revenue growth provided enough cushion to operating margins. Operating income more than doubled to $2.746 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin was 43%, up from 31.5% reported in the year-ago quarter.Facebook exited the quarter with cash & cash equivalents and marketable securities of $23.3 billion, up 26.4% year over year. The company generated nearly $6.18 billion of cash flow from operating activities in the first six months compared with $3.58 billion in the year-ago quarter. Free cash flow was $4.05 billion compared with $2.53 billion in the year-ago quarter. The company incurred capital expenditure of $2.13 billion in the first half.Facebook said that ad revenues will continue to grow but will now face tougher year-over-year comparisons in the current year. Ad load, which so far has been a leading factor driving ad revenues, will now start to \"grow modestly\" in the coming quarters and won't be a big factor after mid-2017. Moreover, as Facebook continues to ramp up investments, the costs will increase. Non-GAAP expenses are projected to increase in a band of 45% to 50% while capex is now expected to be $4.5 billion. Stock-based compensation is estimated in the range of $3.1 billion-$3.3 billion. The company expects amortization expenses in 2016 to be within $700 million-$800 million.Facebook has clearly highlighted its ambitions of being more than just a social network. It outlined its plans for the next decade, with a strong focus on AI and AR/VR technology. The company is aggressively working on monetizing its subsidiaries, Messenger, Oculus and WhatsApp. Chatbots and \"conversational commerce\" are likely to be the strategies for Messenger and WhatsApp as well.Moreover, Facebook has been aggressively promoting \"Live\" in order to capture the opportunity presented by ever increasing video viewing on social media platforms. Leading research firm, Forrester Research projects digital ad revenues to touch $12.6 billion by 2019. The company has signed deals with Internet and media celebrities to churn out more content for its Live platform.As of now, all of these appear to be terrific growth engines but it will be one Herculean task for the company to actually make all of them work. User growth and ad load have already reached a point where growth will now be more subdued. Moreover, intensifying competition for users & ad dollars from the likes of Alphabet  and Twitter Inc and increasing investments threaten to thwart its growth prospects.At present, Facebook carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the tech space include NetEase, Inc  , Ellie Mae, Inc  .

Per media reports, the families of five victims have sued the social media service citing that Facebook is violating American anti terrorism laws by providing material support to radical groups like Hamas that help them in \"recruiting, radicalizing, and instructing terrorists, raising funds, creating fear and carrying out attacks.\"Under the 1992 Anti Terrorism Act, U.S companies are prohibited to provide any kind of support to militant outfits.Out the five victims, one was an American tourist while the rest had U.S-Israel dual citizenships.

Of late, Israel has seen an unprecedented rise in \"lone wolf\" attacks reportedly carried out by Palestinians. The government feels that posts backing such gruesome incidents on social media platforms like Facebook tend to glorify such ghastly acts.Facebook continues to maintain that \"we work regularly with safety organizations and policymakers around the world, including Israel, to ensure that people know how to make safe use of Facebook. There is no room for content that promotes violence, direct threats, terrorist or hate speeches on our platform.\" The company also added \"we have a set of Community Standards to help people understand what is allowed on Facebook, and we urge people to use our reporting tools if they find content that they believe violates our standards so we can investigate and take swift action.\"The lawsuit isn't something to worry about for Facebook. As per media reports, the court in addition to \"safe harbor\" laws is likely to rule that freedom of expression \"precedes\" anti-terror laws. Plus, Facebook also cracks down hard on what it deems as offensive content. In March, the company had reportedly taken down a page that made \"direct calls for violence\" and openly endorsed a new Palestinian revolt against Israel.Apart from Facebook, Alphabet  and Twitter Inc  have also been embroiled in such lawsuits that accuse the companies of \"providing material support\" to militants.At present, Facebook carries a ZacksRank #3 (Hold).

On that front, NetEase has a good track record.Its success is stretching from its home base in Beijing all the way to Wall Street, as NetEase stock has been on an upward trend for years. Over the past three years, NetEase shares are up more than 200%.\"Our data and analysis suggest that PC games remain stable at NetEase and that its mobile games have solid momentum,\" said Guo. \"They've successfully transitioned several PC games to mobile that have been well received, and the market appears to like the stock.\"China has the largest gaming market worldwide with plenty of room for growth, presenting a prime opportunity for NetEase. China has more than 688 million internet users, but that's just half the country's population. Of that total, about 90% of internet users have mobile phones, which is where NetEase has been investing heavily to step up its game.Founded in 1997, Beijing-based NetEase has long had a formidable portfolio of popular games for the PC market. It now has a portfolio of more than 90 mobile games and with 41 in development. That's kept NetEase in position to remain a top choice for both new and existing players and address China's rapidly growing mobile culture.NetEase has three core business segments: PC and mobile games, advertising services and e-commerce businesses, with games bringing in the bulk of revenue. It also operates 163.com -- one of China's most popular web portals -- has a popular music streaming app and is also one of the largest e-mail service providers in China.[ibdchart symbol=\"ntes\" type=\"daily\" size=\"threequarter\" position=\"rightchart\" ]In January 2015, NetEase announced the launch of a cross-border e-commerce platform called Kaola.com, focused on selling goods from overseas merchants. Kaola is competing against China's two largest e-commerce companies,  (  ) and  (  ).Choi said Kaola continues to grow at a healthy pace with improving margins as the business achieves economies of scale against Alibaba and JD.com. Goldman Sachs in a report forecast that Kaola would reach revenue of $2.2 billion in 2017.Its main focus, though, is gaming. Risks that could threaten its momentum include weaker performance of existing key game titles and new game titles, more intensive competition, weaker margins and execution.NetEase's primary competitor in games is  (  ), China's largest gaming company by revenue. Tencent also runs the highly popular messaging platform WeChat and social media properties, which it can leverage to promote its game lineup. NetEase is seen as the only real contender to Tencent in China's online game space.NetEase offers some of the most popular online games in China, including the blockbuster game \"World of Warcraft,\" under license from  (  ).NetEase has held an exclusive license for \"World of Warcraft\" from Activision and other titles in mainland China since 2009. In late May it brought Activision's \"Overwatch\" to China.\"NetEase has long maintained great franchises and technology and has a strong reputation among developers and gamers,\" said Lisa Hanson, a research analyst at Niko Partners. The research firm said revenue from online games in China topped $15 billion in 2015 and is expected to reach $20.4 billion by 2020. NetEase broke out of a cup-with-handle and passed a 179.20 buy point on June 29, and has been rising since.

NetEase says that its strategy for its U.S. office is to take blockbuster hits from China and retool them to appeal to gamers in the U.S. and elsewhere.Chinese companies are having some success in expanding offshore via acquisition, as well as exporting their games, said Hanson.Aside from its licensing deals with Activision and some others, NetEase develops the majority of its games in house, mostly the multiplayer variety, whereas Tencent licenses most of its games.\"NetEase has strong in-house development expertise,\" Guo said.More than three quarters of NetEase revenue comes from multiplayer games such as its popular \"Westward Journey Online\" franchise. Multiplayer games are best suited for PCs, but the popularity of desktop games is declining as more players migrate to mobile. That's where NetEase is investing heavily to diversify around its pipeline of action role-playing challenges that appeal to a broad and growing audience.Mobile games remained the primary growth driver for NetEase in the first quarter. Its classic titles lead the way but newer games have been well-received by players.\"Westward Journey Online\" and another mobile-player favorites, \"Fantasy Westward Journey,\" continue to dominate the  (AAPL) app store in China as two of the most popular games in the last two quarters. Newer games such as \"Kung Fu Panda 3\" and \"The X-World\" were launched in January and drew favorable reviews.First-quarter revenue at NetEase rose 116% in local currency year over year to $1.2 billion.

Yesterday, a federal court in the city of Londrina sealed Facebook's funds worth 19.5 reais or $6 million held in the country for constantly refusing to handover data pertaining to a WhatsApp user involved in drug trafficking, after repeated court orders.Per media reports, though WhatsApp functions as an independent entity, it does not have any bank accounts in Brazil and so the court froze the funds of its parent organization. The amount is almost equivalent to the fines levied for non compliance of court orders.Media reports further add that Brazilian law enforcement agencies have been investigating a drug smuggling racket since January and they argue that without the critical WhatsApp data, they are at a loss as they will not be able to establish any connection between those arrested and their associates spread across Bolivia, Paraguay, Brazil and Spain.WhatsApp has consistently maintained that it cannot furnish the information as it does not store any data pertaining to users. Moreover, WhatsApp has now been employing secured end to end encryption so that WhatsApp and third parties cannot read or listen to the chats and videos sent by users.Earlier, in a similar drug case, the company's regional vice president, Diego Dzodan, was arrested by Brazilian authorities only to be released the next day.

Though the markets have corrected themselves to some extent, in the last few days, the ripple effects will likely be felt for a long time now.Some analysts predict that Facebook will be a safe haven in these times of macroeconomic uncertainties. But if we look closely, even Facebook has a lot on stake after Brexit.First of all, the company has its EU headquarters in Ireland through which it receives certain tax benefits. Now with Brexit happening, Facebook will have to chalk out a way to avoid paying higher taxes. It might also result in the relocation of its headquarters (and some other facilities as well) so that it continues to get the benefits of the EU bloc.In addition, the social media giant will have to wade through too many uncertainties, given the fact that it will have to re-define everything from tax to data flow and privacy regulations for its operations in the UK.The company does have strong growth prospects as it advances its Internet  drive. An increase in user base would directly add more ad revenues to its coffers no doubt but the concern regarding its performance in the UK remains. It derives a sizeable portion of its revenues from that region (over 5% according to a FactSet report). Fears regarding UK going into recession further add to the concerns.Nonetheless, the company has placed itself well with its other money-raking platforms like Instagram, Oculus, Messenger and WhatsApp, which would cushion the negative impacts to a great extent in our view.At present, Facebook carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Per media reports, Lo will be working to enhance Facebook's external partnerships for boosting global connectivity. This has led to speculations that Lo will take roles in Facebook projects like Terragraph, a connectivity program to help bring Internet to populated urban regions. In addition, Lo might also become an important member of the trans-Atlantic data cable alliance that has been formed between Facebook and Microsoft  .Facebook has however clearly stated that Lo will not be working on the company's  initiative. In addition, the company has also hinted that it has no plans to challenge Google as an Internet service provider. Last year, the company had however mentioned that it is planning to tie up with existing providers, in order to boost its efforts. Lo, with all his experience, does seem a good choice to lead such partnerships.We believe that Lo would likely be an important addition to Facebook for advancing its aim of global connectivity. He was one of the co-founders of Google Fiber and managed key aspects of the project from 2010 till last year when he left Google.The two tech giants, Facebook and Google, have been battling in the Internet connectivity space for quite a while. Though on the technological front, the companies are leaders in different domains, there is nonetheless some overlapping. For instance, Facebook's  is quite similar to Google's Project Loon. The only difference is that Google uses high-flying balloons instead of drones to beam Internet connectivity.With growth in developed markets slowing down, these tech giants are looking to improve connectivity, which in turn would allow them to boost their user base. After all, a vast portion of the global population still remains to be connected.At present, Facebook carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

In 2015, the Belgian Privacy Commission had sued Facebook to prevent it from tracking information of non-users who visit Facebook's public pages.Back then a lower court had sided with the regulatory body and directed Facebook to stop tracking non users activities or cough up a hefty fine of \u20ac250K every day.Expectedly, Facebook appealed against the ruling. The company also maintained that Irish Data Protection Commissioner had sole authority over it. Facebook's European headquarters are located in Ireland.However, Facebook temporarily discontinued the use of Datr cookies that are \"placed on users' browsers when they visit a Facebook.com site or click a Facebook 'Like' button on other websites, allowing it to track the online activities of that browser.\"Yesterday, in a big victory for Facebook, the regulatory body's claim was rejected by the Brussels Appeals Court citing that \"Belgian courts don't have international jurisdiction over Facebook Ireland, where the data concerning Europe is processed.\"Facebook welcomed the ruling and said \"we are pleased with the court's decision and look forward to bringing all our services back online for people in Belgium.\"However, the Belgian privacy watchdog said that it was mulling filing a final appeal with the Court of Cassation. Notably, Cassation courts can't deliver new judgments but have the authority to trash earlier rulings.As Facebook hosts a huge amount of personal data, it has been under constant scrutiny from privacy groups and federal agencies. This huge database is its primary asset for attracting advertisers. As a result, the company has been criticized for allegedly selling this personal data to advertisers in order to boost its top line.Although the company has denied any wrongdoing, we believe that increasing scrutiny by regulators of its data handling practices remains a major concern, going forward. Recently, the company ran into trouble with Brazilian law enforcement agencies involving its messaging service WhatsApp and in Germany over antitrust concerns.At present, Facebook is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Also, a few chosen creators will be able to monetize their content directly.There will also be a curated recommendations tool to identify \"high-profile engagement opportunities and a refined view of influential @mentions and follows\".As far as videos are concerned, Twitter will now allow users to post longer videos of 140 seconds as against the 30 seconds time limit earlier. Twitter has also improved the browsing experience to enable users find videos easily on both Vine and Twitter platforms. Users can now click on video tweet on their timeline to a launch full screen mode with more video tweets appearing below.CEO Jack Dorsey said \"we're investing heavily in videos and creators.

Online video is the most lucrative component of digital advertising. As video ads generate more revenues than their photo and text based counterparts, companies are trying to incorporate more and more video oriented content to bring in more ad dollars. Moreover, it is the \"live\" feature that is emerging as a terrific opportunity.As per an e-marketer report, U.S online ad spending will be to the tune of $9.8 billion in 2016, up 22.7% year over year, and will reach a staggering $16.7 billion by 2020.Not just Twitter, Facebook  is also ramping up its video content efforts.

There are as many as 17 deals worth over $1 million including deals with The New York Times and CNN for $3.03 million and $2.5 million, respectively.

The report caused massive uproar and prompted Senator John Thune to write a letter to Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg demanding an explanation.Following the allegations and the Senator's letter, Facebook posted a full account of how \"Trending Topics\" selection works on its website. Zuckerberg also met fifteen key conservative leaders to assure them that Facebook is not prejudiced.Also, Facebook in a blog post had mentioned \"our data analysis indicated that conservative and liberal topics are approved as trending topics at virtually identical rates. We were also unable to substantiate any of the specific allegations of politically-motivated suppression of particular subjects or sources\".However, Facebook did not deny the likelihood of human error in its blog post. As a result, to minimize such instances, the social media service outlined new measures. These included updating the terminology in its Guidelines for better understanding and providing refresher training to all reviewers. It will also do away with relying on external news websites \"to identify, validate or assess the importance of particular topics\".Facebook has been dealing with this whole issue very seriously. Any hint of a bias can cause loss of users. For social media services including Facebook, loss of this key metric will not bode well for financial performance.

If it does happen, it will definitely be good news for the Chinese economy, which had a torrid run this year. This is because more money will flow into its sagging economy, eventually putting a ceiling to market volatility and fulfilling its need for foreign investments. Inclusion by MSCI will fuel demand for Chinese companies.China is a huge part of the global economy, but still a large part of its stock market isn't represented in most of the global indices. Is MSCI, the largest indexing firm in the world, trying to put that right by considering whether to include mainland China stocks on their global indices? This is in spite of the fact that regulatory countdown has pushed local traders away. China's so-called A-shares or mainland China stocks had tanked to less than one-third of their value in the country's two major markets - Shanghai and Shenzhen - in May from its peak level in Jun 2015.Analysts round the world are debating whether mainland China shares are ready for prime time or not. In this context, Chinese authorities did address specific concerns of the MSCI, which more or less represent the concerns of the global investing community at large.Too many trading halts in the Chinese stock market during the beginning of the year created havoc among foreign investors who had to deal with redemption requests. However, authorities had set a maximum period of stock halts at three months. Questions regarding foreign investors owning Chinese shares have been cleared. Chinese authorities confirmed that they do own such shares even though they are held by local asset managers. Authorities also added that foreign investors will be able to invest adequately depending on the size of the firm and can get their money out without much fuss.The world's second largest economy is in desperate need for foreign investments. In order to tame market volatility, institutionalize the onshore market and broaden the investor base, such investments have become essential. With the inclusion, hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars are expected to flow into Chinese stocks.An inclusion of just 5% of A-shares will attract around $17 billion from funds tracking the MSCI Emerging Markets Index alone, as per HSBC Holdings plc  estimates. Moreover, it is anticipated that the inclusion will result in an inflow of an extra $20 billion to $30 billion in Chinese stocks over the next year.MSCI also said that Chinese stocks' index weighting could increase to 20% in the future provided Beijing allows foreign investors more access to its markets. Additional capital inflows will be able to offset capital outflows from its citizens.The MSCI China A Index, which tracks A-shares, plummeted almost 46% over the past 12 months after MSCI decided not to include Chinese A-shares last June. However, this time around, MSCI is likely to welcome A-shares. Given the advantages of being listed and the steps taken by the Chinese authorities, MSCI is expected to take a gradual approach in listing all mainland Chinese shares.The MSCI China A index has 420 stocks with a market capitalization of $800 billion. MSCI has already mentioned that the initial inclusion of China A-shares in the Emerging Markets index will be limited to 1.1% of the weight of the index. This proportion will gradually increase with the passage of time. A 1.1% weightage accounts for almost $16 billion that foreign investors need to acquire mostly within the next few months. Also to be noted is the fact that China A-shares with a full weight will be about 15% of the Emerging Market index.Chinese stocks had a horrible start to this year. But, if MSCI considers it fit to include China mainland shares in several of its indices then billions of dollars will undoubtedly be pumped into Chinese shares, resulting in a bull run. This means we will expect heavy trading volume in major Chinese stocks listed on the U.S. stock exchanges, including NetEase, Inc.  , Ctrip.com International Ltd.  , JD.com, Inc.  and 58.com Inc.  . While NetEase boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Ctrip.com International, JD.com and 58.com carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).On the other hand, other Chinese behemoths listed on the U.S. stock exchange like Alibaba Group Holding Limited  and Baidu, Inc.  don't share the same fate as the above mentioned companies. While Alibaba Group has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), Baidu, Inc., China's answer to Alphabet Inc.  , has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

This was widely cheered by investors. Facebook's phenomenal growth in back-to-back quarters and Zuckerberg's enviable 10 year sci-fi roadmap for the company's metamorphosis into something much bigger than just a social media platform keep investors impressed with his leadership. Shares of Facebook have grown 34% in the past one year. It's also to be noted that Zuckerberg holds 60% of Facebook's voting power.However, as per media reports, Zuckerberg, in a bid to get approval for the Class C shares, has had to yield to some of the demands by investors. They had demanded that all of his Class B shares be converted to Class A in the event of his demise or resignation. This will allow Facebook to choose a new CEO on merit basis. Currently, even if Zuckerberg ceases to be Facebook's chief, he will still carry maximum voting rights. | During its first quarter 2016 results, Facebook had proposed shareholders the creation of publicly listed but non-voting new Class C shares, which will solidify Zuckerberg's position in the company. Facebook, at present, has a double class structure.The Class C shares will have the same other economic rights as Class A and Class B shares. Notably, Class B shares have 10 times the voting rights of Class A shares. Class B shares aren't traded and are held mostly by Facebook executives.The idea behind the creation of this new class of shares is to allow Zuckerberg to have control over the company while continuing his charitable work. In December, Zuckerberg had said that he and his wife plan to give 99% of their  , valued at $45 billion then, over their entire lifetime, to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative LLC, a limited liability company for betterment of the society.Facebook will issue the non-voting class C shares through a stock dividend to the existing shareholders of the company's Class A and Class B shares, which will effectively be same as a three-for-one stock split.Shareholders also approved the re-election of all board members including tech tycoon Peter Thiel, who has been courting lot of controversy since it surfaced that he secretly funded wrestler Hulk Hogan's privacy incursion lawsuit against Gawker Media. Gawker had earlier targeted Thiel and funding the lawsuit was apparently Thiel's revenge against the media company to dent it financially. Hogan won the $140 million lawsuit. The re-election of Thiel was almost certain as board member Sheryl Sandberg had earlier said that Thiel has funded the lawsuit in his personal capacity and not as a member of Facebook's board.Wall Street is divided over the creation of Class C shares. While some approve of Zuckerberg's leadership given Facebook's blockbuster performance, others disapprove given their penchant for \"one share one vote approach\". An analyst with Fortune even went on to compare Facebook's governance as favoring \"benevolent dictators\".At present, Facebook sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Shares of multiplex supersizer  (NYSE: IMAX) shed 10% of their value last week, held back by a switch at CFO and a negative analyst tweak.IMAX announced on Monday that Patrick McClymont will take over as CFO when Joseph Sparacio steps down in two months. McClymont has an admirable pedigree, but investors generally don't like to see CFOs being replaced.However, the biggest blow came two days later, when B. Riley & Co. slashed its price target on the shares, fearing a disappointing second quarter. With just three weeks left in the quarter, B. Riley & Co. feels that a pair of theatrical disappointments will sting IMAX's box office receipts. It's lowering its forecast by 23%. It's sticking to its bullish \"buy\" rating, but sensing the market isn't going to like the current quarter's report, it's lowering its price target from $45 to $40.The stock has fallen for six consecutive trading days, so it's not as if the CFO announcement or B. Riley's updated outlook were the lone culprits here. Even Wednesday's press release by IMAX, bragging about shattering opening-day records in China with  -- the movie based on  's(NASDAQ: ATVI) blockbuster PC game franchise -- couldn't lift the stock.Then again, all it took was $5.33 million in sales across 290 IMAX screens in China to break the record. It's also fair to say that  's appeal in China is unique and may not last long. Chinese gaming leader  (NASDAQ: NTES) has been Activision Blizzard's partner for years. NetEase put out its licensed version of  in China seven years ago, building an audience in the world's most populous nation. NetEase's success in promoting the Activision Blizzard property probably played a big part in the initial push for tickets, but critics have generally panned the flick that opened in U.S. IMAX screens two days later.IMAX has built its model to withstand the duds. It's grown its installed base to the point where there's no shortage of IMAX remastered films in the pipeline. With more than 1,000 IMAX screens worldwide, a movie studio doesn't put out a potential blockbuster without giving it the IMAX treatment.Even B. Riley & Co. isn't turning bearish on the stock. It feels that a ho-hum current quarter may weigh on the stock, but it sees healthy catalysts for growth in 2017 and 2018. It also feels that concerns of the recent weakness have already been worked into the stock, hence the move to reiterate its bullish call while simply adjusting the price target lower to reflect market apathy. may prove to be a disappointment for IMAX, but theatrical releases are part of a game that never ends. The long-term outlook remains bullish here, even if there may be some hiccups in the coming weeks.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Some saw the 49% premium on LNKD's Friday share price as expensive, while others saw the buyout as a potential opportunity for Microsoft to build on going forward.Whichever position you take, one can't help but wonder about what other tech companies Microsoft could have bought for $26 billion. Some of the notable tech companies which make the qualifying list below might surprise you. They may even have you wondering why Microsoft didn't buy them instead of LinkedIn. It's worth noting, however, that if any of the following companies were to be acquired, then they would probably be bought out at a price tag that exceeds $26 billion. After Microsoft's aggressive purchase of LinkedIn, folks can't help but wonder about whom the next acquisition target will be as MSFT moves forward.Applied Materials is a leader in materials engineering solutions for computer chips and advanced displays.

The stock is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and AMAT is coming off of a fresh earning beat which has propelled its stock 18% higher. The company's earnings and guidance came in well above expectations, which is a very promising sign for the company. In spite of the large share price increase, AMAT's stock is still cheaper than LinkedIn's acquisition price tag. Applied Materials' market cap stands at $25.54 billion. | The Hewlett-Packard Company split into two corporations in November of 2015. The move was made in an attempt to streamline and simplify the corporation's business processes. HPQ is focused on selling printers and personal computers. The company is the larger of the two split companies, and it has a market cap of $22.47 billion.Hewlett-Packard generated sales of $103 billion in 2015. HP Inc. won't generate this level of revenues because of the split, but it still has a lot to be desired in a potential acquisition deal. The company has intangible assets which could end up being very valuable for a computer giant like Microsoft. HPQ is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), and it has an \"A\" for Value in our Style Scores. Acquisition targets are typically assessed based on how attractive their EV/EBITDA ratio is. A lower amount signifies a cheaper deal. HP's EV/EBITDA is 2.56, which is way ahead of the industry's average EV/EBITDA of 2.56. | NetEase Inc. is a China-based internet company focused on providing services with developing applications, online services, and other technologies for the internet in China. It should be noted that NetEase also creates in-house developed games and licensed titles. The company has a wide reach online, providing advertising, email, micro-blogging services, and more. NetEase has a market cap that is just under $22 billion.NTES is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and it grew revenues by 86.4% between 2014 and 2015. The company continues to grow quickly, and its share price has more than doubled since 2014. NetEase is very profitable, and its net margin of 29% is proof of this. It is very promising to see that sales are projected to grow by 43.73% this year. The company has a solid balance sheet, with low debt and high amounts of equity.

From artificial intelligence, to virtual reality, or even self-driving cars, the company has technologies to help in advancing these fields.Nvidia is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), and its stock has a weighted average VGM score of \"A\" for metrics that cover growth, value, and momentum. The company's earnings are projected to grow by 44% this year. This is a significant amount of earnings growth expected given the fact that sales are projected to grow by just 11% this year. Nvidia's valuations are a bit lofty, but that may be warranted, given the fact that there are still higher long term growth expectations for the company. | Some of these companies look as though they have some substance to offer Microsoft with regards to generating earnings. LinkedIn has never been a stellar candidate on the income front, which is a key feature distinguishing it from any of the companies above. That being said, the acquisition was done for a strategic purpose.Microsoft wants to access data on LinkedIn's plus 400 million professional profiles, and use that data to merge it with the professional cloud.

LeakedSource is a search engine for stolen data and currently has over 1.8 billion leaked records, which are accessible for a fee.LeakedSource named the source as Tessa88@exploit.im, who provided it with the Twitter data.The report also adds that Twitter's systems weren't likely compromised but the data including passwords was hacked over a period of time by malware-affected browsers that saved and sent back the information to the hackers. This is because Twitter doesn't store passwords in plain text but Chrome and Firefox do so. This indicates that the passwords were stolen directly from consumers.The onslaught was particularly severe in Russia with nearly 7.4 million accounts being hacked. Moreover, LeakedSource, also said that the breach was no hoax as \"out of 15 users we asked, all 15 verified their passwords\". LeakedSource now has transferred the huge cache of data to its database but will let affected users remove the information for free.A Twitter spokesperson later clarified that Twitter systems haven't been breached and that it has notified its millions of affected users.Earlier, social media services like MySpace, LinkedIn  and Tumblr also faced a similar situation where sensitive information of their users was put up for sale. Reportedly LinkedIn had about 117 million accounts hacked in May this year. Recently, many high profile Twitter accounts like that of Katy Perry and Facebook's  CEO Mark Zuckerberg have been hacked. Even Twitter's NFL account was hacked to spread false rumors about the death of NFL commissioner Roger Goodell.With the growing importance of digital activity, data theft has become a major concern. Users have been repeatedly warned to keep different passwords for multiple accounts so that hacking one account (for e.g. a social media account) doesn't put other important ones (like bank accounts) at risk. Moreover, the usage of a password manager like 1Password, and KeePass is recommended.At present, Twitter carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock worth considering in the same space is NetEase Inc  , which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Currently, even if Zuckerberg ceases to be Facebook's chief he will still carry maximum voting rights.At its annual meeting on Jun 20, the board will propose that all of Zuckerberg's Class B shares be converted to Class A shares in case he quits his CEO duties. Also, he will not be allowed to pass any of his Class B shares to his family even in case of his death so that the selection of a new CEO is on the basis of merit.As per the SEC filing, the board said \"these new terms thus ensure that we will not remain a founder-controlled company after we cease to be a founder-led company.\" The board further added \"the Special Committee and the board of directors also believe that the quality of a chief executive officer who would step into the role under these circumstances is likely to be significantly lower than it would be if we were no longer controlled by Mr. Zuckerberg, which could result in the potential loss of significant value for us.\"Zuckerberg literally exercises absolute voting power. As of Jun 2, 2016, Zuckerberg had 419 million shares of Class B or 53.8% of voting power. Facebook has a dual class structure. Notably, Class B shares have 10 times the voting rights of Class A shares. Class B shares aren't traded and are held mostly by Facebook executives. Zuckerberg also has over 4 million Class A shares as well, nearly 15% of total outstanding economic interests of the company.The latest development pertains to the company's announcement of the creation of publicly listed but non-voting new Class C shares in April, which if adopted will solidify Zuckerberg's position in the company. The idea behind the creation of this new class of shares is to allow Zuckerberg to hold his sway over the company while continuing his charitable work. In December, Zuckerberg had said that he and his wife plan to give 99% of their  , valued at $45 billion then, over their entire lifetime, to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative LLC, a limited liability company for the betterment of the society.It actually would be interesting (or not) to see what happens at the annual general meeting, given that Zuckerberg has 54% of the voting rights. Also, it is important to keep in mind that investors remain impressed with Facebook's phenomenal performance in back-to-back quarters, driven by its founder's sheer business acumen. Moreover, he has outlined a very ambitious and envious roadmap for the next 10 years that aims at building the company into something much bigger than just a social media platform.At present, Facebook sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Other stocks worth considering include NetEase, Inc  , 58.com Inc  and DST Systems Inc  . All carry the same rank as Facebook.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The deal worth $300 million encompasses providing IT infrastructure as a service (IaaS), helping the airlines to improve its passenger support system operations over the next decade.Emirates Airline, one of the biggest airlines in terms of international traffic, is one of IBM's long standing customers. Emirates has been using IBM z Systems Technology for the last three decades for intricate operations like flight information & reservations, ticketing and check in. It has also employed IBM's services to enhance its Passenger Service System (PSS).As per the new deal, IBM services will allow Emirates to \"encrypt data in near real-time\". IBM also said that the platform will allow \"the airline to build new apps that will support the API Economy - a commercial exchange of business functions, capabilities, or competencies as services packaged in APIs\".Last September, IBM struck a 10 year partnership worth $700 million with Abu Dhabi based Etihad for providing a multitude of services including IBM's latest mobile and cloud technologies and services to improve operations and security. The deal also covered Etihad's seven partner airlines. Moreover, IBM will build a cloud data center in Abu Dhabi for Etihad.IBM is currently undergoing a painfully long drawn transformation in its business model. It is moving away from its traditional businesses to newer (read lucrative) business avenues like cloud and data analytics. Though IBM's Strategic Imperatives are performing well but these are not enough to make up for the weakness in its traditional business. However, we believe that over the long run these efforts should yield positive results for the company.Currently IBM carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Blackburn alleged that the company had terminated her service when she resisted some manipulative accounting practices in Oracle's cloud-computing business.Oracle in its defense stated that \"We are confident that all our cloud accounting is proper and correct. This former employee worked at Oracle for less than a year and did not work in the accounting group. She was terminated for poor performance.\"However, Blackburn, a certified financial analyst, claimed that she had received a positive performance review just a couple of months before she was fired in Oct 2015.If this was not enough, yesterday evening the company had another lawsuit filed against it, this time by an Oracle investor. Grover M. Klarfeld has alleged Oracle of \"improper accounting practices to inflate the company's cloud-computing revenues by millions of dollars\" as per a Wall Street Journal report.For the last few months, the company has been entangled in one lawsuit after another, raising concerns for its investors. Last week, Oracle lost its six-year old lawsuit against Alphabet  . Oracle had sought $9.3 billion as compensation from Alphabet for unauthorized usage of Java APIs in its Android operating system. However, a 10-member jury found no copyright violations by Google. Oracle, however, is planning to appeal against the verdict.Furthermore, the company is also entangled in a legal battle with Hewlett Packard Enterprise  for the last five years, fresh trials for which started earlier this week. HP Enterprise wants $3 billion in compensation from Oracle for allegedly causing a decline in demand for its Itanium based products.We believe that owing to these legal battles (some of which are not in the company's favor), Oracle shares might remain range bound in the near term amid increasing uncertainty.At present, Oracle carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Rate hike possibilities increased following a series of encouraging economic reports and indications to that effect in the FOMC Minutes.Additionally, the Fed Chair also hinted that a rate hike was likely in June. Initially, investors remained wary of the consequences of a rate hike. However, by the end of the month they were increasingly coming to terms with rate hike possibilities following speculation that a rate hike may indicate moderate economic growth.For the month, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq advanced 0.1%, 1.5% and 3.6%, respectively. The technology sector was the biggest gainer during the month, while energy stocks were biggest laggards.Meanwhile, FOMC's minutes, higher-than-expected economic data and Fed officials' comments boosted June rate hike chances, which weighed on investor sentiment. However, immediate rate increase possibilities pushed financials stocks upward and eventually had broad-based positive impact on markets. Oil prices rose in May, registering four straight monthly increases following multiple disruptions in global crude production.Earnings were a mixed bag while Apple Inc  hit its worst closing level since June 2014, following concerns over a slump in iPhone sales. However, shares of Apple increased after in a regulatory filing Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  reported that it has acquired 9.8 million shares or $1 billion stake in Apple during the first quarter.Oil prices rallied strongly during May even as a production freeze agreement remained elusive. Prices declined over the first week of the month, following China's growth worries and concerns over global crude supply glut. Rise in crude production in Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Iran, and weekly increase in U.S. commercial crude oil inventories raised worries over global crude oversupply.By the second week, supply shortages were boosting prices. Disruptions in Nigeria and Canada reduced crude oversupply worries by a significant extent, which also pushed oil prices upward. Both the WTI crude and Brent crude rose 3.5% and 5.3%, respectively for the week.Crude prices hit a six-month high on May 16. During the third week of the month, Goldman Sachs  said there was a deficit in crude production following production disruptions in Nigeria and Canada.

Baker Hughes Inc.  reported a decline in U.S. rig counts from 318 to 316 for the week ending May 27. Recent production disruptions and decline in U.S. commercial crude inventories and rig counts helped prices post their third straight weekly rise.The \"second\" estimate by the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed that first quarter output of goods and services increased at an annual rate of 0.8%, lower than the consensus estimate of 0.9% increase. However, first-quarter GDP data was revised upward from the previously estimated 0.5% rise.The most notable feature of the report was evidence that corporate earnings were stabilizing. For a long time, this metric has been weighed down by a strong dollar and a downturn in the energy sector. Pretax corporate profits increased by 0.3%, the first sign of growth seen since early 2015.Even though the estimate remained unchanged, personal consumption came in at a healthy 1.9% for the first quarter. Meanwhile expenditure on new home construction jumped to 17.1% for the first quarter compared with the earlier estimate of 14.8%. This is the largest such increase in around four years.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the U.S. economy created a total of 160,000 jobs in April, significantly lower than the consensus estimate of 203,000. The tally was also considerably lower than March's downwardly revised job number of 208,000. The Labor Department also revised down jobs growth in the previous two months by 19,000.Moreover, the unemployment rate in April was in line with the consensus estimate and March's rate of 5%. Further, labor force participation rate fell 62.8%, declining for the first time in 7 months as 300,000 individuals quit jobs or gave up jobs searches.However, the average hourly earnings gained 0.3% or 8 cents in April from previous month's figure to $25.53 per hour, in line with the consensus estimate. This was the third highest monthly gain in a year. The average hourly earnings also witnessed a 2.5% rise from the year-ago figure.Data released through the month was mostly encouraging in nature. ISM Services Index increased in March, indicating expansion in servicing activity for the 75th straight month. New orders for manufactured goods increased 1.1% in March. Durable orders increased 3.4% in April to $235.9 billion, as compared to a rise of 1.9% in March.

Moreover, there were reports that Microsoft  is gearing up to release a VR capable Xbox sometime in 2017. Activision Blizzard  launched its new title, Overwatch after a long time.1.  GameStop posted first quarter of fiscal 2016 results wherein both adjusted earnings and revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, adjusted earnings per share decreased 2.9%, whereas net sales declined 4.3% year over year during the quarter under review. The decrease in video games sales resulted in the year-over-year deterioration. Also, a tepid outlook for the current quarter caused shares to sink over 7% in the aftermarket session yesterday.2. Sony recently issued a  for fiscal 2016, ending Mar 31, 2017. The release of the forecast was postponed due to the Kumamoto earthquakes, the worst quake in Japan's recent memory. Sony had previously hinted at possibilities of the earthquake affecting earnings of its segments, including Game & Network Services (\"G&NS\"). However, PlayStation4 software and hardware, which have been major contributors to revenue, are expected to remain strong even in the current fiscal. The weakness in Mobile Communications (MC), Imaging Products & Solutions (IP&S), Home Entertainment & Sound (HE&S) is expected to offset strong sales at the segment, along with Pictures and Financial Services.3. As per gaming site Kotaku,  . This includes a smaller, and cheaper model of Xbox slated for launch this year while a more powerful model will be launched in 2017 that will support 4K gaming. It will also be compatible with Facebook, Inc.'s  Oculus Rift VR headset. Microsoft's collaboration with Oculus enables Rift headsets to connect to Windows 10 PCs and stream Xbox One games. Moreover, Oculus is deploying Xbox One controller for Rift as its own Oculus Touch motion controllers are expected to be released in the second half of 2016. AR/ VR is the future of gaming. Apparently, even Sony is also developing a new version PS4 console for 4K gaming. Yesterday, Sony announced that PS4 has sold 40 million units as of May 22, 2016, making it the \"fastest selling console in the PlayStation history\".4. Among other developments, Microsoft collaborated with NetEase  to break through the Great Wall of China. Through the NetEase collaboration, Microsoft will launch (both PC & mobile version) its popular game Minecraft in China. Reportedly, Mojang, the developer behind Minecraft along with NetEase is expected to create a new version suitable for Chinese audience and subsequently distribute it via one of NetEase's subsidiaries.5. Video game publishing giant, Activision Blizzard recently launched its highly anticipated new title OverWatch, a team based first person shooter game. It is the company's first new franchise in 17 years and to Activision's pleasure, the game has received an overwhelming response. The game at present has a rating of 4.5/5 on Metacritic and a whopping 10/10 on Destructoid. Not just gaming enthusiasts, even analysts view this as a \"major catalyst\" for Activision going ahead. As per a media report, the title is expected to sell 5 to 7 million copies in the second quarter of 2016 and it considers  with sales of over 9 million copies at launch as the \"best comparison\". It's early to say anything about the future of this franchise but expectedly, Activision will leave no stone unturned to develop this franchise into the leagues of super successful titles like World of Warcraft and Diablo. If it can duplicate the success, it will boost its already strong IP library. And this should help Activision's long term goal of becoming an all round media entertainment giant. The company releases its first movie based on World Of Warcraft, titled Warcraft in June this year.The following table shows the price movement of the major video game companies over both the past five trading days as well as the last six months:\n  \nOver the last five trading sessions, all stocks were up with the exception of Electronic Arts  , which was down 0.12%.NetEase was the highest gainer, up 6.55%.Over the last 6-month period, Take Two  surged the most - nearly 8.51%. We believe that Take Two is well positioned to benefit from higher sales of the digital version of itsgames, which is also adding to the company's margins. The company continues to expect growth in digital revenues and increases in recurrent consumer spending.However, Glu Mobile, Inc.  was down 29.5% over the same time frame due to underperformance of most of its releases this year. But strong first quarter results, share repurchase authorization and its new Britney Spears and a Taylor Swift game should make investors happy.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As per media reports, Oracle's damage expert James Malackowski had claimed $8.8 billion as compensation for profits made by Google in addition to $475 million in damages. A booming smartphone market especially for Android run devices in the last few years is a contributing factor to the mammoth compensation demanded by Oracle.The dispute has been going on for the past six years now. Oracle had first sued Alphabet, then Google. It claimed that Google in order to take a leading position in the mobile market was scrambling to launch its operating system and therefore used Java unauthorized as it was a well-known script with a lot of programmers then. However, Google denied such allegations and maintained that the usage of Java APIs was protected under the \"fair use\" clause \"which permits copying under limited circumstances.\"Java was developed in the early 1990s by Sun Microsystems, which was taken over by Oracle in 2010.In May 2012, Alphabet had initially gained an edge as the Northern District of California Judge William Asylup ruled that APIs are not copyrightable. However, next year, a U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the district court's ruling, thereby bringing some relief for Oracle.But at the same time, it gave Alphabet a breather in the form of the \"fair use\" defense clause \"which permits copying under limited circumstances.\" In Oct 2014, Alphabet filed a petition in Supreme Court but SCOTUS turned it down and redirected it to a district court.The ruling was welcomed by Silicon Valley as they apprehended that a decision in Oracle's favor could prove detrimental to innovation since programmers use open source APIs across various interfaces for developing codes. Analysts observe that if Oracle had won, it would have been a very puzzling situation for developers as to which APIs can be accessed and which are off limits. Further, they added that it would have marred \"software cooperation\" and made the process expensive, the eventual burden of which would fall on consumers.In an email, Google said \"Today's verdict that Android makes fair use of Java APIs represents a win for the Android ecosystem, for the Java programming community, and for software developers who rely on open and free programming languages to build innovative consumer products.\"However, Oracle is not willing to accept this decision. The company is planning to appeal against the verdict. Oracle general counsel Dorian Daley was quoted saying \"Oracle brought this lawsuit to put a stop to Google's illegal behavior. We believe there are numerous grounds for appeal.\"At present, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) whereas Oracle carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Better-ranked tech stocks include NetEase, Inc.

Rate hike possibilities increased following a series of encouraging economic reports and indications to that effect in the FOMC Minutes.Additionally, the Fed Chair also hinted that a rate hike was likely in June. Initially, investors remained wary of the consequences of a rate hike. However, by the end of the month they were increasingly coming to terms with rate hike possibilities following speculation that a rate hike may indicate moderate economic growth.For the month, the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq advanced 0.1%, 1.5% and 3.6%, respectively. The technology sector was the biggest gainer during the month, while energy stocks were biggest laggards.Meanwhile, FOMC's minutes, higher-than-expected economic data and Fed officials' comments boosted June rate hike chances, which weighed on investor sentiment. However, immediate rate increase possibilities pushed financials stocks upward and eventually had broad-based positive impact on markets. Oil prices rose in May, registering four straight monthly increases following multiple disruptions in global crude production.Earnings were a mixed bag while Apple hit its worst closing level since June 2014, following concerns over a slump in iPhone sales. However, shares of Apple increased after in a regulatory filing Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported that it has acquired 9.8 million shares or $1 billion stake in Apple during the first quarter.Oil prices rallied strongly during May even as a production freeze agreement remained elusive. Prices declined over the first week of the month, following China's growth worries and concerns over global crude supply glut. Rise in crude production in Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Iran, and weekly increase in U.S. commercial crude oil inventories raised worries over global crude oversupply.By the second week, supply shortages were boosting prices. Disruptions in Nigeria and Canada reduced crude oversupply worries by a significant extent, which also pushed oil prices upward. Both the WTI crude and Brent crude rose 3.5% and 5.3%, respectively for the week.Crude prices hit a six-month high on May 16. During the third week of the month, Goldman Sachs said there was a deficit in crude production following production disruptions in Nigeria and Canada. Also, U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported a fall in gasoline inventories by 2.5 million barrels for the week ended May 13.Prices staged their greatest rally in seven years, crossing the $50 mark on May 26. Baker Hughes reported a decline in U.S. rig counts from 318 to 316 for the week ending May 27. Recent production disruptions and decline in U.S. commercial crude inventories and rig counts helped prices post their third straight weekly rise.The \"second\" estimate by the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed that first quarter output of goods and services increased at an annual rate of 0.8%, lower than the consensus estimate of 0.9% increase. However, first-quarter GDP data was revised upward from the previously estimated 0.5% rise.The most notable feature of the report was evidence that corporate earnings were stabilizing. For a long time, this metric has been weighed down by a strong dollar and a downturn in the energy sector. Pretax corporate profits increased by 0.3%, the first sign of growth seen since early 2015.Even though the estimate remained unchanged, personal consumption came in at a healthy 1.9% for the first quarter. Meanwhile expenditure on new home construction jumped to 17.1% for the first quarter compared with the earlier estimate of 14.8%. This is the largest such increase in around four years.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the U.S. economy created a total of 160,000 jobs in April, significantly lower than the consensus estimate of 203,000. The tally was also considerably lower than March's downwardly revised job number of 208,000. The Labor Department also revised down jobs growth in the previous two months by 19,000.Moreover, the unemployment rate in April was in line with the consensus estimate and March's rate of 5%. Further, labor force participation rate fell 62.8%, declining for the first time in 7 months as 300,000 individuals quit jobs or gave up jobs searches.However, the average hourly earnings gained 0.3% or 8 cents in April from previous month's figure to $25.53 per hour, in line with the consensus estimate. This was the third highest monthly gain in a year. The average hourly earnings also witnessed a 2.5% rise from the year-ago figure.Data released through the month was mostly encouraging in nature. ISM Services Index increased in March, indicating expansion in servicing activity for the 75th straight month. New orders for manufactured goods increased 1.1% in March. Durable orders increased 3.4% in April to $235.9 billion, as compared to a rise of 1.9% in March. PPI for finished goods increased 0.2% in April while core PPI increased 0.1%.Retail sales rose 1.3% in April reaching its highest level since March 2015. The reading was also favorable compared to March's fall of 0.3%. Industrial production rebounded from a 0.9% decline in March to rise by 0.7% in April, posting its highest percentage increase since Nov 2014. Also, capacity utilization advanced from 74.9% to 75.4% in April.The lone disappointment was the ISM manufacturing index, which decreased from 51.8% in March to 50.8% in April.May's housing indicators revealed that the housing sector was growing at a faster clip in spring. Sales of new single-family homes rose by 16.6% in April, its highest monthly percentage rise in 24 years. Moreover, existing home sales rose for the second straight month in April, per data released by the National Association of Realtors on May 20.

We were also unable to substantiate any of the specific allegations of politically-motivated suppression of particular subjects or sources\".Earlier this month, a Gizmodo report, quoting an unnamed ex-Facebook contractor, alleged that Facebook intentionally concealed conservative news. The report caused massive uproar and prompted Senator John Thune to write a letter to Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg demanding an explanation.After the allegations surfaced and the Senator's letter, Facebook posted a full account of how \"Trending Topics\" selection works on its website. Zuckerberg also met fifteen key conservative leaders to assure them that Facebook is not prejudiced.However, in the yesterday's blog post, Facebook did not deny the likelihood of human error. As a result, to minimize such instances, the social media service has outlined new measures. These include updating the terminology in its Guidelines for better understanding and providing refresher training for all reviewers. It will also do away with relying on external news websites \"to identify, validate or assess the importance of particular topics\".Facebook will be \"removing the ability to assign an importance level to a topic through assessment of the topic's prominence on the top-10 list of news outlets\".

's(NASDAQ: MSFT) Mojang has announced that it is bringing its popular  game to mainland China.

Mojang says it will develop a version of  that is localized and tailored for the Chinese market.Generally speaking, China has always been a tough geographical market for Microsoft to succeed in, due largely to high software piracy rates around its flagship products like Windows and Office. But the gaming market in China is extremely large, making it worthwhile to find new distribution methods. That's why partnering with a Chinese company like NetEase makes sense, since NetEase understands the Chinese market better.Last year, China ended its 15-year ban on video game consoles, which opened up a lot of potential for Microsoft's Xbox One. However, console sales have been reportedly low since China is primarily a PC gaming market. Still, China is the largest smartphone market in the world now, and launching  in China will give the software giant a shot at the growing mobile gaming market.I don't know about you, but I always pay attention when one of the best growth investors in the world gives me a stock tip.

At the same time, high speeds lead to increased data consumption and therefore, increasing data costs, which are a deterrent to the growth of its user base.As such, in the past, Netflix has had tiffs with several telecom providers over their efforts to collect fees to create fast lanes for those services that consume more data. If this became the practice Netflix would have to pay for good data speeds, which would hurt profits. This led it, along with several other Internet service providers to advocate net neutrality. Fast forward to the present and you see the company taking a unilateral decision to cut streaming speed to 600Kps in order to curb data bills for its customers.And that isn't all. Netflix is also included in the 'Binge On' initiative from T-Mobile, which exempted it along with some others from its customers' monthly data cap. This actually gave Netflix an edge over other streaming peers like Alphabet's  YouTube which wasn't offered the same privilege. YouTube thereafter took the matter to the EFF, which got the FCC to look into T-Mobile's practices. This is what led Netflix over to look for other ways to serve its data-sensitive customers.To overcome this problem, a few months back Netflix came up with a data- saver solution that allowed users to control their streaming quality, if required. Besides, Netflix already has an ISP Index that measures the average data speeds across countries and providers on a monthly basis and during prime time hours. However, this was not enough as users could not get the required information in real time.Through Fast.com, users will get real time data speed as offered by their Internet service providers. Netflix, it seems, is attempting to increase transparency so that users know when they are unable to stream due to connectivity problems. The company's blog said that \"When you're experiencing streaming issues, fast.com allows you to check the download speeds you're getting from your Internet service provider.\" So the ball is clearly in the telecoms' court now.Going ahead, we expect that Netflix will link this commercial-free website to its own platform and app as well. In addition, there are talks regarding a downloadable software version of the service to be made available in the future.Fast.com will likely be a key tool for Netflix in the future, especially when it comes to its relations with telecom providers. Moreover, it does give users enough flexibility to view their favorite Netflix programs while keeping a tab on their connection costs.At present, Netflix has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology space include Paylocity Holding Corp.  and NetEase, Inc.  , both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

They argue that the 140 character limit was developed as initially users used the SMS service to compose tweets, which itself had a 160 character cut off. Over time, this limit became Twitter's USP. However, with ever increasing media content like videos, photos and links, this 140 character limit started proving to be a hurdle to attract new users. A link constitutes 23 characters.Twitter at present is struggling to grow users. After user growth came to a standstill in the fourth quarter of 2015, Twitter did manage to record user growth in the first quarter of 2016, although it wasn't an impressive number. Twitter's users grew from 305 million monthly average users (MAUs) to 310 million, a jump of 1.6% sequentially.To increase users, the micro blogging site has been overhauling its features under Dorsey. In January this year, there were rumors of Twitter mulling on extending its character limit to 10K as it did with direct messages. However, CEO Jack Dorsey dismissed rumors of expanding the signature tweet limit of 140 characters to 10K, saying, \"It's staying. It's a good constraint for us, and it allows for of-the-moment brevity\", at The Today Show.Earlier, Twitter introduced a new way to display tweets. Consequently, tweets people \"care about\" would be displayed at the top of the timeline whereas the remaining tweets will appear below, in reverse chronological order. Further, Twitter announced the integration of its live video streaming app Periscope in its feed. It had earlier expanded the tweet limit on direct messages to 10K from 140 characters.Twitter swapped the \"favorites\" button for a \"likes\" button to make the service easy to use. Moreover, to attract users, Twitter said that tweets would now appear in Google search. Earlier, the launch of its news curation tool, Moments was also a step in that direction. Some these changes have met with severe criticism.At present, Twitter carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n a landmark ruling, a 10-member jury has found no copyright violations of  .'s  Java APIs by  while developing its Android system.Oracle sought $9.3 billion as compensation from Alphabet for unauthorized usage of Java APIs in its Android operating system. As per media reports, Oracle's damage expert James Malackowski had claimed $8.8 billion as compensation for profits made by Google in addition to $475 million in damages. A booming smartphone market especially for Android run devices in the last few years is a contributing factor to the mammoth compensation demanded by Oracle.The dispute has been going on for the past six years now. Oracle had first sued Alphabet, then Google. It claimed thatGoogle in order to take a leading position in the mobile market was scrambling to launch its operating system and therefore used Java unauthorized as it was a well-known script with a lot of programmers then. However, Google denied such allegations and maintained that the usage of Java APIs was protected under the \"fair use\" clause \"which permits copying under limited circumstances.\"Java was developed in the early 1990s by Sun Microsystems, which was taken over by Oracle in 2010.In May 2012, Alphabet had initially gained an edge as the Northern District of California Judge William Asylup ruled that APIs are not copyrightable. However, next year, a U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the district court's ruling, thereby bringing some relief for Oracle.But at the same time, it gave Alphabet a breather in the form of the \"fair use\" defense clause \"which permits copying under limited circumstances.\" In Oct 2014, Alphabet filed a petition in Supreme Court but SCOTUS turned it down and redirected it to a district court.The ruling was welcomed by Silicon Valley as they apprehended that a decision in Oracle's favour could prove detrimental to innovation since programmers use open source APIs across various interfaces for developing codes. Analysts observe that if Oracle had won, it would have been a very puzzling situation for developers as to which APIs can be accessed and which are off limits. Further, they added that it would have marred \"software cooperation\" and made the process expensive, the eventual burden of which would fall on consumers.In an email, Google said \"Today's verdict that Android makes fair use of Java APIs represents a win for the Android ecosystem, for the Java programming community, and for software developers who rely on open and free programming languages to build innovative consumer products.\"However, Oracle is not willing to accept this decision. The company is planning to appeal against the verdict. Oracle general counsel Dorian Daley was quoted saying \"Oracle brought this lawsuit to put a stop to Google's illegal behavior. We believe there are numerous grounds for appeal.\"At present, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) whereas Oracle carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

On occasion, my morning commute can get pretty crowded and there is little room for me to browse my phone. This can be upsetting as this is a good time to absorb as much  as possible.When I find myself in this predicament I like to observe and watch what others are doing on the car. I try to pick up on trends, fashions, habits, electronic preferences and even popular music if I'm unlucky enough. Lately, I've noticed one trend that seems to be taking over my fellow city dwellers commute time: mobile gaming.All around me, I see every age playing seemingly every mobile game available. Whether it's Clash of Clans, Candy Crush or even the classic Tetris, people are addicted and becoming comfortable playing and paying for these types of games.And the numbers are showing just that it's not just a trend on the Brown Line in Chicago. Looking at the chart below we see that not only is gaming popular, but tablets, smartphones and watches are looking at double digit revenue growth going into 2018. During the same time, TV/console gaming is expected to fall.The companies involved in this transfer of gaming to mobile are seeing benefits in the form of solid revenue and EPS growth. Below I list three companies that are taking advantage of the mobile consumer and are either Zacks Ranked #1(Strong Buy) or #2(Buy) stocks. is a Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy) that is an Internet technology company engaged in the development of applications, services and other technologies for the Internet in China. The company partners with Blizzard Entertainment and also provides email, ecommerce, and advertising services. The Beijing based company was founded in 1997 and has almost 13,000 employees.Netease has a market cap of $20 billion and a forward PE of 16. The stock sports a Style Score of \"B\" in Growth and Momentum and pays a yield of 2% after a 14% dividend raise last week.The company reported Q1 earnings on May 11th in which it saw EPS at $2.88 verse the $2.31 expected. Revenue came in at $1.23 Billion, a 116.3% jump year over year. The online gaming segment revenue came in at 6.0 Billion Yuan verse the 2.9 Billion year over year, more than doubling last year's numbers.The beat was the fifth straight surprise to the upside and the stock has jumped over 10% since the numbers were released. There is reason to believe this price momentum continues as estimates have shot through the roof. In addition, Nettease has seen upgrades from multiple brokerages, with price targets near $200. is a Zacks Rank #2(Buy) that develops, publishes and distributes game software content and online services for video game consoles, personal computers, mobile phones and tablets. The company was founded in 1982 and operates in tow segments: EA Core and EA.com, the later handling the online portion of the business. Popular games include EA sports, Madden, Plants vs Zombies, Dragon Age and The Sims.EA has a market cap of almost $23 Billion and a forward PE of 42. The stock sports a Zacks Style Score of \"C\" in Growth and \"B\" in Momentum. The company pays no dividend, but sees expected EPS growth rate of 15%.On May 10th the company reported Q4 earnings, beating on revenues and surprising by 8 cents to the upside. While EA is a more traditional video game developer, they have transitioned into online and mobile applications that have been received well.EA now reports more than 54 million unique players engaged with EA SPORTS console titles during fiscal year 2016, up 65% from last year. In addition popular games like Star Wars Battlefront, The Sims 4 and Madden NFL mobile are seeing double digit growth.The earnings beat was the company's twelfth straight beat. Looking forward to the current year, estimates have been are heading higher over the last month, from $3.02 to $3.08. If mobile and online gaming continues its momentum, we should see more beats from EA and a possible breakout above the $76 level. is a Zacks Rank #2(Buy) that is a Mobile-based social networking platform that also offers mobile gaming services. The company also provides membership subscriptions and other services for mobile marketing services. The Beijing based company has almost 800 employees.Momo has a market cap of $2 billion and a Forward PE of 45. The company sports a Zacks Style Score of \"B\" in Growth and \"A\" in Momentum. There are obvious valuation concerns for investors as the high PE gives the stock a Style Score of \"F\" in Value.Momo is another play on China mobile gaming and if the numbers are anything like Netease we should see a pop in the stock when the report on May 17th. This stock is flush with short sellers with 36% of the float short that will have to cover if Momo puts together a solid quarter.The stock has been pretty volatile since becoming an IPO, this quarter could help the it finally pick a direction and start to trend.Observing what people are doing around you can lead to some quality investment ideas. Mobile gaming isn't just a fad; it's seemingly an addiction that all ages are getting comfortable with. Whether in China or the US the companies that develop and make money off providing the games are benefiting. As this story plays out, pay attention to the growth numbers of each company in mobile and keep your money with the winners.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download  .

The terms of the deal haven't been divulged.Univision Network will broadcast Netflix's Spanish 10 part original series Narcos ahead of its second season premiere while UniMas will air Club de Cuervos. Crime thriller, Narcos is based on the life of a Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar and has been highly acclaimed with a couple of Golden Globe nominations in its kitty. Club de Cuervos is a comedy-drama about a family fighting it out to retain rights of a football team.Netflix COO Ted Sarandos said \"Narcos' is a huge global success on Netflix and sampling the series to every single Spanish-speaking living room in the U.S. will give additional viewers the opportunity to fall in love with its unique storytelling. Promoting these original shows on Univision is a great way to further reach Hispanic audiences and help them discover Netflix\".Netflix also said that it will collaborate with Univision to produce another original series \"El Chapo\" based on one of the world's most notorious criminals, Mexican drug lord Joaquin Guzman. The show will be first aired on UniM\u00e1s in 2017 and then streamed on Netflix for U.S subscribers while for other countries it will be available only on Netflix.As per Variety, Netflix is eyeing growth in overseas markets and is rapidly investing in Spanish programming and views it as conducive to attracting Hispanic audiences in the U.S as well.Not just Spanish programming, Netflix is now focusing more than ever on producing more quality original content than ever to add as well as broadly diversify its subscriber base especially overseas. To establish itself as a leading content provider, the company is taking a number of initiatives including the development of more kids and family oriented content. The company had declared that in 2016 it will be launching as many as 31 original series (including both new and sequels), about 8 original feature films and 12 documentaries, 35 original kids series and 9 stand-up comedy shows.Developing its own IP (Intellectual Property) is definitely a good move, though it will add to costs. But it is likely to be a long-term growth driver. Such initiatives might enable it to secure its subscriber base even after the price hike. Even a survey report (April 2016) from Morgan Stanley stated that Netflix is gaining momentum in its original content offerings and has already surpassed HBO, which held the top spot in the space The company is expected to air 600 hours of original programming in 2016 compared with 320 hours in 2015.At present, Netflix is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The upside was primarily driven by strength in advertising related to Weibo  , though it was offset partially by the weakness in the portal advertising revenues.Non-advertising revenues rose 4.3% year over year to $35.7 million driven by strength in the both portal and Weibo businesses.Weibo revenues surged 23.9% year over year to $119.3 million. Monthly active users went up 32% year over year to 261 million. Daily active users for Weibo came in at 121 million at quarter-end. The strong growth momentum of Weibo advertising was driven by increasing adoption of mobile devices and improved monetization, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises.Portal revenues decreased 10.1% year over year to $79.4 million. Portal Advertising revenues decreased over 10% in the quarter to $63.7 million.The company's Weibo and Portal businesses have been impacted by the termination of the Alibaba contract (expired in Jan 2016). However, the company has been seeing strength in its non-Alibaba related revenues for Weibo, which improved 97% year over year and now represents 89% of total Weibo advertising revenues. Portal advertising revenues were affected to a greater extent because of the 72% decline in revenues from Alibaba.Non-GAAP gross margin increased 120 basis points on a year-over-year basis to 59.5%. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues declined to 63.6% from 71.8% in the prior-year quarter.Lower operating expenses in the quarter allowed the company to reduce its operating loss to $8.5 million in the quarter, as against $25.2 million in the year-ago quarter.SINA exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.19 billion compared with $2.21 billion as of Dec 31, 2015.Cash provided by operating activities in the quarter was $18.2 million.Despite a strong product pipeline, a robust user base for e-Commerce and Weibo, the company's business in this quarter was impacted by the non-renewal of the Alibaba contract. The equity loss from the company's investment in E-House also weighed on its financials this quarter.In addition, the company's business is also likely to be impacted by soft macroeconomic conditions in China. Also, significant restrictions on online search and other social-networking activities in the region remain concerns.Moreover, Weibo is expected to face stiff competition from the likes of WeChat in China, which may hurt its user base. We believe that Weibo's monetization ability will be a major driving factor for SINA amid intensifying competition from the likes of Sohu.com Inc.  and NetEase  in the video and brand advertising market.Currently, SINA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

There is little left that can change the scenario. To be honest, it hasn't been a very great quarter with growth concerns looming large over a number of key sectors including technology, which has traditionally remained immune to most macroeconomic disruptions.But this time around, even with low expectations, the tech sector has delivered a subpar performance. As of May 4,  from approximately 88.5% of the sector's total market capitalization in the S&P 500 index are out. On a consolidated basis, earnings from these companies have declined 5.6% year over year despite the fact that revenues grew 1% in the quarter.However, an important thing to note about the tech space is that stock price response to earnings has been the most pronounced. In fact, the average one-day negative stock price reaction has been maximum in this sector. But at the same time, there have been decent gains following a positive earnings announcement.Within the tech sector, let's have a closer look at a few software stocks like CA, Inc.  , Trend Micro Inc.  , NetEase, Inc.  and Rapid7, Inc.  which are scheduled to make their quarterly announcements on May 11. a leading information technology (IT) management software company, has an impeccable earnings record so far with an average positive earnings surprise of 7.3% in the trailing four quarters.

However, the company has a 0.00%  , which makes it difficult to conclusively predict an earnings beat this quarter.

In the trailing four quarters, the company recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 18.26%. This Zacks Rank #3 company has a 0.00% ESP as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $2.31. a software company providing endpoint, messaging and web security solutions, also has a Zacks Rank #3 and a 0.00% ESP. But it's important to note that the company has had a not-so-great earnings history, with the bottom line missing estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters. It has an average four-quarter negative surprise of 15.52%. In fact, in the last quarter, the company's earnings came in 40.48% below the Zacks Consensus Estimate. which is known for its security data and analytics offerings, beat earnings estimates in one quarter while falling short of expectations in two of the trailing three quarters. It is still not profitable. Moreover, this Hold-rated stock has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, which makes it difficult to predict a beat.The software space is relatively stable within the technology space, given consistently increasing demand.

This will also help the company to collect a lot of commute data that might come in handy for its self-driving car project.Available through Google-owned maps app Waze, the service is presently under beta testing with a handful of Bay Area companies including Adobe and Google itself.The service automatically matches drivers and riders based on their routes and departure times. An automatic transfer system sends gas money from passenger to driver.The service is similar to the ones offered by uberPOOL or Lyft Carpool, the only significant difference, as of now, being that drivers don't receive any money apart from the gas contribution. In a similar project piloted in Israel, Waze charged 15% of the amount drivers received from riders.Google's decision to avoid taking cuts from California transactions for now might be a strategy to get a quick grip on the ride-sharing business, collect related data and wrestle market share from Uber, Lyft and so forth.Google and Uber have worked closely so far. Google invested $250 million in Uber in 2013 and planned to include Uber rides in the Google Maps app. Alphabet's senior vice president for corporate development, David Drummond, is a board member at Uber.However, Uber's decision to develop its own mapping and driverless car technology is probably one of the reasons behind Google's decision to test its own car pooling service.At present, Google has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

For the reported quarter, the exact renewal rate figures will be available after 45 days from Mar 31, 2016. However, the company estimates it to be 74.2% compared with 73.4% in the year-ago quarter.VeriSign reported non-GAAP operating income of $178.5 million, up from $154.4 million in the prior-year quarter. The company's non-GAAP operating margin was 63.3% in the quarter, up from 59.7% in the prior-year quarter.Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was $196 million compared with $171.1 million in the year-ago quarter.Exiting the quarter, the company's cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities) were nearly 1.896 billion compared with $1.915 billion at the end of 2015.Operating cash flow in the year was approximately $143.6 million, up 8.3% year over year.VeriSign repurchased approximately $150 million worth of shares in the quarter.

VeriSign expects domain name base growth to be in a range of 1% to 2.5% (up from the earlier expected range of 0.5% to 2%).It continues to expect non-GAAP operating margin between 62.5% and 64%. Non-GAAP interest expense and non-operating income, net is expected to be within a range of $110 million and $116 million (lower than the earlier projection of $114 million to $120 million).The renewal of the .com contract and price hikes for the .com and .net domain names drive VeriSign's top line. In addition, an expected increase in domain name base will remain a key driver of its growth.Also, we believe that gTLD prospects, international expansion through IDNs and investments in intellectual properties will boost results over the long run. Additionally, VeriSign has significant growth opportunities in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) security market.However, the negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization and increasing operating expenses related to marketing remain primary near-term headwinds.

Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" is expected to report first-quarter 2016 results on May 11. Last quarter, it posted a positive surprise of 90.91%. However, the company posted an average negative surprise of 80.40% over the trailing four quarters.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.SINA has a strong product pipeline and is investing in product development and marketing. The company's robust user base for its e-Commerce and Weibo offerings are the positives.However, the company is expected to see some headwinds owing to the weakness in traditional brand advertising, especially for its portal. In addition, the company faces some challenges in its display advertising business owing to the ongoing transition from brand advertising to performance-based advertising. The company's business is also likely to be impacted by the soft macroeconomic conditions in China. In addition, significant restrictions on online search and other social-networking activities in the region remain concerns.Moreover, Weibo is expected to face stiff competition from the likes of WeChat in China, which may hurt its user base. However, we believe that Weibo's monetization ability will be a major driving factor for SINA amid intensifying competition from the likes of Sohu.com  and NetEase  in the video and brand advertising market.Our proven model does not conclusively show that SINA is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. SINA has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 12 cents. SINA has a Zacks Rank #3 which, when combined with a 0.00% ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here's a stock that you may want to consider as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarterThe Toronto-Dominion Bank  has an Earnings ESP of +6.90% and a Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Wouldn't a reasonable person at least have some\ndegree of responsibility to dig deeper into important matters such\nas therapies that\u00a0claim to save lives? Wei had sought treatment for a rare form of cancer he was suffering from, and took to BIDU's search engine, sometimes called the Chinese Google - a.k.a.  (  ,  ) - to search for treatments. There he would find a paid advertisement from a military hospital that flaunted high success rates for an experimental cancer treatment.China's internet regulator will look into Wei's claims, and obviously that's no good for BIDU stock. The risk here is unknowable, since the investigation could turn up a massive conspiracy or nothing at all.And, while this may sound like a somewhat cynical view, the investigation could also be nothing more than a political tool China's government itself is using to push Baidu around.China has recently been toying with the idea of taking 1% stakes - and a board seat - in major Chinese internet companies like BIDU,  (  ) and  (  ). It's hard to tell if the government is pressuring BIDU to submit to it and accept that fate.BIDU stock doesn't look so great from a technical analysis vantage point, either:It's a little muddled over on the far right, but if you look at the blue line - the moving average over the last 50 days - you'll see it's at $183.50. BIDU stock had been trading soundly above that level since late February.Today, the BIDU stock price broke below that point, indicating the beginning of a more bearish move. You can also see a little \"head and shoulders\" action going on - another bearish indicator.In any case, the fresh investigation into its advertising practices isn't something shareholders want to hear.With the Chinese government wielding enormous power to levy the sorts of consequences they see fit, it's times like these that remind us of the dangers of investing in Chinese stocks, even large-cap, typically solid ones like BIDU.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking at the underlying holdings of the ETFs in our coverage universe at  , we have compared the trading price of each holding against the average analyst 12-month forward target price, and computed the weighted average implied analyst target price for the ETF itself.

Three of QTEC's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are NXP Semiconductors NV (Symbol: NXPI), Lam Research Corp (Symbol: LRCX), and NetEase, Inc (Symbol: NTES).

Also, the company unveiled TLBB 3D in 2014, which continues to drive demand. Newer games like Warframe and Tree of Savior are also expected to contribute to revenues in the to-be reported quarter. Additionally, the China-based game developer stepped up its R&D efforts to develop more innovative and user friendly mobile games while also cutting down on its expenses. These should help the company post decent results in the to-be reported quarter.However, Changyou is facing operational challenges from the ongoing transition.

The case is now headed for a retrial in May.Representatives from both Oracle and Alphabet's Google division headed by their respective CEOs Safra Catz and Sundar Pichai met on Friday to sort a long running dispute out of court. However, talks fell flat and now the decision rests with the jury.Last month, per media reports, Oracle sought $9.3 billion as compensation from Alphabet for unauthorized usage of Java APIs in its Android operating system.As per IDG News service, Oracle's damage expert James Malackowski had claimed $8.8 billion as compensation for profits made by Google in addition to $475 million in damages. However, Alphabet's damage experts have quoted a much lower figure (\"at least part of the damages at $100 million\") as compensation for Oracle.The dispute has been going on for the past six years now. Oracle had first sued Alphabet, then Google, for copyright violations of its Java APIs. Java was developed in the early 1990s by Sun Microsystems, which was later taken over by Oracle in 2010.In May 2012, Alphabet initially gained an edge as Northern District of California Judge William Asylup ruled that APIs are not copyrightable. However, next year, a U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the district court's ruling, thereby bringing some relief for Oracle but at the same time, gave Alphabet a breather in the form of the \"fair use\" defense clause \"which permits copying under limited circumstances.\" In Oct 2014, Alphabet filed a petition in Supreme Court but SCOTUS turned down the petition and redirected it to a district court.Analysts observe that the compensation amount claimed by Oracle has risen more than tenfold since the last time both the tech behemoths locked horns over copyright infringement in court. A booming smartphone market especially for Android run devices in the last few years is a contributing factor to the mammoth compensation demanded by Oracle. All the latest Android versions up to and inclusive of Lollipop will be included in the fresh trial.At present, both Oracle and Alphabet carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The scenario has not changed much this year too.The ongoing  instability has led several economies to step-up their stimulus plans.The European Central Bank (ECB) announced its decision to expand bond-buying stimulus program, and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) adopted negative interest rates to boost the economy of their respective countries. Additionally, China's central bank stepped up its efforts to arrest the economic slowdown and any further devaluation of the currency.The Fed is also advancing cautiously. On Mar 16, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to keep interest rate between 0.25% and 0.50%. Also, the committee revised the number of rate hikes to two from four, as projected at its December meeting, citing \"global and financial developments continue to pose risks.\"These positive steps taken by various countries boosted investors' confidence to some extent.

This is because the strategy focuses on hot stocks that have been gaining over the past few weeks or months.Today, we've zeroed-in on some tech stocks using our premium screen \"Momentum Style Score.\"The Momentum Style Score theory states that what has been going up so far will possibly continue to do so in the near future. This indicates the time to buy a stock that is likely to witness share price rise. Nothing is more frustrating than watching a fundamentally sound or inexpensive stock remaining stagnant.Momentum investors thus strongly believe \"the trend is your friend,\" which implies that stocks that are growing will continue to grow. They make short-term choices among stocks that are scaling up and sell them at the first sign of a downtrend. The basic idea is that once a trend is recognized, it is likely to retain that direction and not move against the flow.Thus, gambling on momentum stocks might help investors earn higher returns in the short term. Nevertheless, investors should remember that this is a speculative strategy and not meant for the faint hearted.Finding the right momentum stocks is not easy due to market volatility, but if executed properly, momentum stocks can bring in hefty returns.It is here that our new  can come in handy. The Zacks Momentum Style Score indicates when the timing is right to grab a stock and make the most of its momentum.

Investors closely monitor earnings announcements to gauge a company's performance. Stock prices can jump on positive earnings surprises and conversely nosedive when earnings expectations are missed even by a few cents.We don't deny that profits do provide a measure for a company's long-term growth and staying power. Moreover, long-term investors buy shares on the anticipation that the company will generate a growing stream of cash or earnings in the future. But are \"higher\" profits necessarily better? Are they really a true indicator of the staying power of a company's earnings?Generically, there are three ways to measure profitability, and all of them come with caveats:It is a tricky task for investors to break through management's feel good, \"it's all great if you ignore the bad stuff\" earnings metrics and get a sense of a company's true profitability. Since the ROE measure receives the most attention from the investor community, executives focus heavily on this metric as well.However, management can artificially boost ROE by piling on debt. Higher leverage makes the company riskier, not better. Companies can exploit financial strategies (like increasing debt leverage and stock buybacks funded through built up cash) to artificially maintain a healthy ROE for a while, and conceal weakening operational profitability.However, excessive debt leverage becomes a major albatross for a company when the demand for its products heads south. During tough times, it multiplies a company's risk manifold.So, let's shift our focus to a different bottom-line metric that garners far less attention from executives and investors alike, Return on Invested Capital (\"ROI\").ROI is computed as net income from continuing operations divided by (debt + equity) and it measures the company's ability to generate profit from all sources of funds including those which arise from liabilities to creditors (debt) as well as those from contributions by investors (equity). ROI circumvents the potential distortions created by financial strategies like those we just discussed.If we really think about it, the most crucial job of a company's management's is to allocate its resources prudently. Anybody can make a profit by throwing a stack of money at a problem, but there are very few managers who have the talent to generate large profits with little investment.Essentially, ROI shows how optimally management is directing the capital under its control into profitable investments. It paints a clear picture of how efficiently a company is employing its capital, and whether its competitive positioning is allowing it to produce good returns from that capital.ROI is particularly relevant for assessing companies that have a large amount of capital.However, it might be quite difficult for investors to single out such companies, as we need companies which have generated strong ROIs over a sufficiently long period of time to determine a strong trend.So, we created a three faceted screen to shortlist such companies for you. Only those companies which have generated ROIs in excess of 15% on average over the last 5 years can get past our screen. Their current ROI (over the trailing twelve months) also needs to be at least 15%.In addition, to ensure that we hone in on stable companies which have an established history of generating profits, our screen allows only those companies which have a market capitalization north of $10 billion.Needless to say, these companies must have a solid Zacks Rank too. A favorable Zacks Rank shows positive analyst interest and great prospects for the company.Just five companies got through our screen, and here they are:Accenture provides management consulting, technology, and outsourcing services globally.The outsourcing giant has generated an incredible average ROI of 52.2% over the last five years, and boasts a current ROI of 50.3%.Over the past month, analysts have become increasingly bullish on the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. The company has seen a sharp spike in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016, which now stands at $5.28, up from $5.21 a month back.Broadcom is a premier designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of analog semiconductor devices and digital, mixed-signal and optoelectronics components and subsystems.This Zacks Rank #2 stock has generated an impressive ROI of 27.9% on an average over the last 5 years, and has a current ROI of 28.9%.Analysts envision a healthy future for the company, as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016 earnings has trended sharply up over the past month, from $8.92 to $9.26 per share, thanks to five upward estimate revisions.Based in Foster City, CA, Gilead Sciences focuses on the discovery, development and commercialization of drugs for several indications.This Zacks Rank #2 stock has generated an average ROI of 33.1% over the last 5 years, and its current ROI stands at 53.9%.Analysts have great expectations from the company this year and have been revising 2016 earnings estimates upward over the past month. Gilead's fiscal 2016 estimate has climbed from $11.96 to $12.11 over the past 30 days.UltaSalon operates as a specialty retailer in the United States. The company's stores provide cosmetics, fragrance, haircare, skincare, bath and body products, and salon styling tools.This Bolingbrook, IL-based beauty retailer's earnings has generated an average ROI of 23.1% over the last 5 years, and boasts a current ROI of 23.9%.Moreover, analysts have become increasingly bullish on this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock over the past month, with 13 upward estimate revisions for the company's 2017 earnings.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  .Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .It is common knowledge that Wall Street is obsessed with the bottom line. Investors closely monitor earnings announcements to gauge a company's performance. Stock prices can jump on positive earnings surprises and conversely nosedive when earnings expectations are missed even by a few cents.We don't deny that profits do provide a measure for a company's long-term growth and staying power. Moreover, long-term investors buy shares on the anticipation that the company will generate a growing stream of cash or earnings in the future. But are \"higher\" profits necessarily better? Are they really a true indicator of the staying power of a company's earnings?Generically, there are three ways to measure profitability, and all of them come with caveats:It is a tricky task for investors to break through management's feel good, \"it's all great if you ignore the bad stuff\" earnings metrics and get a sense of a company's true profitability. Since the ROE measure receives the most attention from the investor community, executives focus heavily on this metric as well.However, management can artificially boost ROE by piling on debt. Higher leverage makes the company riskier, not better. Companies can exploit financial strategies (like increasing debt leverage and stock buybacks funded through built up cash) to artificially maintain a healthy ROE for a while, and conceal weakening operational profitability.However, excessive debt leverage becomes a major albatross for a company when the demand for its products heads south. During tough times, it multiplies a company's risk manifold.So, let's shift our focus to a different bottom-line metric that garners far less attention from executives and investors alike, Return on Invested Capital (\"ROI\").ROI is computed as net income from continuing operations divided by (debt + equity) and it measures the company's ability to generate profit from all sources of funds including those which arise from liabilities to creditors (debt) as well as those from contributions by investors (equity). ROI circumvents the potential distortions created by financial strategies like those we just discussed.If we really think about it, the most crucial job of a company's management's is to allocate its resources prudently. Anybody can make a profit by throwing a stack of money at a problem, but there are very few managers who have the talent to generate large profits with little investment.Essentially, ROI shows how optimally management is directing the capital under its control into profitable investments. It paints a clear picture of how efficiently a company is employing its capital, and whether its competitive positioning is allowing it to produce good returns from that capital.ROI is particularly relevant for assessing companies that have a large amount of capital.However, it might be quite difficult for investors to single out such companies, as we need companies which have generated strong ROIs over a sufficiently long period of time to determine a strong trend.So, we created a three faceted screen to shortlist such companies for you. Only those companies which have generated ROIs in excess of 15% on average over the last 5 years can get past our screen. Their current ROI (over the trailing twelve months) also needs to be at least 15%.In addition, to ensure that we hone in on stable companies which have an established history of generating profits, our screen allows only those companies which have a market capitalization north of $10 billion.Needless to say, these companies must have a solid Zacks Rank too. A favorable Zacks Rank shows positive analyst interest and great prospects for the company.Just five companies got through our screen, and here they are: (  )Accenture provides management consulting, technology, and outsourcing services globally.The outsourcing giant has generated an incredible average ROI of 52.2% over the last five years, and boasts a current ROI of 50.3%.Over the past month, analysts have become increasingly bullish on the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. The company has seen a sharp spike in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016, which now stands at $5.28, up from $5.21 a month back. (  )Broadcom is a premier designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of analog semiconductor devices and digital, mixed-signal and optoelectronics components and subsystems.This Zacks Rank #2 stock has generated an impressive ROI of 27.9% on an average over the last 5 years, and has a current ROI of 28.9%.Analysts envision a healthy future for the company, as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2016 earnings has trended sharply up over the past month, from $8.92 to $9.26 per share, thanks to five upward estimate revisions. (  )Based in Foster City, CA, Gilead Sciences focuses on the discovery, development and commercialization of drugs for several indications.This Zacks Rank #2 stock has generated an average ROI of 33.1% over the last 5 years, and its current ROI stands at 53.9%.Analysts have great expectations from the company this year and have been revising 2016 earnings estimates upward over the past month. Gilead's fiscal 2016 estimate has climbed from $11.96 to $12.11 over the past 30 days. (  )UltaSalon operates as a specialty retailer in the United States. The company's stores provide cosmetics, fragrance, haircare, skincare, bath and body products, and salon styling tools.This Bolingbrook, IL-based beauty retailer's earnings has generated an average ROI of 23.1% over the last 5 years, and boasts a current ROI of 23.9%.Moreover, analysts have become increasingly bullish on this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock over the past month, with 13 upward estimate revisions for the company's 2017 earnings. This has led to a sharp spike in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017, which now stands at $5.94, up from $5.68 a month ago. (  )This internet technology company is primarily engaged in the development of online games, e-commerce and related technologies in China.This Zacks Rank #1 stock has generated an average ROI of 24.5% over the last 5 years, with a current ROI of 25.1%.Over the past month, analysts have become increasingly bullish on the company, with two upward estimate revisions for the company's 2016 earnings.

Meanwhile, Activision Blizzard  pulled out of E3 and HTC Vive received tremendous response with15,000 sets booked in less than 10 minutes.1. San Francisco based Zynga appointed Frank Gibeau as its new CEO who will take over from founder and current CEO Mark Pincus, effective Mar 7, 2016. Pincus will serve as the executive chairman of the beleaguered video gaming company. Zynga has been in trouble for quite some time. The company had created quite a buzz with its web-based games FarmVille (2009) and CityVille (2010) but subsequently failed to make a similar splash with its mobile games.However, Gibeau's appointment has been cheered by Wall Street given his impressive track record. A 20-year old veteran at Electronic Arts  , Gibeau was instrumental in turning around EA's mobile division. He has also been on Zynga's board for the last seven months.2. Tencent Holdings Limited has now increased its share in Glu Mobile to 21.5%. Per media reports, this Chinese investment holding company bought over 3 million shares of Glu Mobile from Feb 8 to Feb 25. The company had first purchased a 14.9% stake in Apr 2015 for $126 million or $6 per share. Glu Mobile is also working to bring Tencent's shooter game WeFire to the Americas, Australia and EMEA by the second quarter of 2016.3. Activision Blizzard has pulled out of E3, marking the second high profile exit from the E3 expo. Activision has announced that this year it will no longer have a booth space at the expo. Unlike EA, which plans to host a standalone event to showcase its new titles, Activision will be depending on its partner Sony  to display its new offerings.4. It seems Facebook's  Oculus Rift will be up against tough competition from HTC Vive VR headset. Per media reports, 15K units of Vive were booked in the first 10 minutes on Feb 29, when the company started taking pre orders. Undaunted by the $799 price tag, excited buyers logged on to the online store in large numbers, resulting in a crash.Even bookings for Rift, priced at $599, had been phenomenal leading to a temporary site crash.However, both Rift and Vive need high end PC configuration (read pretty expensive) making it appealing only to a niche set of consumers. On the other hand, Sony's PlayStation VR, priced at $399, seems to have an edge over both Rift and Vive, as these would be compatible with all PS4 consoles in the world which at present stand at over 35.9 million units. VR/AR is the next step in technological innovation besides the development of AI technology. Though VR/AR may be creating a buzz for gamers right now, the technology is eventually expected to improve other critical areas of human life.The following table shows the price movements of the major video game companies over both the past five trading days as well as the last six months:\n  \nOver the last five trading sessions, Glu Mobile was down 19.23% while Zynga was the highest gainer, up 14.07%.Over the last six-month period, NetEase  surged the most - nearly 28.21%. Increasing popularity of mobile based games and strength of PC games (licensed & self developed) continue to keep investors interested in the stock. Moreover, growing mobile advertising revenues is an added stimulus. Recently, the company beat Q4 earnings estimates on a 118.6% year-over-year rise in revenues. Revenues from online games came in at $849.5 million, registering a 103.2% year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter.However, Glu Mobile was down 29.37% over the same time frame due to its underperforming releases this year. That said, strong fourth-quarter results, share repurchase authorization and the Taylor Swift game have made investors happy. .Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Earnings also improved from 10 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter.Despite the strong results, shares declined nearly 4% in the after-hours trading session, due to a weak revenue outlook for 2016.Revenues increased 21.3% year over year to $256 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $243 million.Advertising revenues moved up 23% year over year to $223.2 million. The upside was primarily driven by strength in advertising related to Weibo  , which increased 47% year over year to $129.5 million.Non-advertising revenues jumped 13% year over year to $33 million driven by strength in the both portal and Weibo businesses. Revenues from Weibo value added services (VAS) increased 13% year over year to $19.5 million.Weibo revenues surged 41.6% year over year to $149 million. Monthly active users went up 34% year over year to 236 million. Daily active users for Weibo came in at 106 million at quarter-end. The strong growth momentum of Weibo advertising was driven by increasing adoption of mobile devices and improved monetization, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises.Portal revenues increased only 1.2% year over year to $107.2 million as Portal Advertising revenues remained flat.Non-GAAP gross margin remained flat on a year-over-year basis at 65%. Though gross margin benefited from a higher revenue base, it was offset by lower advertising gross margin. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues declined to 53.7% from 62.9% in the prior-year quarter.Lower operating expenses in the quarter contributed to the company's profitability. SINA reported operating income of $29.3million in the quarter, as against $3.9 million in the year-ago quarter.SINA exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.4 billion compared with $2.2 billion on Dec 31, 2014.Cash provided by operating activities in the quarter was $98.9 million.The company also initiated a new $500 million share repurchase program which will continue till Jun 2017.For 2016, SINA projects non-GAAP revenues between $850 million and $950 million, assuming 8.5% currency depreciation. The guidance also excludes $10.4 million of deferred license revenues from E-House. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $994 million.SINA has a strong product pipeline and is investing in product development and marketing. The company's robust user base for its e-Commerce and Weibo offerings are the positives.However, the company is expected to see some headwinds owing to the weakness in traditional brand advertising, especially for its portal. In addition, the company faces some challenges in its display advertising business owing to the ongoing transition from brand advertising to performance-based advertising. The company's business is also likely to be impacted by the soft macroeconomic conditions in China. In addition, significant restrictions on online search and other social-networking activities in the region remain the concerns.Moreover, Weibo is expected to face stiff competition from the likes of WeChat in China, which may hurt its user base. However, we believe that Weibo's monetization ability will be a major driving factor for SINA amid intensifying competition from the likes of Sohu.com Inc.  and NetEase  in the video and brand advertising market.Currently, SINA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Coming into Wednesday's fourth-quarter financial report, NetEase investors wanted to see continued growth in revenue and earnings. NetEase did well on both counts, but the stock still fell after the release. Let's take a closer look at the latest from NetEase to see why there was a disconnect in shareholders' response to the report. NetEase's fourth-quarter results looked just as solid as they have in past quarters. Sales jumped 128% in local currency, working out to $1.22 billion and producing even better growth than the 122% that most investors had expected. Net income jumped 70% in yuan terms, working out to $334.1 million, and earnings of $2.52 per share were more than a quarter per share higher than the consensus forecast among those following the stock.Taking a closer look at NetEase's results, the video game company picked up considerable sales gains in all of its segments. Online gaming-related services saw revenue more than double, and sales from the email and e-commerce business more than quadrupled from year-earlier figures. Even the relatively slow-growth advertising services unit managed gains of more than two-thirds, grew at an even faster pace of 162%. Unfortunately, margins continued to fall, and overall, NetEase's gross margins were down more than 18 percentage points from year-ago levels. The main culprit was the near-tripling in costs of revenue for online game services, although the email and e-commerce division also saw big expenses gains as well that nearly wiped out gross profit margins entirely.NetEase keeps coming up with games on its own as well as through partnerships. The company highlighted offerings such as  and  , but it also pointed to the Activision Blizzard game  game in driving traffic. Expansion packs for PC-related games like  act as a reminder that traditional computer games have also taken on a new life of their own.CEO William Ding expressed his excitement about NetEase's prospects. \"2015 marked a year of tremendous growth fueled by all-around achievement for our company,\" Ding said, and the CEO pointed to its efforts to broaden game offerings both for PC-clients and on mobile platforms. As we've seen in past quarters, a rise in NetEase's income will translate to a higher dividend. Investors will get a fourth-quarter payout of $0.64 per share, up by 14% from last quarter's $0.56 per share dividend. That brings the total increase since the first quarter of 2015 to 64%, once again proving the potential benefits of using a strategy based on percentage of income to decide dividend amounts.Much of NetEase's future prospects will rely on the strength of the Chinese gaming economy, but so far, the company has proven resistant to the strains that have hit other Chinese stocks. The Activision Blizzard partnership likely plays a role in that, as Blizzard has plenty of experience in working with gamers across the globe and figuring out ways to weather tough economic conditions in certain areas.Despite the impressive results, NetEase shareholders weren't immediately pleased with the results, sending the stock down more than 5% in the first hour of after-market trading following the announcement. Nevertheless, by using its relationship with Activision Blizzard and continuing to develop its own games, NetEase seems to be doing everything it can to stay on top of the video-gaming industry in China.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Shares of Chinese online game maker  got crushed today, down by 15% as of 1:15 p.m. ET, after the company reported fourth-quarter earnings and saw margins fall. Fourth-quarter revenue added up to $1.2 billion, which includes $849.5 million in revenue from the core online games business. Gross profit was $651.4 million, and NetEase attributed growth to mobile games like  and its  mobile games, in addition to several licensed titles. Net income came in at $334.1 million, or $2.52 per share. But that growth from mobile games is proving to be a double-edged sword. Gross margin within the online games segment contracted significantly to 67.2%, down from 76% a year ago, due to the \"increased revenue contribution from mobile games.\" CEO William Ding noted that while PC games remain important to the gaming industry in China, mobile is quickly becoming increasingly important as well, and NetEase continues to invest in mobile platforms.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because NetEase is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings-with the most up-to-date information possible-is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for NTES in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $Array.93 per share for NTES, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $Array.92 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for NTES, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 0.52% heading into earnings season.A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent Array0 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that NTES has a Zacks Rank #Array (Strong Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for NetEase, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Despite persistent macro uncertainty, the company seems positive on the back of a healthy security market, strong product line-up, deal wins and investment plans which should boost results in the to-be-reported quarter.Earlier results show that AVG Technologies is gaining from the rising demand for cyber security. Notably, the company has been witnessing a higher number of large deal signings over the past few quarters which should aid fourth-quarter results as well.With the advancement in technology, more organizations are adopting the bring-your-own-device (BYOD) policy. While BYOD has enhanced employee productivity with anytime, anywhere access, it has become all the more necessary for companies to enforce stringent data security measures.Furthermore, since the beginning of 20Array5, numerous data breaches at high-profile business houses and government agencies prompted the need to impose tighter security measures, which in turn boosted the demand for cyber security products.Additionally, AVG Technologies closed a number of acquisitions last year, the biggest being Location Labs.

After about a year of consideration, Hewlett-Packard Company successfully split itself into two standalone companies - HP Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise  - effective Nov Array, 20Array5.In Oct 20Array4, Hewlett-Packard announced that it will split its enterprise-facing hardware and service business and the consumer-facing computer and printer segments, into two publicly trading companies.Prior to the split, Hewlett-Packard Company was a leading global provider of computing products, technologies, software and services to individual consumers, SMBs and large enterprises, including those in the public and educational sectors. Products such as PCs and access devices, imaging and printing-related products and services, enterprise IT infrastructure and multi-vendor customer services including support, maintenance, consulting, integration and outsourcing were offered by the company.Post split, Hewlett-Packard Company's PC and printer business operates under the name HP Inc., while Hewlett-Packard Enterprise offers the commercial tech products.The persistent decline in PC shipments has been a drag on HP Inc.'s top line off late. The demand for desktop PCs and printers is not as strong as it was a decade ago. The technology and consumer demands are shifting toward mobile devices and cloud storage - something companies like Google, Amazon, Apple, and Dell are focusing on. According to Gartner's latest report, PC shipments (including premium ultra-mobiles) in fourth-quarter and full-year 20Array5 declined 8.3% and 8%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.We consider factors like strong dollar, falling commodity prices, social disruptions in EMEA and Asia/Pacific, longer PC lifecycles and competition from mobile phones and tablets, to be responsible for the deplorable performance of the PC industry in 20Array5. Gartner has also hinted that the launch of Windows Array0 in third-quarter 20Array5 had a negligible impact on PC shipments during the holiday season as customers upgraded their existing PCs instead of buying new ones.We expect the decline in PC shipments in fourth quarter to negatively impact HP Inc.'s to-be-reported quarterly results.Also, market challenges (for instance, saturation in the developed markets and mobile preference in the emerging economies) and cost challenges (low-cost manufacturing in Asia has given Asian hardware makers an edge) are expected to persist. Moreover, macroeconomic challenges, tepid IT spending and competition remain the near-term concerns.

Last year, the company acquired Nimbo - a leading professional services company primarily focused on enabling enterprises to develop and implement hybrid cloud IT architectures - and Bit-isle, which offers outsourced IT services to over 650 customers through six data centers in Japan. Both the acquisitions are anticipated to boost total revenue growth in the fourth quarter.Furthermore, we are optimistic about Equinix's recurring revenue model and current expansion plans. Additionally, the company has converted itself into a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), effective Jan 1 this year, which should maximize shareholders' value over the long run.Nevertheless, we remain slightly cautious about the huge capital outlays which may hurt Equinix's fourth-quarter profitability. Moreover, increasing competition from established Internet data center operators such as AT&T  , Level 3 Communications, COLT and Verizon will affect product pricing, thereby denting the margins.Additionally, the telecommunications industry is undergoing consolidation.

A series of weak economic reports and the yuan's movement have been the immediate trigger for the losses made by stocks. Steps taken by the government have had a mixed effect until now.However, a recent survey of consumers indicates that investors across the world may be overreacting. The inherent strengths of the economy are still evident and adding these stocks to your portfolio at this time would be a prudent move.The global consumer survey conducted by research company Nielsen indicates that consumer confidence increased to 107 for China during the fourth quarter. Released last week, the report also indicates that even though this represents a marginal increase of 1% over the quarter, it is well above the global average of 97. Additionally, it is in line with the Asia-Pacific region's average for the quarter.In fact, Chinese consumers have shown greater confidence than several mature economies. For instance, confidence levels have declined over the quarter for the United Kingdom, U.S. and Germany and stand at 101, 100 and 98, respectively. Additionally, the inclination to increase expenditure increased by 2 percentage points to 48% year over year marking a four-year high.Concerns over China's economy are perfectly legitimate. However, several factors indicate that the market's reaction to the situation may be termed as an overreaction. For one, China's economy increased by 6.9% last year. This was widely depicted as the worst pace of growth in 25 years. However, what such a depiction of events omits is the fact that this rate of growth is twice as much as mature economies and second to none of the major economies but India.Secondly, the other major panic trigger -- flight of capital -- may also be a grossly misunderstood phenomenon. It may simply be a case of companies quickly paying off debts taken in foreign currency. Alternatively, they may be hedging against a weakening domestic currency over the short term and parking their deposits in dollars.The other significant pattern which has caused the markets much heartburn is the weakness experienced by China's traditional strength, its manufacturing sector. However, such a conclusion fails to take into account the rising power of the country's services sector.Additionally, the government is making concerted efforts to transform the economy from one reliant on manufacturing into one powered by consumer spending. The Nielsen survey shows that respondents remain optimistic about job prospects over the next 12 months. In excess of 60% of them are confident about their personal finances over this period and have a very positive outlook about China's job market.The confidence shown by China's consumers about its economy is an evidence of the fact that fears about the country's economy are grossly overblown. It would not be prudent to ignore the country's growth rate, which is still impressive as well as the steps being taken by the government to boost the markets and the economy.Ignoring such factors would be justly unfair, despite the panic markets have shown over China's economic situation. Instead, picking up China stocks with strong fundamentals would be a smart decision.

Apart from earnings, the Vision AR/VR Summit held in California (Feb 10 -Feb 11) dominated headlines.1. Earnings:Activision's  of 81 cents per share and non GAAP revenues of $2,118 million fell below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 83 cents and $2201.3 million, respectively. Analysts observe that the success of Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 was overshadowed by weakness in other titles while forex fluctuations continued to add to troubles. Among other quarterly highlights, Activision registered 20% growth in average MAUs and announced a strong pipeline of new releases.The company's new games should keep investors interested in the stock. It will release the expansion pack for Destiny in 2016 while bringing the full game sequel in 2017. It will be launching its first new franchise, Overwatch in spring. Moreover, Activision will release the movie Warcraft in June and follow it up with the launch of the much awaited expansion of Legion in summer of 2016.For 2016, Activision expects non-GAAP revenues of $6.25 billion while non-GAAP earnings are expected to be $1.75 per share. For first quarter 2016, Activision expects non-GAAP net revenue of $800 million and earnings of 11 cents per share.Concurrent with Activision's quarterly report, King Digital declared its fourth quarter results. Adjusted earnings per share (including stock based compensation but excluding other items) came in at 34 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 32 cents. Total GAAP revenues were $460.7 million while gross bookings came in at $508.8 million.Activision is also in the process of completing the acquisition of the Candy Crush maker (it had announced the acquisition in Nov 2015 for $5.9 billion) in Feb 2016. Recently, the company received approval from South Korean regulators.Zynga's adjusted loss per share (excluding stock-based compensation expense) of 2 cents was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 4 cents. Including the charges, GAAP loss was 5 cents per share, same as the year-ago quarter. Zynga's revenues of $182.1 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $177.3 million. However, Zynga failed to live up to analysts' projection as it expects first-quarter 2016 revenues in the range of $160-$175 million, below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $177 million.2. The first Vision AR/ VR Summit 2016 held in California was an \"all-new cross industry event for artists, engineers, programmers, designers, musicians, directors etc focused on furthering the knowledge base of developing VR/AR content\". At the event, game engine developer Unity said its game engine would support the Rift and offer free Unity Pro (at $75 a month) for four months with every purchase of the Rift. Unity will also add native support for Steam VR. Google announced that Google and Unity will collaborate to offer native support for Google Cardboard devices. So now, Unity is compatible with Google Cardboard, Sony's PlayStation VR, Microsoft's  HoloLens as well as Facebook's  Oculus Rift.VR/AR is the next leap in technological innovation and most of the tech behemoths are directing huge resources to develop this technology, given the lucrative business opportunity it presents. As per a Fortune report, a survey had found that there is tremendous enthusiasm among gamers regarding AR/ VR and they tout it as the future of gaming.The following table shows the price movement of the major video game companies over both the past five trading days as well as the last six months:\n  \nOver the last five trading sessions, ZNGA was down 19.74% while Glu Mobile  was the highest gainer, up 15.33%.Over the last 6-month period, NetEase  surged the most - nearly 9.83%. Increasing popularity of mobile based games and strength of PC games (licensed & self developed) continue to keep investors interested in the stock. Moreover, growing mobile advertising revenues is an added advantage.However, Glu was down 32.40% over the same time frame due to underperformance of most of its releases this year. But strong fourth quarter results, share repurchase authorization and the Taylor Swift game have made investors happy.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of Array25%. Moreover, Palo Alto has underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average negative earnings surprise of Array48.74%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Palo Alto Networks offers a network security platform that enables firms, service providers and government bodies to impose tighter security measures. The company incurred wider-than-expected loss in fiscal first quarter while revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Revenue growth seems to be steady backed by strength across all its geographical regions and business segments. Also, customer wins, coupled with expansion of existing customers, positively impacted revenues. We believe that the company's product refreshes will boost revenues, going forward. The company is also keen on expanding its cloud exposure.Nevertheless, a volatile spending environment and competition from Cisco Systems  and Check Point Software Technologies remain the concerns.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Palo Alto Networks will beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #Array (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. ESP for Palo Alto is 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 20 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Palo Alto's Zacks Rank #2 when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are a couple of stocks, which you may consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases:NetEase Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +0.52% and a Zacks Rank #2.Baidu Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +Array5.Array2% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

It delivered a positive earnings surprise of 50% in the last quarter. Moreover, it has a positive four-quarter average earnings surprise of 14.69%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Pandora has been seeing a slowdown in its subscriber base, compounded by aggressive marketing strategy of Apple Inc.'s  Apple Music (especially three-month free trial plan) and rising competition from other players like Spotify and Amazon  Music.It can't be denied that there are too many headwinds currently that threaten Pandora's prospects in the near term. The company has already lowered its outlook for 2015 as it expects hours growth rate of 3%. It now expects revenues of 1.153 billion to $1.158 billion, compared with $1.175 billion to $1.185 billion projected earlier. For fourth quarter, total revenue is projected in the range of $325 million to $330 million, while adjusted EBITDA is expected be $25 million to $30 million.To combat odds, Pandora is pursuing a strategy of overhauling its operations to provide all of \"radio, on-demand and live music\" on its own platform. As a part of this effort, the company acquired streaming music service provider, Rdio. In contrast to Pandora's limited availability (U.S., Australia and New Zealand), Rdio is operational in 100 countries. Furthermore, a major drawback in Pandora's existing offering (or rather the strength of its peers) is the lack of curated playlists, which is popular at present. In fact, this led users to switch from Pandora to other services despite the significant price differences. The acquisition of Rdio should allow Pandora to diversify and expand its offerings. Pandora plans to offer the integrated offerings toward the end of 2016.Pandora has also announced the acquisition of ticket provider Ticketfly worth $450 million. The duo will harness user-generated data to tell fans when bands or artists are in town and sell tickets while also steering artists to areas where a large amount of people gave them a \"thumbs up\" on Pandora's platform.In addition to acquisitions, Pandora is cutting direct deals with music labels so as to reduce dependence on CRB rates and better manage its content costs. A few months back, Pandora cut a $90 million deal with the RIAA and other record labels regarding royalty payments for pre-1972 sound recordings. The company also received a great relief from CRB in the long-awaited ruling on the royalty rates case. As per the ruling, Pandora will have to pay 17 cents per 100 streams of a song as royalty to the artists. The rate is higher than 11 cents that Pandora asked for but is lower than 25 cents as demanded by musicians and record labels.Despite a 15% increase over Pandora's 2015 effective per-performance royalty rate, CEO Brian McAndrews labelled it as a \"balanced rate we can work with and grow.\"We believe that if the company is able to successfully implement its overhauling strategy, it can position itself well to gain from increasing demand for music streaming, thus improving monetization and driving strong mobile growth.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Pandora Media as likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Pandora has an ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 6 cents.Zacks Rank: Pandora's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here is a stock that you may consider as our model shows it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:NetEase, Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of +0.52% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

In addition, an expected increase in the domain name base will remain a key driver of its growth.Also, we believe that gTLD prospects, international expansion through IDNs and investments in intellectual properties will boost results over the long run. Additionally, VeriSign has significant growth opportunities in its network security products. We are optimistic about VeriSign's Network NIA services business.

Moreover, the company's earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the previous four quarters, with an average beat of 67.50%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Our proven model shows that the company is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. Infinera has an earnings ESP of +7.14%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 15 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 14 cents. This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. Infinera has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Infinera's Zacks Rank #3 and +7.14% ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat at the company.In Nov 2015, Infinera's TM series was selected by SEACOM for the latter's new metro wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) networks in South Africa and East Africa. The TM series is known for its flexibility and scalability for packet-optical networking. This highlights the significance of its expansion into the metro market, which may be a value driver for the firm, going ahead.Moreover, the company has received the MEF 100 gigabit (100G) Carrier Ethernet 2.0 (CE 2.0) certification program. By achieving such status, Infinera is now positioned as a global packet-optical transport leader that can deliver differentiated services to its clients, which in turn boosts its chances to achieve higher revenues.Infinera is not the only company looking up this earnings season.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  and Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .Global markets have been affected by China's economic woes for some time now. A series of weak economic reports and the yuan's movement have been the immediate trigger for the losses made by stocks. Steps taken by the government have had a mixed effect until now.However, a recent survey of consumers indicates that investors across the world may be overreacting. The inherent strengths of the economy are still evident and adding these stocks to your portfolio at this time would be a prudent move.The global consumer survey conducted by research company Nielsen indicates that consumer confidence increased to 107 for China during the fourth quarter. Released last week, the report also indicates that even though this represents a marginal increase of 1% over the quarter, it is well above the global average of 97. Additionally, it is in line with the Asia-Pacific region's average for the quarter.In fact, Chinese consumers have shown greater confidence than several mature economies. For instance, confidence levels have declined over the quarter for the United Kingdom, U.S. and Germany and stand at 101, 100 and 98, respectively. Additionally, the inclination to increase expenditure increased by 2 percentage points to 48% year over year marking a four-year high.Concerns over China's economy are perfectly legitimate. However, several factors indicate that the market's reaction to the situation may be termed as an overreaction. For one, China's economy increased by 6.9% last year. This was widely depicted as the worst pace of growth in 25 years. However, what such a depiction of events omits is the fact that this rate of growth is twice as much as mature economies and second to none of the major economies but India.Secondly, the other major panic trigger -- flight of capital -- may also be a grossly misunderstood phenomenon. It may simply be a case of companies quickly paying off debts taken in foreign currency. Alternatively, they may be hedging against a weakening domestic currency over the short term and parking their deposits in dollars.The other significant pattern which has caused the markets much heartburn is the weakness experienced by China's traditional strength, its manufacturing sector. However, such a conclusion fails to take into account the rising power of the country's services sector.Additionally, the government is making concerted efforts to transform the economy from one reliant on manufacturing into one powered by consumer spending. The Nielsen survey shows that respondents remain optimistic about job prospects over the next 12 months. In excess of 60% of them are confident about their personal finances over this period and have a very positive outlook about China's job market.The confidence shown by China's consumers about its economy is an evidence of the fact that fears about the country's economy are grossly overblown. It would not be prudent to ignore the country's growth rate, which is still impressive as well as the steps being taken by the government to boost the markets and the economy.Ignoring such factors would be justly unfair, despite the panic markets have shown over China's economic situation. Instead, picking up China stocks with strong fundamentals would be a smart decision. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics.

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" is set to report fourth-quarter 2015 results on Feb 1.

Yet most successful investors understand that the biggest gains come from smart stock picks that continue to produce stellar returns year after year, turning even modest investments into big riches. As a result, it's important to try to isolate stocks that have the potential for success in the long run. To help you in your quest, below you'll find three stocks that could give long-term investors the kind of returns over the next decade and beyond that can turn your investment capital into true wealth. Home-improvement retail giant  has delivered impressive long-term performance for far longer than a decade, with average 24% annualized returns dating all the way back to 1985. Yet what's more impressive is how well Home Depot has responded to the housing bust and the ensuing recession in 2008. The company was able to adapt to an economic environment in which homeowners were underwater on their mortgages, emphasizing renovation projects to make homes more livable since many homeowners couldn't sell their homes to move up to higher price points.With the housing market having recovered, Home Depot has successfully used a two-part strategy. It is still catering to do-it-yourself homeowners, but it has also built up a bigger presence among professionals needing supplies to do projects. In addition, offering its own project-based work has also helped lift Home Depot's sales. Even though the stock is at all-time highs, Home Depot's latest financials suggest that there's plenty of growth left for the retailer in the next decade. By contrast, fast-casual restaurant  has been dealing with less-than-perfect conditions lately. Slowing comparable-restaurant sales growth has many investors convinced that Chipotle's best days are behind it. The company posted just 2.6% higher comps in its most recent quarter and predicted sluggishness throughout 2016. Moreover, a recent scare due to an e. coli outbreak has also made some investors nervous about the stock's short-term prospects.Nevertheless, Chipotle is responding with a faster pace of store openings to accelerate its overall revenue growth. The company now believes it will open between 220 and 235 restaurants in 2016. Moreover, the potential for new store concepts like ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen and Pizzeria Locale is huge. Even without comps getting back to their past levels, Chipotle could be a much bigger part of the restaurant scene by 2025. The video game industry has never been more competitive, but  has done a good job of making the most of opportunities in the space. With its  ,  , and  franchises continually producing impressive sales, Activision has been able to keep its positive momentum going. Moreover, through Blizzard's partnership with Chinese video game giant  , Activision also has its fingers in the fast-growing gaming market in China as well.Activision just became part of the S&P 500 earlier this year, so you can see just how long it has taken mainstream investors to see the future potential in the stock. At a reasonable valuation for its anticipated growth rate, it's not too late to play Activision Blizzard for big gains in the decade to come.Trying to trade your way to success almost always fails. Instead, it pays to focus on good stocks for the long term. These three stocks aren't sure things, but they have the potential it takes to go the distance in the next decade and beyond.If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known \"Social Security secrets\" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. In fact, one MarketWatch reporter argues that if more Americans knew about this, the government would have to shell out an extra $10 billion annually.

The company reported third-quarter 2015 earnings of 15 cents per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 8 cents. Earnings were also better than 11 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter.Revenues increased 13.9% year over year to $226.3 million and were higher than management's guided range of $193 million to $199 million. Revenues also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $220 million.Advertising revenues moved up 16% from the year-ago quarter to $193.5 million. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by strength in Weibo advertising, which increased 62% year over year to $105.9 million.Non-advertising revenues increased 3.2% year over year to $32.8 million in the quarter. The increase was driven by strength in the portal's new business. Revenues from Weibo value added services (VAS) remained flat year over year at $18.9 million.Weibo revenues jumped 48.3% year over year to $124.7 million. Monthly active users increased 33% year over year in the quarter to 222 million. Daily active users for Weibo came in at 100 million at quarter-end. The strong growth momentum of Weibo advertising was driven by increasing adoption of mobile devices and improved monetization, particularly for small and medium sized enterprises.Portal revenues declined 11.3% year over year to $101.6 million. The decline was owing to the sluggishness in Portal Advertising.Gross margin remained flat on a year-over-year basis at 63%. Though gross margin benefited from a higher revenue base and increase in advertising margins, it was offset by lower non-advertising gross margin.Operating expenses as percentage of revenues declined to 56.8% from 68.3% in the prior-year quarter. The decline was because of lower selling & marketing and general & administrative expenses.Lower operating expenses in the quarter contributed to the company's profitability. SINA reported operating income of $14.7 million in the quarter, in contrast to a loss of $10.9 million in the year-ago quarter.SINA exited the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.9 billion compared with $2.2 billion on Dec 31, 2014.Cash provided by operating activities in the quarter was $107.1 million.We believe that SINA remains a premier company based on its strong product pipeline, continuous investments in product development and marketing and a robust user base for its e-Commerce and Weibo offerings. The company has also made some strategic investments in sectors like Internet finance, which has seen some positive developments and can be significant growth drivers going ahead.However, the company is expected to see some headwinds owing to the weakness in traditional brand advertising, especially for its portal. In addition, the company faces some challenges in its display advertising business owing to the ongoing transition from brand advertising to performance-based advertising.In addition, SINA's business can be affected by significant restrictions on online search and other social-networking activities in China.Moreover, Weibo is expected to face stiff competition from the likes of WeChat in China, which can hurt its user base. However, we believe that Weibo's monetization ability will be a major driving factor for SINA amid increasing competition from the likes of Sohu.com Inc.  and NetEase  in the video and brand advertising market.Currently, SINA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the technology space is MeetMe  , which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download  .

The Chinese online interactive community's stock was buoyed by a resurgence of interest in Chinese stocks after a brutal sell-off this summer, as well as anticipation of the company's third-quarter 2015 earnings report, released Nov. 12.It may be easiest to grasp October's surge in the \"NTES\" ticker by revisiting the plunge in Chinese stocks that made headlines a few months ago. Below is a chart of the Shanghai Composite Index for the months of June through September, overlaid with NetEase's trend line over the same period. As you can see, NetEase, the shares of which trade as American depositary receipts (ADRs) on the New York Stock Exchange, mirrored the fortunes of the broader market, although investor enthusiasm around the company softened the impact: data by  .In October, the Shanghai Composite, which is a decent proxy for the overall Chinese market, recovered considerably, and it didn't take much for NetEase to regain its lost ground as well: data by  . As I mentioned above, buying interest also ticked up toward the end of the month in anticipation of NetEase earnings. It turns out investors had good reason to bid up shares: The company's Nov. 12 report revealed a revenue increase of 114% against the prior-year quarter, to $1.05 billion. Net income similarly experienced a leap, rising 63% to $296 million.NetEase operates in three major segments: online gaming, advertising services, and email and e-commerce services. Of the three, online gaming is by far the largest and carries the most impact: Revenue grew 125% to $820.2 million.The company attributed its gaming strength to self-developed titles like \"Westward Journey Online\" and \"Fantasy Westward Journey,\" which per management, currently hold the No. 1 and 2 spots for gross revenue in the iOS China app store. NetEase's earnings filing also confirmed the release of its highly anticipated \"Kung Fu Panda\" title, which will be available for download in late November. Finally, alongside its own titles, management cited the continued strength of licensed products in its gaming segment, including  's \"Heroes of Warcraft\" and \"Diablo III.\"While gaming revenue is clearly propelling the business, gaming gross profit margin actually declined, from 77.2% last year, to 67.9% this quarter. This was attributed to the growth in mobile games, which have a lower profitability margin in comparison to the company's total online gaming portfolio. But investors surely are taking this in stride. When a company is able to scale its top line by over 100% in a single quarter, shareholders can stomach a few points of slippage in gross margin.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Yet for  , those concerns haven't done anything to slow the company's growth down, and even amid poor results from online gaming peer  , NetEase investors came into Wednesday's third-quarter financial report counting on the company to continue posting the solid gains in revenue and profits that they've come to expect. NetEase's results didn't disappoint, with the online gaming company showing good results in the mobile segment and helping to drive its overall prospects higher. Let's look more closely at how NetEase did and what's next going forward. NetEase's third-quarter results kept impressing investors. Sales more than doubled in local-currency terms, producing sales in US$1.05 billion. That figure was well above the 80% growth rate that most investors were expecting to see. In addition, net income climbed 62% in yuan terms, working out to $296.1 million, and earnings per share of $2.25 was fully $0.50 per share higher than the consensus forecast among those following the stock.Looking more closely at its results, NetEase saw substantial top-line success across its different businesses. Revenue from online gaming soared 125%, and sales from the email and e-commerce business grew at an even faster pace of 162%. Advertising services brought up the rear, but even that sluggish business managed to post revenue gains of more than 10% from the year-ago quarter. As you can tell from the slower growth in net income, though, margins generally fell, with the email and e-commerce segment dropping all the way to a near-zero gross margin and with the key online gaming division plunging almost 10 percentage points.During the quarter, NetEase continued to boost its gaming business. The new release of  built on the strength of its mobile game  The 3D game  was also a strong performer during the quarter, and NetEase's partnership with  's Blizzard Entertainment continued to support the company's results, with offerings like  and  . Combined with a mobile portfolio that has more than 50 titles, NetEase is working hard to saturate the gaming market with its titles.CEO William Ding was pleased with NetEase's performance. \"China's online game industry is on track to become the world's largest gaming market,\" Ding said, and \"we are honored to be a leading developer and operator of some of the country's most popular games.\" Ding also touted the move among advertisers from PC-based platforms to mobile, arguing that NetEase has a particularly good position to compete in the budding mobile arena. Once again, NetEase's success will mean more money for shareholders. The company said that its third-quarter dividend will rise to $0.56 per share, up 27% from last quarter's $0.44-per-share payout. In just the past six months, NetEase's dividend has risen more than 40%, reflecting the big lift in earnings from the company and its policy to pay out a fixed percentage of expected income each quarter.NetEase also had interesting things to say about its advertising and e-commerce businesses. On the advertising front, revenue growth came from the automobile, Internet services, and food and beverage services sectors, suggesting that fears about the downturn in the Chinese consumer economy might well be overblown. At the same time, NetEase's cross-border Kaola.com e-commerce platform kept growing at a rapid pace during the third quarter, helping to keep strong momentum for the e-commerce business overall.NetEase shareholders were happy with the results, sending the stock up 6% toward an all-time high in after-market trading following the announcement. Although it might be surprising just how much NetEase has been able to stay ahead of rivals like Shanda Games, the company shows few signs of meeting any resistance, and further gains are possible for NetEase going forward if China's gaming community keeps thriving.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Also, the user base for its e-commerce and Weibo offerings remains strong. This even resulted in the revenue beat in the last quarter even though the loss per share was much greater than expected.The licensing issue with the Chinese government is a major headwind, which will negatively impact brand revenues in the near term. In addition, although the investments in mobile and video are long-term positives, they are expected to hurt profitability for the rest of 2015.Additionally, SINA's business can be affected by significant restrictions on online search and other social-networking activities in China. In fact, even the devaluation strategy pursued by the Chinese government can substantially weigh on the company's financials.Moreover, Weibo is expected to face stiff competition from the likes of WeChat in China, which will hurt its user base. We believe that Weibo's monetization ability will be a major driving factor for SINA amid increasing competition from the likes of Sohu.com Inc., NetEase  and Youku Tudou  in the video and brand advertising market.Our proven model does not conclusively show that SINA is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

The day referred to as \u201cBlack Monday\u201d made headlines in financial dailies across the globe.

Additionally, the recent announcement of the inclusion of 14 Chinese ADRs in the MSCI Global Standard Indexes as well as 35 stocks from China in the MSCI Global Small Cap Indexes is creating excitement and new interest in Chinese stocks.This comes in the backdrop of President Xi Jinping\u2019s interest in increasing the role of technology companies in the nation\u2019s economic growth.

The company reported revenue of $1,390.66 million during the fiscal 2014, an increase of 107% over the revenue of $671.09 million in fiscal 2013. Its net income more than doubled to $222.77 million during 2014 when compared to 2013.The shares of Qihoo are currently trading at $62.29, down by 14.73% over the last one-year and much below the 52-week high of $76.70. Analysts expect earnings of $0.71 per share for the third quarter 2015 (up from $0.62 in second quarter) to be announced towards the fourth week of November. Qihoo\u2019s strong revenue growth, dominance in terms of market share and user base, sound balance sheet, innovative product line and quick adaptability to technological changes present it as a good stock.Baidu, Inc.

In addition to serving individual Internet search users, Baidu provides an effective platform for businesses to reach potential customers via performance-oriented marketing.Baidu is a company with strong financials, which has grown at a robust pace over the years. Its revenue increased by 49.84% during fiscal 2014 to reach $7.91 billion compared to $5.28 billion during fiscal 2013. The growth has continued in the three quarters of the current fiscal as well.The shares of Baidu are trading at 23% below the 52-week high of 251.99 which is despite the steep rise in its share prices in the last month.

The company expects a total revenue generation in the range of $2.864 billion to $2.950 billion for the fourth quarter 2015, representing a 29.5% to 33.4% year-over-year increase.

The company reported revenue of $1.89 billion during fiscal 2014, a rise of 24.28% over the revenue of $1.52 billion during fiscal 2013.Although NetEase has great potential to grow, it won\u2019t be wise to pick the stock at current levels. Investors could perhaps wait for the share prices to cool down before adding them to their portfolios (trading 7% below its 52-week high).Alibaba Group Holdings Limited () needs no introduction. The Chinese online commerce giant staged the biggest IPO in history and is the largest online and mobile commerce company in the world in terms of gross merchandise volume. Alibaba is often compared to the business models of Amazon.com, eBay and PayPal \u2013 all together.

So the Beijing-based gaming and Internet company, best known for its desktop PC games, is investing heavily to diversify around its pipeline of mobile, action role-playing challenges that appeal to a broad and growing audience.In October,NetEase (  ) put up $2.5 million to partner with Finnish game developer Reforged Studios. NetEase also has invested in new Silicon Valley offices where a research team is creating mobile games for Western markets. And this summer, NetEase launched a funding initiative of up to $500,000 each for independent mobile game developers.Although there's no shortage of mobile game companies in China, few have had the lasting success of NetEase, says T.H. Capital analyst Tian Hou.\"We believe that NetEase is on a trajectory of sustainable long-term growth fueled by its marketing expertise and game R&D know-how,\" Hou said in an emailed response to queries.The cumulative number of downloads of NetEase's major mobile games was 173.2 million in the second quarter ended June 30, up 78% from the quarter before, Hou says. Mobile games will be a key growth driver for NetEase in the second half of 2015, as the monetizing of its mobile games is just beginning, he adds.Rivals among Chinese game developers includeTencent Holdings (  ),Shanda (  ) andChangyou.com (  ), among others. But NetEase's online gaming revenue shot up 65% in the second quarter while Tencent, a larger rival, saw a 17% increase in online gaming revenue.There are headwinds for NetEase, however. While revenue climbed, its research costs also jumped, rising 148% in the second quarter to $7.9 million on higher costs related to mobile games. Its gross profit margin for the online game business was 69.3%, down from 77.6% in the year-earlier quarter, the company said.Still, NetEase currently has the highest-possible Investor's Business Daily Composite Rating of 99. NetEase is more than just a gamer as it has expanded to build on China's thriving mobile and e-commerce markets. It also happens to be China's largest email provider, with more than 790 million registered email users as of June 30. In addition, it has launched an online payment platform and a cross-border e-commerce initiative called Kaola.com, focused on selling goods from overseas merchants.The Kaola.com initiative is still in its early stages, but it continues to broaden its e-commerce capabilities by adding high-quality suppliers and increasing warehouse efficiencies. T.H. Capital's Hou said Kaola.com's scale remains small and shouldn't affect the valuation of NetEase's core business. It will, though, require capital investment that will pressure margins.\"While we believe e-commerce has significant growth potential in China, there is a significant amount of uncertainty regarding NetEase's new venture, which mainly resides in the fact that NetEase lacks e-commerce experience,\" Hou said.When NetEase reports third-quarter earnings on Wednesday, analysts expect the 18-year-old company to continue to report accelerating sales and profit. NetEase has posted revenue growth for five straight quarters, including a 65% increase in the second quarter to $736.6 million, topping analyst expectations. NetEase also recorded strong growth in its gaming, advertising-services and e-commerce divisions during the second quarter.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters are calling for a 61% jump in third-quarter revenue to $780 million. Profit is seen rising 24% to $1.78 a share, matching the prior quarter's gain.During the second-quarter conference call with analysts in August, NetEase founder and Chief Executive William Ding said each of its three business segments showed healthy revenue gains. Online game revenue climbed 64.8% compared with the year-earlier quarter, advertising services revenue increased 22.8%, and email, e-commerce and other revenue jumped 123.3%.This summer, there was a broad sell-off in Nasdaq-listed Chinese Internet stocks on concerns about China's slowing economy and devaluation of the country's currency, the yuan. But on the services side of the economy where NetEase operates, gross domestic product grew at a strong 8.4% in the third quarter.NetEase stock has climbed 55.2% over the past 12 months, closing Nov. 5 at 144.87.More than three-fourths of NetEase's revenue comes from multiplayer games such as its popular \"Fantasy Westward Journey\" franchise. The mobile version was launched in March onApple 's (  ) iOS as well as Android, the mobile operating system developed byAlphabet's (GOOGL) Google unit. Within three days, it hit No. 1 on research firm App Annie's list of top apps.\"The game stayed at the top spot for the entire second quarter of 2015,\" BNP Paribas analyst Vey-Sern Ling said.NetEase operatesActivision Blizzard's (ATVI) gaming platform battle.net, as well as its \"World of Warcraft\" and other franchises in China. It distributes popular games such as \"Diablo III\" and \"Overwatch.\"Last year, NetEase's online gaming accounted for 78% of total revenue.

It calls for players to cross the bounds of life and death to reunite a hero with his lost love. It's NetEase's third mobile game released in the West, following \"Lunar Flowers\" and \"Speedy Ninja.\"\"While these next games might lean more mid- to hard-core, it'll allow us to round out our knowledge and expertise in publishing westward, which will further define how we build out our business in the next several years,\" Ting said.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["nvestors aren't pleased with  .

To international analysts and market watchers, it reflects the extent to which authorities are concerned about the state of things. Globally there have been fears that the move may spark off a currency war.In this situation, it is likely that China may devalue its currency again in the coming months. This is expected to trigger reprisals in the form of similar lowering of exchange rates by currencies worldwide.However, a section of analysts believe that such fears have been disproportionate to actual events. The financial markets may have been taken aback by the PBOC decision, but this may have been a move which China's central bank was planning for quite some time. Ultimately, it may prove to be beneficial for the country over a longer period.At the same time, there may be more surprises in store as the government attempts to boost a flagging economy. Data on FDI and housing prices are lined up for release in the days ahead. But ultimately, government measures to prop up growth moves and related speculation hold the key to market movements in the days ahead.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Speedy Ninjas -- its first mobile app to debut in North America -- hit the App Store and Android marketplaces Thursday morning.The runner game finds players navigating through obstacles by running, diving, and even flying. It's free, but like most freebies there are in-app purchases along the way to enhance both the gaming experience and NetEase's pocketbook.Given the flurry of apps that hit the market on any given day it would be presumptuous to assume that Speedy Ninja will be a hit. There's a lot of competition out there, and NetEase Games naturally doesn't have the same kind of brand recognition out west as it does closer to its home turf.However, this will be just the first of many games that NetEase rolls out for western audiences. Earlier this month it announced that action role-playing game  and  as well as strategy role-playing game  are either in closed beta or in pre-registration for a closed beta. Depending on how the beta tests go, some of those games will be made available for North American audiences.This has been a good week for NetEase, Chinese market swoon earlier in the week notwithstanding. It shelled out a record quarterly dividend of $0.44 a share on Wednesday. It also received an analyst upgrade when Standpoint Research raised its rating from hold to buy. It also set a price target of $145.NetEase has been one of China's biggest winners over the years. It was one of the first Chinese dot-com darlings to go public during summer 2000. It hit the market at $15.50, a figure that is adjusted down to $3.875 after a 4-for-1 stock split. This makes NetEase a 30-bagger over the past 15 years, and that's without accounting for the generous payouts that have been lining the pockets of shareholders in recent years. NetEase has a policy where it returns roughly 25% of its earnings to its investors in the form of a quarterly dividend, explaining why we're at record levels on the payouts as NetEase's bottom line expands.NetEase has come a long way. Its original prospectus in 2000 played NetEase as a Web portal. Offering free email and attracting an average of 20 million daily page views across its different portal channels seemed like the right model until the dot-com bubble burst. NetEase bounced back by rolling out PC-based online games that now account for the lion's share of its business.The analyst upgrade, fat dividend, and new app in a new market are welcome developments. They will help build on NetEase's already impressive selling points that include a better than expected 64% surge in year-over-year revenue growth in  . With the stock still surprisingly cheap at 17 times this year's projected earnings there should be more bags for this 30-bagger to score if its new westward mobile push pays off. Let's face it, every investor wants to get in on revolutionary ideas  they hit it big. Like buying PC-maker Dell in the late 1980s,  the consumer computing boom. Or purchasing stock in e-commerce pioneer Amazon.com in the late 1990s, when it was nothing more than an upstart online bookstore. The problem is, most investors don't understand  .

Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $200 million. Adjusted revenues were $211 million, up 14% from the year-ago quarter.Advertising revenues increased 13% from the year-ago quarter to $176.3 million. Non-GAAP non-advertising revenues were $34.7 million, up 21.3% year over year.Gross margin increased to 60% from 59% in the year-ago quarter. This increase was mainly due to a higher revenue base and a significant jump in advertising and non-advertising gross margin. The increase was primarily due to favorable product mix of higher margin Weibo advertising and value-added services.Non-GAAP operating expenses in the second quarter of 2015 totaled $120.1 million compared with $116.9 million in the same period last year, primarily due to lower sales and marketing expenditures, which were partially offset by higher personnel costs.SINA reported GAAP net income of $11.7 million or 19 cents per share compared with net income of $16.6 million or 25 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Including stock-based compensation but excluding one-time items, net income was $4.2 million or 6 cents as against a loss of $3.7 million or 6 cents per share.SINA exited the second quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.9 billion compared with $1.81 billion at the end of the first quarter. Cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter was $121.4 million.

Although the investments in mobile and video are long-term positives, they will hurt profitability for the rest of 2015.Moreover, Weibo is expected to face stiff competition from the likes of WeChat in China, which will hurt user base. Nevertheless, we believe that Weibo's monetization ability will be a major driving factor for SINA amid increasing competition from the likes of Sohu.com Inc.  , NetEase  and Youku Tudou  in the video and brand advertising market.Currently, SINA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 241 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the NTES options chain for the new March 2016 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $145.00 strike price has a current bid of $14.20. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $145.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $130.80 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of NTES, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $151.11/share today.Because the $145.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 61%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 9.79% return on the cash commitment, or 14.83% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for NetEase, Inc, and highlighting in green where the $145.00 strike is located relative to that history:  Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $155.00 strike price has a current bid of $14.50. If an investor was to purchase shares of NTES stock at the current price level of $151.11/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $155.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 12.17% if the stock gets called away at the March 2016 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if NTES shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for NetEase, Inc, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing NTES's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $155.00 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $155.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 48%.

Last quarter, it posted a 125.00% negative earnings surprise. Moreover, the company posted an average positive surprise of 5.56% over the trailing four quarters.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Last quarter, the company had reported dismal results with higher-than-expected loss per share and revenues missing estimates, despite improving on a year-over-year basis.We believe that SINA has a strong product pipeline and its investments in product development and marketing are positives. Also, the user base for its e-commerce and Weibo offerings remains strong.In June, the company declared that it has signed an agreement to sell as many as 11 million newly issued shares to Charles Chao, the company's CEO and Chairman. The news though positive indicates that an increased number of shares will be dilutive to earnings and moreover it is still unclear as to why the company has resorted to this financing when it already has a healthy cash position.Additionally, SINA's business can be affected by significant restrictions on online search and other social-networking activities in China. In fact, even the recent devaluation strategy pursued by the Chinese government can substantially weigh on the company's financials.Moreover, Weibo is expected to face stiff competition from the likes of WeChat in China, which will hurt its user base. We believe that Weibo's monetization ability will be a major driving factor for SINA amid increasing competition from the likes of Sohu.com Inc.  , NetEase  and Youku Tudou in the video and brand advertising market.The company intends to restructure its portal business in 2015, focusing more on the mobile front to enhance its user base. SINA is also aiming for vertical expansion in order to diversify its revenue base. However, it expects the headwinds in portal advertising business to continue in the near term.Our proven model does not conclusively show that SINA is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. SINA has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 4 cents. Though SINA's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here's a stock that you may want to consider as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarterFoot Locker, Inc.  with an Earnings ESP of +1.45% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Reportedly, the company has tied up with NASA in order to send HoloLens to the International Space Station for collaboration and training. HoloLens first wooed video game players at the E3 2015 show and received positive response from players.Now, the collaboration with NASA is indicative of HoloLens' strong potential as a virtual reality device. This is expected to attract more consumers and businesses. However, HoloLens' price is yet to be revealed, and details about the number of units in production also remain undisclosed. We believe that Microsoft with such high profile collaborations is trying to create a high demand scenario in the retail market before HoloLens is made widely available.The following table shows the price movements of major video gaming players over both the past five trading days as well as the last six months:\n  \nIn the last five trading sessions, the companies witnessed a mixed trend. The stock that gained the maximum was Electronic Arts, up 2.3%, whereas the stock that lost the most was NetEase, Inc.  , down 1.6%.Over the last 6-month period, Glu Mobile surged the most - nearly 59.2%.

It's a good time to keep a significant chunk of cash on the sidelines and restrict your buying to well-known, liquid leaders that have weathered their earnings reports in good shape. He examines at a few of those, plus a high-profile loser or two.Back when the U.S. was an agrarian nation, August used to be the best month for the stock market in performance terms. But it lost the lead as the strongest month in 1951, and now, with only about 2% of the country involved in farming, August has taken its place as the worst.So that should just about settle it, right? There's no point in being invested in stocks in August. So selling in May and going away looks better and better.Not so fast. If you actually look at the numbers, dumping all your stocks in August and putting the proceeds into sunblock and ice cream doesn't seem like such a smart strategy.The average August loss for the Dow is 0.1%. The average August loss for the S&P 500 is 0.04%. And the Nasdaq, contrary as always, actually averages a 0.1% gain in August!So if you think that the position of August at the bottom of the heap, performance-wise, makes it a good time to take a vacation from paying attention to stocks, you're probably wrong.Thus far in August, markets are pretty flat, and there are a couple of reasons for that. First, markets have been in a broad uptrend since October 2011. Yes, there have been four sizable corrections during this run (each lasting about two months), including the one in May and June of 2013. But the S&P 500 is up from below 1,100 to near 1,700 during that time. So if the market wants to take a break, August seems like a good time for a vacation.The second reason for August's lack of zip is that stock-buying decisions are made by senior people in big institutional investment houses and hedge funds, and such people have to go on vacation. And anyone who has spent any time in New York City or Boston in August knows that they can be hot, humid hell-holes, which makes heading for the beach or the mountains a logical decision. When senior money managers are out of town, the underlings left in charge are often unwilling (or not permitted) to make big trading decisions. So trading volume in August drops because the Big Dogs are out of town. (The buttoning up of portfolios in December, both for the Holiday Season and year-end accounting has the same effect.)So what's the point?The only point I have to make is a familiar one and it's this: There is a much, much better way to decide what to think about the market than looking at the calendar. The generalizations about market behavior in August will tell you what history says about the climate, but won't tell you a thing about the weather right now.If you use a blunt instrument like \"sell in May and go away\" to make your investment decisions, you would have missed big rallies in both 2012 and 2013.The better choice would be to have a system for determining when the momentum of the market is positive and when it turns negative, and act accordingly.Cabot's growth disciplines advise moving toward heavier investment when markets are in uptrends and toward heavier cash positions when markets are in downtrends.If this seems like saying that you should prepare a picnic when the sun is shining and prepare for a day indoors when it's raining, you're exactly right. It just makes sense.Cabot's 100% quantitative market timing indicators have the validity that comes with decades of observation and analysis of stock markets. And they have clearly defined rules for when a bull market turns into a bear and vice-versa.Right now, stock markets are as flat as flat can be, and the stuffed animals on the mantel in our office remind us in a humorous way, indicating that while the short- and medium-term trend is negative, the long-term trend is still up.If this sounds like trivial information to you, I'd point out that Cabot has over 40 years of evidence to show that knowing the actual trend of the market (and adjusting your buying and selling strategy accordingly) is anything but trivial. And adjusting your growth strategy to align with the momentum of the market is the smartest move you can make.Want help determining the direction of the market and how to respond to it?

One of the major events over the past five days was NetEase, Inc.'s (  ) announcement of a joint venture to enter Internet finance businesses and expand beyond the video game industry. Further, the launch of a rebooted version of E  ectronic Arts Inc.'s (  )  and production halt of Nintendo Co. Ltd.'s (  ) 8GB Wii U Basic console remained in the news.In addition, Activision Blizzard Inc.'s (  ) lawsuit settlement with one of its stockholders and contract win in Germany by International Game Technology PLC (  ) grabbed headlines.1. On May 20, Activision settled a case with one of its stockholders who had challenged the company's $8 billion deal to reacquire its stock from Vivendi SA. The plaintiff allege that Activision's CEO and co-chairman manipulated the deal favoring their interests, and barred stockholders from gaining control of the company. The  game maker finally paid $275 million as settlement and $72.5 million as fee to the litigant's law firm.2. On May 20, NetEase announced that its subsidiary - Ujia E-commerce Co. - will form a joint venture focused on Internet crowdfunding and other Internet finance businesses. The China-based gaming company and web portal will enter into a joint venture with Shanghai-based Everbright Securities (a financial firm) and HNA Group (financial as well as logistics and aviation service company).Under the agreement, the total registered capital of the joint venture company will be approximately RMB100 million ($16.1 million). Of these funds, RMB30 million, RMB40 million and RMB30 million will be contributed by Ujia, Everbright and HNA Group, respectively. Notably, NetEase's stock gained 3.7% following the announcement.3. Electronic Arts'  reboot launched this summer has been designed for the new generation console, and represents the first PS4/XB1/PC-only game in the  series so far. According to the company, the new game promises extensive customization, authentic urban car culture, a nocturnal open world and an immersive narrative. However, going by the trailer, it only projects the usual \"fast cars escape cops\" theme that the series has always had.

He's sticking with his game plan of being very selective on the buy side, and practicing patience with the leading stocks he owns. That said, he is seeing some positive signs, especially with regard to set-ups, and reviews a handful of the highest-potential stocks should the market kick into gear. Click below to watch the video.---Today, I'm offering a simple meditation on risk and active asset management.According to the standard wisdom (Wriston's Law, specifically), money will go where it is wanted and stay where it is well treated.In practice, this means that money tends to move to where it commands the greatest return on investment. Money wants to make more money, and it will (adjusted for risk) flow toward the assets and instruments that will let its number increase.But the profoundly screwed up condition of the global economy in the years since the Great Recession have created some puzzling anomalies in global capital flows. Take, for instance, the phenomenon of negative yields on sovereign bonds, which are bonds issued by governments. (U.S. Treasuries are an example.)Sovereigns are among the most secure of instruments (\"... backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government\") and grow more popular when investors are feeling threatened by conditions in stock markets and global economies. This is the \"flight to safety\" that we hear about from time to time.But within the past few years, we have had market conditions that were, at times, so unsettling, that money in Europe (via the investors who controlled it at the time) sought out sovereign bonds that were paying negative interest. That means that investors were, in essence, willing to pay a government to hold their money for them. Things were so threatening that the prospect of losing just a half a percent or so per year actually looked like the best alternative.If you're like most of us, chances are good that much of your retirement money is held in a 401(k) or other tax-deferred retirement plan that is allocated to stock markets and bond funds. And chances are even better that you, personally, don't ever make any adjustments to your allocations, much less decide to make purchases or sales of individual stocks.As with many simple, blunt-instrument tactics, this system is better than nothing, but it has some serious drawbacks. At the extremes of probability, there was the Tech Bubble and the Real Estate Bubble. If you were just sitting there watching your retirement account with your hands in your pockets (which is what you were told to do by the asset managers), you lost not just your shirt, but two shirts and probably a pair of pants, too.But even leaving out those two torpedoes below your account's waterline, every day that you let the movement of the market be the only factor influencing your investment results is a day that you fully accept market risk.If you want 1) to control your market risk, 2) to seek returns higher than market returns and 3) to involve your self actively in the success of your retirement funding, you have to get involved!The best way to control risk is to embrace it. You control it by actively finding investments that allow you to improve your odds and then following a set of proven management rules.And what are those rules? Well, if you've been reading Cabot Wealth Advisory for a while, you probably already know. For growth investors like me, they boil down to, first, staying in step with the major trend of the market. (In other words, not just sitting there like a rabbit on the freeway while a major market correction turns you into a pizza.) Second, you buy high-quality growth stocks with excellent prospects and hold them while they kite higher. Third, you ruthlessly prune losers before they can undercut your results.Cabot has three investment advisories that specifically address the growth investing strategy, but for anyone just getting started, I always recommend Cabot Growth Investor, a full-featured weekly strategy guide that tells you what to buy, when to buy it, when to sell and when to hold on. Cabot Growth Investor will teach you everything you need to know to get out of your passive investment stance and take charge of your investments.---Here's this week's Fortune Cookie.

Coming into Wednesday night's first-quarter financial report, NetEase investors hoped the company could sustain a reasonable pace of growth, and the company gave its shareholders an even better showing than they had expected. Let's look more closely at what NetEase said about its most recent quarter and what it means for the online gaming specialist's future. NetEase's first-quarter results included a number of positive developments. On the revenue side, Netease enjoyed 54% growth in local-currency terms, equating to total sales of $590.5 million. That figure was far higher than the $525 million consensus estimate among those following the stock. Earnings of $1.55 per share similarly topped expectations by $0.13 per share, as adjusted net income rose by more than 12%.Looking at NetEase's segments, the key online gaming business led the way with a 44% sales gain. But the company's other revenue sources also contributed their fair share to NetEase's success, with advertising services revenue rising by 36% and email and e-commerce-related offerings nearly quadrupling from year-ago levels. On the margin front, though, NetEase's performance was somewhat more mixed, as big gains in advertising and e-commerce margins were offset in part by a more than 5-percentage-point drop in gross margin for online gaming.Gaming offerings continued to drive excitement for NetEase. The company spotlighted mobile games  and  as gaining strength after their introduction late in 2014, and the flagship  also grew even more popular. PC-related games also performed well, with NetEase pointing to the beta test of  as particularly encouraging.Image: NetEase.CEO William Ding was encouraged by the company's overall results. \"Mobile games and content continue to be in high demand,\" Ding said in the earnings press release, \"further complementing our online PC-client games and services. While we expect to see continued momentum from the mobile market, our strategy will remain focused on diversity, excellence, and international expansion to achieve healthy growth.\" NetEase's success doesn't mean the company plans to slow down. It has a vast pipeline of offerings coming out this year, including new mobile and PC-based games and enhanced content for its existing popular game franchises.Strategic partnerships have also been extremely valuable for NetEase. The April launch of  highlighted the value of working with  and its Blizzard Entertainment division, and NetEase expects to begin an open-beta phase for Blizzard's  later this month.Meanwhile, NetEase sees great potential in advertising and e-commerce. Automotive, food-and-beverage, and Internet services made up the strongest contributors to ad revenue growth, and Ding pointed to the early success of the company's Kaola cross-border e-commerce platform.NetEase has bucked the trend among many businesses when it comes to stock repurchases. While the company authorized up to $100 million in stock buybacks early last year, NetEase said the program expired during the first quarter without any actual repurchases having taken place. Given the popularity of buybacks across the stock market, it's interesting to see NetEase find other uses for its cash.NetEase shares climbed 5% in the first two hours of after-market trading following the positive earnings announcement. With so much growth potential, NetEase seems to have nearly limitless prospects for share-price appreciation in the months and years to come as it adds more mobile offerings to complement its PC-based strength.

Take the case of Zynga, developer of the popular \"FarmVille\" games.San Francisco-basedZynga (  ) had high hopes for expanding in China, a country poised to overtake the U.S. as the world's largest mobile games market. In 2010, Zynga bought China-based social gaming firm XPD Media. It then opened a Beijing design office charged with making new mobile games specifically for the China market as well as adapting its existing hits for a Chinese clientele.But in February, Zynga -- which is struggling on various fronts -- closed its Beijing design operation and cut all 71 jobs there. It said the division's new mobile gaming releases couldn't compete.\"Ongoing product globalization initiatives are not meeting our expectations,\" Zynga CFO David Lee said in announcing the closure during the company's Q4 analyst conference call.In a land of immense video game opportunity, why are Zynga and other Silicon Valley gaming firms finding the going rough in China?Rising competition, stiff government regulation and regional gamer preferences all play a role.Those factors have prompted another San Francisco-based mobile developer, JuiceBox Games, to stay on the sidelines of China's video game boom, at least for now. The English version of the company's first game, \"HonorBound,\" is being played by some Chinese gamers. But the company has not put resources into translating its free-to-play, card-collecting mobile game into Chinese, or into coming up with a plan to more widely distribute \"HonorBound\" in the country.\"It's a very large market and it's a very huge prize,\" said Michael Martinez, CEO of JuiceBox Games, which he launched with other Zynga alums in 2012. \"We are focused more on what we do best, rather than trying to please an audience that we don't quite understand.\"China had 517 million gamers as of this time last year. 147 million of those players were classified as \"core\" or frequent gamers, according to the Game Publishers Association, China (  ). The majority were mobile players, a contingent that increased by 15% year-over-year, to 358 million in 2014, according to the GPC.The U.S. is now the top market by revenue for mobile games. But that is projected to change in 2016, when China becomes the world's largest market for mobile games with estimated revenue of $7.7 billion, according to an April study by the Global Mobile Game Confederation (GMGC) trade group, based on data from research group Newzoo. The U.S. won't be far behind in 2016, with an anticipated $7.3 million in mobile game revenue, the study said.But, by 2017, look for China to bring in $9.3 billion in mobile gaming revenue, well above the $8.2 billion projected for the U.S., according to the trade group.Overall, China's gaming market generated $18.5 billion in 2014, up nearly 38% year-over-year. Online client games are the largest segment. Those held 53% of the market in 2014, followed by mobile games with a 24% share and Web-based games' 18% share, according to the government's China Gaming Industry Report.Mobile video gaming is growing in China as smartphone ownership rises and as rising incomes make more players able to pay for that form of entertainment.However, U.S. firms must contend with a host of homegrown mobile-game publishing giants that dominate the market.\"Tencent Holdings (  ),Changyou (  ),NetEase (  ) and Smilegate Entertainment are all big players on the PC side and therefore entrenched players that any Western company trying to break into China is going to have to contend with,\" IDC analyst Lewis Ward told IBD. \"You've got to be smart about what bets you make in China because it is a different market along a number of dimensions. It's a difficult market to break into (although) the opportunity is huge.\"Tencent Holdings is China's largest Internet company. In March, two of its mobile games -- No. 3 \"Happy Lord\" and No. 7 \"GunZ Dash\" -- ranked in the Top 10, by revenue, in theGoogle (GOOGL) Android market in China, according to research firm Newzoo. Chinese Web portal NetEase produced the No. 4 top grossing Android game in March, \"Luan Dou Xi You.\"Most revenue in China comes from multiplayer, role-playing or shooter/sports games played on PCs.For example, Santa Monica,Calif.-based Activision Blizzard (ATVI) teamed up with China Web-giant Tencent to expand the availability of a free-to-play version of \"Call of Duty Online\" for PC gamers starting in January. That followed success with \"World of Warcraft\" through Activision's partnership with China Web portal NetEase.Newer U.S. entrants into the Chinese games market include Los Angeles, Calif.-based SGN, maker of the popular mobile matching puzzle game, \"Cookie Jam.\" In December, SGN teamed with China Web portal NetEase to bring \"Cookie Jam\" to China, marking SGN's first foray into the Chinese market.The only way video game publishers can gain access to China's vast player base is by striking partnerships and distribution deals with Chinese companies. Such deals inevitably include revenue sharing agreements.\"Generally speaking, that means half the profit is going to the Chinese partner,\" said Ward. \"The margin is basically cut in half, right off the top, because of the nature of the legal structure that is required to deliver games there. I wouldn't say it's impossible for Western companies to succeed. But you've got to really know the market and you've got to have the right local partnership in place.\"Overcoming widespread piracy is another hurdle that underscores the opportunity and challenge presented for U.S. companies following the recent end of a longtime ban on video game console sales in China.Video game consoles had been illegal since the Chinese government imposed a blanket ban in June 2000, citing concerns regarding the games' content. Taking consoles out of the picture, legally speaking, drove much of China's gaming community to PC-based games. Many in that group are now switching over to mobile gaming using their smartphones, tablets or other handheld devices.In 2014, China lifted the ban on video game consoles. That re-opened a potentially lucrative market for manufacturers including PlayStation makerSony (SNE) and Xbox creatorMicrosoft (MSFT).Even so, the flourishing market for bootleg consoles and games cultivated during the prohibition still exists, and is likely to remain active for some time, industry experts say.Many Chinese citizens have bought legitimate consoles online, in smaller shops in China or brought them home from trips abroad, according to research firm Newzoo. What is probably a larger number of Chinese gamers, estimated at nearly 100 million, either currently play or have played bootleg console games on machines that are not real Microsoft Xbox or Sony PlayStation devices, but are lower-cost, modified PCs, according to research firm Newzoo.In order to attract legitimate purchasers, producers of authentic consoles must start to offer more games than they do now, those in the industry say.\"There's this whole ecosystem of people that 'crack' games, something that will not disappear overnight,\" Newzoo CEO Peter Warman, told IBD. \"The gap between having a little lower-quality, badly (translated) games for nothing and the real thing for $60 is a big gap that is only bridged by the richer gamers that go for status,\" Warman said.IDC's Ward echoed that view, saying that he forecasts that only about 1 million Xbox and PlayStation units will be sold this year, because of the \"entrenched nature of PC gaming, the rise of smartphone/tablet gaming\" and the added burden of government oversight over legitimate console sales.\"I think there is an opportunity there for consoles,\" said Ward, \"(but) it's going to be a slow ramp.\"The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" Shares of  rose as much as 10.7% early Thursday, then settled to trade up around 8.7% as of 2:30 p.m. after the Chinese Internet company reported encouraging unaudited first-quarter results. Quarterly revenue climbed 54.2% year over year to $626.8 million, including 44% growth in online game revenue to $500.8 million, 31.8% growth in advertising services to $53.7 million, and a 278% increase in email, e-commerce, and other revenue streams to $72.3 million. That translated to adjusted earnings of $1.74 per diluted American depositary share (ADS), compared to $1.71 per ADS in the year-ago period. Analysts, on average, were expecting revenue of just $516.3 million, and adjusted earnings of $1.40 per ADS. \"Mobile games have become a major driving force in China's online game industry,\" noted NetEase CEO William Ding, \"and we believe the high quality and diversity of our mobile offerings are resonating with users.\"'Even so, Ding elaborated that while NetEase will continue to invest to maintain momentum in the mobile game space, its \"strategy will remain focused on diversity, excellence and international expansion to achieve healthy growth across all of our Internet businesses.\"Given both that prudence and NetEase's impressive first-quarter results, I think investors are right to celebrate today. And as long as NetEase can sustain that momentum and continue its solid growth across the board, I think the stock has room to rise.

In the prior-year quarter, the company had reported a loss of 50 cents a share.Revenues increased 7.6% year over year to $184.6 million but lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $186 million. Non-GAAP revenues of $182 million improved 9% on a year-over-year basis.Advertising revenues moved up 11% from the year-ago quarter to $150.4 million. The year-over-year growth in online advertising revenues was driven by an increase of $27.3 million in Weibo advertising revenues, which was partially offset by a decline of $12.7 million in portal advertising revenues.Non-advertising revenues declined 4.2% year over year to $34.2 million in the quarter. Non-GAAP non-advertising revenues for the quarter were $31.6 million, flat on a year-over-year basis. A decline in Weibo data licensing revenues affected non-GAAP non-advertising revenues of the company despite being partially offset by an increase in revenues from game and Weibo membership services.Weibo revenues jumped 42.6% year over year to $96.3 million. Portal revenues declined 15.1% year over year to $88.3 million.Gross margin declined to 58% in the reported quarter from 60% in the prior-year quarter. Non- GAAP advertising gross margin for the quarter was 58% compared with 60% in the prior-year quarter. Non-GAAP non-advertising gross margin for the quarter was 58% compared with 57% in the year-ago quarter.Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter totaled $119.6 million compared with $104.4 million in the prior year quarter, owing to increased personnel costs and marketing expenditures.As of Dec 31, 2014, SINA's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $2.1 billion, down from $2.2 billion on Dec 31, 2014. The decrease was because of share repurchases and investments made in the quarter. Cash provided by operating activities in the quarter was $0.7 million.For 2015, SINA intends to restructure its portal business, focusing more on the mobile front to enhance its user base. The company is also aiming for vertical expansion in order to diversify its revenue base. However, the company expects the headwinds in portal advertising business to continue in the near term.We believe that SINA has a strong product pipeline and its investments in product development and marketing are positives. Also, the user base for its e-commerce and Weibo offerings remains strong.However, while the investments in mobile and video are long-term positives, these will hurt profitability in the near term.Also, SINA's business can be affected by the significant restrictions on online search and other social-networking activities in China. In the reported quarter, Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) has also warned SINA after a series of complaints about offensive and distorted content.Moreover, Weibo is expected to face stiff competition from the likes of WeChat in China, which will hurt its user base. We believe that Weibo's monetization ability will be a major driving factor for SINA amid increasing competition from the likes of Sohu.com Inc.  , NetEase  and Youku Tudou  in the video and brand advertising market.SINA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Premier Li promised to implement necessary stimulus measures in case growth was significantly affected. The benchmark continued to surge on Tuesday, touching levels last experienced in May 2008.In Nov 2014, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) announced its surprise decision to reduce interest rates. This was the first reduction in rates undertaken in more than two years. Market watchers were taken by surprise because since that time the PBOC had stuck to more moderate stimulus measures.This was followed by further monetary easing in February. The People's Bank of China announced that it was reducing the reserve ratio by 50 basis points. Analysts said that the central bank's move followed a series of weak economic reports. This indicated that other measures might be needed to be taken by the government to boost the economy.During his sole news conference for the year so far, Premier Li provided reassurances that his government would take further steps to manage the economic situation. This included steps to boost growth, combat deflation as well as deal with other important economic issues. Speaking about the economy, he said that the government was attempting to take a middle path, striving to boost growth and simultaneously implementing major structural reforms.Premier Li added that the country will successfully leverage the lower cost of borrowing to ease China's transformation from an economy driven by exports to one powered by higher consumer demand. The focus will then shift to consumers and the services sector.China's economy has grown at the slowest pace in nearly 25 years. China's economy registered growth of 7.4% in 2014. This is significantly lower than 7.7% achieved in 2013. However, this has not hindered an impressive recovery by the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index. The benchmark index has increased 73% over the last 12 months since its slide in Aug 2009. That descent had erased more gains than any other equity market across the world.These gains have been fueled by record levels of margin debt and improved access for international investors.

Stocks recently featured in the blog include the  (  -  ),  (  -  ),  (  -  ) and  (  -  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .After the closing bell on Tuesday,  (  -  ) reported its fiscal Q3 2015 results, from the quarter ended February. For the first time in many quarters we finally saw a one-penny positive earnings per share (EPS) of 65 cents in the quarter (accounting for stock-based compensation) for the iconic tech giant.  (  -  ) also reported its fiscal Q1 2015 (February) results, and the global software firm saw higher-than-expected revenues on an in-line 27 cents per share (again, accounting for stock-based compensation).Both companies focused on their cloud space, which both consider an important and growing segment of their businesses. Oracle met cloud-growth expectations of 5 percent, though cloud-based solutions make up only single-digit amounts of Oracle's total revenues (roughly 5-8 percent). Adobe, while better-than-expected in its overall sales in the quarter, actually posted a much weaker cloud subscriber number: 517K in the quarter, as opposed to expectations of around 570K.For Oracle, changing over much of its business model and away from traditional revenue streams such as standard licensing growth, which was down 4 percent year over year, is the main reason for relatively lackluster earnings announcements over the past several quarters until today. Oracle's margins shrank in the quarter, which is likely something the company will address in its upcoming conference call. That said, ORCL stock is up about 1 percent in after-market trading.Conversely, Adobe has typically performed well over the past year, posting an average quarterly positive earnings surprise of more than 28 percent until today's meet on the bottom line. Adobe is also further along in its cloud-centric development than is Oracle (although Mark Hurd's statement for Oracle today mentioned 28-29 percent in cloud growth, which is good). The all-time high for ADBE stock, in fact, was reached just a couple weeks ago when shares touched $80.30 late last month. Adobe shares are down more than 3 percent in late trading today, likely due somewhat to missing cloud subscriber expectations.Comments from Premier Li Keqiang powered China stocks close to a six-year high on Monday.

Specifically, how do you handle it when a stock you've known as a growth stock may have turned into an income stock?That's exactly what I think has happened to AAPL, and it's the reason people are having so much trouble deciding what to do with it. What follows is an expanded paraphrase of the answer I sent to several Cabot subscribers who asked what they should do with AAPL.Apple was a monster stock from 2004 through the end of 2007, soaring from a split-adjusted 1.45 to 27. Then, after three years of gains with only one pullback as long as five months, AAPL dropped to 11.5 at the end of 2008. That's a pretty good definition of a bad year. But, as everyone who didn't buy it then knows, AAPL was off to the races again with another three-and-a-half-year rally, roaring to 101 by September 2012.AAPL topped on February 24 at 133, nicked 133 on April 28, touched 133 again on May 22 and rallied strong to hit 133 again on July 20. That's essentially a quadruple top over a period of five months. The stock's decline has pulled it back to the price it was trading at in November 2014.Any way you look at it, AAPL is a stock in a technical downtrend.The Cabot subscribers I've talked to have asked the same question: Sell now or hold for long-term appreciation?Here's a summary of the main points I've made in trying to advise them.Ask yourself:  If it's a long-term holding that you intend to keep for the income (forward annual dividend yield is 1.7%) and possible price appreciation, then just hold on and forget about it.If it's a growth holding, then you should take profits in at least half of your position and draw a line in the sand where you will sell the rest. After all, the stock has been down nearly 14% from its highs, and hasn't shown positive momentum since February.Keep in mind that AAPL is at the heart of an emotional tangle for investors. It was a big winner in the past, which makes it hard to sell. It's also a stock that has staged more positive surprises than almost any other I can think of, and that also works against treating it like any other stock.But at this point, AAPL is known by every growth investor and is probably held by just about every institutional investor who wants exposure to the U.S. market. It has a trailing P/E just over 13 and a forward P/E just under 12, so value investors should be sniffing around, too. It has proved that there were more sellers than buyers at 133. The real question is, are there more buyers than sellers at 115?Personally, I think lightening up in your AAPL holding and watching what happens with the rest makes sense.My stock recommendation today is a Chinese company you've probably heard of if you've spent any time at all nosing around emerging market stocks. The company is  , one of China's largest web portals that has its own strategy for making money.NetEase operates a full-featured Chinese web portal with all the news, weather, sports, gossip, blogs, dating services, messaging, email, photo hosting and search. That makes it very similar to Sohu.com or Sina.com.But the main source of revenue for NetEase is online games like World of Warcraft, plus a huge slate of games exclusively for Chinese audiences, including many developed in-house. The company enjoyed 26% revenue growth in 2014, and a very strong 55% growth in the first quarter. Earnings growth is estimated at 18% in 2015 and 23% in 2016. After-tax profit margins were a robust 38.9% in Q1. The stock also pays a 1% annual dividend.I like NetEase because, more than just about any company I can think of, it has played the massive migration of the Chinese online experience to mobile devices to perfection. More Chinese now use their mobile devices as their primary internet access, and NetEase has optimized its games (and its Web portal and all other services) for mobile users.If you'd like to learn more about Chinese companies like NetEase (as well as strong companies in all global emerging economies), you should check out my advisory-  -which tracks the strongest stocks in the fastest-growing countries in the world.  .Sincerely,Paul Goodwin,Chief Analyst, The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" reported fourth-quarter 2014 earnings of 10 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 15 cents by 33.3%. Earnings also declined from 11 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter.Revenues increased 7% year over year to $211.1 million and were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Non-GAAP revenues of $208.5 million were within management's guidance of $204 million - $210 million.Advertising revenues moved up 14% from the year-ago quarter to $181.9 million. The year-over-year growth in online advertising revenues was driven by an increase of $31.9 million in Weibo advertising revenues, which was partially offset by a decline of $10.1 million in portal advertising revenues.Non-advertising revenues plummeted about 21% year over year to $29.2 million in the quarter. Non-GAAP non-advertising revenues for the quarter were $26.6 million compared with $32.3 million reported in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year decline in non-GAAP non-advertising revenues was mainly due to a decline of $4.8 million in mobile value added services (MVAS) revenues despite an increase of $1.9 million in Weibo value added services (VAS) revenues.Weibo revenues jumped 47.3% year over year to $105.2 million. Portal revenues declined 15.7% year over year to $105.9 million.Gross margin improved 100 basis points to 65% in the reported quarter. Advertising gross margin for the quarter was 65% compared with 64% in the prior-year quarter. Non-advertising gross margin for the quarter was 62%. Non-GAAP non-advertising gross margin for the quarter was 58% compared with 61% in the year-ago quarter, owing to lower margin from Weibo VAS.Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter totaled $123.3 million compared with $94.3 million in the prior year quarter, owing to increased personnel costs, marketing expenditures and bad debt expenses.As of Dec 31, 2014, SINA's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $2.2 billion, up from $1.9 billion on Dec 31, 2013. Cash provided by operating activities in the quarter was $4.7 million.SINA expects non-GAAP revenues for 2015 in the range of $800 million and $900 million, excluding deferred license revenues from E-House of $10.4 million.We believe that SINA remains a premier company based on its strong product pipeline, continuous investments in product development and marketing and a robust user base for its e-commerce and Weibo offerings.Although the investments in mobile and video are long-term positives, these will hurt profitability in the near term.Moreover, Weibo is expected to face stiff competition from the likes of WeChat in China, which will hurt its user base. We believe that Weibo's monetization ability will be a major driving factor for SINA amid increasing competition from the likes of Sohu.com Inc.  , NetEase  and Youku Tudou  in the video and brand advertising market.SINA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

However, Sony has enjoyed a significant advantage in the number of markets in which the PS4 has been available. The PS4 originally launched in only the U.S. and Canada, versus the 13 countries where the Xbox One was initially available. However by early December, Sony quickly increased the total number of markets in which it sold the PS4 to 32, while Microsoft remained supply constrained throughout the Xbox One's rollout. It remains to be seen how the sales battle in China will affect the balance of power.Breaking into the Chinese gaming market represents a massive commercial opportunity for both companies' gaming consoles. However, given the myriad of issues they both face in in the nation, it's probably best for gaming investors to approach this seemingly impressive PS4 and Xbox One storyline with cautious optimism.Apple forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering Apple's brand-new gadgets.

Consequently, Hardware unit sales for all eighth-generation consoles recorded double-digit growth from Jan 2015.Microsoft and Sony, however, continue to compete against each other in terms of units shipped. In February, research firm Strategy Analytics, released its data on the video console segment. According to the firm, Microsoft shipped 12.4 million Xbox One units post the Oct 2014 launch, which surpassed 10.4 million Xbox 360 units shipped post its launch in 2005.On the other hand, Sony shipped 18.5 million PlayStation 4 units in its first year; outpacing 10.5 million PlayStation 3 units shipped a year after release. Overall, Strategy Analytics predicts that the global active installed base of Sony's PS4 will reach 80 million units by 2019, much higher than Xbox One's 57 million.Currently, PlayStation 4 remains the leader in hardware sales with over 20.2 million units sold globally.Further, in February, eMarketer released the mobile game revenue growth data.

Facebook (  ) recently took its Internet.Org initiative to India because the increasing Internet penetration in the country will open the door to increased advertising revenue.But the main challenge for American companies is the stronger currency in which they are dealing, which makes all American goods expensive for Asian consumption. So they either transfer their cost centers to Asia and/or increase penetration to pull in much higher volumes.Another challenge they face is with respect to markets like China, which are still highly protected by the government, ensuring that the operating and regulatory environment is more favorable for Chinese operators. This makes it harder for U.S. companies to shine.That's why we've picked out these three Asian players that are not only seeing fast growth, but also paying out regular income to investors.This company offers online (and offline) education services and products including professional education courses and prep materials for accounting, healthcare, legal, and engineering and construction industries.

While snowfall is notoriously variable, most estimates of our total frozen precipitation run over 100 inches.And when I checked the weather app on my iPhone this morning, it said the temperature was -11 degrees. That's cold, no matter where you live.Veteran New Englanders are supposed to be laconic about the weather, just taking it all in stride, shoveling what needs to be shoveled and driving down streets that are narrowed by berms of snow as if it were the most normal thing in the world.That's a crock. The fact is that New Englanders complain about the weather constantly, blaming Canada for every Montreal Express or Polar Vortex that comes our way and railing against slick sidewalks, frozen fingertips and huge piles of snow that turn progressively browner from auto exhaust as the season wears on.Just because we have parkas, snow blowers, snow tires, big hats, snow boots and thick gloves doesn't mean we enjoy this #@*&!Maybe that's one reason that, when the sun comes out in this region and the thermometer tops 80\u00ba, it takes no time at all for New Englanders to head for the beach. Even if it's been cloudy for so many weeks that webs are growing between their toes, people in New England know that when the sun shines, they'd better slap on the sunblock and look for a spot on the sand for towels and coolers.But it's a little different with rainy stretches in the stock market. Even after the major indexes have shown some good strength and have climbed back into convincing uptrends, many investors continue to sit on the sidelines. And many of them will continue to sit while loads of money is being made by people who are climbing back on the bandwagon.The real shame is that some will persist in shunning the market until the rally has gone on for so long that everyone is happy and totally optimistic about stocks. Maybe there will even be a cover story in Time magazine about the new, improved stock market.So these folks will finally jump into the market \u2026 just as it begins to peak, stalls out and starts the correction process that will wipe out all late arrivers, which is what it always does.Some legendary investor-sources suggest that it was Baron Rothschild in the days following the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo-said that \"The time to buy is when there's blood in the streets.\" And another more recent market wit added, \"\u2026 even when it's your blood.\"If you take that to mean that it's a good time to buy when assets are extremely oversold, it's probably true. But what's true for a massively wealthy banking family isn't necessarily true for individual investors.And if you take the quote to mean that you should try to buy the market at the bottom, then it's not only false, it's impossible!If you would like to know how to make the transition out of a choppy market (like the one we've been in) with confidence, I have a suggestion. And it should come as no surprise to you that it involves a Cabot investment advisory.The suggestion is based on the fact that Cabot Market Letter has 44 years of experience getting growth investors out of bear markets and into cash, and then out of cash and back into bull markets. The method has nothing to do with intuition, economic predictions or the Magic Eight Ball.The  Cabot Trend Lines, Cabot Tides and the Two-Second Indicator have been honed and refined to make sure you never, repeat NEVER, miss a major bull move and never stay heavily invested during a major bear move.Bull markets are a great phenomenon; they make you feel smart and they make you money. And the confidence that comes with following a proven market timing system only adds to the experience. With the Cabot Market Letter and its award-winning timing system, you will know the Bull when it arrives-and when he leaves.And as for New England, we assume that summer will get here eventually. After the snow melts and the mud dries up, we'll let you know.---For my stock pick today, I'm recommending a Chinese web portal called  . The company operates a very popular, full-service portal that offers a huge menu of services, like news, weather, sports, entertainment news, email and a host of other services and connectors.But what sets NetEase apart from its competitors is its reliance on online games for its revenue.Here's what the stock's writeup in the January 19  had to say about it.\"The Internet has transformed Chinese society, and is continuing to do so. NetEase is a Chinese web portal that offers the same mix of news, weather, sports, entertainment, email, social media, commerce and ads that you find on Yahoo or any other full-service portal. What sets NetEase apart from its rivals is its emphasis on gaming, especially multiplayer games. The company has been active in mastering the transition from PC-based games to games played on mobile devices, which is where the Chinese web is heading. Investors are pleased that revenue growth increased from 21% in Q2 to 32% in Q3, with earnings growth climbing from 8% to 10%, respectively. NetEase recently announced a strategic partnership with Sinotrans, a Chinese logistics services provider, to speed delivery of goods that customers order from outside China, but the impact of that alliance won't show up for a while. Analysts are looking for revenue of $518 million when NetEase reports Q4 results, with EPS of $1.53. NetEase also pays a dividend with an annual yield of 1.3%. The NetEase story has good scale and excellent prospects.\"If NetEase seems like the type of stock you're interested in, you can buy it right here and watch it carefully-it's the type of momentum growth stock that can rise and fall quickly. Or you can subscribe to  and chief analyst Mike Cintolo will tell you exactly what to do.Sincerely,Paul GoodwinChief Analyst, Cabot China and Emerging Markets Reportand Editor of Cabot Wealth AdvisoryThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["hich valuation metric is better: the PEG ratio or the P/E ratio?Before we answer that question, let's first start with some basics.The P/E ratio is simply: Essentially, this tells you how much an investor is willing to pay for each unit (year) of earnings. If a stock is trading at a P/E ratio of 30, it is said to be trading at 30x times its annual earnings.In general, the lower the P/E ratio the better. A common threshold for many investors is a P/E of 20 or less. (For the record, at the time of this writing, the S&P 500 Index was trading at a P/E (using F1 Estimates) of 15.33.)A PEG ratio is the: Conventional wisdom says a value of 1 or less is considered good (at par or undervalued to its growth rate), while a value of greater than 1, in general, is not as good (overvalued to its growth rate).Many believe the PEG ratio tells a more complete story than just the P/E ratio. (The S&P at the time of this writing had a PEG ratio of 1.93.)Let's take a look at both of these in action.For example: a company with a P/E Ratio of 25 and a Growth Rate of 20% would have a PEG ratio of 1.25 (25 / 20= 1.25).While a company with a P/E Ratio of 40 and a Growth Rate of 50% would have a PEG Ratio of 0.80 (40 / 50= 0.80).Traditionally, investors would look at the stock with the lower P/E ratio and deem it a bargain (undervalued). But looking at it closer, you can see it doesn't have the growth rate to justify its P/E.The stock with the P/E of 40, however, is actually the better bargain since its PEG ratio is lower (0.80) and is trading at a discount to its growth rate.In other words, the lower the PEG ratio, the better the value. That's because the investor would be paying less for each unit of earnings growth.So which one is better?They both have their usefulness. I do like how the PEG positions the P/E ratio in relation to its growth rate to put everything into perspective.Quite frankly, I use both, so I'm going to say it's a tie. Plus, you couldn't even create the PEG ratio without the P/E.But, you don't have to choose one or the other. You can use both. And that's how we're using it in this week's screen.Let's first start with:\u2022 (Only stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buy can get thru.)\u2022 (Market outperformers are what we're looking for. The 1 year projected growth rate for the S&P is currently 7.94%. So only those above that will qualify.)\u2022 (Not only do we want our P/Es to be below their classic valuation threshold, but we want them to be below the median for their industry as well.)\u2022  (P/E divided by its (F1) projected growth rate. This one also has to be below its classic valuation marker and have a PEG ratio below the median for its industry. This ensures that they are considered undervalued on an absolute basis as well as undervalued relative to its group of peers.)\u2022 \u2022 This screen will find stocks with market beating growth rates, yet still be considered undervalued on two of the most effective valuation markers. And of course, with the Zacks Rank added to it, each one of these picks will be experiencing upward earnings estimate revisions, which provides a timely catalyst for the stock to move.Here are 5 stocks from this week's list, along with their P/E ratio (using F1 Estimates) and their PEG ratio (using F1 Projected Growth Rates): Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.(P/E: 17.58, PEG: 0.86) NetEase, Inc.(P/E: 7.53, PEG: 0.54) Haverty Furniture Cos.(P/E: 17.46, PEG: 1.00) Avago Technologies Ltd.(P/E: 15.99, PEG: 0.91) Summit Hotel Properties, Inc.(P/E: 13.54, PEG: 0.68)Sign up now for your 2 week free trial to the Research Wizard and get the rest of the stocks on this list and start using this screen in your own trading.

We believe that the decline in market indices were primarily responsible for this drop.Major news highlights over the past week include Activision Blizzard, Inc.'s (  ) expansion in China in collaboration with Tencent Holdings Limited and U.S. game developer Kabam, Inc.'s acquisition of TapZen and Magic Pixel Games. Other highlights include bidding for Nintendo Co. Ltd.'s (  ) vintage video game from the 1980s and lucky winners hitting the jackpot on International Game Technology's (  ) Wheel of Fortune Video Slot. ctivision Blizzard, in collaboration China-based Internet services provider Tencent Holdings Limited, launched its hit game Call of Duty Online in China.

We believe that Activision's latest collaboration will expand its business beyond the home turf, leading to financial synergies.2. As the video gaming business gains traction with the expansion in Internet services, many new entrants are coming into the limelight such as Kabam. The free-to-play game developer, which operates globally, acquired Los Angeles-based game developers, TapZen and Magic Pixel Games. The deal represents Kabam's ninth studio acquisition since 2010, which indicates its strategy of rapid expansion to establish itself in the video game industry.3. Another video game retailer, GameStop (  ), registered significant market share gains according to its holiday sales report. On Jan 13, the company reported holiday sales results for the nine-week period ended Jan 3. The company gained 10.5% on Jan 13 backed by a 94% surge in PS4 and Xbox One software sales mainly driven by games like Activision's  ,  and  . However, total global sales for the holiday period declined 6.7%.4. Leading game developer Nintendo is creating a buzz for its video game from the 1980s. This game - Stadium Events - was originally a Japanese video game developed by Bandai Companyin 1987.

International Game Technology once again made headlines with the payment of $1 Million-plus Jackpot in three months to two Wheel of Fortune Video Slot players at luxury resort hotel, The Venetian, at Las Vegas. Wheel of Fortune Video Slot - the company's flagship product - strengthens its position in the casino game market with the payment of mega jackpots, in our view.The following table shows the price movements of the major video game companies over both the past five trading days as well as the last six months:\n  \nOver the last 5 days, NetEase, Inc.

We believe that the company's exemplary performance across business segments and upgrade by JPMorgan Chase & Co. from a neutral to an overweight rating raised its market value. In addition, the expected positive impact of China's interest rate cuts on the company given its high exposure in the Far East remains a significant growth catalyst.

While Zynga, Inc. (  ), Activision Blizzard, Inc. (  ) gained momentum, Glu Mobile, Inc. (  ) and NetEase, Inc.

Further, the launch of critically acclaimed video game  in 2015 grabbed headlines.1. Zynga recently launched a new mobile game Looney Tunes Dash! following the launch of King's Candy Crush Soda Saga on Windows smartphones. The new game is similar to Temple Run and includes characters like Bugs Bunny, Roadrunner and Tweety. The game registered strong receptions and currently rated 4.1/5 on Google Play.2. With 2014 approaching its end, it is time to list the top of the charts video games. This time, Flappy Bird was labeled as Google's Most Searched-For Game of the Year. Reportedly, Flappy Bird, developed by Vietnamese Dong Nguyen and published by Vietnam-based GEARS Studios, has surpassed the popularity of top-of-the-charts games like Activision's Destiny. Unfortunately, the game is not available in the iOS App Store. However, several clones of this game exist, reflecting its popularity.3. International Game Technology (  ) recently launched its new slot game Jeopardy! on DoubleDown Casino that can be played on either desktop or mobile device. The TV quiz show Jeopardy!, which celebrated its 30th anniversary this year, enjoys worldwide popularity. The game now features new elements like Wild Rush, which adds another level of competition.

Activision Blizzard finally made its hit game Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft available on Android tablets. The famous strategy card game was already available for iPad and Windows tablet users.

(  ) tumbled.Some of the major stories that grabbed headlines over the past week were the launch of  by Activision Blizzard, Inc. (  ) and appointment of Chief Operating Officer at Perfect World Co., Ltd. (  ). Further, litigations against Electronic Arts and Chinese social messaging app, Momo Inc., made headlines.1. Activision recently announced hosting a  competition among 32 of the best Call of Duty teams from around the world. The company, in collaboration with Xbox, Major League Gaming (MLG) and other international eSports partners for the tournament, is offering $1 million in prize money to the winning team. Players need to register for online tournaments played on Xbox One in order to qualify.2. Electronic Arts has been sued by Ex-National Football League players for using their modes in the Madden NFL series without permission or proper compensation. The company has recreated the league's best moments by featuring some of the legendry NFL players in the video game without their permission. While Electronic Arts has been defending itself on grounds of incidental use and free speech, going by the current scenario the company may have to face hefty charges.3. China's leading Game developer Perfect World appointed its new Chief Operating Officer, Yunfan Zhang. Previously, Zhang served as the vice president and later senior vice president of the company. Having worked with popular gaming companies like NetEase, Zhang's expertise is expected to propel the company to new heights. The company's stock price is currently trending upward following Chairman Michael Yufeng Chi's proposal to acquire Perfect World for $20.00 per American Depositary Share (ADS).4. Following the merger between Bally Technologies and Scientific Games, the former provided important financial information on pre-merger operating performance so as to facilitate internal financial forecasts for fiscal 2015 and 2016. Bally Technologies offered details on its adjusted EBITDA and unlevered free cash flow to Scientific Games considering it crucial for evaluating its potential operating performance before the deal closes.5. Last month, NetEase accused Momo's CEO and co-founder Tang Yan of dubious business practices like intellectual property theft and violation of business contracts. Following NetEase's accusation, the Chinese mobile chat app firm announced that it will contest the allegations. While Momo shares surged 13% following this announcement, the company has shown concern regarding the impact of such litigations on the overall image of the company.The following table shows the price movements of the major video game companies over both the past five trading days as well as the last six months:\n  \nOver the last 5 days, NetEase remained the top gainer with 4.4% stock price rise, which in our view, may largely be attributed to the latest feud between NetEase and Momo. Given the current scenario, if Momo remains unsuccessful in defending itself, NetEase can fine the company heavily and generate significant cash flow going forward.On the other hand, the company that lost the most over the same time frame was Zynga, declining almost 5.5%. Notably, the company lost the most among the gaming stocks in 2014, declining 37.7% in the last year. Once known as the power house in social gaming, Zynga's success remained short lived with the changing scenario of the video gaming industry. With the onslaught of mobile gaming, investors are concerned about the company's prospects as it continues to lag.Over the six-month period, however, Electronic Arts gained the most - nearly 32.8%. We believe that the company's exemplary performance across business segments contributed to its rising market value. On the other hand, the stock that lost the most over the same time period was Glu Mobile with a 20.6% price drop.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We believe the company's exemplary performance across business segments and the recent upgrade by JPMorgan Chase & Co. from a neutral rating to overweight contribute to its rising market value. In addition, expected positive impact of China interest rate cuts on the company given its high exposure in the Far East market remain a significant growth catalyst.

Source: Chinagame.178.comOnline gaming has fallen out of the spotlight lately in the U.S., as social-media companies have largely turned to other sources of revenue and left gaming to specialist companies with fairly limited current prospects. But in China,  and a host of other players in the online gaming industry continue to vie for supremacy and an important market. NetEase reported third-quarter results Wednesday afternoon, and investors hope to see continued strong growth in the company's sales and net income, even as smaller companies like  and  have had more difficulty in sustaining their share prices. Let's look at how NetEase did last quarter and what the results mean for its future. NetEase's third-quarter numbers looked reasonably strong. Revenue climbed by more than 32%, with gains from all three of its segments. Gross profit margin fell somewhat from the year-ago level, but earnings of $1.45 per share were more than 10% higher than the $1.31 per share the company posted in 2013.Strength in NetEase's sales came from all corners. Online gaming revenue still represents the largest source of funds for the company, and it gained almost 17% from the previous year. While advertising-services revenue remains a relatively small piece of NetEase's overall sales, it soared 60% over the third quarter of 2013. E-commerce and related revenue more than tripled from a year ago and now represents more than 10% of NetEase's total revenue.Source: NetEase.NetEase's success has come in large part from games the company developed itself. The company's licensing arrangements have gone well, but by taking some of its popular online games and moving them to mobile formats, NetEase should build on its past success while taking advantage of the increasing popularity of mobile gaming. Expansion packs for its existing franchises have become an essential part of NetEase's growth strategy, and the company is also looking at the social-networking aspects of its mobile platform with the aim of building an ecosystem from which to launch future initiatives. As important as the past quarter's results are to investors, NetEase is already looking forward for new ways to drive its future results. On Nov. 18, the company will release the latest installment of the  series --  -- in China. In combination with  's Blizzard Entertainment, NetEase expects to host a live event in Beijing two days before the official release. Some question whether the aging  franchise can produce the growth it once did, but it's still important enough to NetEase to warrant attention.Source: NetEase.The biggest question facing NetEase is whether it can continue to transition away from PC-based gaming toward mobile platforms. Despite the  , NetEase has been slow to launch offerings aimed at mobile players, and the company hasn't gotten a huge amount of revenue from that side of the business in recent quarters.To thrive in the long run, NetEase must find a new way to reinvigorate its gaming business. If it can successfully build a viable mobile strategy, as well as make the most of a waning PC-centered business, then the company could justify the hopes that shareholders have had for its prospects recently. Otherwise, NetEase could go back to languishing in the same share-price doldrums that Perfect World and Changyou have endured for a long time.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed.

Image source: Blizzard Entertainment.Online gaming is big business in China, and among the major players there,  remains a key participant and has captured its share of success as a result. With the company reporting its fourth-quarter and full-year 2014 results on Monday afternoon, investors had high hopes that NetEase would be able to sustain its growth and deliver impressive performance to build momentum coming into 2015. NetEase had considerable success during the quarter, but it still needs to demonstrate its ability to keep its competitive edge in an increasingly cutthroat industry. Let's take a closer look at how NetEase closed out the year and how it will fare in 2015.From the big-picture perspective, NetEase did well in the fourth quarter. Sales jumped by 43% in local currency terms, with dollar revenues of $593.7 million easily topping the $522 million that most investors had expected to see. Similarly, earnings per American depository share of $1.56 was better than the $1.49 consensus among those following the stock.Source: NetEase.All of NetEase's major segments saw impressive sales growth. Online gaming revenue climbed 36%, which is especially important given that it represents more than three-quarters of NetEase's total sales. Advertising services gained at a slower pace of just 23%, but revenue from e-commerce and other related sources more than tripled to $61.4 million. Margin growth also helped NetEase's results, with extensive gains in advertising and e-commerce gross margins offsetting a 1.7 percentage-point drop from the online gaming segment.NetEase called out both its licensed games and its own self-developed offerings as contributing to its strong performance. In November, the company launched  the fifth expansion set to the  series. Yet NetEase also cited its own Fantasy Westward Journey II and New Westward Journey Online II as driving higher sales in the online-gaming segment. Meanwhile, NetEase has seen greater demand for advertising services from the financial, communication, and real-estate industries, making up for the loss of one-time revenue related to the 2014 FIFA World Cup.Soccer played a key role in advertising for NetEase, but it's also part of its gaming lineup. NetEase understands that it can't afford to stand still despite its past performance. Already in 2015, the company has released two of its own 3-D massively multiplayer online role-playing games, and it is also working with  and its Blizzard Entertainment division on the beta version of  .CEO William Ding also stressed the evolution of gaming onto mobile devices. \"Mobile Internet is playing an increasing role in China's expanding Internet market,\" said Ding, \"[and] we plan to introduce more mobile games this year.\" Specifically, by using its YiChat user base, NetEase hopes to improve its distribution channel for mobile games and expects to introduce an enterprise version of YiChat for small and mid-sized businesses to get even greater network effects from the service.The key for NetEase will be finding ways to get people to migrate from PC to mobile games. Given how many popular games it already has in its arsenal, NetEase only needs to coax those users over to the mobile side in order to start reaping more benefits from the mobile world.Still, investors have benefited already from NetEase's growth. The company announced a dividend of $0.39 per ADS for the quarter, up $0.03 from the previous quarter. With a policy to track after-tax net income with its payouts, the steady gains reflect NetEase's ongoing ability to sustain its sales and become as profitable as possible.NetEase shares eased upward in the first half-hour following the announcement, indicating a wait-and-see attitude among shareholders. If NetEase can execute well on its core strategy, then further gains could be in store even with the ongoing challenges involved in standing up to its rivals in the Chinese gaming world.Apple forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering Apple's brand-new gadgets.

That means it's selling at 11.67 times earnings. Another way of looking at it is you're paying $11.67 for $1 of earnings.The Earnings Yield is calculated as Earnings / PriceUsing the example above, a stock with $3 of Earnings trading at a Price of $35 ($3 / $35) has an earnings yield of 0.0857 or 8.57%. The Earnings Yield, also known as the E/P Ratio, is expressed as a percentage. So a yield of 8.57% would also mean 8.57 cents of earnings for $1 of investment.Of course, this is all potential, because prices and earnings change.The most common way people will use this ratio is to compare it to other stocks and to compare the yields to the 10 Year T-Bill.Conventional wisdom has it that if the yield on the stock market (S&P 500 for example) is lower than the yield on the 10 Year Treasury, then stocks might be considered overvalued.If the yield on the S&P 500 is greater than the 10 Year T-Bill, stocks would be considered undervalued.The theory behind this is that Bonds and Stocks are competing for investors' dollars. And to attract investment interest in stocks, a higher yield needs to be paid to the stock investor for the extra risk he's assuming compared to the virtual risk-free investment offered in US backed Treasuries.If earnings go up, the yield goes up. If earnings go down, so does the yield.Prices also affect the yield, but they move inversely. If Prices go up, the yield goes down. And if prices go down, the yield goes up.In June of 2007, the yield on the 10 Yr. T-Bill was 4.95%.However, the earnings yield on the S&P 500 was 4.19%.Not much of a risk premium on a risk based investment.Remember, if the earnings yield on stocks is below the T-Bill rate, stocks are considered overvalued. (I should point out that within months, the market began to falter.)I also happened to write about the earnings yield in March of 2009. This time, the earnings yield was high. Back then, the earnings yield on the S&P 500 using the 12 Month Projected Earnings Estimate was 9.51% compared to the 10 Yr. Treasury of 2.89%.With yields well above the 10 Year, conventional wisdom said that stocks were 'undervalued'. Of course, they could have continued to get more undervalued. But the market was quickly bid up - resulting in one of the largest rallies we've ever seen. And it's still going.So where is it now?Currently, the earnings yield for the S&P is 6.03% compared to the 10 Year Treasury of 2.30%.So stocks are still the more attractive investment, assuming you're ok with the risk that comes along with it.The screen I'm running today looks for the following:\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 (For those using the Research Wizard, the calculation looks like this:(i642/i5)*100That's the 12 Month Forward Looking Estimate (i642) divided by the Current Price (i5))\u2022 \u2022 Here are 5 stocks from this week's screen (for Tues., 11/25/14): Cooper Tire & Rubber(9.50% Earnings Yield) Hawaiian Holdings(9.46% Earnings Yield) Mylan(7.20% Earnings Yield) NetEase(11.89% Earnings Yield) TG Therapeutics(9.21% Earnings Yield)Get the rest of the stocks on this list and start using the Earnings Yield in your own screens.

The year-over-year growth was driven by Weibo advertising growth fueled by the FIFA World Cup in Brazil.Non-advertising revenues decreased 11.3% year over year to $28.6 million in the quarter, but surpassed management's guided range of $25-$27 million. The decline was mainly due to lower mobile value added services (MVAS) revenues, partially offset by the $10.0 million increase in Weibo value added services (VAS) revenues.Weibo revenues jumped 105.4% year over year to $77.3 million. The monthly active user for month of June grew 30% on a year-over-year basis. The strong growth momentum of Weibo advertising was driven by native ads, particularly for small and medium sized enterprises, as well as Alibaba and ecommerce merchant revenues.Portal revenues climbed 6.2% year over year to $96.3 million. The growth was driven by an improved Internet services sector.Gross margin increased to 60.1% from 52.1% in the year-ago quarter. This increase was mainly attributable to a higher revenue base and a significant jump in advertising and non-advertising gross margin. A favorable product mix of higher margin Weibo advertising and value-added-services backed the increased.Operating expenses as percentage of revenues flared up 20 basis points (bps) to 67.3%. The sharp rise was mainly due to 41.9% higher selling & marketing expenses and 15.6% higher product development costs, partially offset by 8.3% lower general & administrative expense.However, the steep rise in operating expenses negatively impacted profitability. The company reported operating loss (including stock-based compensation) of $12.8 million, narrower than a loss of $22.9 million in the year-ago quarter.SINA reported net income was $4.6 million or 7 cents compared with a loss of $17.4 million or 266 cents per share.SINA exited the second quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.30 billion compared with $1.81 billion at the end of the first quarter. Cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter was $9 million.SINA expects revenues for the third quarter of 2014 in the range of $193 million to $199 million. Management believes that increasing investment by Weibo on product development and marketing will hurt its as well as SINA's operating results in 2014. SINA expects to invest further in its own portal (mobile and video) that will also keep margins under pressure.We believe that SINA remains a premier company based on its strong product pipeline, continuous investments in product development and marketing and a robust user base for its e-Commerce and Weibo offerings.However, the recent licensing issue with the Chinese government is a major headwind, which will negatively impact brand revenues in the near term. Although the investments in mobile and video are long-term positives, these will hurt profitability for the rest of 2014.Moreover, Weibo is expected to face stiff competition from the likes of WeChat in China, which will hurt its user base. We believe that Weibo's monetization ability will be a major driving factor for SINA amid increasing competition from the likes of Sohu.com Inc. (  ), NetEase (  ) and Youku Tudou (  ) in the video and brand advertising market.Currently, SINA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

That is because NTES is now in overbought territory with an RSI value of 72.56.RSI stands for 'Relative Strength Index' and it is a popular indicator used by technically focused investors. It compares the average of gains in days that closed up to the average of losses in days that closed down; readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought, while an RSI below 30 suggests undervalued conditions are present.Yet NTES's high RSI value isn't the only reason for investors to be concerned, as there has been some decidedly negative earnings estimate revisions in NetEase's stock as of late. This is especially true when investors dive into some of these revisions in order to get a better picture of NTES's prospects for the near term.Over the past two months, investors have witnessed 5 earnings estimate revision lower compared to none higher for the current year. The consensus estimate for NTES has also been on a downward trend over the same time period too, as the estimate has fallen from $6.07/share two months ago to just $5.83/share today.If this wasn't enough, NetEase also has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) which puts it into unfortunate company among its peers. So, given all of these factors, investors may want to consider exiting this stock now before it falls back to Earth.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The stock plunged 10.1% ($4.84) to close at $43.02 on May 22, 2014.SINA reported first-quarter 2014 earnings of 6 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents. Earnings were also much better than a loss of 6 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter.Earnings per share include stock-based compensation ($6.9 million) but exclude net one-time items ($37.4 million) in the first quarter.Revenues increased 36.1% year over year to $171.5 million and were slightly higher than management's guided range of $162.0 to $167.0 million. Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $170.0 million.However, adjusting for deferred revenues ($4.1 million) mostly related to the license agreements resulting from the E-House/CRIC transaction, revenues were $167.3 million up 38.0% from the year-ago quarter.Advertising revenues moved up 43.9% from the year-ago quarter to $135.7 million. Advertising revenues were almost in line with the higher end of management's guided range of $133.0-$136.0 million. Non-advertising revenues increased 17.1% year over year to $31.6 million in the quarter, ahead of management's guided range of $29.0-$31.0 million.Weibo revenues jumped 160.8% year over year to $67.5 million. This was driven by new revenue streams from promoted feeds for small and medium sized enterprises as well as Alibaba's e-Commerce revenues. Portal revenues climbed 3.9% year over year to $104.0 million.Gross margin increased to 59.0% from 49.4% in the year-ago quarter. This increase was mainly due to higher revenue base and a significant jump in advertising and non-advertising gross margin. The increase was primarily due to favorable product mix of higher margin Weibo advertising and value-added-services.Operating expenses as percentage of revenues jumped 460 basis points (bps) to 66.0%. The sharp rise was mainly driven by higher selling & marketing expenses and product development costs, which increased by 510 bps and 120 bps, respectively, year over year. This was partially offset by a 90 bps decline in general & administrative expenses.However, the massive jump in operating expenses negatively impacted profitability. The company reported operating loss (including stock-based compensation but excluding one-time items) of $11.7 million, slightly better than a loss of $14.5 million in the year-ago quarter.SINA reported GAAP net loss of $33.2 million or 52 cents per share compared with loss of $13.2 million or 20 cents per share. Including stock-based compensation but excluding one-time items, net income was $4.2 million or 6 cents compared with a loss of $3.7 million or 6 cents per share.Excluding stock-based and one-time items, SINA reported net income of $11.1 million or 15 cents per share compared with $1.5 million or 2 cents per share.SINA exited the first quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.81 billion compared with $1.87 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. Cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter was $4.9 million. During the quarter, SINA's board approved a share buyback program worth $500.0 million.On Apr 25, 2014, SINA announced that the Chinese regulatory authorities have decided to withdraw two licenses related to Internet Publication and Online transmission of Audio-Visual programs.The withdrawal follows a crackdown on pornographic content by the Chinese authorities. Reportedly, the regulatory authorities found pornographic content on SINA's online reading channel and website. Beijing Municipal Cultural Market Administrative Law Enforcement Unit has also proposed to levy fines on SINA for the violation.In April, Weibo started trading at Nasdaq. As compared to its original expectation of $500.0 million, Weibo finally raised $286.0 million in the IPO, primarily due to low demand for Chinese Internet stocks. SINA holds a 54.0% stake in Weibo, with Chinese e-Commerce giant Alibaba being the second largest partner with 30.0% holding on a fully diluted basis.SINA expects revenues for the second quarter of 2014 to be in the range of $177.0 to $182.0 million while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $183.0 million. Advertising revenues are expected in the range of $152.0-$155.0 million, while non-advertising revenues are projected in the range of $25.0-$27.0 million.Management believes that increasing investment by Weibo on product development and marketing will hurt its as well as SINA's operating results in 2014. SINA expects to invest further on its own portal (mobile and video) that will also keep margins under pressure.We believe that SINA remains a premier company based on its strong product pipeline, continuous investments in product development and marketing and a robust user base for its e-Commerce and Weibo offerings.However, the recent licensing issue with the Chinese government is a major headwind, which will negatively impact brand revenues in the near term. Although the investments on mobile and video are long-term positives, they will hurt profitability for the rest of 2014.Moreover, Weibo is expected to face stiff competition from the likes of WeChat in China, which will hurt user base. We believe that Weibo's monetization ability will be a major driving factor for SINA amid increasing competition from the likes of  ,  and  in the video and brand advertising market.Currently, SINA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Concerns that China's growth rate was slipping was compounded by weaknesses in certain sectors. This had prompted the government to implement measures designed to stimulate the economy. Recent data suggests that such measures are bearing fruit.The HSBC flash PMI has increased to 52 in July. This is the index's highest level in one and a half years. The reading came in above most economists' estimates. Any reading above 50 indicates that manufacturing has expanded. The nation's benchmark index, the Shanghai Composite, jumped 1.3% last Thursday to close at a three-month high following this development.The final reading of the HSBC index is due on Aug 1. Official manufacturing data will also be released based on this information. This gauge increased to 51 in June from a level of 50.8 in May -- its highest reading for the year up to now.Earlier this month, industrial production increased during the first half of 2014. According to official figures, China's value-added industrial output increased 8.8% during Jan-Jun on a year over year basis. This is higher than the 8.7% increase experienced in the first quarter. Output grew 9.2% in June, the fastest increase so far this year.Retail sales also grew during the first half of the year, by 12.1%. Growth was powered by strong performance by the online sector. Performance during the Jan-Jun period outperformed first quarter performance. Retail sales grew by 12% during this period.The Chinese government has implemented several stimulus measures to ensure that growth remains on track. This includes both monetary and fiscal measures, namely easing credit and increasing government spending. However, it also includes significant regulatory reforms.This includes changes to house purchase regulations to rejuvenate a beleaguered property sector. Such steps have possibly been triggered by a decline in home prices. However, the good news is that they have been greeted with resounding applause by the markets. E-House (China) Holdings Limited (  ) posted gains for a fifth successive day last Thursday following reports of such reforms.In fact, key China ADRs have continued to move upward. Despite recent volatility in tech stocks, caused primarily by the resumption of IPOs, promising earnings from Baidu, Inc. (  ) was all it took to push up other China ADRs on Friday. Among these gainers were YY Inc. (  ), Qihoo 360 Technology Co. Ltd. (  ) and Ctrip.com International Ltd. (  ).These indicators and PMI numbers in particular indicate that the economy is on track to achieve its 7.5% growth target for 2014. The economy grew at 7.5% in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis.The growth report was of great significance because it was a marginal improvement from the 7.4% experienced in the first quarter. Second quarter growth numbers prompted analysts at several banks to revise their 2014 growth forecast upward.Taken together, these factors indicate that the Chinese economy may be back on track. Below we present three stocks which are good choices in this environment, each of which also has a good Zacks Rank. (  ) is a holding company operating in the Internet technology domain. NetEase has three business units. These are: Advertising Services and E-mail, Online Game Services, and Wireless Value-added Services and Others.The company offers these services to Guangyitong Advertising and Guangzhou NetEase.

It has a P/E (F1) of 8.15.Some concerns about whether the current rate of growth is sustainable still linger.

Recent economic data also supports such a view. This is why these stocks would make good additions to your portfolio.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Although it established its reputation in China with mobile security software, the company has spent the past couple of years investing heavily in new mobile gaming and search technology.Its search engine launched in August 2012 as a direct competitor toBaidu (  ), China's No. 1 search engine. Although Baidu dwarfs Qihoo in market cap and annual revenue -- Baidu had $5.2 billion in revenue last year vs. $671 million for Qihoo -- the battle for market share is becoming increasingly competitive.According to data from CNZZ, a Chinese research firm, Qihoo handled about 25% of China's Web search traffic in January vs. Baidu's 58.3% share.By the end of last year's third quarter, Qihoo had already hit its year-end goal of 20% of China's search traffic. The company aims to grow that figure even more this year.\"Our goal is to achieve 30% search traffic at the end of 2014. As we deepen our reach within the PC search market, we are also capturing additional share (in) mobile search,\" Chief Executive Hongyi Zhou said on a conference call following Qihoo's fourth-quarter earnings report last week.The company also looks to keep expanding its base of search advertising revenue.During the fourth quarter, Qihoo reported that online ad revenue more than doubled from a year earlier to $142.4 million. Most of that came via advertising appearing on users' startup pages.Qihoo has been aggressive in its efforts to monetize its search business. In January it made headlines when it hired John Liu away fromGoogle (  ) China, where he served as a vice president. Liu, installed as Qihoo's chief business officer, will work to build more revenue out of Qihoo's search traffic.Qihoo also has plans to rapidly expand its sales force.\"We will continue to build our search advertising sales network, including the direct sales force and agency networks,\" CEO Zhou said on the conference call. \"We certainly are very pleased with our results in search traffic and the monetization thus far, and we're seeing even greater potential ahead of us.\"The company handles about 15% of search ads sold in China, Jefferies analyst Cynthia Meng noted in a report. She expects new products in Qihoo's search pipeline this year to \"further diversify its ad placement channels and attract more ad dollars.\"Qihoo also sees a big opportunity in mobile gaming. At the end of 2013, it had more than 800 games running on its game platform. The total number of paying gaming accounts grew to about 700,000 vs. 560,000 in the prior quarter.\"Our game platform continues to attract game developers and the user activities under one scheme,\" CEO Zhou said. \"We are pleased with the overall market and achieved robust growth in this segment despite the cooling off in PC games and increased competition in mobile games.\"A rising number of gamers in China has switched to mobile from traditional desktop gaming. In a report, analyst Tian X. Hou of T.H. Capital noted that mobile gaming revenue in China grew 59% to $515 million between the third and fourth quarters of 2013.\"Qihoo is well-positioned to enjoy robust growth in the mobile game industry,\" Hou said. \"Based on our assessment of industry data, we believe Qihoo could outperform the industry growth-wise.\"The story regarding mobile search is a little fuzzier for Qihoo. Following the company's Q4 earnings report, Zhou conceded that the company doesn't have any revenue from mobile search yet.Analyst Hou notes that Qihoo's search monetization is \"still in an early stage when compared with peers,\" though Qihoo's growth \"is more rapid\" than that of its peers.Qihoo posted fourth-quarter revenue of $221.6 million, up from $103 million the prior year and above views for $209.7 million. Earnings more than tripled to 70 cents a share vs. analyst estimates for 43 cents.Growth was driven by \"solid performance\" from both online advertising and Internet value-added services, CFO Zuoli Xu said on the conference call.Qihoo gave revenue guidance of $226 million to $228 million for the first quarter of 2014, above Wall Street's consensus estimate of $203 million.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the company to post Q1 earnings of 31 cents a share, up from 14 cents a year earlier. Profit for all of 2014 is seen climbing 34% to $2.33 a share.Qihoo shares touched a record high of 124.42 on Friday and currently trade near 117. Qihoo, Baidu,NetEase (  ) andNQ Mobile (  ) (  in IBD's The New America on Wednesday) were among Chinese tech firms pulling back in the stock market this week after customs officials in China reported a drop in February exports.Hou calls 2014 a \"critical year\" for many Internet companies in China because of growth opportunities in mobile platforms and other sectors. Major Internet companies plan to spend a lot of money on investment and marketing. \"Qihoo, as one of the major online traffic distributors, will benefit significantly from such budget flow,\" Hou said.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) recently approved a new share repurchase program worth approximately $500.0 million.

The year-over-year growth in revenues in the fourth quarter was primarily attributable to the strong momentum from the monetization of Weibo.Sina provided its first quarter 2014 revenue guidance in a range of $162-$167 million. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $171 million happens to be higher than the guidance range.We believe that SINA remains a premier company based on its strong product pipeline, continuous investments in product development and marketing and a robust user base for its e-commerce and Weibo offerings.However, increasing competition from  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and Tencent will hurt profitability over the long term.

Earnings were much better than 5 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. The results were driven by strong revenue growth and margin expansion.Revenues increased 7.0% year over year to $192.3 million and were within management's guided range of $190.0 million to $194.0 million. However, revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $197.0 million.The year-over-year growth in revenues was primarily driven by higher revenues from online advertising and fee-based services. The growth of total revenue and advertising revenues in the fourth quarter was mainly attributable to the strong momentum for Weibo monetization.Advertising revenues moved up 44.6% from the year-ago quarter to $160.1 million. Advertising revenues were in line with the lower end of management's guided range of $160.0 million-$162.0 million. Weibo advertising revenues jumped 163% year over year to $56.0 million.Non-advertising revenues increased 29.8% year over year to $36.9 million in the quarter, ahead of management's guided range of $30.0 million-$32.0 million. Weibo non-advertising revenues surged 114.0% year over year to $15.4 million, driven by the launch of Weibo data licensing services as well as from the growth of other fee-based services.Mobile value-added services (MVAS) revenues were $11.1 million, down 16.6% from the year-ago quarter.Gross margin increased to 63.6% from 41.5% in the year ago quarter. This increase was mainly due to a higher revenue base and an increase in gross margins of the advertising and non-advertising business. The increase in non-GAAP non-advertising revenue gross margin was primarily due to a shift in revenue mix from low-margin mobile value-added services to higher margin Weibo value-added services.Operating expenses increased 34.5% from the year-ago quarter to $99.3 million. The sharp rise was mainly driven by higher selling and marketing expenses, product development costs and general and administrative expenses, which increased 490 bps, 350 bps and 220 bps, respectively on a year over year basis.Operating income was $23.0 million, up from $0.9 million in the year-ago quarter. The recovery was primarily due to an increase in revenues and gross margin expansion. Net income improved to $27.5 million in the quarter from $3.5 million in the year-ago quarter.SINA exited the fourth quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.87 billion compared with $1.22 billion at the end of the third quarter. Cash provided by operating activities for the fourth quarter was $41.9 million compared with $12.3 million in the prior quarter.SINA expects revenues for the first quarter of 2014 to be in the range of $162 million and $167 million while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $171.0 million. Advertising revenues are expected in the range of $133.0 million-$136.0 million, while non-advertising revenues are projected in the range of $29.0 million-$31.0 million.We believe that SINA remains a premier company based on its strong product pipeline, continuous investments in product development and marketing and a robust user base for its e-commerce and Weibo offerings.Moreover, vertical expansion will form an integral part of SINA's growth strategy going forward and the company aims to achieve it through internal expansion or through partnership with vertical players, or in some cases through merger and acquisition.However, increasing competition from  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and Tencent will hurt profitability over the long term.

They've settled back just a bit, and are up 74% year to date through Wednesday.Why the surge in the stock price on the announcement? \"The deal makes them a more credible player in the mobile Internet space, which is where people believe the future of the Internet is,\" said Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Andy Yeung.\"If they don't do anything on the mobile side, they have the risk of becoming irrelevant in the future,\" he said. \"Being able to secure a beachhead in the mobile communication space is a key to their future in the mobile Internet. That's why people are excited about it.\"One of the key features of the app, called YiChat, is that users can send free text and voice messages to any mobile phone or free voice messages to fixed lines, without the need for YiChat to be installed on the receiving devices.China Telecom customers also get free data promotional packages with their use of YiChat.China Telecom will hold 73% of Zhejiang Yixin Corp., which will operate the new app, and its representatives will be the joint venture's chairman and financial chief, according to the Shanghai Daily. NetEase will hold the remaining stake and be responsible for product design and operation. YiChat launched on Aug. 19.\"This partnership signals the start of NetEase's entry into the mobile instant messaging space, and is one of the key components of our mobile Internet strategy,\" said CEO William Ding in a statement.The move comes on the heels of NetEase's introduction of its first mobile game in early July.NetEase declined to comment further on the venture. But the Beijing-based company will face competition with its YiChat app, particularly from Tencent Holdings, China's biggest Internet company and developer of the WeChat app. WeChat is a popular mobile instant text and voice communication app.\"NetEase will instantly have access to the wireless subscribers of China Telecom,\" said Yeung. \"This deal will allow them to challenge Tencent's dominance by teaming up China Telecom.\"China Telecom has a total of 177 million mobile subscribers, of which 90 million are 3G subscribers, he says.But competing against a big player like Tencent won't be easy, he adds. The WeChat app is very popular and it already has a very large user base.WeChat -- also known as Weixin in China -- has 300 million-plus registered users in China and 100 million-plus registered international users, says Yeung.\"We're looking at a co-existence situation between YiChat and WeChat,\" added T.H. Capital analyst Tian Hou.The reason: The No. 1 advantage, says Hou, is that YiChat is more user-friendly than WeChat and it's an \"open application.\"\"YiChat is not an isolated and closed-end application,\" she adds. \"Users can reach out to their friends. So it has a radiating effect. If you can communicate beyond YiChat, you could be able to reach out to an audience much bigger than your own YiChat registered users.\"Another advantage to NetEase is China Telecom's financial support. The data usage associated with YiChat and receiving messages from YiChat are free for people who aren't registered users of YiChat, adds Hou, since China Telecom will subsidize the usage.She says about one-fourth of mobile phones in China are sold through mobile operators and China Telecom will have the YiChat app pre-installed on their phones. That gives NetEase \"distribution power,\" says Hou.She says with the three advantages of financial support, distribution power and its open-application format, YiChat could see a good adoption rate.\"But how much, we really don't know at this point,\" she said.NetEase operates an interactive online community in China and is a major provider of Chinese language content and services through online games, its Internet portal and wireless value-added services. It generates revenue on the fees it charges users of its online games, which includes an exclusive license in China forActivision Blizzard 's (  ) popular \"World of Warcraft\" multiplayer game.Most of NetEase's revenue comes from games developed in-house, such as \"Fantasy Westward Journey.\" It also integrates revenue from selling ads on the NetEase websites.To complement its online games, in July NetEase introduced \"Fantasy Westward Journey II,\" a comprehensive upgrade with an accompanying pocket mobile version of \"Fantasy Westward Journey,\" one of its longest operating and most popular games.\"Mobile devices present a terrific platform for us to extend the reach of our games from PC to mobile players and enhance the user experience,\" said CEO Ding in a statement.He said he plans to release more mobile games that leverage the company's research and development expertise in coming months.\"We find it encouraging that NetEase released its first mobile game in the quarter leveraging the content of one of its most popular PC games,\" wrote Morningstar analyst Dan Su in a report. \"We view mobile as an attractive growth area where NetEase can tap incremental demand and achieve scale efficiency.\"NetEase is the third largest company in IBD's Computer Software-Gaming industry group, after Activision Blizzard andNintendo Co. (  ), beforeElectronic Arts (  ).Overall, NetEase reported a strong second quarter. Earnings rose 30% to $1.37 a share, handily beating estimates by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue leapt 27% to $393.2 million, also topping views.They were the best sales and earnings gains since the first quarter of 2012. Sales growth accelerated for the third straight quarter.Revenue from NetEase's online games was up 18.2%, while ad services saw a 33.3% rise in sales. During the quarter, the company commercially launched a new 3D real-time strategy game -- \"Heroes of Three Kingdoms\" -- and also introduced new expansion packs for \"Tianxia III,\" \"Westward Journey Online II\" and \"Westward Journey Online III.\"\"Recently released self-developed games, coupled with major expansion packs of long-standing games, drove strong gamer activities and spending in the quarter,\" wrote Su.Price increases for flagship games such as \"Fantasy Westward Journey\" and \"Westward Journey II,\" which began in February, also contributed to the favorable year-over-year comparison, she adds. And efforts to \"revive\" the portal advertising business paid off in the quarter, with NetEase attracting more ad dollars from clients in the real estate, financial services and consumer goods sectors.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see full-year earnings rising 23% to $5.48 a share.

So, in recent years, investors placed nearly a trillion dollars of long-term assets into global equity mutual funds.Globally diversified investors put their largest concentration of assets into broad global mutual funds that invest across all non-U.S. regions (at around $500B).Following this were Asia-focused funds (at around $300B).Numerous regional and country share indexes have extended a streak of underperformance that stretches back to mid-2010.Consider the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, tracked by the  (  ). It fell -3% YTD versus a +17% rise for the  (  ). That benchmark has hit a string of record closes in 2013. The  (  ) is up nearly +12% YTD. It set an all-time high in May.Three years of underperformance leaves emerging market stocks trading at the biggest discount to developed-market stocks in five years. Ponder these four fact sets:(a) Many major emerging-market companies are more profitable and less burdened with debt than developed-world counterparts. Think Samsung and Hyundai.(b) Consider the weak technical backdrop and future fate of stagnant shares in Spanish banks  (  ) offering a 4.6% dividend and  (  ) offering an 8.6% dividend yield with broad exposure to Latin America.(c) Take a look at regional and country MSCI 12-month Price-to-Earnings equity valuations shown below.This  table shows a current valuation opportunity of nearly 30% in Europe over its 10-year P/E average, 10% in Asia, and close to 10% in broad emerging markets indexes. Interestingly, going in the other direction, Latin American regional indexes look overbid by about 20%.At a large country 'BRIC' level, Russian shares may offer a nearly 50% premium over their 10-year valuation averages; Chinese shares a 25% premium; Indian shares a 12% premium. Going in the other direction, Brazilian shares may be overvalued by 20%.(d) Investors hear about a 2% dividend yield on the S&P 500 index. However, equity indexes tied to the \"Rest of the World\" offer sweeter  to investors.Current dividend yields compared to 10-year average yields on the same index offer another take on under and over-valuation in global indexes.Consult the MSCI international index dividend yield table below. The biggest dividend opportunities are listed at the top of each rank.When it comes to global markets, there are enduring reasons to doubt these equities can shake underperformance.Are significant stock bargains to be had as a result of emerging market index underperformance? Could overdue portfolio rebalancing toward emerging world indexes, specifically country indexes like Russia and China, be on its way?Here are the three big enduring reasons to stay away: But signs the Chinese economy is slowing has helped push down commodity prices.China is just one part of the broader slump in commodity prices. The drop in oil, precious and non-precious metals, and agricultural commodity prices is making life rough for lots of emerging-markets investors. The MSCI emerging markets index is heavily weighted toward Energy and Materials sectors, which has hurt its performance.It's spelled trouble for funds heavily weighted toward country indexes like Brazil or Russia too. These countries have commodity-dependent economies that offer major Materials and Energy stocks to international investors. Funds that had been more focused on the so-called BRICs -- Brazil, Russia, India and China -- had a leg up when commodities were booming. They have been left behind compared with funds exposed to booming emerging stock markets without major Energy and Materials companies, like as Indonesia and Turkey.Aggressive monetary and fiscal stimulus has sent the Japanese yen plunging. Japan's benchmark Nikkei stock index has rallied nearly +70% since November -- even after a recent big correction.The slumping yen -- down more than -15% versus the U.S. dollar YTD -- aids Japanese exporters. But it works against competing Asian companies outside Japan. In response, South Korea's KOSPI Composite Index is down -1.2%.For example, a weak yen hurts South Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia, who compete directly against Japanese companies  (  ) and  (  ). The weak yen is not an obstacle for Asian, European, and U.S. firms that are part of Japan's automotive supply chain.In Europe, the irony of the situation is there may be a \"beggar-thy-neighbor\" condition playing out inside Europe. An entrenched fiscal/balanced budget situation and an overvalued real effective euro currency in terms of internal European trade buttress the German economy.This may be part of what is holding back the rest of Europe.A few savvy pundits contend it is time for investors to scale up global market exposure. Why?\u2022 There are signs Europe's GDP slide is at least slowing.\u2022 The U.S. economy may be building up GDP growth. Global spillovers could be significant.These two catalysts could lead to institutional portfolio rebalancing towards global markets.Global Info Tech companies offer value priced cyclical stocks with less downside risk than global/macro driven sectors like Energy and Materials. A good example would be  (  ), a mainland Chinese Internet Technology company.Certain global shares can be cash-rich. Look at Australian fixed and wireless telecommunications company  (  ). Australia's principal telco offers a 6% dividend yield.Global Health Care shares can also deliver on strong and stable earnings growth expectations. Look at Italian  (  ). The company is a leader in premium, luxury, and sports eyewear with approximately 7,000 optical and sun retail stores in North America, Asia-Pacific, China, South Africa, Latin America and Europe. Proprietary brands include Ray-Ban, the world's most famous sun eyewear brand, Oakley, Vogue Eyewear, Persol, Oliver Peoples, Alain Mikli, Arnette and REVO.Inside the Zacks Rank world, global Info Tech and Health Care consumer stocks deliver low double-digit earnings growth annually.And more earnings surprises!The stocks I mentioned in this last section are Zacks Rank #1 now.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" reported first quarter loss of 6 cents per share (including stock-based compensation), much better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 11 cents per share. First quarter results significantly improved from a loss of 27 cents in the year-ago quarter.Revenues jumped 19.5% year over year to $121.3 million in the quarter. Including deferred revenues of $4.7 million, revenues surged 18.6% year over year and were slightly better than management's guided range of $115.0 million to $119.0 million.Revenues fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $124.0 million.Higher advertising revenues primarily drove the year-over-year growth in revenues in the quarter, up 20.0% from the year-ago quarter to $94.3 million. Advertising revenues were slightly ahead of the low end of management's guided range of $94.0 million to $96.0 million.Non-advertising revenues increased 17.4% year over year to $27.0 million in the quarter, ahead of management's guided range of $21.0 million to $23.0 million. Mobile value-added services (MVAS) revenues were $15.9 million, down 17.0% from the year-ago quarter.However, Weibo value-added services helped the rest of the non-advertising revenues to increase by a staggering 180.0% from the year-ago quarter to $11.1 million.Gross margin expanded 60 basis points (\"bps\") from the year-ago quarter to 49.4% due to higher revenue base and favorable product mix. Advertising gross margin expanded 40 bps while non-advertising gross margin surged 650 bps in the quarter.Operating expenses as percentage of revenues declined 470 bps from the year-ago quarter to 61.4%. The improvement was primarily driven by lower sales & marketing expense (down 940 bps), partially offset by an increase in product development expense (80 bps) and a sharp rise in general & administrative (400 bps) expense.Operating loss was $19.2 million, much better than a loss of $27.4 million in the year-ago quarter. The improvement was primarily due to higher gross margin base and lower operating expenses. Net loss also improved from $17.8 million reported in the year-ago quarter to $3.7 million.SINA exited the first quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $681.9 million compared with $713.6 million at the end of the fourth quarter. Cash outflow from operating activities in the quarter was $5.9 million.SINA expects revenues to be between $143.0 million and $147.0 million for the second quarter of 2013. Advertising revenues are expected in the range of $117.0 million to $119.0 million, while non-advertising revenues are projected in the range of $26.0 million to $28.0 million.We believe that SINA remains a premier company based on its strong product pipeline, continuous investments in product development and marketing and a robust user base for its e-commerce and Weibo offerings. Moreover, the company expects to strengthen its Weibo value-added services on the back of continued growth in mobile Internet in China.In this regard, the recent partnership with Alibaba Group is expected to boost SINA's position in the Chinese e-commerce market going forward.However, results continued to disappoint primarily due to higher product development costs related to Weibo.We believe that any weakness in advertising revenues will impact SINA's ability to counter increasing operating expenses, which in turn will hurt its bottom line going forward.Moreover, increasing competition from  ,  ,  and Tencent will hurt profitability over the long term. Further, we believe that increasing regulations imposed by the Chinese government will remain the primary concern for the stock going forward.Currently, SINA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he following companies are expected to report earnings after hours on 05/15/2013.

More users mean more recurring revenue. And it means new and supplemental revisions of the game introduced and sold over several years.It's what decides success and failure for game companies, says Michael Cai, vice president of research for Interpret LLC, a research firm.\"It's definitely a pretty hit-driven industry,\" he said. \"If (gamers) play your game for a long time, sometimes for years, you can continue to monetize them.\"As serious as the business may be, a game is still a game. Video games are recreation, and tap into basic desires to have fun, says Brian Blau, an analyst for Gartner, a research firm.\"When you look at the reason why the industry does well, (it's because) games have been part of the human psyche forever,\" he said. \"People love to play video games.\"Over the past four weeks, the 19 publicly traded stocks in the computer software game group made the largest advance among the  . The industry is home to thousands of independent game developers churning out new product. From an investor's point of view, only eight of the biggest game-maker stocks trade over 10 a share. They tend to compete in different segments of the market.Activision Blizzard (  ) andElectronic Arts (  ) built their success on console and PC-based games, and are moving into the emerging mobile games market.Chang-you.com (  ) andNetEase (  ) are leaders in China's market for massively multiplayer online games (MMOG) and massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG). Zynga (  ) is the world's leading provider of social-network-based games.Global spending on electronic games will reach $112.1 billion by 2015, up from $70.1 billion in 2009, says Gartner. The growth includes consumer spending on gaming hardware, software and online games as well as investments by game developers in their products.Consumers in the U.S., United Kingdom, France, Australia, South Korea and Japan spent $21.5 billion on games and related hardware last year, says Interpret.And don't make the mistake of thinking it's all about kids. Children ages 6 through 12 accounted for only $1.5 billion of the spending.Activision, best known for its World of Warcraft game, grew revenue by 26% in Q4 after posting 12% growth in the prior quarter.Changyou also grew revenue by 26% and 29%, respectively, in its last two quarters while the much larger NetEase increased revenues more slowly, by 9% and 4%, over the same period.NetEase is the exclusive dealer of WOW games in China. But its own games also appeal to consumers, says Tian Hou, an analyst for T.H. Capital, in a Feb. 7 report.\"NetEase has constructed a robust pipeline of diversified content that meets gamers' interests,\" she wrote.Some game makers, and  , are not faring as well.Electronic Arts saw revenue declines in its last two quarters. Zynga reported that year-over-year revenue growth stalled in its fourth quarter. Zynga's number of users are up from a year ago, but daily and monthly active users and overall visitors declined quarter-over-quarter.Analysts say one reason for the decline is the slowing user growth on Facebook, the world's leading social media site. Zynga grew out of Facebook's meteoric rise.Zynga's games are mostly free to users. Game players who want a more advanced experience pay. But most don't, says Cai.\"You can only convince a small percentage of your players to pay, and in Zynga's case that is typically 1% or less,\" he said.Wireless is fast becoming an important part of the games landscape.By 2016, the number of consumers playing video games on mobile phones and tablets in the U.S. will reach 174 million, up from 61.5 million in 2010, says eMarketer, a research firm.Mobile has opened the door to the rise of so-called \"freemium\" games, which consumers can play for free and decide later if they want to pay to add more advanced features. Many freemium games are supported by ads in or around the games.Non-console PC games dominate in China. Game developers there also face stiff government scrutiny before selling any new games. Sales could spike with a government reversal of its ban on game console sales, says Lewis Ward, an analyst for IDC, a research firm.\"That could possibly change the dynamic for that market,\" he said.Zynga is looking at online gambling to change its fortunes. On Feb. 22, Nevada became the first U.S. state to legalize online poker, followed by New Jersey on Feb. 26. Zynga hosts one of the world's largest communities of poker players on the Web.

Tablet shipments jumped even higher, up 78% to 128 million worldwide vs. 2011, says IDC.Game developers have taken notice, says Gartner's Blau.\"All of the big game developers are looking at mobile and will continue to,\" he said.But consoles remain the largest piece of the business.Sony (SNE),Nintendo (NTDOY) andMicrosoft (MSFT) will deliver new game consoles later this year. Sony hasn't yet revealed pricing or other details about its upcoming PlayStation 4, says Brian Pitz, an analyst for Jefferies Group, in a Feb. 21 report.\"Sony will likely withhold this information until it learns more about Microsoft's launch strategy,\" he said.With about 60% of game revenue coming from games that play on consoles, evolving console technology is pivotal, says Blau.\"This is the time of year when the games industry is going to find out what is going to happen for the rest of the year,\" he said.The market appears poised for continued growth as more developers enter the market. Faster Internet speeds and the fast growth of mobile devices will also help push the games market.\u0095  Growth of smartphones and tablets provides a rising platform to reach more consumers, says Interpret's Cai.\"The sheer number of people who have smartphones and tablets is several times larger than the installed base of three consoles combined,\" he said.Mobile has also opened the door to freemium games, says IDC's Ward.\"If you have those devices, you already have the gaming platform and you can access games and pay if you want to,\" he said.Mobile is also bringing games to new markets: Brazil, India, Russia and China, Ward says.\"The rising standard of living in the BRIC region means that many more people who didn't have access to games five years ago now have the financial capability of investing in games,\" he said.\u0095  Companies counting on console games as big revenue drivers could be in trouble, says IDC's Ward.\"If you are invested in console games, you are running a significant risk if the customers you are anticipating end up migrating over to tablets and smartphones and free PC games,\" he said.Mobile devices can also provide a tougher landscape for game makers, says Gartner's Blau.\"There is a lot more content available on smart devices and PCs so there are other distractions other than games,\" he said.Hit games are also necessary for continued interest and revenue from gamers, says Interpret's Cai.\"The risk is always there; you just have to continue to make hits,\" he said.Changyou gets 80% of its game revenue from its longtime game, \"Tian Long Ba Bu.\"But in a Feb. 6 report, T.H.

The Chinese online media, search and mobile service provider announced that it has not approached any investment bank and private equity fund to take the company private.Sohu also denied rumors about delisting its common stock from the NASDAQ Global Select Market. The statement from Sohu was in response to a report from South China Morning Post, which claimed that the company is in talks with investment banks about financing for a potential private transaction. South China Morning Post cited four industry sources as the base of its report.Following the news, Sohu's share price jumped approximately 12.0% to close at $48.84 on Mar 5, 2013. However, post the 8K filing on Mar 6, Sohu's share price declined approximately 11.0%. Over the past 12 months, Sohu has underperformed the broader market as its share price declined 9.2% versus a 12.6% growth in S&P 500.The underperformance is due to investors' skepticism on Sohu's ability to remain profitable in the near term. Although Sohu reported a better-than-expected fourth quarter of 2012 beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both lines, margins contracted sharply primarily due to higher operating costs.Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were 47.3% compared with 40.1% in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher product development costs (up 51.5% year over year) and sales & marketing expenses (surged 49.9% from the year-ago quarter). Operating margin declined to 21.5% from 30.9% in the year-ago quarter.Sohu is a relatively small player in the online Chinese advertising market and continuing investments in product development are necessary to expand market share. This is expected to hurt its profitability in the near term.Moreover, we believe that market share gain will be difficult in the near term. Sohu faces stiff competition from  in search and advertising,  in online video and  in online gaming markets.In such a scenario, we believe that the private buyout rumor creates uncertainty for investors. Although a better buyout offer will be positive for investors, we believe that current sluggish macro-economic conditions in China will act as an impediment toward fetching a higher price.We also believe that Sohu's strong product pipeline and the growing popularity of Changyou's games will drive profitability going forward.Currently, Sohu has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he following companies are expected to report earnings after hours on 08/15/2012.

It's still a good idea to have your stocks on short leashes though. Featured stocks:  and  . Click below to watch the video!---Robin Carpenter has been analyzing the movements of the stock market since the 1970s, when he founded The Stock Market Laboratory to provide technical analysis to portfolio managers. Robin is also a pioneer of modern market analysis, having originated many statistical models such as moving beta, cross-sectional skew and dispersion, and developed investing strategies based on alpha hedging and market timing.For more than two decades, Robin has run Carpenter Analytical Services in Hanover, New Hampshire, which provides statistical and analytical services to investment professionals. He joined the Cabot team in September 2011 with the launch of  . Today, Robin's taken the time to chat with me about his interest in market analysis, the state of the current market and a little about exchange-traded funds.Matt: How and when did you first become interested in market analysis? When I was in high school, I was given a book, written by Joseph Granville, with the somewhat clumsy title \"A Strategy of  Timing for Maximum Profit.\" I read that book (and a few others) several times. And so I began collecting market data and testing ideas. Unlike today, market data had to be compiled literally by hand, and calculations were mostly by slide rule and recorded on paper.Doing all that by hand would seem unbearably tedious today, but back then it was just the way it was done. And by the way, it's not a bad way to start. There's something about actually crunching numbers the hard way--recording, computing, comparing, adjusting--that helps to internalize relationships. It's slow, and it's cumbersome, but it gets things inside your head in a way that slick software and instant computing doesn't do so well. The first exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were substitutes for broad index mutual funds, with the added benefit of low fees and intra-day liquidity. They're still that, but now there are specialized ETFs that focus on sectors, industries, commodities and alternative asset classes. It was this \"slicing and dicing\" that attracted me, not for investment at first, but as proxies for the indexes they track. They provide a fast, easy and cheap way to follow the ebbs and flows of the markets. If you want to measure how micro-cap stocks are doing, or value stocks, or maybe silver, or the U.S. dollar or other currencies, there's an ETF (or several) tracking it. They give a quick, reliable read on what's up, with updates available throughout the day. And it's almost free.A huge amount of market differentiation--what's strong and what's weak--is accounted for by sectors, industries or asset classes. If Utilities are strong, they're all strong. (Well, almost all.) If regional banks are weak, they're usually all weak. And it's just a lot easier (for me, anyway) to assess prospects by type of business than to search for specific strengths or weaknesses in hundreds of individual companies.Robin: I learned of a sector selection model that has a solid record of outperforming the market, and that is based on quantitatively objective economic analyses. I did a thorough review of its selection performance--right down to daily fluctuations--and am persuaded that it's valid and successful in identifying sectors that usually outperform the S&P 500, and with less volatility.I realized that if the selection model were combined with good market timing, it could be the basis of a unique service. I had met Tim Lutts, president of Cabot, a few years earlier, and I remembered he said his subscribers have a high interest in ETFs. I knew Cabot had a timing model that is also quantitative and objective. So I met with Tim and we back-tested the selection and timing in combination. The tests were successful, so we designed  to meet that need. The selection model is really pretty complicated. Unlike most sector models, we can't say XYZ sector is Favored because of on particular factor, say, interest rates. Or because of inventories or employment data. In effect, the model generates a whole profile of economic factors and looks to see what sectors have excelled in the past when conditions were \"like that.\" As I mentioned, there's now a really full range of ETF types available. We still have the very broad index ETFs (like SPY tracking the S&P, or IWM tracking the Russell 2000). We have sectors (like the SPDR sector ETFs we use), and we have individual industries (like GDX for gold miners or IYT for transportation). The very broad indexes wouldn't give us a basis for differentiation. The narrow industries might work OK over time, but the narrower the target, the higher the chance idiosyncratic surprises will occur. So the SPDR sectors balance those issues, giving sector specificity for differentiation, while each sector includes a limited range of industries that provides partial diversification within the genre.Also, the SPDR sector ETFs are very liquid, so we always know we can get in or get out when a change is called for. Well, I don't know that there's a \"type of person,\" but there is a \"type of objective.\" Investors who find it easier to understand the economic dynamics of a whole class of securities like a sector or industry--and wish to gain or shed exposure to that class--are natural ETF users. Alternatively, an investor seeking broad exposure but who wants to manage the weightings (rather than just buy the SPDR S&P 500 (  ) with its weightings) can do it with ETFs. (And there are even individual ETFs that offer S&P sectors in proportions different from the S&P weights.) We are now in a downtrend as defined by the Cabot Tides indicator. In a downtrend, most stocks go down, and almost all sectors go down. As a result, the  is holding cash. That's how the System works. So right now we're preserving buying power for the next Buy signal. When that signal comes, most ETFs will move higher with the averages. We hope and expect that the Cabot Favored ETF sectors will be stronger than average. But the market is a constant kaleidoscope and we'll have to peer closely at that when the time comes.Matt: Thanks for taking the time to talk with me.

Being the Amazon (NASDAQ:  ), Facebook (NASDAQ:  ) or Match.com of China, the world's largest Internet market, was not enough for some Chinese web names to draw favor among U.S. investors.Actually, yesterday was a fine day for Chinese Internet stocks. While some of those names are succumbing to profit taking on Tuesday, there is no denying Chinese Internet stocks, broadly speaking, have been surging in recent weeks. So have two niche  devoted to these stocks.Often assailed for being too small, too narrowly focused or too thinly traded, the Guggenheim China Technology ETF (NYSE:  ) and the Global X NASDAQ China Technology ETF (NASDAQ:  ) have been on fire in recent weeks. CQQQ, the larger of the two ETFs with $19.7 million in assets under management, was higher by 10.3 percent over the past month heading into the start of trading Tuesday. The Global X NASDAQ China Technology ETF, which has just $3 million in AUM, jumped 12.4 percent over the same time.CQQQ is home to 39 stocks and its lineup is a mixed of U.S.-traded and Hong Kong-listed names. NetEase (NASDAQ:  ), Sina (NASDAQ:  ) and Baidu are the largest U.S.-listed stocks in CQQQ's lineup, combing for 21 percent of the ETF's weight. Tencent Holdings is the fund's largest holding with an allocation of almost 9.2 percent.That trio of U.S.-listed Chinese Internet names are boosting CQQQ's fortunes. Over the past month, Baidu is the WORST performer of the three with a gain of 4.3 percent (prior to Tuesday).Sina has surged more than 21 percent in the past month and that has turned out to be good news for QQQC, the Global X offering, because that stock is the ETF's largest holding at a weight of 8.75 percent. QQQC is home to 27 stocks and Sina, Tencent and Baidu combine for about 23 percent of the ETF's weight.The fund's are not mirror images of each other. For example, QQQC features a 3.82 percent weight to Foxconn, the controversial assembler of some Apple (NASDAQ:  ) products,  . The Guggenheim ETF does not feature Foxconn in its lineup.On the other hand, Sohu.com (NASDAQ:  ), Giant Interactive (NYSE:  ) and Renren (NYSE:  ) combine for 7.6 percent of CQQQ's weight. The Global X fund does not include Giant Interactive or Renren among its holdings. Neither ETF holds shares of online game maker Perfect World (NASDAQ:  ) and that is too bad because the stock has surged 28 percent in the past month.Interestingly, neither ETF holds Ctrip.com (NASDAQ:  ), the Priceline.com (NASDAQ:  ) and one of the older U.S.-listed Chinese Internet stocks. Again, that is too bad because Ctrip has gained more than 10 percent in the past month.On valuation, CQQQ is less expensive with a P/E of 12.5 and a price-to-book ratio of 1.8,  . QQQC has a P/E of 16.15, but a lower price-to-book ratio.Cost-conscious investors can settle the debate by preferring the Guggenheim offering due to the fact that its current premium to its net asset value is just 12 cents compared to a premium of over $1 for QQQC.For more on ETFs, click  .(c) 2013 Benzinga.com.

Some will eventually go on to be big market leaders -- especially newer companies still in the early stages of growth.It wasn't that long ago when my screens were teeming with China-based growth stocks under accumulation. It's a much different story now as names as Internet names like Netease.com (Nasdaq:  ), Sohu.com (Nasdaq:  ), Perfect World (  ) and Changyou.com (Nasdaq:  ) continue to face selling pressure. But China-based Qihoo (prononounced \"chi-hu\") 360 Technology (Nasdaq:  ) continues to trade well as fund managers continue to embrace its growth story. The stock has the look of an emerging leader.The China-based firm, with a market capitalization of $2.9 billion is very liquid with an average daily volume of 1.7 million shares. It's a provider of Internet and mobile security products in China. It went public in March 2011 at $14.50 a share and closed at $34 on its first day of trading.The company has all the qualities I like to see in stock: Big earnings and sales growth in recent quarters, bright growth prospects and high return on equity. Recent price and volume trends point toward a stock under accumulation by institutional investors.Last month, Qihoo reported strong third-quarter results, with profit up 25 percent from a year ago to $0.20 a share. Sales rose 77 percent to $84 million. The company gets most of its revenue from internet advertising (70 percent) and value-added software, including video games (26 percent). In August, Qihoo launched its own Internet search engine which, according to some estimates, has already gained eight to 10 percent of the search market in China. CEO Zhou Hongyi is gunning for a 15 percent to 20 percent share.It's not surprising to see institutional investors continue to dump Baidu (Nasdaq:  ) and gravitate toward Qihoo. It makes sense, actually, because Qihoo is still in its nascent stages of growth.Qihoo is expected to grow annual earnings by 45 percent this year compared to 2011, and 46 percent in 2013. Remember that earnings growth and institutional buying are the main drivers of a stock's price and Qihoo has both. The stock is quickly approaching its recent high of $25.50, bringing the possibility of a technical breakout into play. Still, after five straight weekly price gains, I wouldn't be surprised to see a low-volume pullback to shake out the last remaining sellers in the stock. This would also be constructive price action. If it happens, it could pave the way for a powerful, heavy-volume breakout over $25.50.Stock chart:The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" reported non-GAAP EPS of 66 cents in the fourth quarter of 2012, which decreased 47.8% year over year and 14.1% sequentially due to higher expenses and margin contractions. EPS including stock-based compensation came at 60 cents, which comfortably surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 cents.Total revenue jumped 21.7% year over year and 4.9% sequentially to $299.5 million, ahead of management's guided range of $288.0-$293.0 million. Revenues also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $293.0 million. The increase was primarily driven by strong search business and online gaming revenues.Total online advertising revenue increased 19.9% year over year and 6.7% sequentially to $120.8 million. This strong growth in advertising revenues was driven by 68.4% year-over-year growth in Search and Others revenue, which reached $38.7 million. Search revenues increased 9.7% on a sequential basis.The strong year-over-year growth in search was primarily attributable to higher contribution from pay-per-click services. Online marketing services on the Sogou Web Directory also contributed significantly, driven by higher traffic and improved monetization. In the last quarter, Sogou revenues jumped 78% year over year and 10% quarter over quarter to $41.0 million.Brand advertising revenue grew 5.6% from the year-ago quarter to $82.1 million and was in line with the higher end of management's guided range of $80.0 million to $82.1 million. Revenues increased 5.4% sequentially. Brand advertising continued to benefit from strong performance of the auto, online video and real estate sectors.Total number of clients grew 18% sequentially as the company's coverage expanded to include non-FMCG clients in the reported quarter. Brand advertising revenue growth also benefited from higher marketing spending among non-Japanese auto makers, which fully offset cautious spending from Japanese car makers in the quarter.Sohu video continued to maintain its dominating position, driven by content portfolio that includes American television drama series, domestic variety shows and in-house developed programs. Video views for American television channel jumped 136.0% sequentially in the fourth quarter.Online games (operated by Changyou.com) revenue surged 29.0% year over year and 5.2% sequentially to $158.9 million, well ahead of management's expectation of $152.0 million-$155.0 million. Online gaming revenues grew on the back of expanding user base and improved monetization.Aggregate registered accounts for Changyou's games jumped 41.0% from the year-ago quarter and 11.0% sequentially to 248.1 million. Average revenue per user (ARPU) soared 60.0% year over year and 11.0% sequentially to RMB353, driven by higher spending from Tian Long Ba Bu's (\"TLBB\") advanced level players in the reported quarter.Wireless revenues decreased 12.6% year over year and 11.7% quarter over quarter to $12.6 million, due to new operator policies to reduce consumer complaints. Others revenue decreased 7.4% year over year but increased 5.1% sequentially to $7.2 million in the reported quarter.Gross margin contracted 220 basis points (\"bps\") from the year-ago quarter to 68.8%. The year-over-year contraction was primarily due to significant decline in online advertising gross margin, which was 52.4% compared with 59.1% in the year-ago quarter. On a sequential basis gross margin expanded 270 bps.Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues was 47.3% compared with 40.1% in the year-ago quarter. On a sequential basis, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue surged 350 bps in the quarter.The sharp rise in operating expense was primarily due to higher product development cost, which jumped 51.5% year over year and 11.6% from the previous quarter to $52.4 million. Sales & marketing expenses surged 49.9% from the year-ago quarter and increased 18.2% sequentially to $68.8 million.The higher-than-expected increase in operating costs had a negative impact on the quarterly profits.

Net margin contracted 190 bps on a sequential basis.Sohu exited the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $833.5 million compared with $773.5 million in the previous quarter. Long-term debt was $126.4 million at the end of the quarter.For the first quarter of 2013, Sohu expects total revenue in the range of $290.0-$299.0 million.

Sohu expects to release four expansion packs for TLBB in 2013. Sohu also plans to launch at least 3 new massively multiplayer games and a number of new web games.We believe that Sohu's results will continue to be negatively impacted by increasing product development costs in the near term. Sohu is a relatively small player in the online advertising market and continuing investments in product development are necessary to expand market share.However, we believe that market share gain will be difficult in the near term. Sohu faces stiff competition from  in search and advertising,  in online video and  in online gaming markets.Moreover, Sohu's first-quarter guidance reflects sluggish top-line growth on a sequential basis, which further compels us to remain on the sidelines.Currently, Sohu has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" reported second-quarter loss of 26 cents per share (including stock-based compensation), much wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 1 cent per share.Revenues jumped 20.4% year over year to $152.8 millionand were much better than management's guided range of $143.0 million to $147.0 million. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $150.0 million.The year-over-year growth in revenues was primarily driven by higher advertising as well as non-advertising revenues. Advertising revenues in the quarter moved up 16.9% from the year-ago quarter to $120.6 million. Advertising revenues were slightly ahead of the high end of management's guided range of $117.0 million to $119.0 million.Non-advertising revenues increased 35.4% year over year to $32.2 million in the quarter, ahead of management's guided range of $26.0 million to $28.0 million. Mobile value-added services (MVAS) revenues were $19.9 million, up 12.7% from the year-ago quarter.However, Weibo value-added services helped the rest of the non-advertising revenues which increased by a staggering 186.0% from the year-ago quarter to $7.7 million.Gross margin increased 70 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 52.1% due to higher revenue base and increase in gross margin of the non-advertising business. Advertising gross margin remained flat while the non-advertising gross margin expanded 400 bps in the quarter.Operating expenses as percentage of revenues increased to 67.1% from 55.0% in the year-ago quarter. The sharp rise was primarily driven by higher General & Administrative expense (up 130.1%) and higher Product development cost (up 57.8%).Operating loss was $27.6 million, wider than a loss of $9.2 million in the year-ago quarter. The decline was primarily due to higher operating expenses, which surpassed the growth in revenues. Net loss improved from $19.9 million or 30 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter to $17.4 million or 26 cents in reported quarter.SINA exited the second quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.24 billion compared with $681.9 million at the end of the first quarter. Cash provided by operating activities for the second quarter of 2013 was $43.6 million against a cash outflow from operating activities in the previous quarter of $5.9 million.SINA expects revenues for the third quarter of 2013 to be in the range of $176.0 million-$180.0 million. Advertising revenues are expected in the range of $151.0 million-$153.0 million, while non-advertising revenues are projected in the range of $25.0 million-$27.0 million.We believe that SINA remains a premier company based on its strong product pipeline, continuous investments in product development and marketing and a robust user base for its e-commerce and Weibo offerings. Moreover, the Weibo value-added services have started witnessing substantial growth in revenues.In this regard, the recent partnership with Alibaba Group is expected to boost SINA's position in the Chinese e-commerce market. SINA has already permitted Alibaba to increase its ownership in Weibo to 30% on a fully diluted basis.However, results continued to disappoint primarily due to higher general & administrative expense, personnel costs and product development costs related to Weibo.We believe that any weakness in advertising revenues will impact SINA's ability to counter increasing operating expenses, which in turn will hurt its bottom line, going forward.Moreover, increasing competition from  ,  ,  and Tencent will hurt profitability over the long term.

However, revenues fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $143.0 million.The year-over-year growth in total revenue was primarily driven by higher advertising revenue in the quarter, up 6.7% year over year to $110.7 million, and was slightly ahead of the low end of management's guided range of $110.0 million to $112.0 million. Weibo display advertising contributed 19.0% or $21.3 million of total advertising revenues. Moreover, advertising from telecommunications, IT services and FMCG sector further contributed to the growth in advertising revenues.Non-advertising revenue decreased 4.8% year over year to $23.8 million in the quarter, slightly ahead of the mid-point of management's guided range of $22.0 million to $24.0 million. Mobile-value-added-services (MVAS) revenues were $13.2 million, down 38.0% from the year-ago quarter.

The last Chinese company to do so and the only one year-to-date was flash sales website Vipshop Holdings (  ), which priced its downsized IPO in March and fell over -30% in its first few weeks of trading. It has since recovered strongly to post aftermarket gains (+52%) and is currently 34% above its offer price.After a long wave of accounting scandals from newly US-listed Chinese firms and subsequent outburst of Chinese-related securities litigation, IPOs from China dried up as investors questioned the overall transparency and earnings quality of these companies. This is evidenced by the declining number of US-listed IPOs from China over the last three years (41 in 2010, 12 in 2011, 1 YTD). Most recently, China Auto Rental (CARH), the largest car rental company in China, looked to list in April but postponed and subsequently withdrew its offering amid likely valuation pushback from investors.Currently, only 2 of the 13 Chinese IPOs to list in the US since the beginning of 2011 are trading above their offer prices and the average return is -37%, with more than half down over 50%.

But analysts expect investors have turned their eyes away from earnings to focus on European developments with hope of uncovering the fate of the global economy.\u201cU.S. options traders see almost no chance that earnings, dividends or buybacks will influence stock prices through the end of 2011, instead placing record bets that equities move in lockstep in reaction to Europe\u2019s debt crisis.\u201d(via) The recent debt and leadership fiascos in Italy and Greece have done nothing to improve sentiment in the markets.Record high correlation among stocks indexes is certainly a driving factor. This Wednesday saw the CBOE\u2019s KCJ index (which measures the degree of correlation for S&P 500 stocks) close at record levels, above 91.

Royden WardSuccess Has Many Fathers Failure Is An OrphanStock Market VideoIn Case You Missed It---More than 70 years have passed since Benjamin Graham first outlined the concept of value investing in the 1934 book  . Warren Buffett is one of many investors who've proven the value of Graham's system, and still today it's one of the surest ways to find undervalued stocks in the marketplace.  , which takes its inspiration from Graham, works on an adapted system developed by editor J. Royden Ward--who was taught by one of Graham's own students.This week, we're chatting with Roy about why he chose value investing, his personal outlook on the market right now and how the global economy has affected the value investing philosophy.Matt Delman : What initially attracted you to value investing? Several factors channeled me toward value investing. First and foremost, I received a great education at Babson College as a finance and investment major. Luckily, my professor for several of my investment courses was Dr. Wilson Payne, who focused tirelessly on teaching how to evaluate companies using fundamental analysis.Fundamental analysis consists of learning how to differentiate strong balance sheets and financial data from weak data that could lead to investment disasters. In addition, past income statements from companies were examined and formulas were applied to determine the intrinsic value of each company.Professor Payne's teachings were based on his interaction with Benjamin Graham, his friend and former professor. Mr. Graham wrote  and  , which were the primary texts we studied.During my early career after Babson, I was introduced to various growth and momentum systems and analyses, but I could not be distracted from my in-depth knowledge gained earlier.--- What do you like most about this system?Roy: The system that I have developed during the past four decades provides my subscribers with maximum buy prices and minimum sell prices. The system is simple: buy at my buy price, wait patiently, and then sell at the recommended sell price!In addition, I generate numbers and ratings, which evaluate a company's quality, value, growth and stock price momentum. Recently, within the past five years, I developed a rather good system to estimate annual and quarterly sales and earnings, too.The most important factor for my subscribers is knowing that my evaluations are derived from sound principles and can be relied on no matter what is happening in the stock market. What's your current outlook on the market? As a value investor, I focus on finding undervalued companies that ideally will perform well in any stock market environment. Therefore, I avoid trying to \"time the market.\" Investing when the market is going up and divesting when the market is declining is difficult at best. I rely on my undervalue/overvalue indicators to tell me to invest aggressively when the stock market is undervalued or to invest defensively when the stock market is overvalued.In my opinion, stocks are selling at normal levels. Therefore, the stock market could advance from current levels or it could decline. How has turmoil in the global economy affected the stocks you pick? Several years ago I began recommending gold stocks and gold ETFs to offset the uncertainty in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. The decision turned out to be a fortuitous call in 2011, but lately the turmoil has subsided just a bit and gold prices have dropped. Gold prices might be over-reacting here, but the outcome depends on unforeseen and unpredictable future events. If you could pick one stock to hold forever, which one would it be? That's a really tough question, because I am a firm believer in portfolio diversification. If you are an aggressive investor,  is my choice. The company is selling at a reasonable price, pays a decent dividend, and is the most innovative company on the planet. Buy Apple and hold forever.For conservative investors,  is the best. What I particularly like is WMT's ability to attract new customers when the economy is sagging. Low prices and a huge selection of goods, including groceries and gas, will continue to be a winning combination. Are you happy with the performance of value stocks this past year? I am delighted with my performance during the past year. My two model portfolios have increased an average of 12.7% while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index has advanced only 6.5%. The out-performance clearly indicates that when you invest in low risk, high quality companies, you will beat the market indexes most of the time. Thank you very much for talking with us, Roy! Here's this week's Contrary Opinion Button. Remember, you can always view all of the buttons by Who said it first is unknown. But it's widely accepted, because it's true. I don't think you can use it to be a better investor, but when people claim to have bought a big winner way back when it was cheap, you can remember that they've conveniently forgotten to mention their losers.---In this week's Stock Market Video,  Editor Paul Goodwin talks about the interesting week in the markets, including down days on significant volume in the S&P.

Stocks discussed:  . Click below to watch the video!---The May 10 trading loss of more than $2 billion by  has sparked a bevy of news reports. With good reason too-it's a massive loss from a bank that many have seen as a \"safe haven\" for the past few years. JPMorgan came out of the 2008 financial crisis with a surplus of money, and to now see something like this happen is making a lot of people wonder just how much bankers have really changed.In doing some background reading on the trading loss, I found a fascinating explanation-on American Public Media's  website-of what exactly happened with the trader known as the London Whale and how that $2 billion (or more) could've been lost.To sum up, the trader was using derivatives to bet that certain investment-grade bonds would never, ever default. This was used as a \"hedge\" against losses, but back-fired in spectacular fashion because of a combination of factors. The first of those being the trader's supreme overconfidence in how smart he was, and the second being that rival traders bought up credit-default swaps that were then leveraged against him. The end result of this is that when the corporate bonds were marked down, the London Whale had painted himself into a corner and couldn't cover his losses.And this is how JPMorgan, a company known for its apparently good risk management, showed that they really weren't that good at it after all. It has also added new scrutiny to the banking sector, which has already been battling increased regulation since the 2008 financial crisis. Predictably, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said this was a simple mistake and the company will learn from it and move on. He didn't say they'd never use derivatives as a hedge again \u2026 just that they'd learn from this mistake.The loss resulted in an $18 billion drop in JPMorgan's market cap during the trading day on May 11, and earlier this week a quick search revealed four law firms filing securities class-action lawsuits against JPMorgan. The U.S. Department of Justice is also investigating the trading loss.But all that is just background to my real argument today: It's not a good idea to invest in the banking sector right now.This is true for several reasons, not least of which is that it's difficult at best to figure out how some of these banks make a profit. Back when I worked for Nasdaq, I routinely processed corporate earnings statements that public companies filed as part of their Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure requirements.Banks had the most inscrutable earnings statements by far. At least with a pharmaceutical company, you could tell that their biggest expense was R&D and they made money when drugs were approved. With banks, I found it near impossible to tell where and how they made any sort of income.This whole debacle with JPMorgan just underscores that same inscrutable nature of bank profits. If you can't figure out how a company makes its money, then you probably shouldn't invest in it. Mostly because if you don't know how profits are made, then you never know when that money is suddenly going to disappear.The second, and perhaps more salient point for the current market, is that bank stocks are in a decline. Prior to the crash in 2008, bank stocks enjoyed a massive run due to deregulation and a host of other benefits given in the last years of the 1990s. Since that crash, however, investors have tended to stay away from large, multinational banks\u2026with good reason.JPMorgan lost $18 billion of its market cap overnight because of that trading loss. Investors who didn't sell once trading opened on May 11 could've lost a few thousand dollars depending on their position size. And this loss completely ignores the fact that other big banks, such as  and  are in a persistent downtrend.For investors interested in growth and seeing their stocks go up quickly, it's almost a no-brainer to leave banking stocks behind. Bank of America hasn't traded above 10 in more than a year, and CitiGroup has declined 36% in roughly the same timeframe. For a look at the broader market, the  has been range-bound around 15 for the past two years (this is after it was at 37 at the height of the financial bubble).I'll leave you with one final, redeeming comment for the banking sector. Not  banks are like the big names such as JPMorgan, Bank of America or CitiGroup. There are well-run banks at the regional or state level operated by good people who don't attempt the sorts of financial trickery of the big names. And to find those small, undervalued banks, I'd direct you to  for some of Roy Ward's recommendations from ---Here's this week's Contrary Opinion Button.

The Google of China, if you will.But wait, isn't Facebook blocked in China? Why yes, yes it is, but apparently this minor roadblock can be avoided: The brainchild of Facebook and Baidu will not be integrated with the rest of the facebook's global access.This has to do with China's extraordinary internet regulations, the same \"that defeated other Western internet giants like Google, Yahoo, eBay, Amazon and Twitter.\"In that respect, one of the appeals to partnering with Baidu is that the company \"has one of the best relationships with the government in terms of how they deal with media censorship,\" according to T.R. Harrington, founder and CEO of Darwin Marketing.It's possible this bond could give Facebook the helping hand that other failed business ventures lacked.And sure, the appeal of China is understandable, Facebook has over 750 million users on the  and it's already growing in other asian markets.

The first bullish pattern was the combined buying of stock along with the December 29 puts for $1.35, suggesting that investors want to own the shares with an insurance policy in case they correct lower.

The stock more than doubled last year, then drifted lower after September and lost more than one-third of its value by May.Since then, however, the shares found support at the key $30 where they consolidated before ripping higher in 2009 and are now up 13 percent in the last month. Some chart watchers may consider the price action as evidence that NTES remains in a long-term uptrend.The company's last earnings report on May 19 came in below forecasts, but investors now seem to be pricing in better times, potentially on hopes that Chinese authorities will approve a key upgrade to \"World of Warcraft\" in coming weeks.The second bullish trade to cross the Heat Seeker was the purchase of 1,500 August 34 calls for $2.10 against open interest of 781 contracts.

This is a good time to revisit a few of the big names. Traders had already baked in extremely good earnings for Macao casino operator Melco Crown Enterprises (  ,  ) by the time that company reported its fourth quarter numbers last week. Now that the post-earnings depression has kicked in, it is worth taking a look. Revenue doubled and EBITDA was up something like 4,800% in the fourth quarter. And analysts have been behind the curve, so keep watching for upgrades - especially now that the stock is 5% cheaper than it was a month ago. For a perhaps less sophisticated Chinese gaming experience, Netease (  ,  ) is focusing its online game development efforts squarely at the Chinese market. In addition to gaming, Netease has an advertising component which pushed over a 25% gain for the quarter. The online advertising segment is competing on some levels with search portals  and  . The company is exposed to massive growth opportunities -- and gross margins were a whopping 71% last year -- but the stock is still only trading at 15 times 2011 expected earnings.

China's first-quarter GDP grew at an 11.9% annual pace despite three significant increases to reserve requirements that were designed to cool lending and growth. That's why in much of 2009 and early 2010 I was bullish on China and overweighted my global portfolios in favor of this country. Some favorite picks of mine included  (  ),  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) among others.But all good things must come to an end and right now it's time to get selective about which China stocks you buy. That's why I recommend investors cut back their China holdings and look for new opportunities in emerging markets.To be clear, there is no \"China bubble.\" I still actually recommend some Chinese stocks in my paid newsletters - including  (  ) and Chinese agriculture companies  (  ) and  (  ). But the B word is one of the most terrifying things Wall Street can hear, and the word has followed China's every move of late. As a result, Chinese stocks have become quite volatile and the market has become much more selective. That means your portfolio should get selective on China stocks, too.Again, I'm not bearish on the country, but there is reason to be cautious in this region and there's no need to take on the risk of having a portfolio overweighted in China when there are so many other countries that are delivering solid profit opportunities. Here are a few up and coming emerging markets to watch:The first non-U.S. country I'm targeting for market-beating gains in the year ahead is Israel. With a strong \"currency tailwind\" from a strong shekel and favorable exchange rates, Israel's economy is doing well. Additionally, this nation is formally moving from emerging to established status for institutional investors, we're at the beginning of what should be a fantastic growth run for Israel.My top Israel stock right now is  (  ). This communications stock is one of Israel's largest Internet service providers. IGLD provides Internet access to more than 960,000 home subscribers and about 90,000 business customers through its Smile.com subsidiary. The company's other services include virtual private networking and Web hosting. Its Smile.Media subsidiary manages Internet portals and e-commerce services, while its Internet Gold International branch handles these activities outside of Israel. The stock is up more than 35% year to date, and his been a member of my  newsletter since January.Another booming emerging market is Latin America. In years past, investors have largely cashed in on natural resource plays or utilities, but this market is opening up as a booming middle class increases spending and more Western businesses reach out to the region. Consider that Brazil auto sales hit an all-time high in 2009 even as U.S. auto sales were collapsing.  (  ) alone saw 2009 Brazil sales jump 11.35% from the previous year to 3.14 million units -- a third straight annual record.Global blue chip stocks like Ford are always a good way to play emerging markets, but if you really want to roll up your sleeves and get into Brazil I recommend  (  ). Translated to \"the American Beverage Company,\" and commonly known simply as AmBev, this stock company dominates the Brazilian beer market with brands such as Antarctica, Brahma and Skol. Additionally, the company sells Pepsi brands, Lipton iced tea and other beverages that include mineral water and sports drinks. Along with Brazil, AmBev sells its products in some 13 other countries, including the South and Central American countries of Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, Uruguay and Venezuela.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photo Some reports out there are promoting what we have been saying: that growth is strong out there and that it is playing into names across the consumer sector. By this point, a solid fourth quarter already seems to be already priced into shares of Macao casino operator Melco Crown Enterprises (  ,  ). EBITDA is up 30% in the fourth quarter and while analysts are still behind the curve, the stock has also jumped 30% since we first alerted you to it at the end of February. For a perhaps less sophisticated Chinese gaming experience, Netease (  ,  ) is focusing its online game development efforts squarely at the Chinese market.

But for some of the bigger blue chip names in the industry he holds out hope for 2012.Why? Because according to David Garrity of GVA Research, \u201crelatively low variability in performance is going to be the theme that pays for investors in technology this year.\u201dSpecifically, Macke and Garrity discuss future prospects for the old but reliable tech companies Intel () and Microsoft (). \u201cWhile they do have an attractive dividend yield now, the odds are better than 50/50 that they\u2019ll be able to raise that dividend over the course of the year,\u201d Garrity predicts.Blue chips are partially identified by their ability to operate profitably in bull and bear markets. And although they are not known for fast growth, Macke says \u201cif you don\u2019t find yield and growth a financially sexy combination you probably shouldn\u2019t be running your own portfolio.\u201dSo we\u2019re wondering, which blue chip tech companies are worth a closer look?For ideas, we collected data on profit projections, and identified a list of the largest tech stocks that have seen an increase in their profit outlook for the next fiscal year.In addition, all of these stock prices have failed to adjust to the rise in earnings estimates, signaling that a potential mis-pricing may have occurred.Is the market underestimating these tech giants that have seen a rise in their profit outlooks?List sorted by market cap.(, , , ): Provides wireline and mobile telecommunications services in the People\u2019s Republic of China.
