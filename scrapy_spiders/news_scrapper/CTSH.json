Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 22 million job losses. \"There were whispers that the number could come in much worse,\" said Darrell Cronk, chief investment officer at Wells Fargo Wealth & Investment Management in New York.\"The fact they didn't come in higher is a bit of a relief rally.

(Symbol: CTSH) saw new options become available today, for the July 10th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CTSH options chain for the new July 10th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $53.50 strike price has a current bid of $1.90.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $53.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $51.60 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CTSH, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $54.11/share today.\n\nBecause the $53.50 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.55% return on the cash commitment, or 30.15% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., and highlighting in green where the $53.50 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $54.50 strike price has a current bid of $1.90.  If an investor was to purchase shares of CTSH stock at the current price level of $54.11/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $54.50.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.23% if the stock gets called away at the July 10th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CTSH shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing CTSH's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $54.50 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $54.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 49%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.51% boost of extra return to the investor, or 29.81% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 46%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 47%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $54.11) to be 46%.

These are questions that require further investor research.  \n\n\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["y Anirban SenTop technology services firms are offering payment deferrals, discounts of up to 20% and other sweeteners to some U.S. banks to keep their business as the pandemic forces Wall Street to cut tech budgets, according to executives involved in the talks.Large Wall Street banks are widely expected to reduce overall budgets and discretionary tech spending, which includes areas such as technology consulting services, business analytics, research and design and process management projects.Accenture , Tata Consultancy Services , Infosys  and Cognizant Technology Solutions  - among the world's largest tech services vendors - have offered to do more for them at lower rates, three executives who have taken part in the discussions told Reuters.The aim is to secure new contracts as well as to keep the relationships with the banks ticking over so that they can be expanded once more post-pandemic, they added.At least half a dozen meetings have taken place over the past month between the tech companies and some of the largest U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co , Bank of America  and Citigroup , said the executives who all requested anonymity as the discussions were confidential.\"The current crisis facing the IT industry is potentially bigger than the 2008 recession. We have no option but to use every tactic necessary, including heavy discounts, to gain a competitive edge,\" said one.Major IT outsourcing contracts, which include software maintenance, cloud computing and analytics, are worth several hundreds of millions of dollars and typically stretch over many years.As well as some discounts and payment deferrals of typically between one to four months, the tech companies are in some cases offering to buy up computer data centers from their clients and the existing systems and hardware that are being replaced or upgraded at banks, the executives said.Accenture said it was working with banking clients to address the implications of the crisis but did not comment on pricing talks. Cognizant and Infosys also declined to comment on its talks with clients, while Tata Consultancy did not respond to a request for comment.JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citigroup declined to comment on their discussions with vendors.The negotiations are ongoing and no agreements have been struck yet as many leading banks have delayed finalizing their tech budgets due to the uncertainty caused by the coronavirus crisis, according to the sources.The proposals reflect a wider trend, about half a dozen of tech industry insiders told Reuters, with discounts of varying size and investment commitments featuring in many discussions between vendors and their financial industry customers.Research and advisory firm Gartner estimates the banking and financial services industry's spending globally on IT and information security will fall 5.6% in 2020 to $502 billion.India's IT outsourcing sector, which includes the likes of Tata Consultancy and Infosys, is likely to be particularly hard hit. It has grown into a nearly $200 billion a year industry over the past two decades, offering technology services to corporate heavyweights across the world.Developing and maintaining the plumbing of the world's financial services industry accounts for 40% of its revenues, with Wall Street banks among its biggest customers.The top 10 U.S. banks collectively spend roughly $70 billion on technology annually, according to public statements and executives.Cognizant, IBM, and Infosys have all withdrawn their 2020 forecasts in recent weeks, citing concerns about pricing and budget cuts at their major clients. Accenture cut its full-year guidance in March, while Wipro withdrew its revenue forecast for the current quarter.\"We've seen some delays in ... discretionary spending and select requests for furloughs, rate concessions and extended payment terms from our clients,\" Cognizant CEO Brian Humphries said in an  this month.IBM and Wipro declined to comment on any pricing talks with clients. But IBM said its broad client base provided a measure of stability in terms of recurring revenues and profit in \"these challenging times\".Banks are not, however, slashing tech spending as heavily as sectors such as travel, hospitality and retail. Many are also investing in technology that helps staff work from home.For instance, Standard Chartered , which typically spends about $1 billion a year on technology, is preparing cuts in many areas, but also plans to invest in remote working tech, and wants to dedicate some of the money saved on travel to that, group chief information officer Michael Gorriz told Reuters.\"What has happened with COVID-19 is that these plans have been rapidly accelerated,\" he said.For technology companies looking to keep customers on-side and weather the storm, there are limits, though.While vendors have little choice but to offer discounts to remain competitive, they are unlikely to go as far as to accept losses, said Ray Wang, founder of Silicon Valley technology research and advisory firm Constellation Research.\"The discounting for client business will intensify as the number of contracts drop overall in the market,\" said Wang, but he added: \"I don't think they will hurt their own margins for growth right now. Profitability is very important.\"(Reporting by Anirban Sen in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Imani Moise, Elizabeth Dilts and Munsif Vengattil; Editing by Lauren Tara LaCapra, Tomasz Janowski and Pravin Char)((; (within U.S. +1 646 223 8780; outside U.S. +91 80 6182 3583);))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at , on 5/19/20, Assured Guaranty Ltd (Symbol: AGO), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.

[Operator Instructions]And I will now turn the conference over to Katie Royce, Global Head of Investor Relations at Cognizant. Please go ahead. -- Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. By now you should have received a copy of the earnings release and investor supplement for the company's first quarter 2020 results. If you have not, copies are available on our website cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Brian Humphries, Chief Executive Officer and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer.Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Brian Humphries. Please go ahead, Brian. -- Thank you, Katie, and good afternoon, everybody. Today we have several topics to discuss with you as a follow-on to our April 9 business update. These include a review of our first quarter 2020 results, an update on COVID-19 and discussion on the Maze ransomware attack and an update on the strength of our balance sheet and liquidity and how we will react to the new demand environment.Let's start with first quarter results. Revenue grew 3.5% year-over-year in constant currency to $4.2 billion. This includes the 50 basis points impact from the exit of certain content services business. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.96, up 5% year-over-year. Karen will bring you through the details of the quarter. While today's call had a full agenda given COVID-19 and ransomware updates, I do want to start with some perspective on the commercial transformation program that we have been executing over the past year. I'm pleased to state that we've been making solid progress against this initiative. And I want to illustrate this progress with some data that we do not normally share.On a trailing 12-month basis, our win rate is up hundreds of basis points. First quarter total contracts awarded grew 30% plus year-over-year with broad-based strength across all service lines, industries and geographies. This represents our best quarterly performance since 2017. Qualified pipeline growth was strong in Q1 and especially robust in larger deals where we had solid double-digit qualified pipeline growth versus the prior year period. This momentum speaks to how well clients have embraced our strategy and have responded to our renewed sense of client centricity. It also speaks to how our teams have embraced our focus on growth. Notwithstanding a quarterly earnings backdrop that includes COVID-19 and ransomware, I do not want us to lose sight of these leading indicators that reflect Cognizant's growing competitiveness.Turning now to COVID-19, which as you know, is having a severe humanitarian and economic impact on society across the world. As we navigate this pandemic, our top priority remains the health and safety of our own associates, while maintaining continuity of service for our clients. Our perspective is that COVID-19 is affecting the IT services industry on two dimensions; fulfillment and demand.Let's start with fulfillment. After a strong start to the first quarter, our revenue slowed meaningfully in March, reflecting the fulfillment challenges are shifting rapidly to a work from home environment across our delivery centers. These challenges include people, IT, security and client considerations. Thanks to the professionalism and diligence of our associates and the execution of our crisis management and business continuity plans, we were able to ensure continuity of service for the vast majority of our clients in March and early April.As a testament to this, I have received numerous notes from clients recognizing the work of our teams. While this was a gargantuan task and there were some speed bumps along the way, I want to acknowledge our teams around the world who went the extra mile in testing circumstances to make this happen. And we'll return to fulfillment efforts in a moment when I cover the ransomware attack and our internal IT systems, and in particular, its impact on our work from home enablement.The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on demand is more multi-dimensional. While we are in a period of great uncertainty, as a company, we expect the economics and human impact will be felt by companies across the globe. While certain industries will be hit hardest, all industries will suffer. Smaller businesses those with weak balance sheets and liquidity will be particularly impacted. The demand impact will be felt throughout 2020. And when a recovery materializes, certain markets such as the U.S. will rebound quicker.As indicated on our April 9 update, we've seen some delays and cancellations of projects and discretionary spending and select to request for furloughs, rate concessions and extended payment terms from our clients. While our outlook for 2020 has been meaningfully altered, we are nevertheless confident that we will weather this storm given our business mix. For example, since more than 60% of our business is in Financial Services and Healthcare, we are less exposed to some of the hardest hit industries, including travel, hospitality, retail and automotive.International markets, which tend to rebound more slowly represent just 25% of our business. And we are primarily exposed to global 2000 clients, which we believe will be more resilient than smaller companies. We also have great confidence in the strength of our balance sheet and liquidity. While we will be prudent in this uncertain economic backdrop, this confidence allows us nonetheless to invest in M&A to accelerate our strategy and bolster our capabilities, more on that later.More broadly, the pandemic shockwaves have spurred clients to accelerate their digital transformations. Clients are looking for ways to modernize their business, accelerate innovation, become more elastic and agile in the face of business uncertainty and generally reimagining their businesses for the new normal. More major IT trends such as core modernization, data modernization and cloud adoption will accelerate. These secular trends play to our refined strategy and make it more relevant than ever. In short, while 2020 will be a challenging year given COVID-19, we are confident that our industry, geographic and customer segment mix, our balance sheet, our momentum in our digital imperatives and our growing competitiveness will allow us to compete well on a relative basis regardless of the macro environment.Let's turn now to the Maze ransomware attack, which we announced in April. We responded immediately by mobilizing our entire leadership team, drawing on the expertise of our IT and security teams and bringing in leading cybersecurity experts to help us investigate and respond to the attack. We also contacted appropriate law enforcement agencies. From the start, we decided to communicate forthrightly and transparently with our clients.In addition to hundreds of individual client calls conducted by our security organization, cybersecurity experts and our executive team, we held two client conference calls in April. Retaining client trust is of paramount importance, so we erred on the side of over communicating the details of what we knew and how we were working to contain and mitigate this incident. We proactively provided clients with indicators of compromise or so-called IOCs, namely forensic data a company can use to identify potentially malicious activity and defend against attacks from external actors.Earlier this week, in our third conference call with clients, we confirmed the containment of the ransomware attack. While we are pleased to have reached this important milestone, the ransomware attack will nevertheless negatively impact our Q2 results for two reasons. First, the attack encrypted some of our internal systems, effectively defaming them and we proactively took other systems offline. This disruption included both select system supporting our work from home enablements such as BDI and the provisioning of laptops that had been expected to further increase our work from home capabilities in April. Second, in the wake of the ransomware attack, some clients opted to suspend our access to their networks. Billing was therefore impacted for a period of time, yet the cost of staffing these projects remained on our books.With the ransomware attack now contained, we've restored BDI and automated laptop provisioning. Further, we've previously ordered equipment now physically in India and distribution constraints less restrictive as per the latest state directives. We are now substantially work from home-enabled. In addition, following the containment of the ransomware attack, we have meaningfully progressed in addressing the concerns of clients that has suspended our access to their networks. We expect to substantially complete this by the end of the month.We expect the vast majority of revenue and margin impact from ransomware attack to be in the second quarter. However, ongoing remediation cost will institute through subsequent quarters. We will disclose this financial impact to you on a quarterly basis to ensure appropriate visibility. Ransomware attacks are becoming all too frequent across industries. We are using this experience as an opportunity to refresh and strengthen our approach to security. We're already applying what we've learned to further harden and strengthen our security environments. And we are further leveraging our external security experts to help inform and guide our long-term security strategy. Cybersecurity will continue to be a top priority for us in the years ahead.As you recall, during our COVID-19 business update on April 9, we withdrew guidance for 2020. Before I pass the call to Karen, I want to draw your attention to the fact that we entered the year with cost assumptions built to support revenue growth acceleration. These assumptions no longer hold true in light of fact that nobody can predict how long the current macro environment will persist.So we are faced with a great deal of uncertainty on many levels, including our own cost structure. Having come through a challenging 2019 when promotions and salary increases were delayed, as a leadership team, we have decided to take a nuanced approach to 2020. We aim to invest in the business by protecting and developing digital skills, continuing to build out our commercial team and continuing to correct the employee pyramid by onboarding approximately 20,000 entry-level hires.Meanwhile, we aim to significantly decrease other costs, including corporate overhead, travel, marketing, relocations and non-commercial lateral hires. Services companies habitually really rely on so-called bench policies to rightsize their associate base, to reflect market demand. Against today's COVID-19 backdrop, we feel that traditional industry bench policies do not adequately address the interests of impacted employees. Consequently, any employees impacted by demand supply imbalances may benefit from extended medical coverage and exit packages through the end of the third quarter.Karen will now take you through the details of the quarter and provide updates on our balance sheet, liquidity and cost initiatives. After that, I'll return to provide some closing remarks, before we take Q&A. -- Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. First quarter revenue of $4.2 billion grew 2.8% year-over-year or 3.5% in constant currency including a negative 50 basis point impact from the exit of certain content-related services. We saw strong momentum across the business in January and February with the initial impact of COVID particularly on the fulfillment side starting to impact the business in the middle of March.During the first quarter, we also took a fresh look at our definition of digital revenue and have better aligned it to our digital imperatives. Substantive changes to the definition include the addition of certain platform solutions and the removal of certain content services work. Based on this new definition, digital revenue as a percentage of total revenue was approximately 41% for the first quarter and grew by approximately 19% year-over-year.Moving to the industry verticals where all of the growth rates provided will be year-over-year in constant currency. Financial Services growth of 1.8% was driven by banking, including strong performance in Europe attributable to the Samlink deal and regional banks in North America. Weakness persisted across global accounts, particularly in capital markets and insurance.Moving on to Healthcare, which grew 2.7%. Performance was led by strong double-digit growth in life sciences in Europe. Within our Healthcare vertical, revenue declined low-single-digits as the headwinds in North America we highlighted in 2019 continue to impact the business in Q1. However, contract signings in Healthcare were a meaningful contributor to the overall strength in bookings that Brian mentioned in his comments.Products and Resources growth of 5.3% was driven by manufacturing, logistics and retail and consumer goods and partially offset by softness in travel and hospitality. Roughly 60% of this segment represents revenue within the travel and hospitality and retail and consumer goods industries, which have experienced the earliest impact of COVID-19 given restrictions in travel and lack of foot traffic within retailers.Communications, Media and Technology grew 6.3% led by strength in Communications and Media clients in North America where momentum from late in 2019 continued driven by an increase in demand for services in core modernization and cloud transformation services. However, we expect this vertical to see a meaningful deceleration this year, particularly with the entertainment clients exposed to studios, cable TV and theme parks. Although technology continue to outpace total company performance, growth decelerated due to a negative impact of $23 million from our decision to exit certain portions of our content services business. This impacted our CMT segment growth by approximately 390 basis points.Moving on to margin. In Q1, our GAAP operating margin and diluted EPS were 13.7% and $0.67 respectively. Adjusted operating margin, which excludes restructuring and COVID-related charges was 15.1%. And our adjusted diluted EPS was $0.96. COVID-related charges were $6 million in the quarter, which included $5 million of the expected $25 million total related to the previously announced one-time salary adjustment in April that we gave to certain employees in India and the Philippines.Our GAAP margin improved year-over-year given the India defined contribution accrual in Q1 of 2019. However, our adjusted operating margin, which excludes this impact in the prior year period was down 90 basis points year-over-year as investments in sales hiring, higher incentive-based compensation as well as an approximately $30 million to $35 million COVID-related revenue impact in March resulting from fulfillment challenges caused by the rapid shift of our employee base to safely work from home. These increased costs were offset by savings from items such as lower T&E and the favorable movement in the rupee [Phonetic].During the quarter, we continue to execute against the 2020 Fit For Growth Plan, which is designed to improve our cost structure and fund investments aligned with our long-term growth strategy. In Q1, we incurred $35 million of charges as part of this plan. Based on the actions taken since the program inception, we have achieved over $250 million in annualized run rate savings.Additionally, as part of the Fit For Growth Plan, we continued the exit of a subset of our content services business, accounting for $11 million of the $35 million of charges in the quarter. We continue to expect the ramp down of this work to occur over the next several quarters with the majority of the work expected to be ramped down exiting 2020. In total, our estimated revenue impact of $225 million to $255 million on an annualized basis is unchanged. In Q2, we expect the negative year-over-year impact to revenue of approximately $50 million. As a reminder, the content services business is within the Communications, Media and Technology segment.Now I would like to spend some time talking about how we are managing the business in light of an uncertain revenue trajectory and increased cost related to COVID and the ransomware incident. Entering 2020, we had certain demand and revenue assumptions to which we aligned our cost structure. The new reality of the demand environment and the anticipated cost associated with COVID-19 and remediating the ransomware attack requires us to make further adjustments.Since the trajectory of recovery in demand remains uncertain, we must be prepared for various scenarios over the coming quarters and manage costs accordingly. As a leadership team, we have spent the last several weeks discussing those scenarios and implementing action plans. In the near-term, there will be other COVID-related costs, which we will continue to identify separately, including the remaining $20 million of the $25 million related to the one-time salary adjustments in April for certain employees in India and the Philippines, cost to establish work from home environments for employees.Additionally, part of planning as a leadership team is to contemplate the future workplace environment and be prepared to return our employees safely to this new reality. It is likely that there will be incremental costs in the near-term as we prepare to exit the lockdown periods. These costs could include not only equipping certain employees to work from home on a more permanent basis, but also retrofitting existing facilities to accommodate a lower density ratio amid new social distancing norms and other business continuity-related costs.As we think about mitigation efforts, our near-term focus is on first addressing variable costs. We are a people-based business. And employee-related costs, including compensation and benefits plus subcontractors, make up over 80% of our total cost structure. We are ratcheting down variable costs, both people and non-people-related costs through actions such as reduced T&E, relocation, recruiting and integration-related costs, reduced spend on events and marketing, prudently managing our subcontractor mix, deferring certain annual wage increases and promotion cycle. We are freezing lateral hiring across all functions. However, we will continue to move forward with our sales hiring plan and other key positions and honor all outstanding accepted offers.Deferring the timing of our training start date in India to Q3 from Q2. However, this will continue to be dependent on lockdowns and school schedules across India. Tightly managing utilization is another way that we look more closely aligned with a lower revenue trajectory. As you might imagine, we have seen a significant decline in voluntary attrition in recent weeks. This, when compounded by a reduction in demand, will naturally lead to utilization levels lower than what we believe is necessary to support the business in the near-term.In this scenario, we will accelerate the further development of employees with skills aligned to our key digital imperatives, which we expect will align with client demand when an economic recovery emerges. At the same time, we are aware that there are likely to be employees who are or will become unutilized for whom we do not foresee those opportunities. As always, we are committed to treating these employees with fairness and dignity, which in the current environment, will also include providing extended health and other financial benefits to ease their transition.Accordingly, between now and the end of the third quarter, we expect to incur additional realignment charges associated with these enhanced benefits. And we now expect net headcount to decline in 2020 versus 2019. The size and timing of these charges will unfold as the demand environment becomes clear. It is also critical in this environment to continue to execute our Fit For Growth Plan, which thus far has not experienced any material delays from COVID. We still expect the majority of the actions to be complete by the middle of this year. And result in gross savings of over $450 million in 2020 and annualized gross run rate savings of $500 million to $550 million in 2021. We continue to expect charges to be in the $150 million to $200 million range.Now turning to the balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investments balance as of March 31 stood at $4.3 billion, up approximately $860 million from December 31. This balance now excludes the approximately $400 million of restricted deposits related to our tax dispute in India, which has been reclassified as long-term investments on our balance sheet.We've further strengthened our financial flexibility by drawing down $1.74 billion on our revolving credit facility on March 23, 2020. This brought our outstanding debt balance to $2.5 billion. Additionally, we have paused our share repurchase activity and our focus will be on targeted M&A and preserving liquidity. Overall, we feel that our balance sheet is very healthy and provides us the flexibility needed in the current environment to run the business, while continuing to invest. We generated $385 million of free cash flow in the quarter. DSO of 74 days improved two days year-over-year, reflecting improved collections from several large accounts.On a year-over-year basis, free cash flow also benefited from lower incentive-based compensation, which is paid out in the first quarter. In addition, restructuring charges resulted in approximately $50 million cash outflow in the quarter, although this was mostly offset by one-time items as the result of certain favorable contract renegotiations. We do anticipate an increase in DSO for the remainder of 2020 as we have granted certain clients in significantly impacted industries extended payment terms for a short defined period. As we have seen in prior downturns, standing by our clients in times of trouble serves as well in protecting the overall partnership. At the same time, we are also reviewing our own vendor relationship and will continue to pursue opportunities to drive both cost and cash flow efficiencies.As we discussed during our business update call on April 9, given the limited visibility in our markets, we do not feel it is appropriate to offer either Q2 or full year 2020 guidance. While we are not able to predict with any certainty the length of disruption or depth of the economic impacts from COVID-19, we are operating the business with the following assumptions.First, that the demand environment remains highly volatile and uncertain in the near-term. We expect client focus in the near-term to be on critical systems and infrastructure to enable their core operations. Discretionary projects are those without a quick payback, we expect will be delayed. We see this significantly challenging the second quarter, but also the remainder of the year. We are currently planning for a slow transition back to normalcy and expect year-over-year challenges to continue, at least through Q1 2021. We expect that demand will be most impacted in travel, hospitality, retail, automotive, energy and media and entertainment, which are collectively just over 20% of total revenue, but we do also anticipate a broad slowdown across our other industries.As Brian mentioned, the ransomware attack in April negatively impacted our work from home enablement schedule. As a result of this ransomware attack, our Q2 revenue and margins will both be negatively impacted. While we anticipate that the revenue impact related to this issue will be largely resolved by the middle of the quarter, we do anticipate the revenue and corresponding margin impact to be in the range of $50 million to $70 million for the quarter.Additionally, we expect to incur certain legal, consulting and other costs associated with the investigation, service restoration and remediation of the breach. While we have restored the majority of our services and we are moving quickly to complete the investigation, it is likely the costs related to the ransomware attack will continue to negatively impact our financial results beyond Q2.While we have already begun taking actions to address costs across the company, there is a lag on the timing of any savings from these actions. Therefore, we expect adjusted margins to decline sequentially and remain below the 16% to 17% range provided in our February guidance, which we have since withdrawn on a full year basis. We anticipate that our Q2 adjusted operating margin will be the lowest quarter of the year given the combined impact of COVID-19 and the ransomware attack.So to wrap up, while COVID-19 and the ransomware attack will negatively impact our 2020 financial performance, we are very pleased with the progress we are making, not just with the cost alignment part of our Fit For Growth program, but also the continued progress we have made with hiring new sales resources and the traction we have seen in win rates and first quarter total contract signings. We look forward to providing you with further updates as the year progresses.With that, I will turn the call back over to Brian to further discuss our recovery plan in a post-COVID world. -- Thank you, Karen. Let me wrap up by saying that Cognizant is built on financial strength and flexibility, unwavering client centricity that has earned us the enduring trust of clients and 290,000 talented associates who once again proved our great selflessness and determination in recent weeks. While 2020 will be a challenging year given COVID-19, we are confident that our industry, geographic and customer segment mix and our balance sheet, our momentum in the digital imperatives and our growing competitiveness will enable us to compete well on a relative basis regardless of the macro environment.The post-COVID world will create new norms and hasting trends to highly mobile virtual and personal world. We won't just be talking about teleworking, but rather remote everything from digital workflow, to design, to e-commerce, e-banking, education and telemedicine. Against this backdrop, our strategy to win in the digital battlegrounds of AI and analytics, digital engineering, cloud and IoT become more relevant than ever.We will continue to use M&A to accelerate the execution of our strategy. On Tuesday, we announced an agreement to acquire Collaborative Solutions, one of the world's largest Workday consultancies. With its rich expertise and leading position in the Workday ecosystem, Collaborative Solutions will expand our opportunity in cloud by establishing new practice in this large fast growing market.The acquisition brings key skills to Cognizant and differentiates us in the market, especially against Indian pure-play competitors. The acquisition also complements the capabilities we've been building out in our salesforce practice. We've come through a lot so far this year. Through this, we've always sustained our focus from our client centricity and our determination to execute our strategy.Our increased commercial momentum in the first quarter affirms that our strategy, our solution portfolio and our renewed vigor is resonating well with clients. While the COVID-19 and the recent ransomware attack has been a setback, I am confident that Cognizant will emerge strongly from these challenges. No one knows how long the pandemic will last, only that eventually will fade. Certainly the business world will be quite different from what it is today. I've been here long enough in Cognizant to know that we will rise and surmount this challenge and come out the other side stronger. We'll keep our cultures strong through this period. The spirit of teamwork and collaboration on the vast scale that I've seen from our associates during the crisis are I believe the direct result of our company's deep-seated and shared sense of purpose. Come what may, it's in our DNA to help our clients succeed.And with that, operator, we can open the call for questions.Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question is coming from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question. -- Hi, good afternoon, guys, and good to hear your voices. Brian, thanks for the visibility on some of those sales metrics in the first quarter, you highlight the 30% increase in total contracts awarded. You've made a number of changes to Cognizant's go-to market model since you joined Cognizant. Can you highlight what changes have been making this difference or driving this early traction you're seeing? How far along are you on this journey? And are there particular service lines or project types where you're seeing particular traction at this point? Thank you. -- Yeah. Hi, Lisa. So look, we made a significant amount of changes from a go-to-market point of view in the last year, but really kicked it in Q1 of this year because a lot of work was needed before we could actually determine how to best deploy this. And that included a different sales compensation model, which shifted more compensation to variable comp away from fixed compensation. It included a resegmentation of clients into a RAD model, which is a sophisticated methodology to deploy resources against accounts that you are currently in where you're trying to farm versus hunt new logos. It also required us to build out extensive new relationships with partners who need to become very much part of our ecosystem. And on top of that, of course, we have been in the process of hiring 500 revenue-generating resources and/or supporting resources, which could include commercial pricers, lawyers, etc. And we're about 60% through that. But let's not overlook the fact as well. Just the notion of getting the company back focused on growth, focused on client centricity and getting the rigor back into the company to tap into something that fundamentally is in our core DNA is very, very important.We've been doing that for a period of time now. We've also made some leadership changes. We've really tried to hone in on client centricity in the leadership team, starting with myself. And that's what I believe has led to the significant momentum we've had in the first quarter. And I would say even for some of our larger industries like insurance, banking, healthcare that momentum has actually continued into the month of April, albeit not at the really robust strength that we saw in the first quarter. But the 33% growth in the first quarter is our strongest bookings since 2017. It was actually very broad-based across all industry segments, across North America, as well as our international markets, which we term global growth markets.And then from a service line point of view, our digital business was up in excess of 50% and digital operations and our third service line systems and technology also had robust growth. And I really feel good by the way about our digital offerings. We have really strong capabilities now in cloud. You've seen us build out those capabilities with a series of acquisitions in the last year, three Salesforce platinum partners. And more recently this week, Collaborative Solutions, which is the establishment of a Workday practice in Cognizant. Salesforce and the Workday tend to go hand in glove in clients that have embraced cloud and we feel that a strong alignment behind companies that are growing 20%, 30% year-over-year is obviously very important for Cognizant's growth rate into the future as well.So I feel very, very good about our commercial momentum of the progress we're making. Now of course then we're hit with COVID-19, which fundamentally changed the growth trajectory in the month of March. But we're going to deal with that. And as I said on the call, we are -- from my perspective as well positioned as anybody to deal with it given our business mix, and we'll come out stronger on the other side.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. -- Hi. Thank you. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on the ransomware attack? Sort of when did it first appear? Was the take down of the credit line related to that? And what sort of -- you talked about great awards in Q1, has this slowed down that favorable TCV momentum? Thanks. -- Hey Ed, it's Brian. So the ransomware attack hit us prior to the work from home enablements. We saw what was happening. And as we were trying to slow it down, we were faced with therefore a ransomware attack. And we had three calls with clients too in the month of April and then one last week where we acknowledged containment. The credit line or the line of credits drawdown has nothing to do with this. This simply gives us optionality. We already have a very strong balance sheet, as you know, strong collections as currently indicated in the quarter. So frankly, it's nothing to do with ransomware.The TCV growth in Q1 was independent of ransomware. I don't believe ransomware had any meaningful impact on our business momentum. Certainly, we had an impact in the month of -- latter part of April and early May as the ransomware attach had effectively disabled some of our internal systems that have been encrypted, which impacted some of our work from home enablements and indeed certain clients had opted just ahead of an abundance of caution to isolate themselves from our network. But given we have contained the virus by working night and day candidly internally as well as working with leading cybersecurity partners, including mandates and of course the federal authorities. We are now in a better position and clients on a daily basis are again freeing us up. So I think that will be felt from a revenue and margin point of view for the most part. The vast majority will be felt in Q2. Thereafter, I imagine we're well be half of that.That said, we will continue to spend money in Q3, Q4 and beyond to further strengthen our security framework. So revenue and margin impact is more in Q2. Cost impact will continue a little bit through the rest of the year. But Ed, I think we handled the ransomware attack as well as one can in these circumstances. We chose to be very deliberately client-centric by having three clients conference calls, by doing hundreds of client calls with the executive team and our security team and indeed mandates in the days throughout this period by being as forthright and transparent as we possibly could. And nobody wants to be dealt with a ransomware attack. I personally don't believe anybody is truly impervious to it, but the difference is how you manage it and we try to manage it professionally and maturely.Our next question is from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. -- Good afternoon. Thank you. I hope you're all doing well. I wanted to ask on client behavior. Really just, what you're seeing over the last two weeks versus the spending appetite in early and mid-April. Any semblance of stabilization in any verticals yet? And can you just comment on the types of programs that are moving forward? -- Hey, Bryan. I don't think there's any stabilization per se. Budgets, from my perspective were being revised downwards throughout all industries. Certainly, some industries will be hit more than others. I think digital remains a priority. Virtual work, virtual healthcare, education, banking, e-commerce, you name it, remains of course top of mind for people in today's environment. The shift to SaaS continues. Digital engineering continues by definition to fuel some of those capabilities. But I would say projects with short-term paybacks continue, but anything that is deemed discretionary is being delayed.We have seen some requests for furloughs, rate concessions, etc, but not a meaningful amount. And I would say, in the same vein, we are still seeing some pretty substantial opportunities out there including captive opportunities. And as I referenced in my prepared remarks, pipeline shape on a qualified basis actually in that reasonably healthy as we exited Q1 and even now after the month of March. So we are being very opportunistic here. We are making sure we fine-tune our offerings to take advantage of the new norm that we're in today. We have work streams lined up behind that. And of course we continue to push our digital imperatives, which are from my perspective, firmly and squarely into the area of the market where growth will continue, if not accelerate into the foreseeable future, and that includes data modernization and cloud applications, generally including SaaS and indeed core modernization. So we feel well positioned. But it is a particularly difficult environment to call at this moment in time. There's not a lot of visibility. And clients are I think obviously being cautious.The next question is from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question. -- Hey, thanks so much. I have a follow-up and then a question. Just a follow-up to Lisa's question, just on the sales signing success. Are you seeing an uptick in sole-sourced deals given your investments in sales? Obviously the win share is up against the bigger pipeline, but it sounds like maybe the sole-sourced piece could be up, just curious on that? And then just -- it sounds like, Brian, your M&A appetite is still there. Should we expect a pause given everything going on or are you still pretty active with the M&A? Thank you. -- I don't think we see a lot of sole-sourced per se. But I will say, we have seen some renewals where we've had the opportunity to renew without those contracts being up for bid or tender. And that's been on the basis of very strong deliveries and strong client satisfaction and frankly a very strong executive engagement which has been quite intentional over the last year. But as ever, clients are always looking to extract value for money. And of course, they also want to sleep well at night. So they want to work with partners who honor their commitments and deliver well.I'm feeling good generally however about our momentum in the field and our competitive positioning. Our win rates are improving, as I said. Our contract bookings speak for themselves. If it was one vertical or one service line, I wouldn't quite be so adamant about this, but I genuinely feel is that we've made tremendous progress in the last year.From an M&A perspective, I'm fortunate to be blessed by a board who are very supportive of the projects we're undergoing. And we have a clearly defined strategy. The M&A transactions that we have made in the last year have been against a defined strategy that was blessed by the board last September. We will continue to obviously monitor collections and monitor our liquidity, as well as our balance sheet, but we feel very comfortable in our current position. And I will say, we will continue to conduct M&A transactions, albeit in a prudent manner. We want to conduct transactions that solely fits and are squarely aligned to our strategy and then we have confidence that we have the right leadership team in place to integrate them successfully.The next question is from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO. Please proceed with your question. -- Hi. Thank you very much. And Brian, congratulations on a good March. It seems pretty clear in the absence of COVID that Cognizant was on a very good path for 2020. My question is, I want to dig a little bit, at least around some context associated with margins over the next couple of quarters and what the puts and takes are. You mentioned that Cognizant is on a journey to invest including the sales reps that you mentioned. Karen listed a number of things that were incremental, sounds like incremental cost savings. And I just wondered, it's the way to think about the dollar amount of incremental cost savings associated with those new areas since the advent of COVID, just so if we can at least try to think about where the margins might be?And Karen, Part B of that is, as you think about the malware situation, will those costs or remediation -- will those be non-GAAP out? In other words, were those be GAAP charges, but it would be taken out of the non-GAAP results? And that's it. I mean, just any other comments, Brian on how we should be thinking about margins for the next two quarters in particular? -- So Keith, I'll kick it off and then maybe Karen can jump in if it's OK, Karen. We're obviously not in the same location today. Keith, thank you first of all. I do feel that we did have momentum that was building as we exited Q4, January and February were particularly strong. I felt tentatively we were well on track to have a very strong quarter relative to Wall Street expectations. And then of course March arrived with COVID.As Karen will attest, the change in dynamics was relatively abrupt, obviously because, first and foremost, because of fulfillment where in countries like India we had four hours. We had obviously triggered a business continuity plan weeks ahead. But the ultimate decision to lockdown India came with a four hour notice. So we, like many services companies I imagine, were scrambling to fulfill work from home capabilities via encrypted desktops or laptops or remote VDI, etc.So that hurt us from a fulfillment point of view. And as such, you have cost, but as the revenue. Similarly, that compounded itself in the first few weeks of -- the first week of May and the last few weeks of April when yet again not only were we dealing with COVID, but then we had a ransomware attack that encrypted servers, which actually took out some of the work from home capabilities that we had enabled in the prior weeks. And also slowed our ability to enable further work from home because of some of the systems and tools we would have used to automate and provision laptops, we're no longer functioning.So we had a perfect storm in which we still had costs without revenue. And on top of that, when you have clients who disconnect you from their network for a period of time until such time as you contain the malware, yet again, you want to keep those skill sets ready to reengage as soon as the clients permit you to reengage.So I think what you will find in Q2, we had the perfect storm of cost without revenue. And of course, then you have to adjust to reflect the demand-supply balance. And that is ultimately I think what will hurt our margins in the foreseeable future. And then as Karen will tell you, of course, we want to protect skills like digital skills, and of course, therefore, we want to take out any so-called no regrets costs to try to mitigate that. But Karen will give you a little bit more details. -- Thanks, Brian, and thanks, Keith. In terms of the ransomware question you asked, we will not be adjusting that out of our non-GAAP. So those costs will stay both in our GAAP and our non-GAAP margins as they continue through the rest of the year. We will, however, as we've done in the past with other similarly large unusual transactions, try to call those out on a quarterly basis if they're meaningful for the investors. We'll see what that cost looks like.And as Brian said, on the margin side, obviously there are a number of things that happened very quickly and where we can move to take cost or cost gets eliminated or doesn't happen such as T&E and so forth, which like others, we started to see the benefits of in late March, obviously because people aren't physically at work at client sites, they're not relocating and we don't have to worry about immigration and other things. People are moving around the country and so forth.And then as we mentioned in my prepared remarks, while we will continue to honor all of the outstanding offers that have been accepted, we have for the most part shut down much of our hiring. And so recruiting costs obviously go away along with that. But I think, as we've talked about, in this business obviously, when there is a revenue slowdown, it depends what the cause of that revenue is, to what happens to your resources and your utilization rates.As Brian talked about, with things that we think are short-term such as we had with the fulfillment challenges with COVID, late March, early April and then more recently with the ransomware, clearly we want to hold on to those resources so that they can continue to deliver services to clients as that we're comes back up and we certainly want to make sure, through this time that we protect our digital skills and use this opportunity to continue to enhance and develop digital skills across the company, but certainly it is not unlikely that utilization will hit levels below where we think they should be to run the business for the foreseeable future. And then, obviously, we'll have to make some adjustments and modify the headcount accordingly for the organization.As we said, we don't expect to be in the margin range that we had previously guided to back in February. We do think margins will be below the 16% to 17% range for the year and for each of the quarters throughout the year and we would expect the Q2 because of the issues with ransomware will be the lowest quarter of the year. But we will remain on track with our Fit For Growth Plan. We had made good progress through the first quarter and have generated between Q4 in the first quarter of this year over $250 million of annual savings already and we'll be on track for the $450 million as we go through the rest of the year to begin to set ourselves up as we move into 2021. -- Also Keith, just to conclude at this point. I felt as though very much the story was on track. The commercial momentum is starting to build, the Fit For Growth was well on track. And I would say, then we suffered a micro event, which is a ransomware attack, which we have dealt with since. And then of course we are faced with a macro environment because of COVID-19.In the absence of those, I would say the story remains very much consistent with what we've been saying for the last year, which is differentiating between the cost versus investments, trying to pivot the company back toward a growth story and making sure we have a refined strategy that we can invest behind and execute well to unlock more shareholder value creation. And that's certainly will be the playbook we will go back to. And I'd like to think we'll come out of this storm well given the business mix, given our balance sheet, given our liquidity and with even a leaner cost structure given the environment we're going through in the meantime. Hopefully we can continue the commercial momentum, at least on a relative basis and then the come out of this strongly.Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity Research. Please proceed with your question. -- Hey, there. So the payer subsegment of your healthcare vertical has been weak for a good while, while the life sciences subsegment has been strong. We actually entered 2020 thinking this was the first time in a while that you could be in a better place to grow the payer subsegment of your healthcare vertical. So my question is, looking beyond the immediate crisis on a more secular basis, are you starting to see opportunities for better relative growth in the payer subsegment or maybe you were seeing better opportunities and now COVID is making that murky. But I'd like to ask for any color on that if you can? Thanks. -- Hey Rod. Look, we had an outstanding first quarter in healthcare from a bookings point of view, triple-digit growth. By the way, we also had growth into the month of April on a year-over-year basis as well. I've been particularly pleased to see the breadth of wins we have seen in the payer area, but also frankly even in the provider area. So it feels to me that we were starting to turn a quarter in healthcare. And as you know, once we hit Q2, we will anniversary the tougher compares that we hit last year because of some of the consolidation in the industry. So we still have work to do of course to continue to sharpen our pencils on our strategy, but I feel that we had made very good progress. We have a leadership team that's very engaged and we seem to have growing momentum with our major clients.Thank you. -- Okay. I think with that, we will take one more question.Thank you, Brian. That is from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.Hey, this is Jonathan on for James. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I want to ask about what you're seeing on work that's being canceled versus the type of work that's been deferred? Are you seeing a difference in that type of work? I know discretionary work is off the table, but can you help dimensionalize relative to your service lines what has been considered discretionary now? -- Look, it's highly nuanced, it's client-by-client. But I would say, things that have a long payback tends to be pushed out at this moment in time, some change request or anything that's so-called discretionary that's not been critical is certainly being pushed out. But we have seen good momentum. As I said, in our digital engineering business, we feel very good about our cloud momentum. And actually, we've had receptivity to this week's announced acquisition of Collaborative Solutions.So I think it's back to the core elements that the secular trends that have been in the markets from my perspective will accelerate as client strikes. You have a much more agile modern infrastructure and ultimately try to take advantage of the data that they have accumulated over the years to really try to have a much more modern perspective in terms of how do you think about individuals. And I truly believe we're moving to a mobile, a virtual and a truly personal world on a go forward basis.Okay. I think with that we're at the top of the hour. So I'd just like to thank you for joining. I know it was a complex earnings call because not only did we talk about Q1 results, we also touched upon the COVID-19 implications, the ransomware attack and how we've dealt with that and a little lens into the future. I would just want to wrap up by saying the following things. I truly feel that we're more competitive than we have been as evidenced by win rates, as evidenced by our pipeline growth, as evidenced by 33% bookings, our highest momentum since 2017.Yes, it is true that COVID brings a great deal of uncertainty, but I believe our business mix and indeed our growing competitiveness will help us on a relative basis come what may. Ransomware attack is regrettable. it is contained. I believe we've managed it well. We've had good client feedback. We've been transparent, we were forthright. The impact is on revenue and margin primarily in Q2. There will be some residual costs that we will incur in Q3 and Q4 as we continue to harden and strengthen our security position and that is an absolute no regrets spend. Fundamentally, our strategy is sound. It resonates with clients and you're seeing that show up now in our numbers. And last but not least, we're 100% focused on executing that strategy. And our clients centricity is greater than ever and we expect to accelerate out of the corner once we get through COVID-19.So with that, I'd like to thank you for joining us.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- \n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(Symbol: CTSH) saw new options become available this week, for the May 22nd expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CTSH options chain for the new May 22nd contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $42.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.10.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $42.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $39.90 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CTSH, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $44.16/share today.\n\nBecause the $42.00 strike represents an approximate 5% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 65%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.00% return on the cash commitment, or 37.24% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., and highlighting in green where the $42.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $44.50 strike price has a current bid of $2.60.  If an investor was to purchase shares of CTSH stock at the current price level of $44.16/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $44.50.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.66% if the stock gets called away at the May 22nd expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CTSH shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing CTSH's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $44.50 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $44.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 49%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.89% boost of extra return to the investor, or 43.86% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 74%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 70%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $44.16) to be 43%.

Cognizant stock is up over 11% year to date, a stark improvement over 2019, when it underperformed the S&P 500 index, returning negative 2.3%.So, what has driven the bounce back, and is the stock a buy?Cognizant Technology seeks growth in its digital and cloud consulting businesses. Image source: Getty Images.Cognizant beat earnings estimates in the fourth quarter with adjusted earnings of $1.07 per share, ahead of estimates of $1.04.\u00a0The company saw revenue increase in the fourth quarter, up 3.8% year over year\u00a0to $4.2 billion. Net income was $395 million, down from $648 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Cognizant's business is split into four groups: financial services, healthcare, products and resources, and communications, media, and technology. Financial services represent the biggest slice, accounting for 34.3% of revenue. The segment saw sales increase 1.2% year over year. Healthcare saw a 1.6% jump in revenue, but the biggest gainers were products and resources and communications, media, and technology, which saw revenue rise about 8% each in the quarter. These segments were both buoyed by higher demand for system upgrades and modernization to cloud and digital services. From a geographic standpoint, revenue was up 3.1% in North America and 1.5% internationally for the quarter.The positive momentum may stem from Cognizant's \"Fit for Growth\"\u00a0plan, a restructuring initiative announced last year that will cut costs and free up money for investment in \"four key digital battlegrounds,\" as CEO Brian Humphries called them on the : data, digital engineering, cloud computing, and Internet of Things (IoT).\"We are investing aggressively and are determined to win in these four digital battlegrounds. And as we do so, we expect to accelerate our revenue growth,\" Humphries said.The cost reductions will primarily be achieved through layoffs, facility consolidation, and exiting the content moderation business. These changes are estimated to result in the reduction of some 10,000 to 12,000 jobs, primarily in India, with an estimated annual cost savings of $450 million in 2020 and $500 million to $550 million in 2021.Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are a big part of the growth strategy, as the company recently purchased two companies to bolster its cloud capabilities. One is Code Zero, a firm it bought on Feb. 3 that helps companies migrate to cloud-based systems. The other is EI-Technologies, a Paris-based digital technology consulting firm it acquired on Feb. 5. In Q4, Cognizant bought Contino, a U.K.-based consultancy that specializes in advanced data platforms.\"Both acquisitions we made this week are firmly behind the cloud ambition that we have, and you'll see more of the same on a go-forward basis behind each and every one of those digital battlegrounds. To be very clear, I view M&A as a means to an end to achieve the strategy,\" Humphries said.\u00a0For 2020, Cognizant expects revenue to grow 2% to 4% year over year, which includes lost revenues from exiting the content moderation business.

Also, the company's outlook for its two biggest client segments -- financial services and healthcare -- is muted for 2020.\u00a0Cognizant's share price has come down to a nice entry point at $64 and it's trading at a pretty low 16 times earnings.

By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's fourth quarter 2019 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Brian Humphries, Chief Executive Officer; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer.Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate, to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.With that, I'd now like to turn this call over to Brian Humphries. Please go ahead, Brian. -- Thank you, Katie. Good afternoon, everybody. As I stated on prior calls, Cognizant is in the midst of a multiyear project whose aim is to reposition the company to realize its full growth potential. And today, I'd like to briefly cover our Q4 performance and then turn our attention to 2020. After a challenging start to 2019, we're seeing higher levels of engagement from our leaders and optimism as we rally behind client centricity and revenue growth. We're making progress, but there's more work to do in the quarters ahead. Q4 revenue grew 4.2% year-over-year in constant currency with $4.28 billion. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.07, and we delivered strong cash flow. Macro demand remained stable but challenging. There is a distinction between traditional work versus digital. Legacy services are subject to meaningful pricing pressure at renewals, competition and, indeed, in-sourcing. Meanwhile, clients continue to invest in digital to become modern, data-enabled, customer-centric and differentiated businesses. These trends are set to continue through our strategic posture, and operational and financial initiatives are aligned to address this market reality.On the geographic basis Q4 revenue in North America grew 3.1% year over year. While revenue in a growth markets region grew 7.4% in costs and currency. In both geographies we are determined to accelerate growth. But the opportunity is especially significant in our international business. We remain under penetrated and we must do better. From an industry segments view, Q4 Financial Services global revenue grew 1.5% year over year in constant currency. Both banking and insurance were weak throughout 2019. Full year insurance revenue growth slowed primarily due to a modest decline in North America, albeit with a return in the second half of the year where we saw growth in Q3 and indeed Q4 year-over-year. In banking, we continued to see particular weakness in capital markets and commercial banking, offset by growth in payments and retail, with retail having benefited from the Samlink deal.Both global accounts and local accounts declined for the full year. North America performance, while still declining, has been improving throughout the year, and we see that trend continuing. Europe remains weak with some macro uncertainty and some Cognizant-specific issues. In Healthcare, we reversed two quarters of decline with constant currency growth of 1.8% year-over-year. I remain pleased with our performance in life sciences, which delivered double-digit growth. However, this was offset by ongoing declines in our healthcare vertical, which continues to be impacted by contract renegotiations at some of our largest clients, following industry consolidation and by in-sourcing at a large client. Our other two segments, Products and Resources and Communications, Media and Technology, posted high single-digit revenue growth in constant currency year-over-year, down from double digits in prior quarters.Revenue growth in the technology segment slowed meaningfully in the quarter, following our recent announcement to exit a subset of the content services business over the coming quarters. Later in our call, Karen will take you through the details of the quarter. Let's now turn to 2020, including executing the recommendations of the transformation office as they relate to strategy, operating and commercial models, our cost base and more. We enter 2020 with a two-pronged strategy that aims to expose Cognizant to faster-growing market categories. The first element is to protect and optimize our core business while scaling internationally. The second part is to invest to compete and win in four key digital battlegrounds: data, digital engineering, cloud and IoT. Our strategy leverages our technology services heritage while accelerating our position in digital where our brand recognition and commercial momentum can improve.This strategy resonates well with our clients who've always cited our strength in the run and operations side, who want us to further strengthen our digital portfolio to assist them in their innovation agenda. We're determined to help our clients become fully digital, data-enabled, customer-centric businesses. We will continue to use M&A to execute this strategy. This week, we announced two acquisitions focused on expanding our cloud capabilities. On Monday, we announced the acquisition of Code Zero Consulting, a firm that specializes in helping companies digitally transform by providing strategy, implementation and migration capabilities to evolve legacy systems to cloud-based, configure price quote and billing system. And earlier today, we announced that we've entered into exclusive negotiations to acquire the French operations of EI-Technologies, a Paris-based, privately held digital technology consulting firm. Cloud has changed the way that IT is delivered across infrastructure applications and platforms.Both of these acquisitions are Salesforce Platinum partners and will help us build upon one of our most strategic and fastest-growing practices. In addition, in Q4, we closed our previously announced acquisition of Contino, a leading consultancy that specializes in enterprise DevOps methodologies and advanced data platforms. The transformation office also recommended changes to our operating and commercial model. After months of detailed analysis, on January 1, we implemented a series of measures to accelerate our commercial momentum as part of our sales transformation initiative. These include: a new customer segmentation that prioritizes account and ensures we get the right resources on the right accounts at the right time, new sales compensation plans that reward overperformance encourage greater upsell and cross-sell in our existing accounts and increase our focus on new logos and the alignment of our specialist sales teams to our service line to increase our subject matter expertise by key practices.To date, I'm pleased with what we've seen in our sales force initiative. We have renewed energy, and our win rates continue to improve. Our previously announced hiring of 500 revenue-generating associates is on track and in line with modeled assumptions. In addition to these 500, we plan to double the number of associates supporting our most strategic alliances with all three leading hyperscale companies and SaaS vendors. Complementing these commercial changes, our recently appointed Chief Marketing Officer has been working diligently to better align our marketing spend to a growth priority. This includes strengthening our point of view by industry segment, improving targeting via account-based marketing and digitizing our customer engagement strategy. Our marketing spend will increase in 2020 as we aim to support our revenue aspiration and better position Cognizant as a leader in digital. In parallel, we've also worked to simplify the organization, empowering our client partners for speed of execution and account P&L ownership and clarifying responsibilities and decision rights for all roles across the sales life cycle.To ensure we have the right digital skills in a supply constrained environment, we've doubled our investments in Cognizant Academy in 2020 to reskill and redeploy talent toward our digital imperative. To accelerate our digital momentum, we believe we need to hire or reskill approximately 25,000 resources in 2020 alone, and we started to operationalize this. Finally, as we make these investments in automation, training, marketing and sales, we've been diligently reducing our cost structure to ensure we can be fit for growth. Karen will bring you through the details of our restructuring program later in the call. Engagement and confidence are essential in a people business. Therefore, we've been energetically communicating and contextualizing the reasons for the changes we're going through and engaging the organization to rally everyone behind our goal. I'm pleased to see the mood in the company continue to pick up, both at an executive level and throughout the broader organization.Our annualized attrition rate fell three points sequentially to 21%. Some of this can be accounted for by normal seasonality, so the fact that voluntary attrition rates declined year-over-year is actually even more encouraging. Of course, as we execute our restructuring program, we will remain diligent and stay focused on increasing employee engagement and reducing attrition. We also recognize that we need to rally the organization behind a common purpose that goes beyond financial returns. We've therefore spent a great deal of time in recent months defining a compelling company purpose statement, which will serve as our north star that guides and inspires us to make the right strategic move in the years ahead. We've also refined our company's values and behaviors that define what will be celebrated and tolerated. We will unveil this to the broader organization in the coming months. We're determined to stay true to the heart and soul of our company.And having recently attended our annual global planning summit, one held in Dallas, the other in Dubai, where the executive team and I spoke to thousands of associates around the company's strategy and expectations for 2020, I can tell you that I came away from these summits filled with optimism about our collective ability to move the company forward. Let me conclude by saying that after a challenging first quarter, we've become a more focused, determined and confident company as we move through 2019. There's a great deal of urgency in Cognizant these days. It starts with me. Any distractions we've had are now behind us. Our team is energized by the clarity of our strategy, the magnitude of the market opportunity, our renewed client centricity and our increased employee value proposition focus. While our hard work in the past year will serve us well in 2020, there remains some important areas that require progress in the years ahead.Pricing in our heritage business continues to pressure gross margin. We have efforts under way to address renewal pricing strategy as well as our cost of delivery efficiency, including pyramid management, automation and other measures. Meanwhile, as more work shifts to project-based digital engagements, we are implementing refinements in our digital pricing strategy and continuing to optimize resource planning and allocation. The leadership team and I are fully aware that we have a multiyear project ahead of us, and we are united in our resolve to work with rigor and tenacity to achieve our goals and once again make Cognizant the industry bellwether. Before I turn the call over to Karen, I want to acknowledge a Cognizant co-founder, former CEO and longtime director.Frank D'Souza had let us know of his plan to resign from Cognizant Board of Directors effective March 31. Along with his remarkable track record of success as Cognizant's CEO for a dozen years, Frank has served with distinction on Cognizant's Board since 2007 and Vice Chairman since June 30, 2019. On behalf of the entire Board, I want to extend our deep gratitude to Frank for his pioneering leadership and quarter-century of dedication to Cognizant. Today, we also announced that Vinita Bali will be joining our Board of Directors later this month. I look forward to her contributions and partnership.And with that, I'll turn the call over to Karen who will give you an update on our operational and financial performance as well as a view of how we see the year ahead. Karen? -- Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. For the full year 2019, revenue increased to $16.8 billion and represented growth of 4.1% year-over-year or 5.2% in constant currency. Fourth quarter revenue of $4.3 billion was above the high end of our guided range and represented growth of 3.8% year-over-year or 4.2% in constant currency. The revenue outperformance versus guidance was broad-based across our industry. Digital revenue continues to grow above 20% year-over-year and represented approximately 38% of total revenues for the quarter. Moving to the industry vertical. Financial Services growth was up 1.5% year-over-year in constant currency driven primarily by insurance. However, the project-based work that we benefited from in Q3 did not extend into Q4. We saw a modest slowdown in banking sequentially, reflecting typical year-end seasonality and furloughs.As Brian mentioned, within banking, our performance continues to be negatively impacted by a few of our global accounts as well as some slowness in certain regional and other clients. While macro uncertainty persists, we expect budgets within banking to be broadly stable in 2020, with North America banks better positioned relative to the U.K. and Continental Europe given continued Brexit uncertainty and our ongoing challenges with a few of our largest accounts. Against that backdrop, we continue to have a muted outlook for banking. However, we are confident in the initial steps our new head of banking has taken to reposition us for growth. We expect his client's entrance centricity to drive deeper and more robust account planning and marketing. I partnering well with digital business to ensure we increase our relevance to banks. He has also implemented a solutions team to bring ease of repeatability ensure we develop more compelling thought leadership and better align with key partners.Moving on to Healthcare, which returned to year-over-year growth, up 1.8% in constant currency. Life sciences again grew strong double digits year-over-year, benefiting from demand within digital operations and the contribution of Zenith Technologies. Additionally, we see continued momentum within our industry-specific platform solutions, such as the shared investigator portal for clinical trials, which has users in over 80 countries across 14,000 facilities, covering over 400 active trials. Within our Healthcare vertical, revenue declined mid-single digits year-over-year as performance continues to be impacted primarily by large clients involved in mergers and the continued shift of work through a captive at a large client. We expect similar year-over-year trends in Healthcare in Q1 and improvement in the year-over-year trends in the Healthcare vertical beginning in Q2 as we lap the headwinds that impacted the business in 2019.We expect continued cautious spend with healthcare payers as we approach the elections in the U.S. later this year and so are maintaining a cautious growth outlook for the healthcare vertical. Products and resources grew 8.6% year-over-year in constant currency. As we mentioned on our last , we expected slower growth on a year-over-year basis in products and resources in the fourth quarter as we locked the ramp-up of work with new logos and the contribution of acquisitions made in Q4 2018. We were pleased that the growth in the quarter continued to be broad-based growth across our industries. Results reflect demand for core modernization services of enterprise applications and for digital engineering, cloud and IoT solutions, and we expect these trends to continue in 2020. Our Communications, Media and Technology segment grew 9% year-over-year in constant currency where we saw an acceleration in the communications and media vertical driven by an increase in demand for services in core modernization and cloud transformation services. We expect continued solid performance of telecom clients as traditional telco companies look to transform into digital service providers.Additionally, we see convergence across media and communications companies, driving investments in technologies and services that hyper-personalize consumption and create new and engaging experiences for consumers. In technology, growth was negatively impacted by our decision to exit certain portions of our content services business. This negatively impacted the year-over-year growth of the CMT segment by approximately 200 basis points or $11 million. I'll provide more color on the expected impact from our decision to exit certain parts of the content services business with my Q1 and full year 2020 guidance. Now turning to geos. We were disappointed with growth in Europe, which grew 5.3% year-over-year in constant currency, reflecting a slowdown in both the U.K. and Continental Europe. A more cautious macro environment continues to weigh on spend across industries in the U.K., while we also have some Cognizant-specific challenges in a few large banking clients.The rest of world grew 14.5% year-over-year in constant currency, the strongest performance in seven quarters. While our global banking relationships continue to pressure growth in Asia Pacific, we have seen improved traction in countries, such as Australia and Japan, in insurance and life sciences. Moving on to margins. In Q4, our GAAP operating margin and diluted EPS were 14.6% and $0.72, respectively. Adjusted operating margin, which excludes restructuring charges, was 17%, and our adjusted diluted EPS was $1.07. Before getting into more details on margins, I want to provide an update on the enactment of a new tax regime in India that enables domestic companies to elect to be taxed with an income tax rate of 25% compared to the current rate of 35%. A company electing into the lower rate is required to forgo any tax holidays associated with the special economic zones and certain other tax incentives, including MAT credit carryforward. Our current intent is to elect into the lower rate once our existing MAT assets are substantially utilized.As a result, we recorded a onetime net income tax expense of $21 million due to the revaluations to the lower income tax rate of our existing India net deferred income tax asset. This had a negative $0.04 impact on GAAP EPS in the quarter. Our adjusted operating margin was flat year-over-year, reflecting SG&A discipline offset by continued pressure on gross margins, including a $25 million write-off of certain capitalized setup costs for a large healthcare customer. The write-off negatively impacted gross margins by 50 basis points and EPS by $0.04. Over the last several quarters, we have taken steps to start to rightsize our cost structure primarily focused on reducing overheads in the business, with those benefits evident in the year-over-year improvement in SG&A. These savings are necessary to fund the planned additional investments in areas such as sales resources, branding, talent and lean and automation enhancements across the company.However, gross margin declined year-over-year as we continued to face pricing pressure in the legacy parts of our business that require us to take additional actions in 2020 around pyramid optimization and pricing levers, such as COLA and aligning bill rates with promotions. We expect our 2020 Fit for Growth plan that we announced last quarter to drive improvements in these areas. I'll provide an update on the actions taken in Q4 under the 2020 Fit for Growth plan as well as additional details on the expected execution of this plan later in the call. Turning to our balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investment balance as of December 31 stood at $3.4 billion, up approximately $350 million from September 30 but down $1.1 billion from the year-ago period, reflecting the over $2.2 billion of share repurchases completed in 2019 and approximately $620 million deployed on acquisitions. As a reminder, our short-term investment balance includes restricted short-term investments of $414 million related to the ongoing dispute with the India income tax department. We generated $845 million of free cash flow in the quarter.A DSO of 73 days improved three days sequentially due to strong collections. On a year-over-year basis, DSO improved by one day. In the fourth quarter, we made a change to our accounting policy related to DSOs to better align with industry practice and better reflect amounts due from our customers on our balance sheet. Beginning in Q4, we started to net certain amounts due to customers, such as discounts and rebates, with trade accounts receivables rather than reflecting those amounts as a liability on our balance sheet. This change does not have any impact on our operating results or cash flows. Our outstanding debt balance was $738 million at the end of the quarter, and there was no outstanding balance on the revolver. During the fourth quarter, we opportunistically repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares for approximately $150 million, and our diluted share count decreased to 548 million shares for the quarter. In 2019, we repurchased over 34 million shares for approximately $2.2 billion.Today, we are announcing a 10% increase to our quarterly cash dividend, the second increase since we initiated the dividend in 2017. Additionally, the Board has approved a $2 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization. Before I turn to guidance, let me provide an update on the progress of the 2020 Fit for Growth plan as well as the content work that we're in the process of exiting. Our 2020 Fit for Growth plan is expected to run for two years. This program is designed to simplify the way we work, improve our cost structure and fund investments aimed at accelerating our revenue growth. As previously announced, we expect to remove 10,000 to 12,000 mid- to senior level associates from their current roles. We will make every effort to identify productive roles based on client demand and continue to assume that approximately 5,000 associates will have the opportunity to reskill for new roles within the company.In Q4, we incurred $48 million of charges, including $42 million of severance charges as part of the Fit for Growth plan. These charges relate to approximately 550 associates, most of whom we expect will exit the company by the end of Q1 and we expect will result in a cash impact of approximately $40 million in the first quarter with full run rate savings not achieved until Q2 for these associates. We continue to expect the majority of the remaining associates to exit the company by mid-2020. We are managing this process carefully as any time we make decisions that impact our employees, we take it very seriously. Additionally, we continue to review our real estate portfolio as part of the Fit for Growth plan and expect to take further actions related to real estate rationalization in 2020. These actions are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2020 and are expected to result in 2020 in-year gross savings of over $450 million and annualized gross run rate savings of $500 million to $550 million in the year 2021.Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we began the exit of a subset of our content services business. Approximately $5 million of the $48 million Fit for Growth charges in the quarter related to retention and severance for approximately 1,100 of the expected 5,000 to 6,000 total associates to be impacted by the wind-down of this work. We have updated our estimate of the number of associates to be impacted by the wind-down from 6,000 to a range of 5,000 to 6,000 as we expect to retain more work with these clients in other content and technology services than originally estimated. We now estimate that we may lose revenues of $225 million to $255 million, down from our previous estimate of $240 million to $270 million on an annualized basis within our Communications, Media and Technology segment. We continue to anticipate revenues will ramp down over the next one to two years with an expected impact of $20 million to $25 million of revenue in Q1 on a year-over-year basis.This is expected to be modestly dilutive to our adjusted operating margin rate, subject to the timing of the ramp-down and other factors. We also continue to expect to incur wind-down charges related to the transition of these associates and any related assets such as real estate and equipment. We are working with our partners to transition this work while continuing to meet our contractual obligations and providing impacted associates with a number of transition assistance programs, including retention bonuses, severance packages and the opportunity to participate in various reskilling programs. At the time of our Q4 , we provided an estimate of $150 million to $200 million in total expected charges associated with this Fit for Growth cost transformation plan, including the wind-down of certain content work.Based on our actions to date, attrition at the senior levels of the pyramid being slightly higher than our expectations and less impact from the exit of certain content services, we now expect to be toward the low end of that range while maintaining the annualized gross savings estimate of $500 million to $550 million. Before turning to guidance, I want to comment on a potential change in the dividend distribution tax that was announced as part of the India budget a few days ago. We are currently analyzing this proposal but believe it can, once enacted, significantly lower the cost of repatriating funds back to the U.S. The proposal is not yet law, but the expected date is April 1, 2020. I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q1 and the full year 2020. For the full year 2020, we expect revenue to grow in the range of 2% to 4% year-over-year to $17.11 billion to $17.45 billion on a reported and constant currency basis as, based on the current exchange rates, we are not expecting a material impact from foreign exchange.This includes our estimate of a negative impact of approximately 110 basis points to year-over-year growth from our decision to exit certain content work within our CMT segment. This guidance continues to reflect a muted outlook for Financial Services and Healthcare. We expect first quarter revenue growth in the range of 2.5% to 3.5% year-over-year to $4.21 billion to $4.25 billion on a reported basis. Based on current exchange rates, this translates to constant currency growth in the range of 2.8% to 3.8% year-over-year or $4.23 billion to $4.27 billion, reflecting our assumption of a negative 30 basis points for foreign exchange for the first quarter. This includes our estimate of a negative impact of approximately 60 basis points to year-over-year growth from our decision to exit certain work within the content services business, which will be reflected in the CMT segment. Revenue guidance for both Q1 and the full year assumes a cautious macro outlook in the U.K., continued slow growth in Financial Services and Healthcare as well as the previously mentioned impact of exiting certain content work.For the full year 2020, we expect adjusted operating margins to be between 16% and 17%, which assumes incentive compensation to be a target payout. We expect Q1 margins to be slightly below the low end of the range as we are investing in sales hiring, training, tooling and automation and marketing and branding, while the timing of the savings from the actions taken under our Fit for Growth Plan and the return on our sales investments will not have reached the full quarter run rate. As a reminder, our full year 2019 margin rate reflects lower incentive compensation payout given our underperformance versus target. Our guidance assumes that in 2020, we'll perform as planned, and therefore, incentive compensations will reflect target payout rate. This is a margin rate headwind of approximately 120 basis points year-over-year that we plan to absorb. The midpoint of our 2020 margin guidance of 16% to 17% therefore reflects approximately 100 basis points of improvement over the 2019 margin normalized for incentive compensation.We expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.97 to $4.13. Our EPS guidance anticipates a year-over-year decrease of approximately $30 million in interest income, reflecting a lower cash balance and reduced interest rate in both the U.S. and India. This is expected to impact EPS by approximately $0.04. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 548 million shares and a tax rate in the range of 24% to 26%. Guidance provided for adjusted diluted EPS excludes restructuring charges and other unusual items, if any; net nonoperating foreign currency exchange gains and losses; clarification, if any, by the Indian government as to the application of the Supreme Court ruling related to the India defined contribution obligation; and the tax effects of the above adjustments. Our guidance does not account for any potential impact from events like changes such as immigration or tax policies.With that, operator, we can open the call for questions.Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. -- Hi guys. I want to ask about the cadence of revenue growth in 2020. It looks like you guided -- 1Q '20 revenue guidance, 3% to 4% constant currency. Full year fiscal year '20 growth is pretty similar at 2% to 4% constant currency. So is Cognizant expecting kind of steady revenue growth with no fluctuations? Or do you expect maybe a little bit of a drop in the middle of the year and a pickup in the fourth quarter? I guess another way to ask this is, do you see an inflection point in revenue growth on the horizon? -- Bryan, it's Karen. So the one thing I would say is nothing particularly unusual. There's no large deals. There's no -- nothing unusual right now from a seasonality perspective. So I think it will be relatively a typical seasonality that will start to ramp as we get into Q2 and then Q3. The one thing I would say where the back half might be a little bit stronger is because of the sales investments that we're making now, right? So we launched that hiring program late last year. Those folks are coming onboard as we expected. And certainly, while we said we would expect to take about a year for them to start to ramp, but we should start to see a little bit of that benefit as we get into the back part of the year. -- Yes. And maybe the addition I'd make to that, Karen, is obviously the content moderation ramp-down will offset that somewhat as it grows throughout the course of the year.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. -- Thank you. Hi, Brian. I can appreciate the detailed commentary. Brian, I was hoping you could give more information about the sales force transformation. Where do you stand on hiring? You mentioned the words on track but a little bit more color on what on track means would be great. And on the flip side, is there perhaps any heightened attrition you expect to see for the traditional sales force that was already there given maybe the new compensation schemes or any changes there? So a sales force update. -- It's very interesting because, as I said, we were at our global planning summit in the last month or so, and the sales force are actually very motivated by the compensation changes because they can actually make more money than they could in prior periods. So actually, on the contrary, I actually feel there's a great deal of optimism in the sales force. People are -- when a CEO visits clients every single day, it leads to a certain cultural demand in the organization. And I think people are motivated to get the company back to an accelerated growth rate, so I feel good about where we are. I'm not overly concerned about attrition in the legacy sales teams. We've had great luck, I would say, fulfilling the pipeline of opportunities. We don't break out on a quarterly basis where we are versus that hiring. We're less than halfway through the 500, I will tell you that, but there's a lot of work still to do. But I track it on a monthly basis at the Executive Committee, and we're pretty much in line with what we anticipated in terms of cost. I've also been keeping an eye not just on the accounts that these folks are assigned to but also the pipeline that they are building.And in some cases, I've been pleasantly surprised that the early pipeline builds have even been ahead of my expectations. So look, more work to do to continue to review that, but there's a lot of energy and urgency in Cognizant these days. And I think we're all very clear on what we're setting out to achieve, and I feel very good in terms of where we are to date. So the broader sales force update is consistent with what I said last quarter, that's not going to change. We've implemented a RAD model, which is retention, acquisition and development. That's all about trying to get the right folks on the right accounts at the right time, aligning specialist resources, which are, by practice, such as big data or cloud, with a generalist client partner. The client partner is the quarterback on the accounts. They have decision rights. They own the P&L for the accounts. They can move with speed and accountability within the framework of authority that we have delegated to them, and they are complemented by subject matter experts, solution architects and the like. We implemented that model on January 1. So far, so good. And we've obviously got to continue to push that in the course of the year ahead, but I feel good about where we are.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question. -- Hi, good afternoon, guys. Hey, Brian, one of the things you mentioned was that you're doubling the number of people supporting Cognizant's major strategic alliances. And I know that that is also somewhere where you have been spending your own time as well. Can you just provide a little bit more richness on where you're focused there, where maybe Cognizant is already strong, where you think there's opportunity to improve and how that sort of fits into the overall updated strategy and Fit for Growth Plan? -- Yes, I will. And look, we have, Lisa, some really strong alliance partners and partnerships by key verticals, whether that's Temenos in Financial Services, Pega, Adobe or otherwise. But I've really spent a huge amount of time in the last nine months trying to build that and foster a business plan behind Amazon, behind Microsoft. We're now working through Google Cloud practice as the hyperscale players, and it is really selectively aligning Cognizant to some of the leading SaaS-type players, as an example, such as Salesforce or ServiceNow or, indeed, Workday to make sure that we go to market with the companies that are going 20%, 30%, 40% year-over-year. Not to say we won't continue to obviously partner with others, but we are putting -- allocating even more capital to the winners in today's environment. That invariably means for us, just to be very clear, it doesn't mean hiring more alliance partners and having a bunch of coffee drinkers sitting around, feeling good about hosting meetings. This is a lot about building our business plans with solution architects and big data experts and the like aligned to each and every one of those companies I've talked about.It involves putting an operational cadence together on a rolling 4-quarter basis. So I know in a certain date, I'll be sitting in a room with the CEO of that company, reviewing not just what we're setting out to achieve as a company, which has our targets against it, which are intersected by country and vertical, but also looking at the pipeline shape, where we are in the funnel and really operationalizing that strategic alliance vision into day-to-day reality, which includes joint customer calls, joint in-person visits to clients with the leadership of those companies, joint emails to clients or letters to clients and the like. So it's strategic. But to be very clear, it's also very operationally inclined and pragmatic with a view to successfully driving activity or cadence going forward with these clients and partners and making sure we show up better than we ever have in the past.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. -- Hi, thanks a lot, everything looks, in mind, a little bit different. I know you mentioned, Karen, the 50 bps or the $25 million Healthcare writedown. Can you maybe quantify some of the pricing pressure you're seeing coming from the heritage work or anything else on delivery costs that might have surprised you? I know the Fit for Growth piece is coming in, too, so just overall, trying to get some more color on the quarter and then maybe how the year is going to play out here in 2020 for gross margin. -- I don't think -- in the quarter, Tien-tsin, I wouldn't say there was any real change in pricing trends. But as we talked about on the prepared comments, we certainly are continuing to see pressure on renewals in the heritage or legacy IT side of the business. Right now, that's being offset by higher pricing on the digital side of the business. And -- but certainly, we think we can do better on pricing in digital services and really make sure that we are pricing to the market and for the value that we are providing to clients. So that is certainly an initiative we have under way as well as do a far better job on things like COLA and getting adjusted bill rates when people are being promoted or rotating our staff to take effect of a more optimal pyramid.Certainly, the savings that we've seen so far has been primarily in the SG&A bucket as we've been focused on the top end of the pyramid, most of which was down in SG&A. But as we move into Q1 and Q2 and further into the Fit for Growth program, we would certainly expect to see improvements in the middle to upper middle of the pyramid as well and also be able to drive improvement in some of these revenue levers, which will hopefully start to stabilize gross margin.Our next question is from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. -- Great. Thanks. Brian, is your team now in place? I know you had one of your execs cycle out not that long ago. But do you have the people that you need down a level or two at this point to drive the transformation? -- Look, I'm a big believer, Ed, that A players attract A players. And the more we upskill and make sure we have the right team around me, those people, in turn, will make sure that they replicate that trend through the organization. I will say we have gems in Cognizant, really, really strong leaders. I talked about life sciences growing double digits. That's an internal promotion that happened in the last year. So it's always going to be a combination of complementing excellent internal talent with excellent additions from the outside and putting a system of meritocracy and a performance culture in place where everybody knows what we celebrate and what we condone versus what we don't tolerate. So of course, in the years ahead, there will always be refinements. I want to drive a performance culture, but we're getting there. But of course, there will be even, in the foreseeable future, ongoing refinements as we continue to attract better people from the outside to complement the internal talent.I will say one thing that's very pleasing to me. There's no shortage of people reaching out to Cognizant at this moment in time, feeling both from clients and otherwise that there's a new vigor in the company, a new urgency in the company and a confidence that we can get back to being the great company that we have been in the past. So it's very encouraging to me to know that we can still attract great talent from the outside. And in the same vein, with a new Chief People Officer, Becky Schmitt, who joined this Monday, who almost spent two decades in Accenture and most recently had been in Walmart, we have a very strong people agenda program lined up in the coming years to attract, motivate, develop, retain and put very sophisticated talent management programs in place internally. And I believe that that will not just make us a very appealing place to come and develop your career, but it will also have intrinsically a direct impact on our attrition rate which, as I said in the call, I'm pleased with, but we can always do better.Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your question. -- Hi, excuse me. Hi. Thank you very much. Karen, just for clarification, could you tease out the guidance from a revenue perspective in terms of isolating what M&A contribution is expected to be? And particularly, the M&A contribution, does that include some of the recent -- very, very recent deals? And then, Brian, for you, if you could just revisit on Healthcare and how we should be thinking about Healthcare cadence, both this year and, frankly, exiting this year? As the deals anniversary in earnest in the June quarter, in particular, has the price activities of the M&A client, will that -- has that already played out? Or would that continue to play out for the year? But just more broadly, talk a little bit about Healthcare, both this year and kind of exiting the year, and how you see the opportunity there for Cognizant. -- Well, I'll start with the Healthcare question, Keith, because actually ironically, I've been on the phone with the leadership team of, as it happens, both of those combined companies as recently as this morning, so I'm pretty current in terms of where we are in the accounts and, indeed, the opportunity. And I will say I continue to be pleased that we show up a little bit better than we have, and those executives and companies reassured me that the merger integration work is still there. And as they think about consolidating to preferred vendors, we are firmly and squarely in the go-forward strategy as well. So I do feel there's lots of opportunity for us even in those larger accounts where we've seen consolidation from four to two in the last year, and we have seen some pressure on rates as part of that. But we do want to get back, once we anniversary that, into a stronger growth trajectory in Healthcare. In the same vein, I just want to caution the amount of work that needs to be done.We've also had our Healthcare team today here in New York, about 20 people in the room reviewing last year, reviewing revenue pipeline, win rate, margin trends, a very strong call to action in terms of what we need to do in the coming years. So we're not out of the other side on that yet, but I choose to be glass half full here in terms of a lot of the actions we are doing are not specific to one vertical. Better aligning marketing spend, making sure we have the right customer segmentation strategy in place, upskilling our client partners, making sure we have the best specialists in the world to complement them, going to market with some of the hyperscale players in Financial Services or Healthcare, etc., etc., that will bear fruits in each and every one of our industries, Healthcare included. We do expect still some, I would say, modest -- we still have modest expectations for Healthcare in the coming year. But as we go through the course of the year, I'd like to think that we'll start to make some progress. -- And Keith, it's Karen. Let me just comment on the guidance. So for the first quarter, there's about 120 basis points of inorganic revenue baked into the guidance. That includes only the transactions that have already been completed, so that would include Code Zero but not the EI-Technologies transaction as that has not closed yet. And then on a full year basis, the guidance, similarly only for deals closed, is about 100 basis points of revenue growth year-over-year. And that's down from -- if you recall in 2019, the impact was about 200 basis points.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity. Please proceed with your question. -- Yes. Hey there. So on the last earnings call, you talked about a set of growth investments that would cost you about 150 basis points on margin. So I'm just looking at the further needs to build into the digital era. And besides the growth investments you've already articulated, are there additional growth-related investments that you'd like to start making in 2020 such that if you had more room in your margin plan, are there additional investments that you would like to make besides the ones you've talked about? -- Rob, it's Brian. So listen, the way I think about it, this year, if you normalize for, let's say, target bonuses, as Karen has articulated in this call and prior calls, margins would have been in roughly mid-15%. We've guided 16% to 17% for next year. So call the midpoint, 16.5%. So -- and we're assuming, by the way, next year that our bonus structure is a normalized part of our cost base. So hence, organically, if you will, 100 basis points of margin improvement year-over-year. Now to your point, we've made reference before of $250 million-plus of investment back into the business. A lot of that, we call that explicitly like 500 head count related just to revenue generation. We're doing more on sales and marketing. We're doing more in training, etc.. That's approximately 1.5 points. So had we not done that, margins naturally would have been higher. But I'm not here to try to operationalize Cognizant from $17 billion to $20 billion. We're trying to make this a $25 billion, $30 billion, $35 billion company in the years ahead. And as part of that, I think it's always wrong to look at one element on a continuum and shine a spotlight there and think, well, Brian, had you not made those investments, could you deliver a higher margin rate.And Rod, I've known your investment thesis on the stock. I certainly know that's not your intent either behind your question. What I want to do is continue to reinvest into the business. So if we can prove a strong return in these investments we're making, including the sales force hiring, and we get win rates higher, if we get a good pipeline that we convert to TCV and revenue, my inclination will be to continue to deliver and apply more of the upside back into the business and get us back into the Cognizant that was tried and tested for many, many years that made this company a great success story over the years. So that's the intention that we're setting out to deliver here in the next five to 10 years. I'm confident we're doing the right thing. I will tell you I'm really pleased, and I spend a lot of my time with clients and partners. Our strategy is resonating. They see the renewed energy in the company. We have lots of work to do, but I'm very pleased and optimistic with the progress we're making and know, nonetheless, that we still have more work to do in the year ahead.Our next question is from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. -- Hey, thanks. Thanks, guys.Just a two-pronged question on M&A. First, I know that EI-Technologies, you just said, is not in the guide at this point. But assuming that that closes in line with the timing you're expecting, roughly how much revenue would that add this year? And then can you just comment more broadly on your M&A strategy? It feels like the frequency and intensity of M&A is picking up a little bit, Brian, under your watch over the past year. Is that an accurate assessment in terms of where you intend to take that strategy as well? Obviously, these kind of tuck-in, sized digital assets really stand out. -- Yes. So listen, a good question. I wouldn't say to date that the frequency has picked up that much. February 6 last year, I was announced as the new CEO. So I started on April 1. And since then, we've done, until this week, two acquisitions, Contino and then, prior to that, Zenith Technologies. It just so happens that we were diligently working to review our strategy and finalize that. And only with that behind is that we absolutely go -- now let's go and put our balance sheet behind us to make sure we position ourselves strongly behind our strategic intent. And as I said earlier, that's a lot about protecting and optimizing the core, including scaling internationally, but it's also about winning in e-digital battleground. And both acquisitions we made this week are firmly behind the cloud ambition that we have, and you'll see more of the same on a go-forward basis behind each and every one of those digital battlegrounds. To be very clear, I view M&A as a means to an end to achieve the strategy.While I'm pleased with the $2.2 billion we've spent on share repurchases last year, you will see an absolute conviction to returning capital to shareholders in the form of periodic dividend increases as well as share repurchases with a particular eye to offset dilution. But also potentially opportunistic, I will say that you will see us err more toward accelerating M&A on a go-forward basis as long as it is supportive of the overall company strategy. Share repurchases, while having value, do not reposition the company against the strategic intent. M&A can enable us to do that. So with almost a year behind me under my belt here in Cognizant, getting my head around the company, the industry better, the operational rigor and control we have, with the team around me, we're absolutely inclined to accelerate M&A a little more in the years ahead and make sure we use that as a means to accomplish our overall company strategy.With regards to the details of EI-Technologies, look, we've entered into exclusive negotiations. Deal's not closed. It is material for France but is absolutely immaterial from a company perspective in terms of the dollar addition. So it's basis points in terms of growth as opposed to anything else. But as I said, that plus Code Zero is firmly behind our Salesforce ambition. And we've been spending a lot of time. I personally have met with Salesforce CEO, I think, probably now 5 times in nine months, and these are very symbolic moves to make sure that we strengthen our capabilities behind the Salesforce practice that we're building out.Thank you. We have time for one final question today, which will be coming from the line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question. -- Hey, thanks for taking my question. Brian, you spoke about the need to potentially accelerate growth in international where you feel that the company is underpenetrated. Can you talk a bit about what sort of actions you're taking to kind of get there? Maybe some color there, that will be helpful. Thanks. -- Yes, it ultimately takes three portions: one is organic investments, one is partnership and another one is M&A. To be very clear, Zenith Technologies, which was at the intersection point of life sciences as one of our really strategic verticals as well as IoT was a perfect illustration of hitting many birds with one stone: geographic expansion strengthening European footprint, aligning through our IoT digital priority and aligning to one of our strategic verticals. We also announced and closed Contino, which has got a very strong international footprint in the form of DevOps and data in Q4. So those are good illustrations. And of course, EI-Technologies that we announced earlier today will be another good illustration of strengthening our footprint in Europe, in this case, in France. Organically, of course, we're strengthening our capabilities by building out more footprint and supporting that footprint with better allocation of resources globally. As an example, we will modify our marketing mix this year to shift much more toward our international expansion.In prior years, our marketing spend was actually less in our international business than the actual current revenue mix, notwithstanding the fact that our growth opportunity was bigger there. So that seems to have been something that we wanted to rectify on a go-forward basis and, of course, part of the 500 revenue-generating head count that we've approved. A good chunk of that is in Europe, and we want to continue to go scale that to make sure we have a bigger footprint in those geographies. And then on the partnership side, whether it's with AWS or Salesforce or otherwise, we've been building out those linkages throughout the world, and Europe is no different with a view to go to market in a digital ecosystem aligned country by country.I firmly view partners, Lisa asked the question earlier, as an extension of our sales force. We are working on some core banking deals at this moment in time where the CEO of Temenos has actually actively engaged and brought us into deals and been a huge proponent of Cognizant given our world-class capabilities behind Temenos. So it's wonderful when a client hears not just from the CEO of Cognizant but also the CEO, in this case, of Temenos as to our capabilities and our referenceability in that regard. So we're full speed onboard, full speed ahead to go scale our international capabilities. It was a little bit disappointing this last quarter, some of it self-inflicted. We got to get that right going forward, and it's certainly an area of focus for me in the coming years. -- Okay. With that, I think we will conclude today's call. Thank you all for your questions.[Operator Closing Remarks]. --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- \n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.79% return on the cash commitment, or 20.34% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., and highlighting in green where the $61.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $62.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.70.  If an investor was to purchase shares of CTSH stock at the current price level of $61.53/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $62.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.53% if the stock gets called away at the February 28th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CTSH shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing CTSH's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $62.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $62.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 52%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.76% boost of extra return to the investor, or 20.17% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 25%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 24%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $61.53) to be 23%.

These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Brian Humphries. Please go ahead, Brian. -- Well, thank you, Katie, and good afternoon everybody and thanks for joining us on today's call. Over the past few months we've initiated what we expect will be a multi-year evolution of our business aimed at returning our company to historical levels of performance. We view this as a systematic process of revitalizing the company and one we're pursuing with rigor and urgency.Today I want to clarify where we are in this project and where we're headed by briefly covering our Q3 performance and then reviewing how we've begun to operationalize the conclusions of the transformation office, impeding our refined strategic posture, which aligns to our clients' digital imperatives and our plan for resetting our cost base to facilitate investments in growth.Let's begin with our third quarter earnings. Q3 revenue grew 5.1% year-over-year in constant currency to $4.25 billion and non-GAAP EPS was $1.08. In an uncertain economic climate, our year-over-year performance in North America improved modestly in the third quarter. As we've discussed in prior calls, our ability to accelerate the company's top-line growth depends on revitalizing our North America performance. And in particular, our banking and financial services and healthcare businesses, both of which were under new leadership. While we have more work to do, we now have highly engaged strategic leaders running these businesses to bring a fresh perspective and huge client centricity. Arguably, even more important than a modest year-over-year growth improvement we've seen is the new energy we have in our North America leadership team and our clients are noticing this.At a global level in Q3, banking and financial services was up 3% year-over-year in constant currency and healthcare was down 90 basis points year-over-year in customer currency. In banking and financial services, against a backdrop of growing demand for DevOps and some in-sourcing of skills, we see cost pressure in the traditional business with growth opportunities in digital, with particular interest in cloud, digital engineering, AI and analytics and interactive. Similar dynamics exist in healthcare, but here revenue growth also continues to be impacted by rate reductions and volume discounts from clients in the midst of merger integration.Our momentum continued in our other two business segments, Products and Resources and Communications Media and Technology, both posted double-digit revenue growth in constant currency year-over-year. Later in our call, Karen will take you through the details of the quarter including the business segment and markets commentary.Let's turn to my second topic, operationalizing the conclusions of the transformation office. As a reminder, upon joining Cognizant in April, we established a transformation office to identify, prioritize and put into action key initiatives aimed at accelerating our revenue growth and unlocking the full potential of Cognizant. Following six months of engagement by 250 of our leaders, we have now identified, among other things, our strategic focus, operating and commercial models, global delivery structure and our cost base and processes and tools required to enable us to be fit for growth. As a result, we are now in execution mode, putting into action key initiatives aimed at facilitating investments in growth, going to market with a sharper strategic focus, working more closely with our clients, continuing to evolve our skill sets and creating a leaner and simpler operating model.Let's start with our strategy. I continue to allocate significant time to face-to-face meetings with the C-suite of our clients. I find these meetings essential because they allow me to gain insights into the key trends by industry, customer pain points and desired business outcomes. Clients across all industries are confronted with the risk of being disrupted by next generation, nimble, digital-native competitors. So they are redirecting their focus and investment to digital and embracing DevOps and technologies like cloud, digital engineering, analytics, AI and automation.We spent the past few months sharpening our strategic posture to align directly with clients' needs to become modern, data-enabled, customer-centric and differentiated businesses. Our strategy has two parts. First, protecting and optimizing our core portfolio, which includes efficiency, tooling and automation, delivery optimization, protection of renewals, strengthening our industry alignment and scaling our international footprint. And second, winning in four key digital battlegrounds; data, digital engineering, cloud and IoT. These four areas enables clients to put their data at the core of their operations, improving the experience they offer their customers, tapping into new revenue streams, defending against these structures and reducing costs.The two parts of our strategy reinforce each other. It's our core portfolio that has built our strength in the market. For instance, our deep relationship with clients who leave their industries, our reputation for responsive and reliable delivery and our historical strength of the application there mean that we know how to help clients transition for managing their current legacy state to enabling their digital future. We are investing aggressively and are determined to win in these four digital battlegrounds. And as we do so, we expect to accelerate our revenue growth.I want to offer a bit more context about these four areas, starting with data, which is the heart of our strategy because it's at the core of our clients competitiveness. No matter their industry, clients must quickly get better at storing, managing, reporting, analyzing and reusing their data. Clients need to leverage enormous amounts of data to fuel AI-based platforms that can transform customer experiences, drive automation and provide management insight. This is causing a shift from legacy to next generation data services like data modernization, AI and machine learning. We're helping our clients make the leap from systems of record to systems of insights and engagement. It starts with data engineering, including basic things like customer and product hierarchies.Turning to digital engineering. To compete effectively, clients need to become software-driven enterprises. And to do so, they are replacing traditional application development with digital engineering to build leading-edge consumer grade experiences and infuse software into their products, services and customer experiences.Cloud, our third digital battleground is just as critical for clients digital journey given that an estimated 50% of our workloads sit on public and private clouds today, a figure said to rise to 80% in a couple of years. Our clients need help migrating their workloads as well as the entire spectrum of client management, including monitoring, notification, provisioning and orchestration, governance and security. We aim to significantly enhance our partnership with leading scale companies, hyperscale companies and SaaS vendors.Our fourth battleground is IoT, an exciting space given that 75% of businesses are expected to increase their IoT spending in the next five years and 40 billion plus devices are expected to be IoT connected by 2025. The adoption of IoT enabled by 5-generation technology is sparking an explosion in distributed and edge computing. A vast array of sensors and industrial IoT devices and solutions will proliferate across businesses, cities and environments of all kinds, significantly changing use cases and accelerating adoption. For clients, IOT offers the ability to instrument everything for constant insight.If we look back at our recent acquisitions such as Softvision, which expanded our digital engineering capabilities and then technologies, which expanded our IoT portfolio and our life sciences domain expertise, we've been methodically deepening our expertise in areas that we believe will provide the greatest value to clients, while generating the best return for Cognizant.Our latest step along that path is our agreement to acquire Contino, a leading consultancy that specializes in helping global 2,000 clients speed their digital transformations by leveraging Enterprise DevOps methodologies and advanced data platforms. Cognizant's approach to cloud migration, core modernization and cloud security is reshaping how enterprises build their infrastructures. And these cloud capabilities will enable us to offer transform the cloud-based solutions to our clients. We expect this transaction to close later this quarter.The refinement of our strategic posture also highlights a subset of our portfolio that is not in line with our strategic vision for the company, and therefore, an area to exit. Within digital operations, we have a content operations business that offers a wide range of business process services to clients across all industries. Some of these projects involve ensuring proper brand and business experiences, such as integrating our healthcare patients or determining whether online maps accurate. But within one subset of the content operations business, our work is largely focused on determining whether certain content violates client standards and can involve objectionable materials. We've determined that this subset of work is not in line with our strategic vision for the company.While we intend to exit this work, we recognize the cleansing web of objectionable content is a worthy cause and one in which companies have a role to play. For this reason, we have decided to allocate $5 million to fund research aimed at increasing the level of sophistication of algorithms and automation, thereby reducing users' exposure to objectionable content. Over the coming quarters, we intend to comply with our contractual obligations and determine the best path forward with effective clients. Exiting this subset will impact our financial performance in the coming year and also affect approximately 6,000 roles. In the months ahead, we expect to work with our partners to explore ways to transition roles to alternative vendors, thereby reducing the impact to our value decisions. As a reminder other Cognizant digital operations content work will continue.In recent quarters I've discussed the importance of simplifying our organizational model to enhance low clarity, empowerment and accountability, while ensuring we further increase our client centricity and optimize our cost structure. Over the last few months, the transformation office and a deployed[Phonetic] feedback has identified a series of measures to help us progress against these goals.And today I want to give you an update on some of the decisions we have taken. These actions include returning to our sensor [Phonetic] two-in-a-box model of client partner and delivery partner for a more seamless client experience and greater agility in front of the customer. Our previously announced consolidation of the delivery organization under one delivery leader reporting to me, significantly increasing investments in automation in tooling to enable more streamlined and efficient processes, higher productivity and lower delivery costs, combining Cognizant digital engineering capabilities with Cognizant's Softvision, thereby creating a powerful team focused on software product development and application modernization.Extending our global brand, developing greater thought leadership by industry vertical and better positioning Cognizant in the market as a leader in digital by uniting all marketing under our recently hired CMO reporting to me. Strengthening Cognizant consulting capabilities in select geographies and verticals, while complementing our targeted capabilities with greater partnerships with a leader again reporting to me. Aligning our specialist sales capabilities to the service lines, albeit with an industry intersection point to ensure the highest competencies and capabilities are available to our client partners.And lastly, in our commercial teams, the implementation of more leverage sales compensation programs and the development and deployment of a RAD model or Retention Acquisition Development to optimally segment our clients and future clients, thereby allowing us to better hunt and form. These changes for the most part will become effective January 1, 2020.Against a strategic backdrop and a set of organizational divisions aimed at ensuring strategy execution, today we are also announcing a cost reduction program. In any people-intensive business, cost reduction always involve difficult choices. Would we deny to evolve here skill sets and freeing up capacity to invest in growth, we've made the decision to remove approximately 10,000 to 12,000 mid-to-senior level associates from their current roles in the coming quarters.This gross reduction is expected to lead to a net reduction of approximately 5,000 to 7,000 roles as we aim to reskill approximately 5,000 associates, thereby lessening the impact on our associates and allowing us to reduce lateral hiring. These numbers exclude the approximately 6,000 roles impacted by our decision to exit a subset of our content operation business. But as previously stated, we expect to work with our partners to explore ways to transition these roles to alternative vendors, thereby reducing the impact on our associates and also reducing any associated charge.Establishing a healthcare cost structure is what a means to an end and that's to drive revenue growth. We free up cost. We've identified a series of investments that require funding including the previously announced hiring of approximately 500 revenue-generating associates over the coming year, a combination of customer facing and sales support professionals who will help us expand existing accounts and generate new ones, significant investments in Cognizant Academy, our internal learning center and in technical skills as we aim to reskill and redeploy our talent toward digital imperatives, accelerated investments in tooling and automation and increased investments in marketing and branding as we aim to strengthen our international operations and the dealer digital brand.Karen will provide more detail on our 2020 Fit for Growth plan including the expected completion date and run rate savings along with the charges we expected to incur. We will take great care to treat associates with the dignity and respect they deserve and to minimize any internal distractions caused by our actions as we get the company back to achieving its full potential.We didn't see our roadmap for a full seven months, which has given me the opportunity to considerably deepen my knowledge of our operations, our market opportunity and our clients. And three things are resenting and appear to me. First, we've built an enviable position in a large and attractive market that's expected to continue growing at a steady rate. Most of the clients we serve are still in the early stages of their transformation. They need our expertise in a distinct set of digital technologies coupled with our intimate knowledge of their technology environments to fully digitize their businesses.Second, the significant time I have been able to spend with our top accounts convinces me that our clients love working with us and actually want us to succeed. In fact, we want to step up and do even more for them. It's my observation that Cognizant is one of those rare B2B organizations that is a so-called love brand. The reservoir of client for us we've built over the years is one of our most distinctive assets. And third, the company is brimming with talented and engaged associates around the world. Our associates are driven to grow and develop new capabilities and use these skills in our portfolio of solutions and then how to apply them to help our clients thrive in a digital economy.In summary, the leadership team and I are fully aware that we have a multi-year project ahead of us. My optimism about Cognizant's future is pragmatic and it comes from the winning spirit of our associates around the world who are passionate about contributing to the long-term success of our clients. Notwithstanding a backdrop of macro demand uncertainty that gives us pause for prudence, I'm convinced that much of what we need to do to increase Cognizant's competitiveness is within our own control.Our relentless focus on growth has defined Cognizant's performance since its founding a quarter century ago and that determination and focus are as strong as ever. We are determined to unlock the organization's growth potential and return Cognizant to its historical position of being the bellwether in the IT services industry.With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Karen who will give you an update, both on our and financial performance as well as of U.S. to how we will see the fourth quarter. Karen? -- Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon everyone. Third quarter revenue of $4.25 billion was above the high-end of our guided range and represented growth of 4.2% year-over-year or 5.1% in constant currency. Digital revenue growth was in the mid-20% range and represented over 35% of total revenues. Moving to the industry verticals where overall company performance continues to be impacted by financial services and healthcare. Financial services growth was up 3% in constant currency driven by the ramp up of several projects and insurance and banking performance which was consistent with last quarter. Within banking, our performance continues to be impacted by a few of our largest customers. Consistent with the last quarter, two of our top five accounts continue to grow, while three remain under pressure, a trend we expect to continue through the remainder of the year.As we had expected when we did our last earnings call, insurance in Q3 benefited from a ramp up in project-based work. However, in Q4, we anticipate a continuation of trends seen over the course of this year where executive transitions under way at several of our clients is slowing the decision making process, particularly around larger deals in the pipeline.Moving on to Healthcare, which declined 0.9% year-over-year in constant currency. Within our healthcare vertical, performance continues to be primarily impacted by large clients involved in mergers, the continued shift of work captive at a large client and the continued year-over-year impact from the completed ramp down of an account in which we were the subcontractor to a third party. Additionally in the quarter, we were impacted by a charge related to an ongoing contract dispute with the large client. This charge impacted both revenue and margin.Life Sciences again grew double-digits year-over-year, benefiting from continued demand within digital operations, large enterprise transformation deals migrating from on-premise to cloud-based environments and momentum within our industry-specific platform solutions such as our Shared Investigator Platform and Smart Trials. Zenith also contributed to growth in the quarter and we are pleased with the early success we have seen with this acquisition. We expect similar year-over-year trends in healthcare in the fourth quarter.Products and Resources grew 13.4% year-over-year in constant currency. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit constant currency growth. Growth was broad-based across verticals as the results continued to benefit from strong growth within our digital business and demand for digital engineering, cloud infrastructure, IoT and analytics solutions. We do expect to see slower growth on a year-over-year basis in the products and resources segment in the fourth quarter as we lap and ramp up the work with new logos and the contribution of acquisitions made in Q4 2018.Our Communications, Media and Technology segment grew 10.6% year-over-year in constant currency. In technology, growth was driven by revenue from recent acquisitions and demand for our digital engineering services, partly offset by slowing demand for content services. As Brian mentioned, we have decided to exit certain types of content work within our digital operations practice that is not in line with our long-term strategic vision for the company. I will provide some more color on the impact of this to our Communications, Media and Tech practice, as well as the overall company in a few minutes.Turning to geos [Phonetic]. Europe grew 8.8% year-over-year in constant currency, reflecting weakness in the UK from macroeconomic uncertainty. In Continental Europe, we saw strength in Life Sciences driven in part by our Zenith acquisition. While a few of our larger banking relationships in Europe remained under pressure, we did see good growth in several of our newer logos including the partnership with three Finnish financial institutions.The Rest of World grew 11.1% year-over-year in constant currency driven by strong growth in products and resources, insurance and CMT that was partially offset by softness in banking driven by the weakness with several of our large clients. Over the coming years, there is significant opportunity to gain further market share within Europe as well as the Rest of World and we intend to increase investments in these markets in the coming quarters.Turning to margins. Our GAAP operating margins and diluted EPS were 15.7% and $0.90 respectfully. Adjusted operating margin, which excludes realignment charges was 17.3% and our adjusted diluted EPS was $1.08 in the third quarter. While up by 120 basis points from Q2, our adjusted operating margin was down 120 basis points year-over-year below our expectations, primarily due to employee compensations and benefit costs, outpacing revenue growth and the ongoing dispute with the large healthcare client, which negatively impacted operating margins by 40 basis points.These headwinds were partially offset by the impact of lower incentive-based compensation and cost savings realized as a result of the targeted actions at the senior levels of our pyramid to simplify our org structure that we took in Q2 and Q3. The cumulative savings from actions taken in Q2 and Q3 are now expected to result in annualized savings of over $100 million with approximately $50 million realized in 2019. However, we have more work to do to rightsize our cost structure and are not satisfied with the amount of cost reduction achieved in the quarter as we did not achieve our full potential around pricing levers, aligning bill rates with promotions and pyramid optimization.Also, we experienced a longer than previously anticipated timeline to align revenue and headcount growth as we continue to hire and rescale our workforce to be better positioned to capture digital demand in the market. Attracting and retaining our talent is a key factor to our long-term success. While reduction of our attrition rate currently running at 24% annualized remains a long-term goal, we do expect this rate to remain elevated for the next few quarters as we undergo this transformation.Turning to our balance sheet. Our cash and short-term investment balance as of September 30 stood at $3.1 billion, up approximately $75 million from June 30, but down $1.4 billion from December 31, reflecting the over $2 billion of share repurchases completed year-to-date and approximately $380 million deployed on acquisitions. As a reminder, our short-term investment balance includes restricted short-term investments of $419 million related to the ongoing dispute with the India Income Tax department.We generated $620 million of free cash flow in the quarter, DSO of 78 days was down slightly sequentially, but up 2 days year-over-year, which negatively impacted free cash flow by approximately $100 million. This was primarily due to the customer dispute I referenced earlier. Our outstanding debt balance was $747 million at the end of the quarter and there was no outstanding balance on the revolver.During the third quarter, we opportunistically repurchased approximately 3.6 million shares for approximately $219 million and our diluted share count decreased to 251 million shares for the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we have repurchased over 31 million shares for approximately $2 billion. As of September 30, we have $519 million remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization. Through our cash generated from operations, remaining cash on the balance sheet and our revolving credit facility, we continue to have access to plenty of liquidity to fund both our existing capital return program as well as future acquisitions.Before I turn to guidance, let me provide an update on the outcomes of our transformation office including the 2020 Fit for Growth plan that we announced this afternoon as well as the content work that we intend to exit. As Brian highlighted, we are moving rapidly to implement the key initiatives identified by the transformation office, aimed at accelerating our revenue growth. Our 2020 Fit for Growth plan is expected to run for two years. This program is designed to simplify the way we work, reduce our cost structure and fund investments in the business, which will enable growth.As part of this plan, we expect to remove 10,000 to 12,000 mid-to-senior level associates from their current roles. We will make every effort to identify productive roles based on client demand and our model assumes that approximately 5,000 associates will have the opportunity to reskill for new sales or delivery roles within the company. We expect the remaining 5,000 to 7,000 associates to exit the company by mid-2020 either through attrition or role elimination.As Brian said, anytime we make decisions that impact our employees, we take it very seriously. We believe these actions are critical for the long-term health and competitiveness of the company. We expect the charges will also include charges related to optimizing our real estate portfolio. These actions are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2020 and will result in annualized gross run rate savings of $500 million to $550 million in year 2021.While we will begin the execution of the plan in Q4, we do not expect a material savings impact in the fourth quarter. These cost reduction activities will be occurring at the same time that we accelerate investments in sales resources, branding, talent, reskilling and lean and automation enhancements across the company and further investments in our four key digital battlegrounds, including M&A. These actions are an important step to building a strong foundation to support our future growth ambitions and success in our chosen digital battlegrounds. Our commitment to all associates during this time of transition is to ensure that we preserve the qualities, value and culture that make Cognizant a great company for employees and clients alike.Additionally, as Brian mentioned, we have determined that certain content work within our digital operations practice is not in line with our long-term strategic vision for the company and we intend to exit this work over the course of the next one to two years. This transition is expected to impact approximately 6,000 associates around the world. In addition to continuing to meet our contractual obligations during this period, we will ensure that our associates are treated fairly and with the respect that they deserve.In the months ahead, we will work with our partners to explore ways to transition to work and role to alternative vendors. And we'll provide impacted associates with a number of transition assistance programs including retention bonuses, severance packages and the opportunity to participate in various reskilling programs.While the exact timing for the completion of this transition is uncertain, we do expect there to be a small impact to revenue within the CMT practice in the fourth quarter. And as a result of this decision, we estimate that we may lose revenues of between $240 million to $270 million on an annualized basis within our Communications, Media and Technology segment.We anticipate revenues will ramp down over the next one to two years. And therefore the impact on 2020 revenues may be lower than the expected annualized run rate. This is expected to be modestly dilutive to our adjusted operating margin subject to the timing of the ramp down and other factors. We expect to incur a wind down charge related to the transition of these associates and any related assets such as real estate and equipment.The total expected charges associated with this Fit for Growth cost transformation plan including the wind down of certain content work is expected to be in the range of approximately $150 million to $200 million. We will provide a more detailed update regarding the phasing of the impact when we provide our 2020 guidance on our Q4 call.I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q4 and the full year 2019. For the full year 2019, we expect revenue to grow in the range of 4.6% to 4.9% year-over-year to $16.75 billion to $16.9 billion in constant currency. Based on current exchange rates, this translates to growth of in the range of 3.5% to 3.8% to $16.7 billion to $16.74 billion on a reported basis, reflecting our assumption of a negative 110 basis points for foreign exchange for the full year.This guidance continues to reflect the muted outlook for banking and healthcare. This implies fourth quarter revenue growth in the range of 2.1% to 3.1% year-over-year to $4.21 billion to $4.25 billion in constant currency. Based on current exchange rates, this translates to growth in the range of 1.7% to 2.7% year-over-year to $4.2 billion to $4.24 billion on a reported basis, reflecting our assumption of a negative 40 basis points for foreign exchange in the fourth quarter. This outlook reflects our expectation for slower organic revenue growth in Q4 as a result of a more cautious macro outlook in the UK and continued headwinds in financial services and healthcare and the impact of exiting certain content work.For the full year 2019, we now expect adjusted operating margins to be between 16.5% and 17%, reflecting Q3 actuals and the longer than previously anticipated timeline to normalize the revenue growth and headcount trajectory and additional cost from recent acquisitions. We expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.95 to $3.98. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 560 million shares and a tax rate in the range of 24% to 26%.Guidance provided for adjusted diluted EPS excludes realignment charges, charges under our 2020 Fit for Growth plan and other unusual items if any, net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, clarification, if any, by the Indian government as to the application of the Supreme Court ruling related to the India defined contribution obligation and the tax effects of the above adjustments.In the context of the Fit for Growth plan we announced today, we are targeting adjusted operating margins in 2020 to be in the range of 16% to 17%. While the cost program outlined today, coupled with annualized savings from Q2 and Q3 will increase margin rates, this increase is being mitigated in the near future by two major things. First, our full year fiscal 2019 margin rate reflects lower incentive compensation payouts given our under performance versus targets. Our goal in 2020 is to perform at plan and therefore have target payouts to be a normalized part of our cost structure in line with company performance. This is a margin rate headwind of 120 basis points year-over-year that we plan to absorb.We are investing meaningfully in a number of areas including revenue-generating resources, Cognizant Academy, tooling and automation and marketing and branding. These important investments will help us accelerate growth rates. However, in the short-term, they negatively impact margins by approximately 150 basis points.With that, we can open the call for questions. Operator?Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. -- Hi, good afternoon. And thanks for going through all this, it's fantastic. Brian, I'd like to double click on one of the investment areas in sales and marketing, clearly one of the most critical areas to reaccelerating top-line growth. You mentioned a few things, the 500 new sales people, the return to the two-in-a-box model, can you provide maybe a more holistic view of the major changes you're planning to make to Cognizant sales strategy and sales coverage and overall go-to-market model? Thank you. -- Yeah. Hi, Lisa. So I'll give you four examples. First of all, it's important to clarify the role of the client partner and returning to two-in-a-box I think really simplifies Cognizant's go-to-market team in front of the customer. So we traditionally used to have a two-in-a-box with the client partner and delivery partner. A few years ago, we moved to three-in-a-box and we're returning to what we traditionally have had with greater clarity of roles and responsibilities therefore between the client partner and the new role that we will term in engagement delivery partner.Second point, we will actually add more headcount in sales or the commercial function than before. I've referenced this in our prior call. We were adding approximately 500 headcounts. Not all of those are quota-carrying, but some for instance will be business finance people, R&D commercial lawyers, but it's all with a view to helping us show up to more clients and have greater agility and put the clients in greater responsiveness.The third major thing relates to how we want to compensate our commercial teams. As of January 1, we will move to a more leveraged sales compensation plan with at least 70% of the base fixed or at most and then 30% variable. And within this variable portion of their compensation there will be strict parameters in terms of what they are required to sell. That will enable us to ensure that people do not follow the path of least resistance, which is what they sold yesterday, but more readily embrace the things that we need them to sell, which is part of our digital strategy.And then the fourth thing, we will deploy something we spent a lot of time working on the last four months, what I call a RAD model. That is a term to address how you think about sales segmentation in the purest form, how you tier your customers, Tier 1, 2 and 3 based not just on what you sell them today, but more readily on what you have the potential to sell them on. So potential versus current. And then you tier customers between an existing customer or that you want to retain or potentially develop subject to your share of wallet or a customer that you want to acquire. And according to where a customer sits in that line box and the degree of sales coverage that they get or visits from somebody like myself, changes. So those are four examples of what we're doing to try to ramp our commercial momentum.Obviously in addition to that, I've talked previously about greater alignment with strategic partners. I referenced in today's script the notion of going to market more readily with hyperscale players. We have some tremendous partners and industry verticals like Temenos, Guidewire and there will be -- and the like that we want to embrace further and make sure we go-to-market with together.Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. -- Hi, good evening. Thank you for all the detail. Could you flush out a little bit more of the commentary around, it sounded like an inability to get pricing. And it is -- is that going to take time for the sales organization to get going and the workforce to be re sort of calibrated here. I mean when do you think you can get those -- start to get some of the pricing for the value that you're hoping to give? -- It's inherently a complex topic because we have a series of activities that we have from time and material, staff augmentation through to managed services are more fixed price type bids, but let me decompose your question down and Karen perhaps you can comment as well on this.With regards to the sales team, their ability to ramp ultimately also depends on where they come from before and if you know the client itself or if they know the industry. Our intent is of course to hire people who were able to sell business outcomes, who have the gravitas and the wherewithal to speak with the C-suites, understand the industry pain points and seller business outcome. So you need to expect nonetheless however, as we deploy these sales people in for the clients, they build relationships, subsequently build a pipeline that pipeline is ultimately progress and eventually turns into TCB which later turns into revenue.It's for that reason that we've spoken previously around the impact of these 500 headcount that we've agreed to hire is more a negative impact in terms of our cost structure in the short-term. However, I don't view it as a cost, I view it as a investment that will have an appropriate return over time in the form of sales force gearing. So opex to gross margin dollars are indeed opex to revenue dollars and we are anticipating the revenue return from that to really kick in more in Q4 next year or indeed the first half of FY21.Look, the pricing dynamics are important, Karen can comment on those, I just wanted to add one point. If the client partner is the quarterback on a deal, they need to be surrounded with world class experts that are aligned with key practices and have competencies in those areas whether that is artificial intelligence or analytics or digital engineering or cloud or otherwise. We spent a great deal of time in recent months honing in on a model that we think will give us greater competency and greater technical capability to support a general of client partner in front of the client. We do want to allocate more pricing power back to the client partner, but they will have to operate within certain bounds or parameters as the deals or pricing on a quarterly basis. We will review those, but it will be some notions of checks and balances. -- Sure. And so, Ed, let me talk about a couple of things in pricing. One is what I would call market bill rates and pricing for new deals and renewals and so forth. As we look at the digital business, pricing continues to be very strong there. Obviously, you have high demand in that business and the short supply of talent. So by definition bill rates continue to be strong there. Where you do continue to see pressure on deals and particularly with renewals and vendor consolidations and so forth is in the core part of the business, the heritage, application, maintenance, etc part of the business where we do continue to see pricing pressure on those transactions.The other piece which we were referring to in the script is also around what I would call contract hygiene. So the ability to get colo increases, to get rolling changes when we promote people, as you know, for several years that was something that just was not commonly done in the industry and it's something that many firms have started to reinitiate into their portfolio over the last few years. We've made some progress this year where we have automated colo adjustments and so forth, but I think we still have a lot of opportunity to continue to get better at that and enforcing contract terms. And in particular when we promote people to either rotate them into new opportunities that are appropriate for their new level or to get rate adjustments within their existing clients. So both of those are opportunities that we continue to see as we move forward.Thank you. The next question is from Tien-Huang with JP Morgan. -- Hi. Thanks so much. I appreciate all the detail here. I just wanted to get your thoughts on the cost, the soft cost, the hard cost to attaining the $500 million to $550 million in savings from Fit for Growth. How much disruption might there be on both culture and then also on the revenues aside from the 250 that you called out from from getting out of the content work? -- I would say the majority of the people we are targeting through this exercise are senior-to-mid level executives. They tend to be not the client partners or in front of clients, but some degree of middle management that has crept into the system over the years. Of course, we are spending a huge amount of time bringing our team through these changes and making sure that they are contextualize and that people know we're investing in growth.To be honest, Tien, I feel as though there is a degree of swagger coming back in Cognizant these days. Client partners in my opinion will be delighted with the news today that we're returning to a two-in-a-box model. And they do appreciate the fact that we're spending hundreds of millions of dollars to reinvest back into the business including more coverage and giving the sales folks and opportunity to earn more than ever before via having a more leveraged sales compensation plan.Of course that is not for everybody and there will be some degree of disruption, but we aim to mitigate that as best we can. And as I said, not only are we adding more people in deploying segmentation, but we're also honing in on optimization of skills via a competency model that will be measured on a more thorough basis going forward. So look, it's very hard to control. This is a people business. We're spending a huge amount of time communicating, contextualizing, but we feel it's the right thing to do.Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Keith Bachman at Bachman [Phonetic]. Please proceed with your question. -- Hi. Thanks very much. I wanted to ask a clarification on the question. Karen, the clarification, just to be clear on the content ops is whatever we think the normalized run rate for Cognizant in 2020, we should go ahead and take an additional amount out from our revenue expectations of, I don't know $150 million or something as we assume that content gets at least partially taken out next year. And then my question is directed to Brian. Brian, you talked about swagger in the last comment and on the last conference call, I think you said win rates had gone up. But it was hoping you could just talk a little bit about what you see is the economic backdrop, a number of companies, the IT services side have called out some incremental weakness, but juxtapose that against what you've seen in your time there, I think frankly putting a lot more initiative into the sales side. If you could talk about a little bit about your win rates and how those might balance out? Thanks very much. -- So Keith, it's Karen. Let me just cover off on the content situation first. You're right. As you think about the model for next year, it is appropriate to take some portion of our estimate of the 240 to 270. As we said, it will not -- we don't expect it at this point to all go away at the beginning of the year. We think that will phase in throughout the year, although I would say it would be more heavily weighted to the first part of the year.Also the other thing I would also like to point out with that range is that it does assume that in certain of the client situations that they may exit more than just the specific digital operations work and that they may choose to transition more work. So this is our best estimate at this time of what you think the annualized impact would be. And obviously we will provide as much color as we can as we understand further the transition plans. -- And Keith, with regards to the second question, yeah, it of course didn't go unnoticed with us as well. But we're delighted to have beaten consensus and indeed our guidance for this quarter, but bear in mind we had set guidance prudently. And we're also walking into the coming quarter having read the dynamics in the industry, so we remained somewhat I would say prudent going into this quarter as well. The backdrop is uncertain. However, I would say, if I look at the micro element within Cognizant, first of all, growth is permeating the company, we're going back to our roots, back to basics and I think people are actually delighted with that.We found depreciation of focusing on growth as opposed to margin rate . And we have very deliberately insisted on a significant uptick in executive presence with customers, I'm leading by example myself and that permeates the organization as well. And then of course, Karen and I have been working on what we announced to date for a number of months now. And so, we've been trying to start looking at deals, not with today's cost structure, but envisaging the economic value of deals over time with tomorrow's cost structure, which as you know we're aiming to reduce.We know in Cognizant that once we get our foot in the door with clients because we have confidence in our teams and confidence in our delivery, we tend to land and expand. And hence, that's also the reason we're deploying the RAD model going forward to make sure we accelerate new logos and cross-sell and up-sell.So those are the positives. But again, the backdrop is uncertain, certainly in the UK, it's uncertain. I would say in North America, what we found is there is continued compression in legacy businesses and pricing pressure on renewals continues at a steady rate, but the digital imperatives remain key. And I've been pleasantly surprised as I've dealt with C-suite executives throughout the world that digital is certainly not viewed as a cost center expense, it is very much viewed as a a critical enabler both on the defense as well as on the offense for these companies to disrupt or indeed to avoid being disrupted by more nimble next generation companies. And that is an area where on the contrary I do not see demand constraints, I see more supply constraints given the nature of the teams we need to fulfill those demands.Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citigroup. -- Hi, Brian. Hi Karen. It's good to see the velocity on fiscal growth initiatives. I want to start by asking if you could provide maybe a framework for how investors should think of the trajectory of growth over the next couple of years as these initiatives unfold, I mean will we see perhaps a flattish type pace before higher growth kicks in and that's I guess including the impact of the CMT, the content-ups? And then in the meantime, what are your thoughts in providing metrics to the investor community that help us that you are on the right track? -- So Ashwin, in terms of growth, I think obviously it's early to give guidance for next year, although certainly we would expect that we will start to see some acceleration versus constant currency organic growth this year. Q4 is obviously a little bit light and Q1 does tend to be a slower quarter for us. So when we gave guidance in February, we'll have a little bit more color on how we see the rest of the year playing out.In terms of incremental revenue from the sales hires and so forth, we, I think as we had talked about this before, we do not anticipate any significant revenue next year from that investment. It really takes about 12 months for sales teams to ramp up and actually generate revenue that becomes incremental to us. So I think that would be more back-ended and certainly into 2021. And now all of that obviously excludes the impact of the content moderate -- content work in the digital operations practice, but excluding that, that's how we would expect it to play out.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. -- Thanks. On the $500 million to $550 million of gross annualized savings, what's the net savings there, because it sounds like there is a drag from investments on adjusted operating margins in fiscal year 2020, but can we expect a positive impact to margins thereafter in fiscal year 2021. I'm just wondering if there might be some one-time investments in fiscal year 2020 that go away so that fiscal 2021 and beyond we'll see some net drop to the bottom line? Thanks. -- Yeah. So I think obviously, Bryan as you said and as you heard on the call, we were assuming a target range of 16% to 17% next year, roughly in line with 2019. As we talked about on the call, there is about 120 basis points that we have to make up given the lower incentive-based compensation this year and then on top of that the investments in sales and training and so forth. I think it's premature obviously to give guidance beyond 2020, but certainly we think the investments we'll make in sales will start to pay off in 2021. I would anticipate that certainly the investments that we're making in branding and training and reskilling and so forth, those will continue on for quite some time.I think -- we think that perhaps those are areas that we've underinvested in recently. And so, those will become part of the core of the organization going forward. But certainly, as you know, this is still a relatively linear business. So as we look to accelerate revenue growth in the future that should certainly help to stabilize and provide some margin opportunity dependent year-to-year on the investments that we want to make in the business.Our next question is from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity. -- Hey guys. Hey a lot of work done here in seven months. If I go back over Cognizant's history, it's had a distinctive ability to mine its large clients for additional revenues. Clearly that client mining performance has slowed in recent years. And so, my question here is whether you're seeing ways to rejuvenate Cognizant's client mining ability? Are there corrective measures being made or new initiatives specifically on the front for client mining? The RAD model makes a kind of sense here, but I'm also wondering if there are practical changes beyond the RAD model to better connect with the large clients? -- Yeah. So, hi Rod. It's a good question. And look, if I look back over the last four years and the data will tell you that we have been growing new logos, but not really accelerating new logo revenue and really the pipeline and the TCV in the last 18 months or so stopped this year performing where we needed it to be. But the bigger issue was to your point, the installed base accounts and we had stopped mining or upselling it on the contrary because of pricing erosion at the time of renewals that became a little bit of a drag in the business.So very much of the core of the RAD model is of course, tiering customers based on potential not based on where we are today. And of course segmenting customers then between acquisition customers versus a customer that you already exist in that you want to develop or were you already exist that you're simply trying to retain.So the RAD model is key to achieving this. Sales compensation is also key because in our existing accounts what we want to do is get much more leverage in the sales compensation program and put parameters in the portion of people's compensation such that they are not just entice, but they're also obligated from an earnings point of view to cross-sell the portfolio into digital and beyond as opposed to simply selling what they sold yesterday, which is traditionally been a path of least resistance.And then the third thing of course, as we are thinking about upselling and cross-selling, a lot of that leads to different decision makers. It's more project-based, it's more cloud cultures in digital engineering, it's line of service. So distinctively, changing out some client partners we've done a good job of that in some of the clients I have seen for instance in the last few months, these are client partners that joined Cognizant in the last year or so or 18 months. A different background, a different compensation model, but again, I don't think about the salary of a sales person at the cost, I think about it as an investment. And therefore, I think about it in terms of sales gearing, both on the gross margin level versus opex or indeed on revenue basis versus opex.And then last but not least, we're really trying to segment our own capabilities into a four box, great sellers who understand the industry and understand the technology is in the top right-hand quadrant. You also have a bunch of people who are very confident with technology, but not really sellers, some of those you can migrate across to more commercial skills, some of them will simply remain pre-sales types oriented -- pre-sales oriented people. Some people are frankly grade sellers, but don't really understand the industry well enough or the customer pain points. We obviously have to educate them. And then the people in the bottom left that are the worst of both worlds, not particularly good commercial skills in terms of getting a PO signed with certainly not technical either. Those are two people that most likely you will see exit the company going forward, particularly in the sales comp plan where with a higher variable portion of compensation they will not be earning as much as they have previously.And then one of the final actions we've taken to ensure cross-selling is to put all of the so-called CSEs, these are more specialist sales people, aligned into the practice and service lines to ensure a great deal of focus on competency assessment certifications and indeed alignment with our partners that intersect nonetheless with verticals to make sure we have the right skill sets and indeed the right go-to-market partnerships to do QBRs with more of our partners and make sure we end up with asymmetrical accounts where clients can -- our partners can bring us into their accounts and vice versa we can bring them into ours and leverage the best of both worlds.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen & Company . -- Hi. Thank you. First, I just wanted to clarify on the content ops, is there an opportunity to sell this practice or is this more or so a wind down in transfer? And then within banking and healthcare, can you just give us a sense on these large clients, how close you may be to seeing any inflection and the trajectory there or at what point are they just not among the top clients? -- So I think in banking and healthcare, we have some tremendous examples actually and I've seen some of these myself, accounts that we have really turned around in the last two years through different account teams, much more focused on digital, but that's a blueprint or a codification that we need to bring more broadly across the company. And we will see some inflection points, particularly in healthcare as we get into FY20 because we will be rounding the tougher compares. As you know, many of our healthcare clients, four in particular merged into two and ended up with a very different rate dynamic for Cognizant and we will be running that once we get to Q1 next year.In banking, it's less obvious in a sense there wasn't a single inflection point. There are ongoing trends, some captives, some insourcing, particularly in a world of DevOps. But as I said earlier, well, the legacy business or traditional areas of the business have been under some pressure on price renewals. I do see opportunity for us to better participate in the digital spend that these banks have at their disposal and have been prioritizing and that's what we're setting out to achieve in the coming years of course. So no major inflection point, but I will say, I am pleased with the revised energy I'm seeing in the North America team now in particular and the new banking leader and the new healthcare leader, they seem to be going down well with clients and that's always a good positive leading indicator.With regards to the content moderation business, that's something we're working with our partners on right now to understand how to best transition the work. Whether it is one of the options you referenced or another, we will determine that in the coming periods. For now, we've taken a restructuring charge against it, but our intention is to work very aggressively with partners to make sure that we can transition our employees with minimal disruption. And of course financial consequence of that is of course minimal charges as well. -- Okay. This is Katie. I think with that that will end today's call. Thank you all for your questions. And we look forward to speaking with you next quarter.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- \n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(Symbol: CTSH) saw new options become available today, for the November 1st expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CTSH options chain for the new November 1st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $58.50 strike price has a current bid of 15 cents.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $58.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $58.35 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CTSH, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $64.76/share today.\n\nBecause the $58.50 strike represents an approximate 10% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 86%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 0.26% return on the cash commitment, or 1.87% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., and highlighting in green where the $58.50 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $66.00 strike price has a current bid of 45 cents.  If an investor was to purchase shares of CTSH stock at the current price level of $64.76/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $66.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 2.61% if the stock gets called away at the November 1st expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CTSH shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing CTSH's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $66.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $66.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

In a world in which cloud computing, data analytics, and other cutting-edge capabilities have become commonplace,  to ensure that companies big and small make the right moves for their IT needs.Coming into Wednesday's second-quarter financial report, Cognizant investors had high hopes for seeing modest revenue growth, but they were ready  to see some downward moves in earnings. Cognizant's results were mixed, but they had enough high points to give shareholders some confidence that the company is making progress toward its long-term strategic goals.Cognizant's second-quarter results had good and bad points. Revenue growth of 3.4% was slower than in the previous quarter, as sales came in at $4.14 billion. That number matched what most people were expecting to see on the top line. Net income of $509 million was higher by 12% from year-earlier levels, but after accounting for some extraordinary items, adjusted earnings of $0.94 per share were down more than 10% over the same period. Even so, the figure was $0.02 per share better than the consensus forecast among investors.Image source: Cognizant.Geographically, Cognizant got more of its sales growth internationally. North American revenue rose just 2.3%, making up about three-quarters of the company's total. In Europe, revenue grew 8.6%, as double-digit percentage sales gains in the Continental Europe region were able to overcome slower growth of just 4.2% in the U.K. market. Cognizant's rest of world segment saw gains of just 1.6%, but it made up only around 6% of total revenue.As we've seen a lot recently,  in terms of sales growth. Financial services revenue grew only 0.3%, and healthcare sales actually fell 1.9% from year-ago levels. By contrast, both the products and resources segment and the communications, media & technology division posted double-digit percentage sales gains.Cognizant's explanations for its results shed some light on the numbers. In financial services, a partnership with three financial institutions in Finland helped offset weaker performance from large banking and insurance clients. Healthcare industry consolidation hurt the IT consultant's results in that segment, but large enterprise deals in the life sciences arena offset some of the declines elsewhere. Demand for cloud and digital engineering services drove results at the other two segments.CEO Brian Humphries was succinct in his comments. \"We are taking the necessary steps to position Cognizant for improved commercial and financial performance,\" the CEO said in defending the company's short-term performance.Cognizant has a plan for moving forward. As Humphries described it: \"While there is lots of work ahead, I am encouraged by what I have seen to date and am optimistic on our future.\" CFO Karen McLoughlin gave more color on the operational side, saying that Cognizant is \"implementing actions in the second half of the year that we expect will lower our existing cost structure and allow for greater investment in growth, talent, and digital solutions.\"Cognizant made some minor adjustments to its full-year guidance. On the sales front, the IT consultant now sees revenue climbing 3.9% to 4.9%, representing roughly equal narrowing of its previous range of 3.6% to 5.1% growth. Adjusted earnings should come in between $3.92 and $3.98 per share, which is an increase of about $0.03 to $0.05 from its earlier projection. Third-quarter revenue gains should be consistent with the full-year numbers, expected to come in up 3.8% to 4.8%.Cognizant shareholders were reasonably pleased about the results, and the stock picked up almost 4% in after-hours trading following the announcement. Even if Cognizant's banking customers continue to pull back from their previous levels of activity, the IT consultant has done a good job of tapping other opportunities across multiple industry groups to sustain its growth and profitability.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Please go ahead. -- Thank you, Jeremy and good afternoon everyone. By now you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the Company's Second Quarter 2019 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Brian Humphries, Chief Executive Officer and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer.Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the Company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC. Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures, can be found in the Company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Brian Humphries. Please go ahead, Brian. -- Thank you, Katie, and good afternoon everybody and thanks for joining. Earlier today we announced results for our second quarter. Q2 revenue grew 4.7% year-over-year and constant currency to 4.14 billion and non-GAAP EPS was $0.94. While we are pleased that we met our revenue and margin guidance, we are not satisfied with this level of performance. Our second quarter results do not reflect where Cognizant is capable of achieving in this market environment, neither on revenue growth nor margin rate. What we said about correcting these trends, I'm convinced that a large part of what we need to do is in our own control. Softness in banking and financial Services which was up 1.7% year-over-year in constant currency and healthcare which was down 1.5% in constant currency impacted second quarter revenue growth. While certain market dynamics have impacted our results. I believe that much of our weakness in banking and in the non-life sciences portion of healthcare is attributable to Cognizant specific issues.By interacting with clients in both industries underline that they are committed to investing in innovation to help increase their competitiveness and growth. Specific to our banking practice we've recently implemented a new operating model which includes a team solely focused on new locus. The team dedicated to the platinum accounts which are a subset of our largest global clients and the banking practice and solutions team to ensure we develop more compelling thought leadership and better align the key partners.In Healthcare, factors such as an in-sourcing at a large healthcare payer clients and the spending pullback by clients that are in the midst of merger integration impacted our performance in the quarter. Fundamental market changes reshaping healthcare requiring our clients to do more with less and get ahead of regulatory compliance and complexity while dealing with cyber threats and privacy concerns.We have a market leading position in healthcare and a position of considerable strength upon which to build. I believe industry specialization will be more important than ever with the shift to digital and hence expect to be spending a great deal of time with our healthcare business in clients to ensure we turn around this prized asset.Over the past three months, we've changed that the leaders of both banking and healthcare to get a fresh perspective, new energy and even greater customer focus. On a positive note, we delivered double-digit growth in products and resources and in communications media and technology and continue to be pleased with our momentum in international markets, our global growth markets region which encompasses our non-North America operations surpassed the $1 billion run rate for the first time in our history. We intend to invest in our international business which should continue to be a growth driver for Cognizant.Later in the call Karen turn who will take you through the details of the quarter including segment commentary. As you know, I assume the role of CEO in April 1st. Since then, I have significantly deepen my knowledge of the company was reviewing the market opportunity, structure and competitive dynamics. Over the last 18 weeks I've met with more than 100 clients and partners across three continents and conducted over 60 deep dive strategic and operational reviews of the Company. I've actively solicit declined input on our strategy and the strength of our commercial and delivery teams.I've also spend a great deal of time considering customer needs and buying behavior, our brand position, our business strategy, the effectiveness of our organizational structure, our operating discipline, our portfolio of solutions and indeed our talent and culture. It is clear to me that Cognizant has a proud heritage significant customer loyalty, a broad portfolio of offerings and engaged and talented associates throughout the world. However, we can position ourselves better to participate in the market opportunity and this work includes refining our strategic posture and associated enablers to ensure we better participate in the categories that are most relevant to our clients' needs developing greater thought leadership and an innovation agenda by industry vertical accelerating investments in revenue growth including increased sales and marketing, targeted innovation and enhanced partnerships. Significantly lowering our cost structure to facilitate these investments in growth and to ensure we are more cost competitive in deals and ensuring greater operational discipline and a more performance-based culture to make certain, we execute with rigor and focus.Our path to accelerated growth starts with customers, the lifeblood of every company. It's important that we ready ourselves to address the pricing demands of customers in our traditional areas of strength while readying ourselves also for the changing dynamics in digital. Given advances in technology, customers regardless of their industry verticals are faced with an unprecedented pace of change in risk of disruption. Against this backdrop, they are focused on modernizing their environments, extracting value from data, better understanding their own customers and accelerating innovation in cloud migration to increase their competitiveness, security and agility.As investments are shifted to digital, budgets in the legacy pressured with increased focus on cost reduction during renewals. Given our traditional business mix, Cognizant has been exposed to this headwinds. We partially offset this peer through mid management automation and other delivery efficiency levers. In addition, given our strong customer NPS, we have often been able to provide incremental savings to clients by consolidating to work of other vendor, while these strategies may be affected in the short term, we need to significantly accelerate our shift to digital as we consider our intermediate and longer-term future.The pivot to digital requires us to rethink many aspects of our company, including our brands, skills, processes, systems and tools, client engagements will become more project oriented, meaning more contracts with lower TCV, our account teams will need to build relationships with a broader C-suite as budget owners, decision makers and influencers extend well beyond the CIO. We will need more consultative selling skills, more digital talent, more targeted sales compensation programs and more intellectual property and thought leadership aligned by industry vertical.Delivery will be increasing the agile with near and onshore delivery complementing offshore centers. The skills of our associates and our leadership team must further evolve. This is a multi-year transition that is essential to our future. Against this backdrop, customers are choosing their strategic partners. So as we more readily embrace digital, we must ensure our client facing resources under branding represent our strategic ambition.Meanwhile, we need to be even more deliberate and our solution portfolio which includes increasing our investments in areas that provide the greatest value to clients while generating the best return for Cognizant. This requires a rigorous capital framework to accelerate our position in emerging categories while reducing our cost structure mature and declining categories.We have a strong foundation to build from in some of the growth categories. One such example and one I am extremely excited about is digital engineering, this is a large attractive market with 20% plus growth rates. To accelerate our position in this market, we've recently decided to combine Cognizant's digital engineering capabilities with Cognizant Softvision. Until now, our assets have been distributed across Cognizant and our structure and operating model, have been fragmented and inconsistent. This combined practice with over 11,000 associates and revenue of approximately 800 million will provide a powerful combination of software, product development and application modernization services to clients across the globe. I believe that our focus efforts will ensure greater brand recognition in this important category and allow us to do more meaningfully participate in the market opportunity. Our increased focus on digital engineering reflects the market opportunity before us and the growing needs from our clients to achieve top line growth, improve customer engagement through superior experience and boost productivity at an accelerated pace.With this combined practice, we will bring together current and emerging technologies scale cross-functional teams and innovate talent and delivery methods into a single product-centric operating model. We are building the digital culture into operating model that influences how our clients can see, design, engineer and ship digital products at speed. At the same time, we are leveraging decades of experience and expertise in a client's technology stack to produce a cloud ready architecture. We will finalize our strategic positioning in the coming weeks however as we enable our customers to disrupt and innovate via modern scalable, agile, data enabled and future proof architectures, it is clear that we should further accelerate our investments in digital engineering cloud and IoT. And we must strengthen our partnerships with industry leaders to buttress our own capabilities. That being said this is not a strategic overhaul with rather refinement of the strategic positioning, our capital allocation and the enablers critical to execute our strategy.Against this strategic backdrop, we need to determine the necessary steps to be taken to unlock Cognizant's growth potential. For this reason, we have established a transformation office which is charged with reviewing six areas of focus as follows. Strategic choices which include where we want to make strategic bets to better expose us to growth categories. organizational structure, which includes our operating model, our metrics and roles and responsibilities within this. Talent, which includes attracting, developing and retaining talent, our culture, our compensation of structures and our skills. Delivery transformation which includes optimizing our unit cost of delivery across the global delivery model. Sales force transformation which includes compensation plans, customer segmentation, increased partnerships, sales coverage ratios and consultative selling. And finally team for growth which aims to ensure we have the cost structure, processes and tools to facilitate growth. Each work stream is led by a member of our executive committee which is cross-functional in nature and is said against a comprehensive change management and communications framework.We've made significant progress in a short period of time. I'm personally excited about the findings of the transformation office which underlines to me that we can meaningfully change our competitiveness in this market. We've identified opportunities to sharpen our strategic focus, simplify the organization, clarify roles and responsibilities, empower our teams closer to the customer and free up investments in growth by significantly reducing our cost structure. We have more work to do in the weeks ahead, including internal change management and communications to maximize associate engagement. We expect to outline the details of this program including the execution plan and associated restructuring charges on the third quarter .Happy customers be the first line of the income statement. So as we aim to accelerate our revenue growth, I want to lead by example by striving to be in front of customers every single day. I've asked for greater innovation and growth focus from our executives and so I've made some changes in the leadership team. Both external hires and indeed internal promotions. Meanwhile to ensure our senior leaders get closer to our customers and our front-line operations we've initiated a process to optimize our spans and layers. This has the added benefit of speeding up decision making improving communication and reducing cost. Growth also requires investments in sales coverage targeted M&A and a competitive cost structure. Therefore even ahead of the execution of the conclusions of the transformation office, we have moved on a number of things including the acquisition of Zenith Technologies which expands Cognizant's IoT portfolio and extends our life sciences domain expertise by enabling us to become a single source provider of end to end smart factory capabilities a key growth driver in Industry 4.0.The separation of digital systems and technology one of our three service lines from our delivery organization to increase focus on that service lines. The Establishments under one leader of an end to end delivery organization in the dramatically reducing our unit cost of delivery was optimizing delivery KPIs and the approval to hire 500 plus revenue generating associates over the coming quarters, a combination of customer facing and sales support professionals will help us expand existing accounts as we generate new ones.Finally, we need to drive more of a performance culture in our client teams. Therefore, we will overhaul our sales commission plans for the new fiscal year, ensuring we can better attract, retain and reward top performers. The new plant will have a greater mix of variable compensation, ensuring greater meritocracy and better align our overall incentives with the company's strategic direction.The growth mandate is now starting to permeate the entire company informing our big decisions and investments and beginning to reshape the critical behaviors of our employees. As we focus on growth, we have also need some operational and cost structure decisions that Karen will address later in the call. This will help our cost structure in the second half even ahead of the full conclusions of the transformation office. Cognizant is a vast organization brimming with talent in the time of change, we must engage the winning spirit of our 290,000 associates to get back to the basics that resulted in our long record of success.Leaders are key in transitions, for most talented leaders who are at the director level and above, we have recently implemented a retention program to let them know have value there and how committed we are to their continue to create growth with us. Communication is more important than ever right now so in recent months, we've also greatly increased communication to our associates. We've stressed that growth is a number one priority and provide context on which -- and what is needed for us to return to growth. Personally I am spending a lot of time meeting with associates, reminding them of our tremendous assets and great heritage about building on and a substantial market opportunity in front of us.Let me wrap up by saying that I now have a much clearer understanding of the market opportunity which is meaningful and Cognizant's opportunities and challenges against this backdrop. While we've taken some tactical decisions in the last three months on cost and growth, the true potential of Cognizant and the extensive to work to be done on costs and transformation in the quarters ahead is becoming apparent via the transformation office. The opportunity teed up from the output of these work streams gives me reason to be optimistic, I see plenty of opportunities to take cost out of the business. To invest in growth as we improve our working capital, we will spend more time on this in the third quarter .I've covered a lot of grounds so let me quickly underscore the five focal points of our work; refining our strategic posture, developing greater thought leadership and an innovation agenda by industry sector, accelerating investments in growth, significantly lowering our cost structure and ensuring greater operational discipline and a more performance-based culture. Well, there is a lot of work to be done to ensure Cognizant returns to its historical levels of performance, we can assure that you that our team is up for the challenge and looking forward to winning again.With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Karen, who will give you an update on both our operational and financial performance as well as a view on how we see the balance of the year Karen? -- Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon everyone. Second quarter revenue of $4.14 billion was at the high end of our guided range and represented growth of 3.4% year-over-year or 4.7% in constant currency. Digital revenue growth accelerated from previous quarters to the mid 20% range and now contributes approximately 35% of our total revenue.Moving to the industry verticals where overall company performance continues to be impacted by both financial services and healthcare, financial Services growth was up 1.7% in constant currency driven by modest improvement in banking, primarily from the contribution of the previously announced partnership with three Finnish financial institutions to transform and operate a shared core banking platform. In insurance growth continued to be sluggish as delays in decision making impacted the start of new work from projects in the pipeline.We anticipate some improvement in insurance in Q3 with the ramp up of several of these projects. In banking, we continue to see softness at a few of our largest banking clients and a cautious approach to spend with several of our regional banking clients in North America, they were impacted by M&A activity. Consistent with recent trends, two of our top five banking clients continue to show good growth while spend at the other three clients remains under pressure.We anticipate some cautiousness in overall levels of spend in the banking sector in the second half of the year due to weakness in capital markets across banking, M&A activity with US regional banks and weak macro factors.Moving on to Healthcare, which declined 1.5% year-over-year in constant currency. Within our Healthcare vertical the decline with our payer clients was largely the result of several large clients involved in mergers as well as the accelerated movement of some work to a captive at a large client. We continued ramp-down of an account in which we were a subcontractor to a third-party also continued to negatively impact revenue. While the ramp down of the work is largely complete, we expect some continued year-over-year revenue impact in Q3 and a minimal impact in Q4. For our payer client moving work to a captive and those involved in mergers, we expect the second half of the year to stabilize near Q2 levels. We continue to expect that there will be meaningful future revenue opportunity associated with integration work that typically follows a merger.Life Sciences had another quarter of double-digit growth year-over-year. We are seeing good traction for digital operation services managing pharmacovigilance cases globally, large enterprise transformation deals and momentum with our industry specific platforms such as the shared investigator portal for clinical trials. And as Brian mentioned, we closed the acquisition of Zenith Technologies earlier this week. Products and Resources had another strong quarter, showing 12.3% growth year-over-year in constant currency. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit constant currency growth. We saw continued positive momentum in retail where we have low above the company average mix of digital revenue in our largest clients. And we continue to see strength in cloud and digital engineering services and increased demand for interactive IoT and analytics solutions across clients.Our communications media and technology segment had another strong quarter with year-over-year growth of 14.1% in constant currency. Technology saw a double-digit growth driven primarily by our digital content services and solutions. Through our acquisition as Softvision, we are also seeing good traction for digital engineering solutions with our technology clients.Within Communications and Media growth was negatively impacted by spending reductions in a few large clients. As we move into the second half of the year, we expect to see some slowdown in the year-over-year growth rate at the technology vertical as we start the significant ramp-up of the digital operations work with several large clients. We expect this to be partially offset by improvement in communications and media.Now moving onto the geographies. Europe grew 14.2% year-over-year in constant currency. In both the UK and Continental Europe, we saw strength in West Sciences and while a few of our larger banking relationships in Europe remained under pressure we did see good growth from several of our newer logos including the partnership with the three Finnish financial institutions. Additionally, in the UK, we saw strength in products and resources. The rest of the world grew 6.4% year-over-year in constant currency.Results in Asia Pacific, continue to be negatively impacted by the weakness in some of our larger banking clients. We saw a double-digit growth of insurance, manufacturing, logistics and life sciences clients in the region as well as good traction with winning work with a number of new clients.Shifting now to margins. Our GAAP operating margin and diluted EPS were 14.9% and $0.90 respectively. Adjusted operating margin which excludes realignment charges with 16.1% and our adjusted diluted EPS was $0.94 in the quarter. Our adjusted operating margin was in line with our expectations but down approximately 300 basis points year-over-year. While year-over-year head count growth slowed from the prior two quarters, the year-over-year decline in operating margins was primarily due to cost related to headcount growth of 7% outpacing constant currency revenue growth of 4.7% in the quarter. And the impact of contract renegotiations with recently merged healthcare clients which negatively impacted operating margins by 320 basis points and 40 basis points respectively. Revenue and head count in digital operations continues to grow above company average. And we saw slight increase in the onsite mix at senior levels of the organization.This was partially offset by lower incentive and stock-based compensation, the lower segment operating margins in our communications media and technology segment reflects the growth of digital content services and solutions in this segments which generate lower margins and other services in the portfolio.For the remainder of 2019, we expect margins to improve as we align our cost structure with our revenue expectations. While we expect to be in a better position to discuss our longer-term view of margins in the coming quarters, there are several areas that we can and will address in the second half of the year to allow us to reduce costs to reinvest in areas to drive growth including attracting and retaining the best talent and expanding our portfolio of digital solutions.Even ahead of the conclusions of a broader benchmarking exercise, in the second quarter we took targeted actions at the senior levels of our pyramid to simplify our organization structure. These actions are expected to result in$65 million of annualized savings for the approximately half of that to be realized in the remainder of 2019.In Q3 and Q4, we expect to further reduce overall cost through a number of actions, including aligning headcount growth with revenue growth by further slowing the pace of hiring and being thoughtful on where we backfill attrition. Headcount growth on a full year basis well aligned to our full-year constant currency revenue guidance, with greater discipline on capturing improved pricing levers more closely aligning promotions and wage increases with bill rate adjustments, more rigor around redeploying unbilled resources in our accounts, we will continue to optimize our pyramid by adjusting our spans of control. We will have enhanced oversight regarding our use of subcontractors in the balance between subcontractors and full-time associates.We will also have significantly tighter control of areas within SG&A such as disciplined hiring of non-billable resources, further rationalization of our real estate portfolio, tighter control over T&E including significantly reduced travel for internal and other non-client facing meetings, limiting business class travel, relocations, etc.. And only investing in marketing events that will provide an appropriate rate of return. These actions will help fund our continued investment in areas of support revenue growth. Additionally, the shift to higher value services such as digital will continue to support higher margins. From a people and talent perspective, our annualized attrition rate of 23% was up from 19% in Q4 but flat versus the prior year quarter. We continue to focus on our workforce strategy and management such as the announced retention program to recognize and retain our best talent, we expect to incur an additional $48 million of compensation-related cost during the remainder of 2019 for this program.Turning to our balance sheet which remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with $3 billion of cash and short-term investments, down $1.5 billion from December 31, 2018. This decrease is largely due to the $1.8 billion of share repurchases completed year-to-date under our stock repurchase program including over $1 billion of repurchases in the second quarter.As a reminder, our short-term investment balance includes restricted short-term investments of $429 million related to the ongoing dispute with the Indian Income Tax department. We generated 479 million of free cash flow in the quarter. Additionally, we had an uptick of DSO of three days compared to Q2 2018, which negatively impacted free cash flow by $135 million. Approximately half of the DSO increase was due to unbilled receivables related to the billing construct of certain long-term contracts.We believe that we have the opportunity to improve our cash conversion and are initiating a working capital programs that we expect will improve free cash flow by several $100 million in the coming quarters. Our outstanding debt balance was 746 million at the end of the quarter, tere was no outstanding balance on the revolver. During the second quarter we opportunistically repurchased approximately 18.7 million shares for approximately $1 billion and our diluted share count decreased 564 million shares for the quarter.On a year-to-date basis, we have repurchased over 28 million shares for approximately 1.8 billion. We have $738 million remaining under our existing share repurchase authorization Through our cash generated from operations, remaining cash on the balance sheet and our revolving credit facility, we continue to have access expense you have liquidity to fund both capital return and acquisitions.I'd now like to comment on our outlook for Q3 and the full year 2019. For the full year 2019, we expect revenue to grow in the range of 3.9% to 4.9% year-over-year or $16.75 billion to $16.9 billion dollars in constant currencies. Based on current exchange rates, this translates to growth within the range of 2.8% to 3.8% or $16.57 billion to 16.73 billion reflecting our assumption of a negative 110 basis points for foreign exchange for the full year, compared to an assumption of a negative 90 basis points in our prior guidance. This guidance continues to reflect the muted outlook for banking and healthcare.For the third quarter of 2019, we expect to deliver revenue growth in the range of 3.8% to 4.8% year-over-year or $4.23 billion to $4.27 billion in constant currency. Based on current exchange rates, this translates to growth in the range of 2.9% to 3.9% year-over-year or $4.2 billion to $4.24 billion reflecting our assumption of a negative 90 basis points for foreign exchange for the third quarter. For the full year 2019, we expect adjusted operating margins to be approximately 17%. Based on the actions taken in Q2 and perspective cost alignment actions for the remainder of the year, we anticipate adjusted operating margins of approximately 18% in both Q3 and Q4.We expect to deliver adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.92 to $3.98, an increase from our previous guidance of $3.87 to $3.95. Primarily reflecting a lower share count assumption based on the steps up repurchases completed in the second quarter and the contribution incentives. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately $562 million shares and a tax rate in the range of 24% to 26%. Guidance provided for adjusted diluted EPS excludes realignment charges and other unusual items if any, net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, clarification, if any, by the Indian government and to the application of the Supreme Court ruling related to the India defined contribution obligation and the tax effects of the above adjustments. Our guidance also does not account for the impact from shifts in the regulatory environment including areas such as immigration and tax.With that, we can open the call for questions. Operator?Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. In the interest of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Our first question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your question. -- Hi, thank you for taking the question and welcome again, Brian your first quarter under ownership, so to speak. And my question is going to be directed toward you. Is there is a lot of moving parts, it sounds like both on how we think about all sense of trying to chase revenue as well at the same time trying to balance cost. And so we have your margin targets for the year but just philosophically, how should we be thinking about these two goals of trying to really nurture the revenue line while at the same time trying to ask optimize the cost structure? How should investors be thinking about this over the course of this longer journey? -- Hi, Keith. Well, I mean the first thing I'd say is, I do not believe we are mutually exclusive. But let me start first would revenue and then I'll spend some time on cost. We grew, as you know, 4.7% this quarter in constant currency and within that construct I would say, we had very muted performance in two of our largest segments; banking and financial services, and indeed healthcare which represents 63% of the business, so one of the first things we have to do to get back to a stronger growth performances to actually help turn those businesses around, just a law of numbers becomes meaningful.And on top of that I think we are at this stage now of investing more in growth, changing the dialog internally, prioritizing growth as you've seen, we have approved at this moment in time and I believe over time will add to this number over 500 revenue generating resources or revenue support resources. So the inclination is to get back to what we've always done, which has been to focus on client centricity and revenue growth.Now, cost is of course an strategy is important to revenue growth. First of all, what are strategic postures, how we exposed to faster-growing categories of the market which are both technology categories such as digital engineering or way of working IoT cloud as well as geographic categories and that's why I am pleased to see the continued momentum we have in the global growth markets which is our non-North America region. Cost, however, are important to growth because you need to have a very efficient and disciplined cost base to be able to take pricing in the deals, to be able to absorb the renewals, pricing pressure that we are seeing in our traditional business, as well as being able to invest in the future. I talked in my prepared remarks around the importance of pivoting to digital and the associated parameters of that smaller TCV contracts, more contracts, a different delivery model, etc..We also need to invest in people, in M&A and indeed in the brands to make sure that we are more associated, not just with the area of the business where we are loved by customers, but also with the pivot to digital. Many of these areas, as you know, Keith are constrained assets both M&A targets as well as even just getting digital resources into the company. But I will say I'm four months in at this stage, having interrogated the data for four months and having spent a great deal of time in the transformation office, I see huge opportunity here on revenue growth and indeed on costs. I'm not going to get into a guidance discussion today around next fiscal year or indeed in multi-year view but at this moment in time this from my perspective is something that I only see opportunities to improve our performance from today's performance.Our next question comes from line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. -- Thank you so much. Glad to see a lot of heavy buybacks, well done there. I want to ask actually on gross margins, it looks like it's the lowest level we've seen in some time. What's driving this? I heard the healthcare renegotiation, I'm not sure if that was related there and any comments on pricing contract mix issues execution, that kind of thing and maybe any outlook on gross margin. Thank you. -- Tien-Tsin, it's Karen. It's really two factors. One of which is the healthcare renegotiations, as you talked about, which is about a 40 basis point impact in the fall in gross margin. And then also the fact that head count continue to grow faster than revenue in the quarter. Part of that is our digital operations business which is growing considerably faster than head count and then for a company revenue at this point. Head count grew in line with the revenue growth, digital operations. But you know that does come at typically of lower gross margin than the IT business. But overall head count for the rest of the business to grow faster in revenue and the vast majority of that cost is sitting in gross margin and that is obviously one of the things as we continue to focus on tackling the cost of delivery to the organization we will be looking to optimize in the coming months and quarters.Our next question comes the line of Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question. -- Hi, good afternoon. Thank you. Brian, as you're thinking about your overall strategic plan, can you provide a little bit more color on how -- you believe you guys should be tackling the deterioration in Cognizant's traditional services, meaning shifting away from or reaccelerating or whatever the right answer is, you know hose more traditional legacy pieces of the business, which just as an industry level may be flat or even in structural decline that strikes me, it's one of the trickier aspects things to navigate through here. Thank you. -- Yes. It's a good question because we have strength in our existing customer base. And if you look at greater, we have very strong positions in they are highly concentrated in a set of customers but we need to pivot more to digital. And as we are pivot into digital as I said, there are different characteristics of the deals, of the skill sets we need, of the delivery models, of the buying decision makers, if you will on behalf of the customers and this is an area we definitely want to invest into the excess curve and make sure we are from a capital allocation point of view really prioritizing that.Now, on the more traditional businesses, some of them actually give us a foothold into the new application modernization will go hand in glove. As I said with the digital engineering space as we start thinking about cloud native applications but in a broader sense of the word Lisa on a big believer in drawing hard decisions across your portfolio and trying to understand where you need to be extremelydisciplined from an investment and from a cost structure point of view, in terms of optimizing legacy while investing in the new and those are disciplines we need to obviously continue to drive here in Cognizant as we're investing in some of these newer growth categories that should etc. at CAGR our growth.You have seen in the last quarter we have aggregated all of delivery under one leader, previously delivery was fragmented through a number of leaders in the company. And part of the task of that delivery leader is ultimately to drive a much more aggressive stance in terms of how we think about automation and tooling and put ourselves in a position that we can be what I would term fit for growth in the legacy as well as the broader companies, so optimizing the cost structure in particular for the legacy and freeing up capital to invest in the new categories which should be the growth driver for Cognizant going forward.Our next question comes from the line of Ed Caso from Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. -- Thank you. Welcome. Can you talk a little bit about your capital deployment strategies from this space, obviously deployed a lot of capital for repurchase, where does M&A fit into the equation sort of order of magnitude and is there more share repurchase to be done in the near term? Thank you. -- I will touch upon this and Karen can jump in as well. Look, we saw the opportunity to accelerate share repurchases in the last quarter as an opportunistic situation for us and we took advantage of that and I have no issues continuing to do so if needed. From an M&A point of view, I have rejected some M&A and I have approved some M&A in the last four months. So we will look at that as a meaning to execute our strategy. We are pleased to have acquired Zenith Technologies which closed most recently and obviously we're using M&A as a means to an end. It is not a strategy, it's a means to execute a strategy.Our priority right now is continuing to refine our strategic posture and making sure to the prior question we get our capital allocation correct. But we will look at on M&A as something that we will use to execute our strategy going forward. My emphasis at this moment in time continues to be look in acquisitions that strategically align us to even better our competitive position in the market that we deem most relevant to us going forward. -- And I think it's Karen. Obviously the guidance for the share count does not assume any more buybacks for the rest of the year. As Brian said, we will continue to look at that opportunistically but as you know we have far exceeded our initial expectations for this year in line with this framework. We outlined last year at Investor Day where we said we expect to spend on average 25% of our global free cash flow toward buybacks 25% toward dividends and 25% for acquisitions with the rest going to India at this point. There are no changes to that framework if and when there are, we will obviously update accordingly.Our next question comes from line of Bryan Bergin from Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. -- Hi. Thank you, Brian. Can you give us a sense on, just your view of the time frame or what you think it's going to take for Cognizant to address the company specific issues that you noted in the core verticals there? And then the transformation office work streams, that's already been set up and that's in progress or is this now to come in 3Q and 4Q? -- No. The transformation office was set up probably almost three months ago at this stage to be honest. It consists of six work streams. As I said, each has led by one of our Executive Committee members, each one has a steering committee and indeed the working committee below that. We've been very clear in outlining some positions that I want us to back to an expected outcomes and as part of that and some short-term wins along the way. So we've been also very deliberate, Brian. In terms of the composition of the teams making sure we have people that are cross-functional in nature, people who understand the markets, both in North America and internationally people that understand delivery as well as the market facing commercial teams and I really feel very, very enthused from the outset of the work we've been working extremely hard on that, but it gives me nothing but optimism that there is a huge opportunity for us to free up capital to invest in growth to simplify the organizational structure, clarified roles and responsibilities and ultimately to make us much more successful in the market by accelerating revenue growth and having better solutions for being fair to our clients.So I feel great about that. It is not a new initiative. It's been well under way. And frankly, I'm probably more advance in my thinking in the output of that where I potentially considered I would be three months ago.With regards to banking and healthcare, we've changed that the leaders of both. This will be some heavy lifting if I'm very honest, some of it is because of and Cognizant specific issues that are reflective the market reality of some M&A in Healthcare where we are heavily exposed to four firms that have merged and some of that currently relates to just the need for us to ship faster to digital, have more thought leadership to be even more client-centric and indeed to add more sales coverage and those are things that are under way at the moment both in healthcare and indeed in our financial services practice or banking practice.I should clarify that our business in life sciences is very strong. It continues to grow double-digits. It's one of the areas of our portfolio that I feel best about. We have a strong strategy, a strong leadership team. We know the end to end value chain for customers and therefore M&A is facilitated against that and we are doing a little better insurance than we are in the core banking business and as I said on the call, we've made some structural changes in the banking team to really put dedicated teams behind hunting on new logos behind some of our most strategic accounts that we deem platinum, as well as more broadly, I believe that in the world of digital extra emphasis on thought leadership and innovation agenda is required and then my dealings with clients over the last four months, it has become very apparent that we are very established in the legacy or traditional models but our brand attributes and perhaps our thought leadership isn't where it needs to be on the side of that asset in the digital and that is an area that we need to do better in.If you do look at the competitive market in terms of what has been announced in the last quarter, it's also clear that there is market growth at there in banking, and indeed in healthcare and certainly from a banking point of view, we've seen most of our competitors in financial services and insurance grow from the low to the high-single digits and indeed some even into the double digits.So we have to accelerate quicker, get back on the attack. Make sure we hold our thought leadership and get a team that are constantly in front of clients with a agenda around innovation that helps customers think about how they can accelerate our pivot to digital. I have not seen in any dialog with customers, any macro concern around their desire to spend on innovation invariably the conversations we're very clear if we show up put enough thought leadership and innovation they have budget and of course the pivot we need to make us to ensure we are cost disciplined on the legacy side of our business to ensure that we can absorb those cost demands at the time of renewals while accelerating our investments into the new.Our next question comes from line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Mr Keane your line is live. -- Hi. I wanted to ask about attrition, I thought that it was up a little bit although year-over-year it's pretty similar. Where do you expect attrition to go? Do you expect it to stay elevated or do you expect to come back down? And maybe you can just talk about if you guys have lost any key managers are personnel and just thinking about the morale of the company through all these changes? Thanks. -- Let me start with the broader question around leadership and then Karen can jump in on the attrition question. I mean, to be very clear in a company of 300,000 employees. We will always have leadership changes and it's pretty standard. When you have a new CEO comes on board and we have been fortunate that at the time of my appointment and indeed before that the board secured certain executives to see through a CEO transition and I'm grateful for their ability to actually get us through that first four to six months of my tenure because it's certainly allowed me to time to get deeper into the business and to make sure that I was ready to run forward.My perspective is we needed greater emphasis on our customers, greater energy, fresh perspective and candidly in dealing with clients, typically the question that was asking were how often you've seen our team, the thought leadership we brought to bear and how we stack up versus the competition and also who were some of the best people in the industry that they recognize and value as people when they are dealing with them. So we have made some very deliberate changes. Now, of course, we've also had some other departures and I think that's normal particularly in a company that has had a relatively stable leadership team over the best part of two decades. This is not something I will say that I am overly concerned about the emphasis on growth is permeating through the organization, the people who are touching customers day in and day out typically not the executive team but the client partners and those client partners are really in my mind enthused with the renewed focus on growth after a few years of more focus on margin rate, if you will. Now of course don't get this wrong, I'm not taking this for granted by any means we are paranoid at the first line of the P&L is the customer but from my perspective, this is a very manageable condition, we're going through and we've made some strong internal promotions. The new Head of North America DK has been with Cognizant for over 20 yearsand he is ultimately and focused and has always been focused across multiple verticals on the growth. I'm also pleased of promoted for deep in delivery somebody who has been with Cognizant for 23 years to enable us to get much more focus in terms of optimizing our delivery structures. And we complemented them with some external hires, some executives who used to work at Wipro, Indeed more recently Ganesh Iyer who was the ex-CEO of Mphasis. So my sense is we want to have the the best team we can get our hands on, a team highly motivated, energized moving with the same speed and urgency that I have and absolutely focused on their teams and under customers. -- And so Brian as it relates to the 23% as you said. It is flat year-over-year and as you know there is some seasonality to attrition. So typically after bonuses are paid in March, we do tend to see attrition tick up. Really no changes in terms of the attrition in terms of where it's coming from up and down the pyramid. The only exception being the director plus attrition ticked up a little bit based on the actions that we took in June as part of the realignment program. But that was the only real -- I would say significant change in attrition, both in terms of geography as well as up and down the pyramid. Now I would expect it's going to continue to be lumpy, as we've said for some time now the job market is strong and as well as we look to optimize cost structure for the organization, that one is itself likely to create some churn.Our next question comes from line of Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. -- Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. As you look forward to the next few quarters, it sounds like you expect continued muted trends in financials and maybe some improvement in healthcare as you get to the end of the year. I guess my question is your Q4 guidance sort of implies that things remain muted, a kind of across the board for some time. Is that just a level of conservatism relative to the outlook or do you actually see some some headwinds in other segments that could be potentially offsetting that recovery? -- So, Jim this is Karen. Let me tackle that. So Q3 to Q4 there is actually a decline in bill days of about two days and that will cost about $47 million on a constant currency basis. So from a modeling perspective if you were to take the middle of the range for Q3 and then the middle of the range for the full year guidance that would actually stay on a volume basis that Q4 will be flat with Q3. There will be some puts and takes as we've talked about in our comments, we do expect to see some stabilization of healthcare off of the Q2 number is not on a year-over-year basis it will continue to show challenges but we do expect it to stabilize on a sequential basis going forward.We do expect, as I said a little bit of slowdown in the technology practice just given the tough year-on-year comps as we get back into the back part of the year, But that was in our guidance for this quarter as well as last quarter. So no real change there from that perspective.Our next question comes the line of Joseph Foresi from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question. -- Hi. I wonder if you could talk about your positioning in digital. Do you think your competitive in that business or is there a catch up to be done and I think most importantly, how does one company catch up in digital and close the gap if there is one? Thanks. -- So, this is Brian. I'll start there position in digital -- there are areas that I've been really blown away with and that have really I've left reviews feeling very proud about what we have and feeling as what we definitely have a strong foundation to build from. I talked today about the digital engineering team, I've spent a lot of time with Cognizant's Softvision team. But more broadly within Cognizant we had legacy digital engineering as well as the application modernization efforts that collectively -- it really puts us in a position if you think about 11,000 plus resources with over 800 million of revenue. It puts us in an incredible position to increase our brand recognition and really dramatically change our position in the market vis-a-vis some of the, let's say, currently known meters out there.IoT is a few hundred million dollars for us and we have broad offerings that are aligned by industry vertical and I'd expect us to go accelerate that as part of our strategy. More broadly, there are organic investments we need to make. There will be some inorganic plays, we need to make there too. But as I said, I'm not working on something huge at this moment in time and it will be more tuck-ins aligned to our strategy. And of course behind any organic and indeed inorganic acquisitions, how do you scale digital -- will you need to have a brand, you need to have capabilities and you need to have systems and tools and the sales and marketing engine facilitated. That's why I explicitly called out thats the fact that we are going through pivot which requires us to do some work, it's more project oriented work that's good and bad, you need to sell more projects they have lower TCV but unlike the legacy business, we will not have the same renewal price erosion that we are faced within the legacy.We need to have a set of client partners that are capable of speaking to the right level of the organization that typically will extend well beyond the CIO different decision makers and buyers right from the CMO up to the CFO and indeed the CEO. And indeed know how to speak and how to follow up on what collaterals leave in what use cases to bring in and obviously what industry expertise to bring with them into the conversation, more consultative of selling and with all these practical things that are very often overlooked, but nonetheless critical in my opinion to running a world-class operation things like sales commission plans that need to change and therefore we need to orient more of our commission toward aligning our sales into areas of the -- that are aligned with our strategy.So that is not something we've historically done. It is something we will do going into the new year and indeed the delivery capabilities from an agile delivery point of view becomes relevant as well. I do feel that as we have near on and indeed offshore capabilities, if you think about something like digital engineering, if we are able to take the guild and pod model that we have an extended much from nearshore but indeed off to offshore centers, I believe we will have a huge advantage over some of the other players that you know. So listen, this is an area that I'm pumped about, I'm excited about the possibilities we have, and I've seen a lot of goodness in the operations, we of course now need to accelerate our investments in it and make sure that we take this strategy into execution and rest assured we're very focused on that. -- I think we have one more question.Our final question comes from line of Rod Bourgeois from DeepDive Equity Research. Please proceed with your question. -- All right, thank you. Brian, so I appreciate your candor and admitting that Cognizant's weak growth in banking and healthcare is mostly due to company specific issues. And my question is do you have a point of view at this point on what Cognizant's growth rate would be today if it weren't for these company-specific issues that you're needing to fix? And I guess on a related note, you're making a lot of internal changes now, I'd like your perspective on whether you think these internal changes will cause additional growth disruption in the upcoming months? -- So, Rod. Hi, it's of course hard to extrapolate the implication. But you can do a sliding scale analysis to understand that for every 100 basis points of improvement in healthcare or banking, what is the implied implication on the broader Cognizant story. But given they are 63% of the business, you can clearly understand that these are meaningful ships to our overall numbers in every 160 basis points, 160 or so million of growth is one point of growth for us and every 6 million, a bottom line, it's $0.01 EPS for us.So these are important levers for us to get right. We do have a lot of balls in the air at the moment. And that's why we are very, very deliberate around the transformation office. We have started with people who know the company well. They have been surrounded by management consultants, both internal and indeed external. We have a huge operation cadence behind that and a broad framework of change management, communication and indeed an execution layer that needs to happen and Rod by definition you will always go home at night. I'm wondering if you're going too far, too fast. But I've got to be honest, I have a great sense of urgency. I'm really proud to have this role, I am really proud to have inherited an organization that is, in my mind full of talent and I want to leave them forward then I believe that we are going at the right pace to catch up where we need to catch up and to extend our leadership where we think we're in front. But we're spending a lot of time around operational excellence and rigor and making sure we contextualize these exchanges. It's clear certain employees will be concerned around the amount of work in the hours, in the pace in the decision making. But my belief is that my executive level, I've had a number of executive committee meetings now we have a cadence of two days every month. We've had some really, really constructive meetings where the team are on board and we are making the decisions in my opinion needed at this moment in time to put Cognizant in a position where we can unlock our true potential. -- Right. And with that the concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining, and for your questions.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- \n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

According to a report from management consultant McKinsey Global Institute, AI is expected to add $13 trillion to the global economy by 2030. For that reason, tech-focused growth investors can't ignore developments in AI.With that in mind, we asked three Motley Fool contributors for AI-focused stocks to watch. Read on to find out why  ,  , and   made the cut.Image source: Getty Images.\u00a0This may not be the first company you think of when making a list of potential artificial intelligence investments, but there are at least three reasons investors should pay close attention to what it's doing with AI.First, Amazon's popular Alexa assistant is allowing the company to use AI to learn more about its customers than ever before. Every time Echo smart-speaker users ask Alexa to tell them the weather, play a song, order a pizza, or buy more toothpaste, the company learns just a little bit more about what its users want. And it'll be using that data for years to sell more goods and services on its e-commerce website.But that's not Amazon's only AI strategy. The company has also integrated AI services, like facial recognition and speech and text translation, to its cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is the No. 1 cloud computing platform and Amazon's , all of which means that as AI services become more important to developers, Amazon will likely benefit as AI and cloud computing become further entwined.Finally, the hidden aspect of Amazon's AI strategy comes from how it uses machine learning, a type of artificial intelligence,  what deals to offer, what products to promote, and how much demand a product will have. So the next time you're scrolling through Amazon, and you find the exact product you were looking for, thank AI for that.For these reasons, any investors looking for a stock that is betting big on AI from multiple angles should have Amazon high on their list.Image source: Getty Images. The proliferation of artificial intelligence will require a significant ramp-up in compute and storage functions in short fashion. As a result, cloud computing and companies that provide access solutions will directly benefit from the technology. And this is where Okta comes in: It provides identity management solutions for both internal and third-party applications, giving companies an out-of-the-box solution to control who is on their networks.Okta has found a receptive audience. In the first quarter, the company reported 50% year-over-year revenue growth, of which 94% is highly sticky subscription revenue. The company remains unprofitable under generally accepted accounting principles (). But free cash flow (cash from operations minus capital expenditures and software capitalization) grew to $13.2 million last quarter, up from a $1.6 million loss in the prior year's quarter.More important is how Okta is growing revenue.  the company noted its net dollar retention for the trailing 12-month period was 119%. This is a fancy way of saying it grew revenue from existing customers via upgrades more than it lost via service downgrades and cancellations. That is, once companies have the service, they are more likely to upgrade than to leave. Look for Okta to continue to deepen relationships while adding new customers as AI takes hold. The consulting and outsourcing giant formerly known as the business and technology division of Arthur Andersen is putting an amazing amount of work into AI research. The company is building AI into almost everything it does, from tailor-made app development and customer experience customization to data analytics or inventory management. Accenture is even working up wide-ranging frameworks to guide other companies to use AI technologies in a responsible way.Simply put, AI tools make up the brains of Accenture's consulting services. And this business model has been firing on every cylinder in recent years. It's hard to find another company in the consulting industry that can match its sales and cash flow growth over the last five years. The one head-to-head rival that actually can match Accenture's recent growth spurt is the far smaller consultancy  , which is staring down long-term weakness in its two most important growth sectors.So it's no surprise to see Accenture crushing its closest peers with a 146% share price gain in five years. The company  at the end of June, setting the stage for accelerated sales growth and strong earnings in the fourth quarter. I think we'll see Accenture's AI-powered growth engines finding more traction in the coming years, starting in the next quarterly report. Hence, this would be a good time to open a position in this quietly skyrocketing giant.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

Other than perhaps 's Google or , no company touches as many people or exerts as much influence as Facebook.And it does this with a relatively small number of products:Facebook has been a cultural phenomenon almost from the beginning. So much so that in 2010, writer Aaron Sorkin wrote a drama about the company titled . The film would go on to gross $224.9 million worldwide on a $40 million production budget and win three Oscars (for adapted screenplay, editing, and original score).Oscar-nominated, 2010's \"The Social Network\" dramatizes the story of Facebook.

The abridged version amounts to this: Facebook is by far the most accessible, most trusted source of news in the country, which made it easy for the Buddhist majority to inflame anti-Muslim sentiment, which in turn led to growing genocide of Myanmar's Muslim population.Either as investors or as human beings, it's fair to say we can no longer think of Facebook merely as a profit-making company. Its global footprint makes it the world's first interconnected public square -- and that introduces opportunities to do both good and bad, at scale. Examples of both are easy to find.On the one hand, Facebook is the creator of the Open Compute Project and a pioneer in the business of making data centers more green with its Prineville, Oregon, facility. More than 75% of the energy the company consumes in its quest to connect people around the globe is sourced from renewables, according to . On the other hand, Facebook spent extraordinary amounts of time and capital downplaying , in which the personal data of up to 87 million people was compromised in a sweeping effort to influence the outcome of a U.S. election.Investors take Facebook's privacy practices seriously because poor governance can depress performance and impact returns on invested capital (ROIC).

So in that spirit, we decided to look deeper by evaluating the company using The Motley Fool's . Here's how Facebook stacks up. If this answer feels like hedging, it's for a good reason. For full-time workers, Facebook can be an amazing experience. Glassdoor ranks the company seventh on its  LinkedIn is the only tech-driven company to rank higher, and Google -- a premium employer in its own right -- ranks eighth.Here's how one hardware engineer, a current Facebook employee, describes the  of working at Facebook in a July 2018 Glassdoor review:It's so good that it would be hard to work anywhere else. I'm destroyed for life. If [Facebook] is your first job I would feel bad because this is NOT a true view of the working world. If you're humble enough to appreciate that then you should be ok. I believe people can develop a degree of entitlement and hubris in this environment. You can run into folks like that, but the majority of others are great.Talk about a powerful testament. When your core criticism is that the benefits and work environment are so good that a handful of workers have become spoiled, then you've found a truly great place to spend your weekdays. If only contractors and customers were as lucky.Sadly, they aren't. According to two blockbuster exposes published by  in  and , conditions at the sites employing tens of thousands of contractors who perform content moderation duties for Facebook -- that is, searching for, reviewing, and potentially deleting offensive content -- include abnormally long hours, low pay, and high stress. At least one employee has died on the job, according to . Others suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, from the avalanche of gruesome images of violence and child pornography they're tasked with viewing and removing as quickly as possible.To be fair, these contractors do not work for Facebook but for  . Legally, Facebook doesn't have the same obligation to care for its contractors that it does to care for its full-time workers. And yet these workers are quite literally on the front lines. Without them, Facebook users around the globe would be bombarded with offensive and illegal content. That the company isn't doing more to protect them is both telling and tragic. There's hope for that to change, according to . Arun Chandra, Facebook's vice president of scaled operations, told the publication that he plans to include worker well-being in the equation when evaluating contracting firms such as Cognizant. That's a hopeful promise, but just as customers who were promised their data would be safe have witnessed the fallout from the Cambridge Analytica scandal, I can't score Facebook as \"yes\" on this question until there's proof of better treatment. As it now stands, Facebook is a divided community. Some employees are rich and enjoying the fruits of being associated with a multibillion-dollar global enterprise while contractors struggle to make a living wading through images that could be better handled with artificial intelligence or other means of computerized screening. Evidence of better treatment of contractors -- including a clear implementation of Chandra's contractor scoring system to include worker well-being -- could flip the answer to \"yes.\" While Google deserves credit for being the first major tech company with a data center footprint to invest directly in renewables --  -- Facebook helped usher in the era of green data centers nine years ago. In January 2010, the company publicly committed to opening a reimagined data center, built from the ground up to be energy efficient in ways no one had previously considered. The Prineville, Oregon, facility opened in April 2011 and is still serving users today.Facebook's Prineville, Oregon, data center is one of the centerpieces of a strategy for making data center computing greener and more efficient.

Ranking nine of the \"more innovative facilities that came online in 2011,\" the magazine found that only Prineville ranked under 1.1 for \"power utilization Eefficiency.\" (A facility with a PUE score of one is perfectly efficient and consumes no extra power for lighting, power generation, or cooling.)Data centers have been getting greener in the years since; just look at the work ESG leader   is doing with . Facebook deserves at least some credit for inspiring Microsoft and others to think bigger. Why? The Open Compute Project, which Facebook unveiled around the same time it opened the doors at Prineville. Think of the initiative as what happens when the spirit of shared innovation that embodies the open-source software movement is applied to data center hardware. In this case, Facebook freely published the designs that made Prineville a state-of-the-art facility nine years ago. Today, there are roughly 200 organizations participating in and contributing to the project.For its part,  and says in its sustainability pages that the company ran on 75% renewable power in 2018 and is on track to get to 100% in 2020. Zuckerberg sees it as a priority, writing a withering criticism of the U.S. decision to retreat from the Paris climate accords .\"Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement is bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and it puts our children's future at risk,\" he wrote. \"For our part, [at Facebook] we've committed that every new data center we build will be supported by 100% renewable energy. \"We know from Facebook's years of commitment to better data center computing that Zuckerberg means what he says, and it's reasonable to conclude his company will continue to be an advocate for environmental sustainability. Nine months after joining the company as global chief diversity officer, in June 2014, Maxine Williams published Facebook's diversity figures for the first time. The blog post was striking if predictable: 69% of employees were male and 57% were white. Of those, 85% of technical employees (i.e., developers and hardware engineers, primarily) were male and 53% were white. Those numbers had to change.Williams wrote at the time:Research ... shows that diverse teams are better at solving complex problems and enjoy more dynamic workplaces. So at Facebook we're serious about building a workplace that reflects a broad range of experience, thought, geography, age, background, gender, sexual orientation, language, culture and many other characteristics.Maxine Williams has been Facebook's chief diversity officer since September 2013. Image source: Facebook.Where is Facebook on the diversity spectrum today, five years later? Doing better: 63.1% of the workforce is male versus 39.9% female. More importantly, white staff no longer comprise an overwhelming majority. Instead, white workers now account for 44.2% of all roles and 40% of technical roles. Also of note: 32.6% of senior leadership positions at Facebook are now occupied by women, up from 23% in 2014.That's different from the four executives Facebook profiles at its investor relations site. There, COO Sheryl Sandberg is the only woman, and no people of color are yet represented. Of the members of the eight-person board, three including Sandberg are women, and one of the men -- former  CEO Kenneth Chenault -- is nonwhite.Not surprisingly, Williams believes she and the company as a whole can do better, writing in a blog post about the 2019 survey results:We envision a company where in the next five years, at least 50% of our workforce will be women, people who are Black, Hispanic, Native American, Pacific Islanders, people with two or more ethnicities, people with disabilities, and veterans. In doing this, we aim to double our number of women globally and Black and Hispanic employees in the US. It will be a company that reflects and better serves the people on our platforms, services, and products. It will be a more welcoming community advancing our mission and living up to the responsibility that comes with it.Prioritizing diversity and inclusion requires audacious thinking and the wherewithal to follow through. So far, Williams and her team appear empowered to provide both to a workforce hungry for greater representation.

Rewind to May 2012 and Facebook's landmark initial public offering. Most will remember the feeding frenzy over shares and the extraordinary market value of the company at its debut --  -- or  investors endured over the ensuing 90 days. I remember Zuckerberg's letter and the powerful, hopeful vision he penned about a more connected, more just, more peaceful world:These days I think more and more people want to use services from companies that believe in something beyond simply maximizing profits. Facebook exists to make the world more open and connected, and not just to build a company. We expect everyone at Facebook to focus every day on how to build real value for the world in everything they do.Ethical practices, in other words, were to be central to the Facebook ethos as Zuckerberg foresaw it in 2012. Seven years later, he's leading one of the world's most scandal-plagued enterprises. It's so bad that BuzzFeed published a list of fresh scandals and new controversies for  of 2018. Unfortunately, if you look at history, scandal is business as usual for Facebook.The Cambridge Analytica scandal is arguably the most far-reaching and demonstrative of Facebook's influence and privacy practices. The now-defunct U.K.-based political consulting firm obtained private data on about 87 million Facebook accounts worldwide with the help of an app developed by a Russian-American academic who . The data became part of an orchestrated campaign to influence the outcome of the 2016 U.S. elections.Amid pressure from investigative reports from  and others, on April 4, 2018 , Facebook shared staggering news: 87 million users' private data had been obtained and misused without their consent. Chart source: .Zuckerberg has since testified before U.S. and European lawmakers about Facebook's business practices and what protections it provides to users. His testimony to EU regulators in May 2018 unleashed fervor among both liberal and conservative lawmakers, but it may be Guy Verhofstadt, a Belgian politician and a major voice in liberal EU politics, who best captured what many people -- not just users but also investors -- have been thinking since the Cambridge Analytica story first broke:You have to ask yourself how you will be remembered. As one of the three big internet giants together with Steve Jobs and Bill Gates who have enriched our world and societies, or on the other hand, the genius that created a digital monster that is destroying our democracies and our societies?That this is even a legitimate question -- and it is -- precludes me from considering Facebook an ethical operator in a business that badly needs ethical oversight. Or at least that seems to be the opinion of the Federal Trade Commission. In July, the agency imposed . Too often, it seems Facebook is reluctant to take responsibility for privacy breaches impacting its users. The company is reactive rather than proactive, and sometimes in the worst ways. The FTC fine speaks to this truism. Facebook can and should take the initiative and develop collaborative agreements with governments around the globe to watch for and respond to incursions. I'm not suggesting Facebook give governments access. Rather, I'm suggesting that instead of performing its own internal analysis and then reporting what it wants much later, the company should be working hand in glove with regulators to report on suspicious activity  so there are fewer surprises and more cooperation for protecting citizens who use Facebook's apps and tools. Since the days of its missteps with Beacon, Facebook has been apologizing for its privacy issues and then returning to business as usual. And it's not just Zuckerberg at fault here. In a November 2018 expose,  revealed a series of disturbing decisions management made during the height of the Cambridge Analytica crisis.Two decisions by Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, in particular, beg the question of whether Facebook can ever meet Zuckerberg's original intent of building a customer-first business for the social good.In both instances, Sandberg appears to be taking steps to protect not only her own reputation but also that of the company. Trust is currency for Facebook; the business model doesn't work without it. In attacking those who could undermine that trust, she's playing a justifiable if unseemly form of defense. Knowing this, Zuckerberg in March 2019 wrote  governed by Facebook:Public social networks will continue to be very important in people's lives -- for connecting with everyone you know, discovering new people, ideas and content, and giving people a voice more broadly. People find these valuable every day, and there are still a lot of useful services to build on top of them. But now, with all the ways people also want to interact privately, there's also an opportunity to build a simpler platform that's focused on privacy first.And where are we in the development of a private version of the world's most popular social network? We don't know. Facebook hasn't yet provided a roadmap, and in his post, Zuckerberg conceded it could be a while before a private-focused network goes live.Image Source: Facebook.In the meantime, private messaging service Telegram had more than 200 million users worldwide as of March 2018 and gained 3 million more a year later --  -- when all Facebook messaging services experienced outages around the globe. Such brittle loyalty appears to be due to a long-term, systemic breakdown in trust between Facebook and its users. A good ESG actor wouldn't have let the relationship sour without taking more direct action, and sooner.There's little evidence Facebook has learned its lesson. Recently, the company unveiled plans to , which could go wrong in numerous ways given Facebook's history with handling private data. Imagine, for example, that in signing up, you unknowingly give permission to a third party to post on your News Feed -- including notifications when someone requests to connect to you on the dating app. What happens when an ex reaches out and your current partner sees the notification? And that's just one possibility. Policing usage by minors is certain to be an issue as well. Trusting Facebook with romantic data when it's proven untrustworthy in too many other areas seems like a stretch.It's pretty simple. Zuckerberg can and should make good on a private, subscription-based version of Facebook as soon as possible. When he does, it'll give users the option to choose what experience they most want, which is what every company -- especially a company with ESG ambitions -- should be striving for. In fact, Facebook has one of the strongest balance sheets you'll find. The company has more than  as of this writing. That's a profoundly healthy ratio and more than enough capital to fund Facebook's operations for the next two and a half years . Facebook's growth is inexorably tied to the growth of smartphone and internet usage around the globe, and both should continue to rise. Market research provider Newzoo put total smartphone usage at 3 billion in 2018, rising to 3.8 billion by 2021.In other words, roughly half the world is still getting the basic infrastructure that leads to a Facebook account, getting connected to friends, using messaging, and getting news -- all steps that boost Facebook's revenue and profit profile because they increase the addressable audience to which Facebook can deliver ads. (In its SEC filings, Facebook says that it generates \"substantially all of our revenue from selling advertising placements to marketers.\")Wall Street has reached a similar conclusion. According to financial analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence, Facebook is gearing up to grow earnings by roughly 19.54% annually over the next three to five years. Revenue will at least double over that same period, analysts project. Facebook is a remarkably good cash generator, having more than tripled annual cash from operations between 2015 and the trailing 12 months. Free cash flow has more than doubled over the same period, with the difference due to a sharp  in capital spending in that time. Spending on principal for finance leases, share repurchases, and data center equipment, among other things, seems to be the cause.In the meantime, Facebook's return on invested capital (ROIC) has improved every year from 2015 to 2018 and sits at a heady 30% over the trailing 12 months versus an 8.5% weighted average cost of capital (WACC), . Zuckerberg and Sandberg deserve credit for an impressive record of allocating capital for the benefit of shareholders.Source: New Constructs. Growth has never been a problem for Facebook. Despite its well-publicized privacy issues, the company has grown both its daily active user (DAU) and monthly active user (MAU) count every quarter since Q2 2015 through Q2 2019. Average revenue per user (ARPU) has grown 155.45% over the same period -- from $2.76 to $7.05. Clearly Facebook is finding ways to deliver ads that its customers value.How those ads perform is important, because Facebook has no one else to blame. Like , Facebook is a \"walled garden\" in that you can only develop and spend ad dollars using Facebook's own tools and platform. Third-party tools such as those provided by  aren't capable of plugging into Facebook for programmatically bidding on ad space. In keeping control, Facebook continues to grow fast and produce tens of billions of dollars worth of annual free cash flow. Management has been laser focused on making the most of its ad inventory --  -- and I don't see that changing soon.They're also focused on creating optionality to boost revenue from sources other than ads. Recent add-ons beyond dating include  for selling secondhand items and , a cryptocurrency the company says will serve the 31% of the world's population that remains unbanked. The company's financial strength makes it one of the current era's titans of industry. At the same time, . In an age when \"fake news\" is a verifiably real problem, Facebook is one of the main pushers -- even if it doesn't mean to be. If that sounds harsh, consider that as it's currently structured, Facebook needn't answer to shareholders  the board. Zuckerberg has voting control of the company, and there's virtually no scenario in which he can be forced to make changes that others deem good for shareholders, customers, or the public.Source: Facebook's April 2019 proxy statement.Here's what this chart means:Because Mr. Zuckerberg controls a majority of our outstanding voting power, we are a \"controlled company\" under the corporate governance rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq). Therefore, we are not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent, nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function. We have nevertheless opted to have a majority of our board of directors be independent and to have a compensation & governance committee comprised of independent directors, as more fully described below. In light of our status as a controlled company, our board of directors has determined not to have an independent nominating function and to have the full board of directors be directly responsible for nominating members of our board.Were Facebook actually a state -- and now with its own currency, it's increasingly looking like one -- we'd call it a dictatorship. It's hard to see governments standing aside while Facebook emerges as a global economic superpower.More likely is that regulators will write new laws and enforce old ones to govern how the platform serves people in the years to come. Already, seven U.S. state attorneys general and the attorney general of the District of Columbia are cooperating on an antitrust probe. \"The investigation focuses on Facebook's dominance in the industry and the potential anticompetitive conduct stemming from that dominance,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said . Regulators could seek to seriously curtail the company's business practices or break it up.  Regulation is coming. The only question is whether Facebook will participate in the process or have new laws foisted upon it. Instead of pouring dollars into lobbying -- Facebook has spent more than $31 million on lobbying in the last three years alone -- Zuckerberg and Sandberg could be spending time and effort discussing commonsense ideas for improving how we govern the social web around the world. They've been reluctant witnesses so far.Even though Facebook checks the boxes on six questions in The Motley Fool's ESG Compounder Checklist, the two \"maybe\" answers and two \"no\" answers on critical questions that relate to management choices and the company's ongoing collisions with regulators and failures on public policy issues make the company not a high scorer on our  framework.The good news? Facebook's ESG standing will improve materially if Zuckerberg and Facebook's other leaders make good on promises to bring to market a fully private Facebook experience that's built on a subscription model, giving customers choices in how they use and experience the world's most feature-rich social media platform. Unfortunately, that day may never come -- and I can't see Facebook as an ESG compounder unless it does.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $60.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $59.80 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CTSH, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $63.23/share today.\n\nBecause the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 5% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CTSH shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing CTSH's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $64.50 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $64.50 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

Given how crucial it's become to put the power of cloud computing, data analytics, and information management to work, Cognizant has seen extremely strong growth in recent years, and that's helped it become a .Coming into Thursday's first-quarter financial report, Cognizant investors were prepared to see some pressure on earnings but wanted solid gains in sales. Unfortunately,  indicated that the future might not be as bright for the company as previously expected, and that could create headwinds that will last throughout 2019.Image source: Cognizant.Cognizant's first-quarter results didn't live up to expectations. Revenue climbed just 5% to $4.11 billion, falling short of the $4.17 billion that most of those following the stock wanted to see on the top line. Net income of $441 million plunged 15% from year-ago levels, and the resulting adjusted earnings of $0.91 per share didn't come close to matching the $1.04-per-share consensus forecast among investors.From a geographical standpoint, Cognizant saw relatively uniform performance. North American sales were up 5%, and although Europe saw double-digit percentage gains in local currency terms, the strong dollar limited reported sales increases to just 7.3%. The rest-of-world segment saw flat revenue from year-ago levels, also suffering the impact of currency headwinds.Cognizant's weakness came largely from its biggest business segments. The financial services unit saw an outright drop in segment sales, which fell almost 2%, as soft results from big banking and insurance clients weighed on performance. Healthcare managed a modest gain of almost 4%, but both of those businesses experienced deterioration in their growth rates. Double-digit gains of 11% in products and resources and 17% in the communications/media/technology segment were more encouraging, but they were still 1 to 3 percentage points weaker than their corresponding growth three months ago. gave more color on the poor results. \"Cognizant's growth and performance in the quarter leaves room for improvement,\" Humphries said, as \"while I am encouraged by our client centricity, our employees' winning spirit, and our innovation, we are not yet delivering against the market opportunity.\" The CEO pointed to the need to improve execution in order to restore Cognizant to a healthier growth trajectory.Cognizant is optimistic that it can get its momentum back. CFO Karen McLoughlin highlighted part of the recovery strategy, saying, \"Over the coming quarters, we intend to bring our cost structure closer in line with our revised revenue expectations while continuing to invest in growth, talent, and our portfolio of innovative solutions to speed our pivot to digital.\"Yet at least for now, Cognizant will likely have to deal with a sustained slowdown. In its guidance for the second quarter, the IT consulting company projected sales growth of just 3.9% to 4.9% even after adjusting for currency impacts, with the implication that reported dollar-based numbers could be even weaker.Moreover, McLoughlin noted that Cognizant now expects slower growth in financial services and healthcare for the remainder of the year. That prompted Cognizant to cut its guidance for the full year, with a new range of 3.6% to 5.1% in currency-neutral sales growth comparing unfavorably with past projections for top-line gains of 7% to 9%. Adjusted earnings are now expected to be between $3.87 and $3.95 per share, down from the $4.40 per share the company expected three months ago.Cognizant shareholders didn't like the downgrade, and the stock was down 8% in premarket trading Friday following the late-Thursday announcement. Even though the company has the financial resources and wherewithal to recover from tough conditions, Cognizant will still have to deal more successfully with strong competition in the lucrative IT space for the foreseeable future.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(Operator Instructions) I will now turn the conference over to Katie Royce, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead Ms. Royce. Please go ahead Ms. Royce. -- Thank you, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's first quarter 2019 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website cognizant.com.The speakers we have on today's call are: Brian Humphries, Chief Executive Officer; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.Additionally, during our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for our investors. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures, where appropriate to the corresponding GAAP measures can be found in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC.Before I pass this to Brian, let me address one issue. We understand that there was some inadvertent communication of our release and other materials this afternoon shortly before market closed. Obviously we are going to take a look into what happened here. We simply wanted to let you know that we are aware of the issue and we will undertake a review.With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Brian Humphries. Please go ahead, Brian. -- Well, thank you, Katie and good afternoon, everybody. I'm pleased to join you today on my first  as Cognizant's, CEO. I've long admired Cognizant from my vantage point at other leading technology companies. Since moving into the role five weeks ago, I've been busy getting into the heart of the company's operations. I traveled across three continents to listen directly to our clients and partners. I've conducted more than two dozen deep dives into our industries, lines of service and regions. And I've met with nearly all of our global executive leadership team and talked to hundreds of our associates in person.I can tell you that the initial reasons for my enthusiasm about Cognizant have been strongly confirmed. I'll share some observations later in the call. This is a great company and I'm excited to have the opportunity to lead the company forward.That said, we had a disappointing first quarter performance. We have a lot of work to do to get back to what I believe this company is capable of achieving to seize the market opportunity in front of us.In Q1 our revenue grew 6.8% year-over-year in constant currency to $4.1 billion. This fell short of our guidance and resulted in an earnings shortfall. Our softness in top line growth resulted from a weak performance in Banking and Financial Services which was flat year-over-year in constant currency and slowing growth in Healthcare, excluding the contribution of Bolder Healthcare Solutions.Our revenue performance reflects both external factors including in-sourcing among a few large Financial Services clients and the spending pullback in Healthcare clients that are in the midst of merger integration, as well as Cognizant-specific execution issues that we need to get behind us. Offsetting this weakness in Financial Services and Healthcare, we delivered strong double-digit growth in two of our other major business segments; Products and Resources and Communications, Media and Technology. Later in today's call, I'll let Karen take you through the details of the quarter.Beforehand I want to offer three observations: First, notwithstanding a disappointing Q1 the foundation and capabilities of business are solid and the market opportunity is robust. I've spent enough time reviewing the business and meeting with clients and partners over the last five weeks to know this to be true. I want to stress that our customer centricity is as strong as ever. Having met face to face with hundreds of our associates over the past five weeks, I can attest to their passion for clients, incredible resourcefulness, innovation and desire to win. Their winning spirit derives from decades of commercial success. This kind of spirit is hard to create, but once it becomes the core culture -- cultural attribute as it is in Cognizant, it's also hard to break.Second, we know we can and must do better. We are committed to delivering consistent financial performance that aligns with the expectations that we set and communicate. And third, we also recognize that the first quarter revenue weakness follows a loss of top line momentum over the past 18 to 24 months. One of my top priorities is to act to restore top line momentum. Restoring our momentum goes to a question I've been asked many times by associates and others about revenue versus margin trade-offs. I've long believed that it is possible to achieve solid revenue growth and drive margin expansion simultaneously. I've seen nothing to-date at Cognizant that changes this belief. To do both, we must be fit for growth. And by this, I mean establishing a healthy cost structure that allows us to be cost competitive while enabling us to make investments that create value for our clients.Investments, of course can take many forms including marketing, demand generation, partnerships, reskilling, increased sales coverage or increased spend in platforms tools and automation. I believe cost equals growth. They are not mutually exclusive. Therefore, as we said about reviving top line momentum, we will improve our cost structure as a means to invest in growth and unlock higher levels of performance. One example is our cost of delivery. During my recent trip to India, I saw firsthand how important our delivery teams are to our strategy. Through our customer engagements, our teams in India not only deliver, but also develop solutions and drive customer innovation that bring our digital capabilities to life for clients. This is a prized asset and a valued competitive advantage, but we must also be more efficient to ensure we can accelerate growth.As we set about getting fit for growth, change management, clarity of roles and responsibilities and communication are critical. We will ensure that all of our associates understand the connection between top line momentum and a healthy cost structure and that everyone is clear about our go-forward priorities and their role in making this happen. For example, I want our sales and delivery teams focused on customer acquisition, up-selling and cross-selling within the existing clients, co-creating innovative solutions to customer pain points and maximizing customer satisfaction. Meanwhile Karen and I will focus on ensuring a rigorous approach to non-investment costs, while prioritizing investments related to growth. Once we get the balance right in steady state, I believe we can accelerate growth and deliver margin accretion simultaneously.That aside in the meantime, I'm doing what you would expect a new CEO to do. I will dig into every part of the business to fully understand our strategy, market structures competitive dynamics, client buying behavior, control points and the engagement levels and collaboration of our teams. As I intend to leave no stone unturned, I've already launched a series of work streams to review our growth and margin opportunities. These work streams focus on areas including: our organizational structure, to assess role clarity and decision rights among our verticals regions and lines of service, and to ensure a clear accountability model that drives a culture that is both empowered and performance-oriented.Our sales model, including how we segment customers, align sales coverage and establish sales performance metrics and more leveraged sales commission plans. The must-win battles in our digital strategy as well as the practical matters of ensuring our pivot to digital will be successful via structural leadership and compensation actions. And our delivery model particularly on lowering the cost of delivery through pyramid actions, tooling and automation and optimizing the mix among our delivery locations.Finally and acknowledging people are at the heart of everything, we have work streams focused on our leadership and culture, emphasizing rigorous data-driven talent management, succession planning and leadership attraction and development. While, we're on the topic of leadership an essential part of my role is to ensure we have the right team in place to propel Cognizant forward. Having conducted over two dozen 4 to 5 hour business reviews in the last five weeks, I've had a good deal of interaction with most of our senior leaders.I believe we have a highly experienced, deeply knowledgeable and accountable team that serves our clients and shares my commitment to getting the company back to executing the basics well. Recognize, however that when a new CEO joins some reshaping of the leadership team is inevitable and this has already begun to happen. As you know with my arrival Frank D'Souza moved into the role of Executive Vice Chairman and will transition to Vice Chairman of our Board at the end of June. Raj Mehta has stepped down as President. I'm not planning to backfill this role. I want to be deeply engaged in the business and also want to flatten our organizational structure, so that we can take out layers of costs, communicate quicker and move with greater speed and agility.With the view to sharpening our focus and accelerating our growth in digital business I've just appointed Malcolm Frank as the new President of Cognizant Digital Business. Malcolm will bring significant customer centricity, passion, a strategic mind and a partnership mentality to this critical position. And to improve our performance in Banking and Financial Services, which represents 35% of Cognizant's annual revenue, I've asked Prasad Chintamaneni our EVP and President of Global Industries and Consulting in addition to his existing responsibilities to also assume the direct management of the banking business on an interim basis.Earlier in his career, Prasad led our Banking and Financial Services segment. Therefore I'm confident that he will immediately make a difference as we launch the search for a new head of our banking business. Prasad will continue to maintain all of his existing responsibilities in addition to his interim role. Finally before turning the call to Karen, I would like to touch briefly on Cognizant's significant market opportunity. One of the things that drew me to Cognizant is our large addressable market. The rates of digitization across industries creates a significant opportunity for us and clients, as they recognize digital as both an opportunity and a threat.We built leadership positions in many industry verticals and strong client relationships where we can upsell and cross-sell our lines of service. We have an opportunity to further diversify our client base. And on a geographical basis, there's a huge opportunity outside of North America with our global growth markets currently accounting for just over 1/4 of our total revenues. I believe that we have the right strategy and portfolio of services and solutions to capture the market opportunity and we will double down on execution to ensure success. We have been focusing over investments on six advanced capabilities that our clients need to become fully digital businesses.These six capabilities which form the core of our digital strategy are: core modernization; digital engineering where I'm really enthusiastic about the capabilities enabled by Cognizant's Softvision; AI and analytics; intelligent process automation; industry and platform solutions; and interactive customer experiences. To this list, I have added one more capability, Internet of Things. The advent of 5G will vastly expand the impact of IoT and create significant opportunities across our verticals.As we help our customers be successful in a digital world, we need to extend our IoT portfolio of offerings and build out our IoT partnership ecosystem. We see ample headroom for growth in all of these areas which offer strong margin profiles and a combined market opportunity that we estimate to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars. As we get after these opportunities we will be ultra-efficient in our legacy operations, prioritizing our investments, investing in partnerships and ensuring we digitize our own operations.In short, my mission is to ensure that Cognizant is well positioned for long-term success. My aim is to leave no stone unturned so that we can identify all opportunities for improvements in growth, efficiency and profitability. I look forward to giving you an update on our progress in the coming quarters. We have a solid strategy engaged associates and incredible client centricity and we are fully committed to executing this strategy.Okay. With that it's my pleasure to turn it over to Karen who will give you an update on both our operational and financial performance as well as a view on how we see the year ahead. Karen? -- Thank you, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. While the quarter started as expected, we saw a deterioration in our performance in the second half of the quarter which led to a slower-than-expected Q1 revenue of $4.11 billion, an increase of 5.1% year-over-year or 6.8% in constant currency. Digital however continues to be the most significant driver of our growth and now accounts for over 1/3 of total revenue.Moving to the industry verticals, whereas Brian mentioned the Q1 underperformance were primarily driven by Financial Services and Healthcare. Financial Services growth was flat year-over-year in constant currency driven by both banking and insurance.In insurance, growth was slower than our expectation at the beginning of the year as executive transitions under way at several of our clients, slowed the decision-making process in the latter part of the quarter, particularly around larger deals in the pipeline. In banking we continue to see softness at a few of our largest banking clients, but during the quarter we also saw a more conservative approach to spend with several of our regional banking clients in North America, including some banks that were impacted by M&A activity.Consistent with what we communicated at our Investor Day in November, two of our top five clients continue to show good growth while spend at the other three clients remains under pressure. We have however made progress in furthering our platforms and solutions strategy for the banking clients through the recent acquisition of MeritSoft, a capital market software platform for post-trade receivables and payables processing with offerings in regulatory, tax, operations and fees and billing. And the previously announced partnership with three Finnish financial institutions to transform and operate a shared core banking platform based on the Temenos platform which began as expected in the second quarter. However we are seeing some cautiousness in the banking sector around levels of spend in the second half of the year with a moderating outlook for growth in their business.Moving on to Healthcare which grew 4.6% year-over-year in constant currency. Within our Healthcare vertical slower-than-expected growth of our payer clients was largely the result of several large clients involved in mergers, as well as the accelerated movement of some work to captive at a large client. The continued rampdown of an account in which we were a subcontractor to a third party also continued to negatively impact revenue. We expect these trends to continue and likely deteriorate in the second quarter as some of these clients finalize new contract negotiations before embarking on the execution of their integration plans. Over the last several years, we've seen periods of heightened industry consolidation in Healthcare creating pressure on our organic growth rates during those periods.While the revenue associated with integration work that typically follows M&A can be meaningful, we recognize the volatility that has resulted from a handful of large clients over this period. As we broaden our client base within Healthcare by expanding into new care clients through platform offerings developed for contracts such as TMG, as well as the provider space, the diversification of our client mix should over time contribute to more consistent growth.Life Sciences saw broad-based acceleration in the quarter contributing above-company average growth. We are seeing good traction in large enterprise transformation deals and momentum with our industry-specific platforms such as the shared investigator portal for clinical trials. Products and resources had another strong quarter showing 13.8% growth year-over-year in constant currency. We saw double-digit growth in constant currency across retail and consumer goods, travel and hospitality, as well as manufacturing logistics energy and utilities.Building on the momentum that we saw in the fourth quarter, retail continued to perform well, despite a handful of bankruptcies in some of our smaller relationships during the quarter. We continue to see strength in cloud and digital engineering services and increased demand for interactive IoT and analytics solutions across clients. Our Communications, Media and Technology segment had another strong quarter with year-over-year growth of 19.6% in constant currency driven by software and platform clients within the technology sector. Within media and communications, growth was primarily driven by digital services for media and entertainment clients to accelerate their transformation to modern media companies, partially offset by slower growth with communications clients involved in industry consolidation. Technology delivered double-digit growth driven primarily by our digital content solutions.Now moving on to geos. The rest of the world grew 7.1% year-over-year in constant currency. Results in Asia Pacific continued to be negatively impacted by the weakness in some of our larger banking clients. On a constant currency basis, the three industry segments outside of Financial Services saw double-digit growth in the quarter.Europe grew 14.3% year-over-year in constant currency. In Continental Europe, we saw strength in Life Sciences and telecom while a few of our larger banking relationships in Europe remain under pressure we did see good growth from several of our newer logos. While North America remains a significant and growing market for us we see tremendous opportunity for growth in other parts of the world. We have made a number of organic and inorganic investments in Continental Europe which have given us a strong foundation for future growth. Going forward, we expect to increase our investments and drive an even greater focus on international growth particularly in Europe.Shifting now to margins. Our GAAP margin and EPS were 13.1% and $0.77 respectively. Our GAAP margin and EPS were negatively impacted by a $117 million accrual related to a recent ruling of the Supreme Court of India interpreting certain statutory defined contribution obligations of employees and employers which altered the historical understanding of such obligations by extending it to cover additional portions of an employee's income.Our accrual covers prior periods and assumes retroactive application of the Supreme Court ruling. However as further discussed in the financial tables to our earnings release, there is significant uncertainty as to how the liability should be calculated and whether the Indian government will apply the ruling on a retroactive basis. As such the ultimate amount of the company's obligation may be materially different from the amount accrued.As a result of this ruling, the contributions of our employees and the company in future periods are required to be increased. This change will result in approximately $15 million of incremental spend for the remainder of 2019 related to the employer portion of this contribution. Adjusted operating margin which excludes realignment charges and the $117 million incremental accrual related to the India defined contribution obligation was 16% and our adjusted EPS was $0.91 in Q1.Q1 margins followed our typical seasonality and were lower than the full year projection. In Q1, we also had the continued absorption of headcount additions and wage increases and promotions from the fourth quarter. Our adjusted operating margin was below our expectations for the quarter due to costs related to headcount growth outpacing the lower-than-expected revenue growth in the quarter which negatively impacted operating margins by 70 basis points and EPS by $0.04 and an anticipated increase in bad debt expense related to a few bankruptcy filings by clients, primarily in our Products and Resources segment. This bad debt expense negatively impacted operating margins by 30 basis points and EPS by $0.02. For the remainder of 2019, we expect margins to remain below our previous expectations, but to improve in the second half of the year as we align our cost structure with revised revenue expectations.As we discussed during our Investor Day back in November, while we have taken steps to improve our cost structure there remains much more we can do to enhance margins through areas such as pyramid optimization, sustaining higher levels of utilization and improved pricing levers. There is additional opportunity to simplify parts of our business unit overhead structure and take a hard look at the cost of delivery. Additionally a shift to higher-value services such as digital will continue to support margins. From a people and talent perspective, our annualized attrition rate at 19% is flat with Q4, but remains elevated. We continue to focus on our workforce strategy and overall management.Turning to the balance sheet which remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with $3.7 billion of cash and short-term investments, down $843 million from December 31, 2018. This decrease is largely due to the $750 million of share repurchases under our stock repurchase program including the funding of the $600 million accelerated share repurchase program launched in early March and annual bonus payments. As a reminder, our short-term investment balance includes restricted short-term investments of $427 million. These restricted amounts are related to the ongoing dispute with the Indian Income Tax Department. We generated $163 million of free cash flow in the quarter. Following the typical seasonal pattern, free cash flow in Q1 was impacted by the timing of our bonus payouts.Additionally we had an uptick of DSO of three days compared to Q1, 2018 which negatively impacted free cash flow by $125 million and included an increase in unbilled receivables. We billed approximately 57% of the Q1 unbilled balance in April which is in line with our historical norms. Our outstanding debt balance was $746 million at the end of the quarter and there was no outstanding balance on the revolver. During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 9.5 million shares and our diluted share count decreased to 575 million shares for the quarter.I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q2 and the full year 2019. For the full year 2019, we expect revenue to grow in the range of 3.6% to 5.1% year-over-year in constant currency. Based on current exchange rates this translates to growth within the range of 2.7% to 4.2% reflecting our assumptions of a negative 90 basis points of foreign exchange for the full year. This revised guidance reflects the slower growth in quarter one as well as a more muted outlook for Financial Services, including Banking and Insurance as well as Healthcare. For the second quarter of 2019 we expect to deliver revenue growth in the range of 3.9% to 4.9% in constant currency. Based on current exchange rates this translates to growth in the range of 2.6% to 3.6% reflecting our assumption of a negative 130 basis points for foreign exchange for the second quarter.For the full year 2019, we expect adjusted operating margins to be approximately 17% and to deliver adjusted EPS in the range of $3.87 to $3.95. The reduction in our operating margin guidance is primarily the result of headcount which grew faster than revenue for the last two quarters. While we will better align our cost structure with our revised revenue growth expectations, we will also continue to invest in talent and development of solutions that further our position in the digital marketplace. In the second quarter, we expect adjusted operating margins to be in line with Q1 at approximately 16% while we take perspective cost alignment actions that will take several months to implement.This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 572 million shares and a tax rate in the range of 24% to 26%. Guidance provided for adjusted EPS, excludes realignment charges and any other unusual items net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, the incremental accrual related to the India defined contribution obligation and the tax effects of the above adjustments.Our guidance also does not account for the impact from shifts in the regulatory environment including areas such as immigration and tax. As part of our balanced approach to capital allocation, we intend to utilize approximately 50% of global free cash flow annually for dividends and share repurchases. In Q1 we executed share repurchases that will reduce our average share count for the full year by more than our target of 1%. In addition the Board has declared a Q2 cash dividend of $0.20 per share for shareholders of record at the close of business on May 22.Additionally we intend to utilize approximately 25% of global free cash flow on acquisitions and have closed two acquisitions thus far in 2019. We continue to look for acquisitions that enhance our longer-term strategy of enriching our digital capabilities, expanding our geographic footprint and enhancing our vertical expertise.With that, I will turn the call back over to Brian. -- Well, thank you, Karen. Before we take your questions let me close by saying once again, how delighted I am to have the opportunity to lead this great company. My 286,000 colleagues and I recognize that we have work to do to get Cognizant back to basics and to strengthen our execution. We will roll our sleeves up and ensure that we tenaciously follow through on our strategy to produce the kind of results I know Cognizant is capable of achieving. We are all dedicated to our clients and we are all committed to advancing Cognizant's pivot to digital and spurring the next phase of growth and success.And with that, I'll ask the operator to open the lines for your questions.(Operator Instructions) The first question is from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question. -- Hi good afternoon guys and welcome Brian. I look forward to working with you. -- Thank you. -- Can you give a sense -- I know you've just been on the ground like you said for five weeks or so, but given you've landed in an organization that's clearly in this pretty tough period of transition, can you just map out for us a little bit how you envision the next 6 to 12 months for you looking like? Like where are you going to focus? Are there some immediate shifts and changes you can already envision you might want to make things you want to be doing faster investing in more aggressively? Any, just early thoughts? Thank you. -- Yes, I'm happy to do so. And ultimately over the last five weeks I spent my time across three continents and ultimately have been prioritizing business reviews, spending time with our associates and spending time with clients and partners. And to a great extent that will be how I will continue to spend my time going forward.From my point of view, but the great news is that we have an exciting market opportunity. The potential is there. But one of the things we're going to have to get back to doing is understanding the relevant trade-offs between costs investments and growth. I don't view costs and investments to be the same thing, but I do view costs and growth to be the same thing. We have to be fit for growth.So in order to do so we need to invest in growth, in order to invest in growth we need to free up dollars for investment. And to a certain extent Lisa, I really feel that we have to restart the engine that was the secret sauce of Cognizant. We have very engaged associates who have a winning spirit. There's a great opportunity out there, but we have to go back to making the investments, getting our cost structure right, really embracing digital and doing the basics well.And sometimes those basics in companies can be overlooked in terms of structural decision rights, sales commission plans etcetera, etcetera. If we get all of this right I think we will be in a position to execute our strategy and to do well.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. -- Thank you and Brian, thanks for the thoughtful comments. I wanted to ask you, our understanding was that the Board when they selected the CEO that would ultimately carry out the strategy that they laid out at Investor Day late last year. So given what you've learned and what you described in 1Q results are the company's longer-term growth and margin goals still relevant? Or are changes required again based on what you've seen and observed? -- Well, I can't really comment on what the Board sought in a candidate so the question is for them to answer over time. What I will say is that five weeks into my tenure, I'm still very much in a steep learning curve as you can well imagine. I'm delighted to be here and obviously optimistic about our potential. And why? Of course as I said the market opportunity is there to be taken. I'm surrounded by a lot of really smart people with broad industry knowledge and I'm going to be leaning on them to help me execute our plan in the years ahead. We do have a base of associates as I said that are client-centric which is a huge asset to have a winning spirit and that's based on years of commercial success.Now we have a set of customers who like Cognizant and that gives us the opportunity to up-sell and cross-sell to our installed base, but we also have an opportunity to go after new customers within our largest spend and most successful verticals as well as in the other segments and indeed as Karen touched open within growth markets. And we have to embrace digital further and leverage our strong C suite relationships notably at the CIO stack to better penetrate the rest of companies in their digital ambitions. What's easy or what's easy to articulate in one hand is obviously harder to execute. You asked me what needs to change? Too early for me to comment and I'll be in a better position to address that obviously down the line in the outer quarters.Maybe let me answer your question indirectly by saying and touching upon some of the work streams that I've started. What's really clear and important to me in good companies is that roles and responsibilities are clearly defined. Teams are empowered with responsibility clarification and empowerment so too goes accountability. And core to all of that his decision rights. And we have a matrix as every company has a matrix, but we need to and I will explore the D if you will on a rapid between horizontals verticals and the deeper markets.There must be clarity in the matrix. I also really want to look at how we get after the sales opportunity and not just in terms of the CIO versus the rest of the C-suite where we in theory should be able to better leverage our CIO relationships to cross-sell into the CMO, the COO and indeed the CEO and shift ultimately from the run portion of the business which will always be under some degree of constraint into the optimization or transformation portion of the business, leveraging more of a shift to advisory and indeed our digital offerings.But we have to look at some of the basics as well customer segmentation, commission plans, accounts-based marketing all of these are critical to growth and it's important to get the basics right and of course as it expands our delivery model. So look in short I'm learning the business. With every passing week I get a little smarter, but I've got a lot to learn and I'm rolling my sleeves up as you can imagine with the team spending time with clients and they themselves will have a huge role to play in informing my priorities going forward.Thank you. The next question is from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. -- Hi, good afternoon, and thank you for taking the question. I guess either Brian or Karen I was wondering if we might be able to get a little bit more color on the Banking and the Financial Services side? And it sounds like things are a little bit softer than you anticipated particularly with North America and regional banking clients? I was wondering maybe if you could help us wrap our arms around that a little bit to understand what -- where the softness came from and is this a temporary issue? Or might there be a fatter pipeline kind of in the back half of the year as you kind of progress through the year? -- Sure. Brian it's Karen. I'll take that. So I think, certainly as we've talked about for several quarters, the top five banking clients have been under pressure and we saw the nice recovery in two of the top five last year and that continues into this year. We haven't really seen any change of the profile of those clients or their behavior.But we did, as we said on the call in my comments see some pullback in the regional banking clients. Some of it was M&A as we've always talked about when there were acquisitions happening between clients particularly when both sides of the acquisition are clients of ours. We do tend to see some pullback as the deals are getting finalized and closed before integration spending, so there was a little bit of that in the quarter.But we saw some general softness at some of our other regional clients as well, not on a material basis in any individual client, but a number of small pullbacks across the industry. I think it's early to say what's happening in the broader market. But at this point I don't expect to see a significant recovery as we move into the back half of the year. But neither do we expect to see significant deterioration beyond what we've already seen with the three of the big five banking clients, but it was a little bit of a surprise in the quarter as we got further into it.The next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. -- Hi, thank you very much. I want to -- Brian this is for you and I wanted to start with you're lowering estimates, which I don't candidly think as a surprise, but the magnitude's certainly a bit larger than we were thinking. And as you indicated you've been there a short period of time. And so I just wanted to get kind of comfort level that you had enough time to at least give some assessments that would suggest that the estimates are set at a reasonable spot. And the second part of the question is you are taking a fresh look at things.And one of the things that does surprise me a little bit is the free cash flow targets, in other words, using 25% of your free cash flow for acquisitions. And given your attached rates to some of the troubled banks and the gravity that that poses, I would think that Cognizant would be well-served by perhaps leaning a bit more on M&A as your friends from Accenture doing in other firms. And so the corollary part of the question if you saw opportunities that would advance the cause of Cognizant would you be willing to flex away from some previous statements that were made to advance Cognizant? That's it for me. -- Well, thank you, Keith. Let me first start with capital allocation because the M&A question is inherent in that. Look you can well imagine Keith, our Board of Directors and I will continue to evaluate our framework on an ongoing basis to ensure we're maximizing value for people like you and our shareholders generally. We do have a very strong balance sheet. At this moment in time, there is no change in our previously disclosed capital allocation framework.I will say more explicitly to the question on M&A, it has been and will continue to be a level of -- a lever to execute our strategy. I'm very clear in my mind that M&A is not a strategy, it is a means to execute a strategy. So, all acquisitions that come forward to me needs to be contextualized against our strategy and we need to have clear business ownership and sponsorship and a clean line of sight to integration.At the moment, we're not working on major acquisitions and I'm more historically favorable to tuck-in acquisitions as opposed to anything beyond that. And I do think we should be able to use those as a means to an end to drive further revenue growth in line with our strategic ambition.Back to the first part of your question which relates to the margins, look everybody knows I've been here five weeks, so I arrived in April 1st, the quarter was closed and immediately we started looking at the results and trying to decompose them down understanding what happened in the latter part of the quarter.By definition, I have been focused on what is a secular trend versus a cyclical trend, what is an external factor versus a Cognizant-specific factor? I'm pleased with the work that Karen and I have done to try to get below those as best we can. I'm obviously focused on putting guidance out there that I know we can actually execute against. And that will enable me to invest in the long-term health of the business to ensure we can drive shareholder value creation. So, at this moment in time, that's as much as I can say. -- And I think Keith if I could just add to Brian's comments on capital allocation and acquisitions. As you'll recall at Investor Day what we outlined was a framework that on average in a given year, we would deploy 50% of our free cash flow for buybacks and dividends, 25% for M&A, and then 25% on average goes to India. But we continue to have a very strong balance sheet both with cash and excess capacity for debt if we needed the appropriate time for acquisitions or other investments.The next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. -- Hi, good afternoon. I know you guys gave guidance on February 6, so I'm just trying to understand in the first quarter, the miss of op income was by $100 million versus $300 million and margins ended up being down 170 basis points. So -- and I know we talked about margin expansion this year. Margins were going to be up 100 basis points.Now they're going to be down 100 basis points. So I'm just trying to put what happened to the margin expansion and just the shortfall in revenue for the quarter doesn't make up for it. And I'm sure you knew about headcount raises already. So I'm just trying to reconcile the differences? Thanks. -- Yes. So I think Bryan the way to think about it is that the revenue shortfall was clearly the biggest piece in the sense that we have ramped up hiring in Q4 and then the beginning of Q1 for the anticipated growth this year. And as you know it's hard to -- you can pull down the hiring, but once you have the people on board you need the revenue to support that.And when we gave guidance, while we did not give quarterly margin guidance certainly our Q1 margin does tend to be below the full year average. And so while the 16% adjusted operating margin was slightly below our own expectations we had expected that there would be a ramp of margins as we went through the year as revenue continued to build and as we were be able to deploy the headcount that we had bought on in Q4 and the early part of 2019. And I think what you'll see, as I've said in my comments that margins, there will be a little bit of a different seasonality this year. So margins -- adjusted operating margins in Q1 and Q2 will be roughly the same. Q2 tends to be our strongest margin quarter, but given the pullback of revenue and the headcount that we have on board now, Q2 margins will be similarly in line with Q1, but then we'll see the ramp as we get back into Q3 and Q4 and we can better align the cost structure to the revenue.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. -- Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and welcome Brian. Maybe if we could go back to the conversations you've had with clients over your initial month at the company. Can you maybe just talk philosophically about what they've told you about their willingness to potentially give you more business, if business conditions were different?In other words, for example with respect to pricing is -- do you believe that you could actually accelerate revenue growth at the company by potentially being a little bit more aggressive on pricing? And can you maybe -- understanding that you don't believe there's a direct trade-off between revenue growth?And margins, just talk about your thoughts on how you could reaccelerate revenue growth beyond all of the kind of temporal issues that are going on with the clients in Banking, Healthcare right now? -- Yes. I think it's a good question and inherent in that is the notion of elasticity and also our position within clients in terms of where we stand, not just in legacy but also in the new. I've seen quite a lot of clients across three continents and I have approached those meetings very openly soliciting feedback on Cognizant, on our brand, on what we stand for, on our client teams and delivery and project management. I've tried to obviously in the same vein understand what those customers are working on.And I would say very clearly and consistently spend pressure continues on the run side of the business in Financial Services everywhere else kind of consistent theme. And all firms are fully aware of the do-or-die notion that digital disruption brings their way. So they are in a highly competitive market with legacy competitors as well as new. And so very often the message is, we have to find ways to get our investments down in legacy, free up dollars for investments in security, but also free up dollars for innovation, to enable them to better participate in the digital world, if you will. So there is spend, but it's not always where we would traditionally played. And so our task is to optimize our portfolio, being as efficient as possible in our legacy business, and better positioning ourselves then in the digital world.And that brings with it complications as well as opportunities. The nature of the contracts from longer-term contracts to more project-based contracts is the fact that we have to juggle with, the nature of the skills required to get at those opportunities and the relationships, how we get into the front door? How we leverage our strength with CIOs and strong customer NPS to sponsors with their CMO, COOs, CEOs? How we get the right skill sets? Who we talk to? How we talk to them? How we follow-up? What collateral to leave? You name it. It's fundamentally an opportunity for us, but also something we have to grow into and continue to flex our muscles in, as we become more of an advisory element.Cognizant Digital Business is really important to making that happen. Winning new logos of course will enable us to grow too. But more broadly, almost two-thirds of our business is in Financial Services and Healthcare, so it's important that we turn those businesses around. It's important that we buttress our North America business with further growth in global growth markets, which grew 12% in the first quarter. And, if we get all of those things right and invest for growth, I am confident that over time in a steady-state, we will be able to simultaneously deliver better margins and accelerated growth. At this moment in time, of course, we have a lot of work to do.Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity. Please proceed with your question. -- Hey, welcome, Brian, and nice to have the fresh perspective. Hey, I just want to go back to where we had been recently. I mean, it does seem that the Analyst Day and the related financial targets that were set by the outgoing management, it does seem that those targets were awkwardly timed. And so I just wanted to inquire, a couple of things. One has the process for forecasting risk rating prospects in the pipeline and so on, has that process changed as you've come to the helm?And two, is there a plan for the role that Frank will be playing going forward? Is he ultimately going to transition out or is he staying for an extended period? So any clarity on that in the context of having these financial targets that were issued when there was the CEO change eminently about to occur. I think a lot of people are now especially now wrestling with the awkwardness that was created with that. So has the guidance process and the forecasting assumptions and approach changed? And is there a plan for the role of Frank going forward? -- Well, let me first start with the latter question around Frank who's been nothing short of a gentleman in the transition period with me. And I've been delighted to have the opportunity to spend time with him and work with him. He's somebody I reach out to almost on a daily basis to get guidance and counsel within the same vein. He's clear that he hasn't gone from the CEO role for the next three months or the next two months at this stage to move into an EVP or Executive Vice Chairman role and thereafter, will transition to the Board. And I'm sure will be available for me in non-operational capacity, but as a counselor as needed and as I choose to use.With regards to the process for forecasting and the Investor Day guidance and Q1 guidance, I can't really comment on the past. It's very clear obviously that, I understand the importance of setting expectations we can meet and consistency of earnings. It's something that I hold near and dear to my heart. We will continue to work to get rigor in our forecasting process and not just forecasting, but an annual budget process. Forecasts happen on a monthly basis, bottom up from accounts. But at the end of the day, we set a cost structure and we set leadership bonuses based on the annual budget. So we want to make sure we're rigorous, not just against forecasting and predictability of guidance, but also against the inherent plan as we enter a year. -- Thank you.The next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. -- Hey, thanks, guys. Listen just to dissect the shortfall on revenue versus your initial outlook, I mean, when we think of the magnitude of $500 million $600 million of revenue here, I guess, I'd just love to get a little more granularity as to how much of this is a handful of large clients? How much of it is broad-based? And then, really, I didn't hear you say you digital -- sort of, digital revenue growth rate. Maybe if you can give us that and if that's not been really enough to offset, what you're seeing is legacy revenue decelerating at a faster pace now. Thanks, guys. -- So, Darrin, it's Karen. So the digital, what we've said in my comments was that it's about a-third of revenue now. It grew low -- above 20%, so -- but low 20s, so consistent with where it was running toward the end of last year, so no real significant changes there.Thank you. Our final question is from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. -- Hi. Thank you. I wanted to ask on Healthcare. With the political cycles starting to ramp and then the rhetoric around health insurance also ramping, can you discuss what you're seeing in spending behavior in conversations with your managed care clients. I'm trying to understand the underlying outlook here, that's independent of the captive and also independent of account ramping down. And really, when do you expect that segment can potentially show a turn of the corner here? -- It's Karen. So I don't -- I think the behavior we saw in Q1 was really related primarily to the merger and acquisition activity that we've seen in Healthcare. So as we all know, there have been two very large mergers in the last few months. All four of those companies were clients of ours.And that was the majority of where we saw some pullbacks and where we expect see some deterioration, as we said, going into Q2 and sluggishness for the rest of the year. And then, we had one large client that did accelerate the move to a captive during the quarter. At this point, I think, it's more about those client-specific situations versus anything that might be happening in the broader regulatory environment with Healthcare. But I'll ask Brian to maybe add some color to that as well. -- Well, thanks, Karen. Well, first of all, it bifurcates. Obviously, Life Sciences has been very strong and grew double-digit, as we said. In the healthcare payer business, we've had a different story and certainly excluding some M&A, it's been slow. I would say, on a positive nature, healthcare is still about 18% of the nation's GDP and we're starting from a position of strength. So we need to understand, of course, we've had disappointing Healthcare results this quarter, but we need to do better.In the last few days, I've spent about three hours with CIOs of some of the largest Healthcare companies in the world. And the message I received was very clear. Help them on the run to optimize your opportunities, which optimize their run business and get cost savings and yet they are very open to embracing Cognizant under transformation and digital agenda, where we have so much opportunity. And so for us now and Malcolm in his new offer -- in his role to get after those opportunities and make sure we bring our assets to bear in customers where we've historically had very strong customer satisfaction and growing business in prior years. -- And with that, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining and for your questions.Thank you.Thank you for joining today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.

(Symbol: CTSH) stock, but tentative about paying the going market price of $72.11/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal.  One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2021 put at the $47.50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.45.  Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 3% return against the $47.50 commitment, or a 1.8% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost).\n\n\n\nSelling a put does not give an investor access to CTSH's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised.  And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $47.50 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price.  ().  So unless Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. sees its shares decline 34.2% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $46.05 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.45 from $47.50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 1.8% annualized rate of return.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tInterestingly, that annualized 1.8% figure actually exceeds the 1.1% annualized dividend paid by Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., based on the current share price of $72.11.  And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to fall 34.22% to reach the $47.50 strike price.  \n\t\t\t\t\nAlways important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company.  In the case of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., looking at the dividend history chart for CTSH below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 1.1% annualized dividend yield.\n\n\n   Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., and highlighting in green where the $47.50 strike is located relative to that history:\n  \n\n   \nThe chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2021 put at the $47.50 strike for the 1.8% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks.  We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $72.11) to be 24%.

In other words, if we look at the number of call buyers and then use the long-term median to project the number of put buyers we'd expect to see, we're actually seeing more put buyers than expected out there in options trading so far today.\n.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n \nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["While other tech companies long ago moved investment away from free services and toward cloud applications,  (NASDAQ:  ) remained stubbornly devoted to the \"free\" web.

However, terms of the transaction were not disclosed.Since Cognizant and Meritsoft are long-time partners, the integration will be a smoother process. Moreover, the acquisition not only strengthens Cognizant's software-as-a-Service (SaaS) portfolio but also expands its footprint among financial institutions.Notably, Meritsoft's FINBOS platform for post-trade processing, an automation solution for managing taxes, fees, commissions and cash flows, is popular among financial institutions. Meritsoft's solutions are currently used by \"five of the world's eight leading investment banks.\"Acquisitions have played an important part in charting out Cognizant's growth trajectory. In 2018, the company benefited from the acquisitions of Bolder Healthcare, Hedera Consulting, Softvision, Advanced Technology Group (ATG) and SaaSfocus.These buyouts strengthened Cognizant's digital capabilities as well as clientele. Additionally, they have helped the company expand in countries like Belgium, the Netherlands, Romania and Australia.Moreover, Cognizant is adopting the inorganic route to strengthen its footprint in the financial services domain that accounts for a significant part (35.1% of fourth-quarter 2018 revenues) of its top line. Although Cognizant has been witnessing strong growth among insurance customers, sluggish spending by large banks has been a drag on top-line growth. | In order to expand its presence among banking customers globally, Cognizant acquired Finland-based IT management firm Samlink. The acquisition is expected to be completed on Apr 1, 2019.As part of the deal, Cognizant was selected by three Finnish financial institutions - Savings Banks Group, Oma Savings Bank and POP Bank Group - to build and operate a shared core banking platform. More than 10% of Finnish banking deposits and loans will be managed by the new platform. Notably, all the three banks had stakes in Samlink.Additionally, the Meritsoft acquisition strengthens Cognizant's capabilities in trade processing domain. The deal will also help the company win contracts from financial institutions operating in the capital markets as they look to find effective solutions to manage increasing regulatory requirements.

Sales were higher by nearly 8% to $4.13 billion, inching above the 7% growth rate that most of those following the stock were expecting to see. Net income of $648 million reversed a modest loss in the year-earlier quarter, and after accounting for some extraordinary items, non-GAAP earnings of $1.13 per share topped the consensus forecast among investors for $1.06 per share.As we've seen recently, Cognizant's business segment performance showed continuations of well-established trends. The company's smallest units saw the most substantial revenue growth, including an 18% rise in the communications, media, and technology group that accelerated from its growth rate in the third quarter. The products and resources segment posted a 14% rise in sales, also outpacing what it managed to produce earlier in the year.However, more sluggish performance came from Cognizant's larger businesses. Growth for the healthcare segment slowed to just 7%, falling from near-double-digit percentage levels in the third quarter. The leading financial services segment saw growth slow to just 1.7%, decelerating further from earlier in the year.Cognizant got some much-needed strength from Europe. Sales in the key North American core area rose 6.7% from year-earlier levels, but that paled in comparison to the 17% growth Cognizant saw in Europe. Even the U.K., which has seen pressure related to Brexit weigh on results, posted a 15% gain. Only a 1.6% drop in the small rest-of-world segment held back Cognizant's overall growth worldwide.CEO Francisco D'Souza was pleased with how things went. \"Cognizant executed well in 2018,\" D'Souza said, \"diversifying our revenue base and client roster, and investing to build distinctive leadership in six advanced digital capabilities.\" The CEO noted that its digital-focused strategy matches up with what its clients need, and Cognizant will continue to pursue opportunities to drive digital growth.Cognizant has high hopes that it can keep using its overall strategic vision to find new areas to tap. In D'Souza's words, \"With a disciplined plan for executing our digital strategy, we've set Cognizant up for the next stage of sustainable strong growth and value creation.\"Yet it won't be D'Souza who's in charge of implementing that strategy. Effective April 1, Brian Humphries will come in to assume the CEO role, with D'Souza staying on to help with the transition through June 30. Humphries comes from  (NASDAQ: VOD) Business, and he will bring a new perspective to Cognizant's operations that could lead to new innovation. The departure of Rajeev Mehta as company president seems to indicate some disappointment that he wasn't selected as the new CEO, despite positive comments from D'Souza about Mehta's departure.Cognizant's outlook was generally favorable.

Please, go ahead, Francisco.Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, Cognizant announced a solid Q4 and full year 2018 results. We also announced, as you'd seen, our plan to effect a smooth transition in our leadership team, to take the company forward in the coming years. Having co-founded Cognizant, which celebrated its 25th anniversary less than 2 weeks ago, I've spent half my life here, and have had the privilege of serving as CEO for the past 12 years. Last year, in connection with the board's regular leadership assessment and succession planning processes, I informed my fellow board members that I was considering stepping down from my role as CEO, sometime in 2019. As a board, we embarked upon a methodical search for my successor, to ensure a fully thought-through, and orderly transition when the time came.Our announcement this morning is the result of that process. I'm pleased that Brian Humphries, as the CEO of Vodafone business, and a member of Vodafone Groups executive committee, will be the new CEO of Cognizant, effective April 1st of this year. Brian, is a terrific executive, and I look forward to working with him closely to ensure the smoothest possible transition. I speak for all of my fellow directors in saying that Brian is a strong choice to lead Cognizant in its next phase in growth. I'll have more to say about Brian in a minute.Before I do, I want to take a moment to thank the entire global Cognizant team for the tremendous accomplishments of the past 25 years, and in particular, during my tenure as CEO. My thank-yous need to begin with my longtime colleague, and the president of Cognizant, Raj Mehta. Raj, has been our President for the past two and a half years. And has provided Cognizant with his leadership, operational skills, and passion for clients for more than two decades in a variety of operating roles. We're grateful to Raj for his countless contributions to the growth and success of Cognizant over the years. He's ready for a new challenge, and has decided to step down from his role as president, and to leave the company shortly after Brian arrives. On behalf of the board, I wish Raj well in his future endeavors.I'm proud of what our global team has worked with such skill and energy to build during my CEO tenure. Over the past dozen years, we've grown annual revenues from $1.4 billion, to $16 billion moving Cognizant into the Fortune 200. We've scaled our talent base over that period from 39,000 to 282,000 associates. And since our IPO, we've increased the company's market value more than 400-fold, from less than $100 million to approximately $40 billion.I'm especially proud of how we've served as a trusted partner and guide to our clients, as they transition from one technology era to the next. And as they transform their businesses to improve operational performance, and generate new growth. And now, with the mainstream adoption of Digital at Scale, we've invested significantly in the distinctive capabilities needed to set Cognizant up for its next stage of sustainable strong growth and value creation. As we outlined for many of you during our November Investor Day.In fact, over the past several years, we've evolved nearly every aspect of our company: our domain knowledge, our services portfolio, our methodologies, our geographic footprint, global and local delivery, our leadership team, and even our culture to ensure that we can provide compelling value to clients, and capture this market opportunity, which is larger than any we've seen before. We're gratified that others have recognized the strength of this foundation, as Fortune Magazine recently named us one of the world's most admired companies for the 11th year in a row. It's been an honor and a privilege to lead the best team in the industry, as we've accomplished milestones that few others in the services business have been able to match.On April 1st, the time will be right for me to pass the baton to Brian, who has the experience, the drive, and the commitment to execute on our growth agenda. The board embarked on the search process with a view to our long-term future, knowing that the full transformative effect of the digital build-out on our clients, our company, and the economy is still to come. We sought someone with a track record of success across multiple companies, industries, technologies, geographies, roles, and organizational cultures. Brian, fits that bill. At Vodafone business, for example, which had annual revenues of approximately $14 billion in Fiscal 2018.Brian, is responsible for the entire global portfolio, which consists of all B2B fixed in global customers, as well as IoT, cloud-hosting, and security services. Brian, has successfully run a large-scale global technology business, and he has the focus and disciplined approach to execution and driving profitable growth. Brian's first day as Cognizant's CEO, will be April 1st. Until then, I'll continue in my role as Vice Chairman and CEO. And once he's on board, I'll transition to the full-time role of Executive Vice Chairman, to actively support Brian, and to help him get off to a running start. When that transition concludes, I'll remain on the board as Vice Chairman. I'm fully committed to ensuring Brian's success, and Cognizant's continued growth in my current and future roles.Turning to an update on our business, I'd like to run through a few Q4 and full year highlights followed by guidance for 2019. And then, I'll comment on the strategic plan we introduced nearly three months ago, at Investor Day. Starting with Q4, revenue was $4.13 billion, within our guided range, and up 8.8% year-over-year in constant currency. In the quarter, our digital revenue grew in the mid-20% range, well above company average, and is now over 30% of total revenue, reflecting our continuing shift to digital revenues. Our portfolio of digital services generated margins above the company average, and our non-GAAP EPS of the quarter was a $1.13.For the year as a whole, revenue grew 8.5% in constant currency, to $16.13 billion. During the year, we diversified our revenue base, and our client roster, and invested significantly for growth. We instilled greater operating discipline across the company, further simplified the business, and acquired 5 companies. And for the year, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders, to our capital return program.Let's turn to guidance. For the full year, we expect revenue growth to be within a range of 7% to 9% in constant currency, which falls within the medium-term target we defined at Investor Day. And for the first quarter of 2019, we expect revenue growth to be within a 7.5% to 8.5% range in constant currency. Turning to margins, as you'll recall from Investor Day, from here forward, we will include stock-based compensation expense in acquisition related charges in our non-GAAP measures of operating margin. For 2019, our adjusted operating margin target will be approximately 19%.I'd like to offer a few thoughts now on the demand environment. As we've referenced on prior calls, we are moving quickly to an era in which technology's role has shifted from supporting the business to actually being the business. Clients, are clearheaded about this dynamic, and continue to see the business case for digital transformation as absolutely compelling. Even against the backdrop of some global economic volatility. Our strategy for continuing to deliver disciplined and profitable growth, as outlined at the November Investor Day, responds directly to our clients' mandate for transformation. To help clients speed their journey to Digital at Scale, we're investing to build distinctive leadership in the six advanced capabilities: interactive, artificial intelligence and analytics, intelligent process automation, platform solutions, core modernization, and digital engineering.These six capabilities are aligned to our three practice areas, and play to our expertise and strong market positions. And all six areas offer ample headroom for growth. And when we combine our focused investments in these capabilities, with targeted acquisitions, as well as continued geographic expansion in industry diversification we have our engine for delivering continued growth. The board and I kept this strategy front-of-mind during the CEO selection process we undertook. So, we expect the strategy presented at Investor Day to continue to direct Cognizant's approach to the market opportunity. Shaped, of course, by Brian's perspective as he transitions into the CEO role.I want to close by saying how fortunate I am to lead a company of Cognizant's scale and stature, and how proud I am of the work our associates do every day across the globe. I look forward to continuing on the board, and to ensuring a smooth transition. And I'm confident that Cognizant's best days are ahead.With that, I'll turn the call over to Karen, who will give you an update on both our operational and financial performance. Karen.Thank you, Frank, and good morning, everyone. Q4 performance was solid, rounding out full year results, which were within our expectations and reflect continued execution of our strategy to derive sustainable revenue and earnings growth.Fourth quarter revenue, of $4.13 billion, was at the high end of our guided range, an increase, 7.9% year-over-year, or 8.8% in constant currency. The adoption of the new revenue recognition standard had an $11 million positive impact to revenue in the quarter. Banking and financial services continued to see slower growth at 2.8% year-over-year, in constant currency, driven by softness at a few of our largest banking clients.As we discussed back at our Investor day in November, the pressure in our banking business has primarily been driven by some of our largest banking clients. Two of our Top 5 clients continue to show good growth going into 2019, while spend at the other three clients remains under pressure. Despite the continued pressure in these three accounts, the rest of our banking portfolio continues to grow nicely. And based on deals that we've already closed, and our late-stage pipeline of deals, we do expect recovery in banking over the course of 2019. As I will discuss in a few moments, we have made significant progress in developing platforms and solutions for the European banking markets, and expect to see accelerated growth in those markets in 2019.Moving on to healthcare, which grew 7% year-over-year, in constant currency. Growth with our healthcare payer and provider clients, excluding the contribution from Bolder Healthcare, was impacted by the continued ramp-down of an account in which we were a subcontractor to a third-party, and a temporary slow-down with several large clients involved in mergers, where the potential spending associated with integration work is not yet under way. We expect this to continue into Q1. As healthcare delivery is shifting from a sea for service, to a value-based care model, we are seeing increased collaboration and partnerships across payers and providers that's focused on effective consumer engagement with data-driven insights. While, we have seen periods of slower growth in healthcare, we believe that our investments in the industry have positioned us well to take advantage of this shift over the long-term.Products and resources had another strong quarter, showing 15.4% growth year-over-year in constant currency. We were pleased with the good growth in both retail and manufacturing and logistics in Q4, in what is typically a seasonally weak quarter for those industries. Let me give you an example of work we are doing to help clients along their transformation journey in this segment. A leading U.S. fast-food chain that pioneered the concept of the classic 1940s drive-thru, with the on-the-go convenience, was facing the challenge of digital technologies, redefining the very concept of convenience. They needed to elevate the guest experience, and increase operational efficiencies in order to stay competitive.Cognizant, helped to develop an overall digital strategy, and the restaurant changed first, mobile app, including location finding, menu viewing, ordering, and online payment combined with, kitchen, customer service, and supply chain management tools. When the app was initially launched, purchasers saw an average of 12% increase in order value. It has now been deployed across all 2,000-plus franchise locations.Our communications, media, and technology segment had another strong quarter, with year-over-year growth of 20.1% in constant currency, driven by our technology clients. A recent client engagement in our communications, media, and technology segment held our AI and analytics story. A major software company needed to achieve a higher percentage of subscription renewals for its software and services, reduced costly customer churn, and drive additional sales. The client, however, lacked essential repository of information about past customer transactions, key decision-makers on accounts, or product-related issues.In other words, the very details needed to expand sales and close more deals. Our team partnered with a client applying big data and machine learning to develop an automated cloud-based, central data repository, and predictive analytics that enabled the client to connect the dots of customer behavior across its entire product portfolio. Using machine learning, and predictive analytics, the client is now able to predict customer churn, with 80% accuracy, take proactive steps to retain high-risk, high-value customers, and spot patterns to identify customers most receptive to cross-sell and up-sell.Many of you may know that Cognizant was born in the data and analytics space. And we've been consolidating our position here over the last 25 years. So, we've been at this for some time, and today, we are a Top 3 leader in this market. This, is just one example of our analytics and AI practice at work.Now, moving on to Geos. The rest of the world grew 4.7% year-over-year in constant currency. Results in Asia Pacific continue to be negatively impacted by the weakness in some of our larger banking clients. Europe, grew 20.3% year-over-year, in constant currency. Our investments, both organic and inorganic, have given us a solid footprint in Continental Europe, from which we expect continued strong growth. We've grown our geographic footprint organically, by expanding our client roster, adding new delivery and operational centers, and developing local talent in the markets we serve.Our organic growth has been accelerated with the ramp-up of a number of strategic client engagements: in Benelux, in banking and manufacturing; Nordics, in energy and banking; France, in banking and life sciences; Switzerland, in life sciences; and Germany, with life sciences and communication, media, and technology.Acquisitions, such as Netcentric, Hedera, Zone, and Mirabeau have enhanced our digital leadership in the region, and complemented our ability to service our clients across the entire range of the digital transformation. As I mentioned earlier, we have made significant progress developing platforms and solutions specifically for banking clients in Europe. These, include solutions for core banking, credit operations, cloud transformation, and digital transformation. These solutions, which require deep industry expertise and local presence, are expected to bring sizable revenue opportunities in the coming years.As an example of core banking transformation, we've recently announced partnership with three Finnish financial institutions: Savings Bank Group, Oma Savings Bank PLC, and POP Bank Group, to transform and operate a shared core banking platform, based on Temenos T24, and Temenos Payment Hub that will enable their digital transformation plans. More than 10% of Finnish banking deposits and loans will be managed by the new platform. This partnership, will not only help support our acceleration of revenue growth beginning in the second quarter, but over the longer term, will provide expanded opportunities in other markets across Europe.An example of could transformation is our partnership with ABN AMRO Clearing to cloud-enable its global IT infrastructure, and lay the foundation for digital transformation. Further, we have a good pipeline of similar opportunities as we enter 2019.Shifting now to margins. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, and realignment charges was 19.5%. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.13, exceeding our guidance primarily due to a lower non-GAAP tax rate. The Q4 GAAP tax rate of 20.6%, was lower than our previous guidance of 31% primarily due to net non-operating foreign exchange gains driven by the appreciate of the Indian rupee, and guidance regarding the GILTI provision of the Tax Reform Act issued in the fourth quarter of 2018. This tax guidance led to a reversal of the incremental income tax expense accrued for this provision earlier in the year.For the full year 2018, revenue of $16.13 billion represented growth of 8.9% or 8.5% in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating margin was 20.7%, in line with our guidance of approximately 21%. And non-GAAP EPS was $4.57.As we presented at our Investor Day in November, starting in 2019, we are revising our non-GAAP operating margin and EPS definitions. Going forward, our adjusted operating margin and EPS will no longer exclude stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related expenses. When calculated under the new methodology, the full year of 2019 adjusted operating margin was 18.1%, and adjusted EPS was $4.02.Now, turning to our other metrics. Consulting and technology services represented 58.2% of revenue, and outsourcing services, 41.8% of revenue for the quarter. Consulting and technology services grew 9.5% year-over-year, and outsourcing services revenue grew 5.6% from Q4, a year ago. Consulting growth benefited from the inclusion of several of our recent acquisitions such as Softvision and ATG, and continued strong demands for digital solutions. Within outsourcing, we saw continued strength in digital operations, partially offset by the ramp-down of the healthcare customer previously mentioned, where we were serving as a subcontractor to a third-party.During the fourth quarter, 37% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts, and transaction-based contracts were approximately 11% of total revenue in the quarter. We added seven strategic customers in the quarter, defined as those with the potential to generate at least $5 million to $15 million or more in annual revenue. This brings our total number of strategic clients to 385.Now, moving to an update on operations. In the fourth quarter, we continued to build on the operational improvements we've made in our business over the last two years, such as higher levels of utilization, improved pyramid structure, simplification of our business unit overhead structure, and a more effective leverage of our corporate function spend. Net of hedges, our Q4 margins, also benefited from the depreciation of the Indian rupee, versus a year ago, by 120 basis points, which, allowed us to continue investing for growth. The solid margin performance also allowed us to absorb the remaining wage increases, and promotions in the quarter, while achieving our full year non-GAAP operating margin target.In 2019, we expect continued margin improvement to be underpinned by ongoing improvement in operational efficiency and discipline, a continued shift within our business, to focus on higher-value services, improving profitability of our portfolio of large-structured contracts, and ongoing reassessment of less profitable opportunities that do not further our long-term strategic position.From a people and talent perspective, our annualized attrition rate, at 19%, declined over 300 basis points from Q3, but remains elevated. While, we are pleased with the decline in the attrition rate, we continue to focus on our workforce strategy, and overall management.Turning to our balance sheet, which remains very healthy. We finished the year with $4.5 billion of cash and short-term investments, down $545 million, from December 31st, 2017. Net of debt, this balance was down by $417 million, from December 31st, 2017. As a reminder, our cash balance includes restricted short-term investments of $423 million. These restricted amounts are related to the ongoing dispute with the India Income Tax Department.We had strong cash generation in the quarter, with free cash flow of $606 million. On a full year basis, free cash flow of $2.2 billion, as the ratio-to-net income, was just over 1 time. Our outstanding debt balance, was $745 million at the end of the quarter, and there was no outstanding balance on the revolver. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 3.6 million shares, and our diluted share count decreased to 579 million shares for the quarter.I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q1 and the full year, 2019. For the Full year 2019, we expect revenue to grow 7% to 9% in constant currency. Based on current exchange rates, this translates to growth of 6.3% to 8.3%, reflecting our assumption of a negative 70 basis points for foreign exchange. For the first quarter of 2019, we expect to deliver revenue growth of 7.5% to 8.5% in constant currency. Based on current exchange rates, this translates to growth of 5.8% to 6.8%, reflecting our assumption of a negative 170 basis points for foreign exchange.For the full year of 2019, we expect adjusted operating margins under our revised definition, to be approximately 19%, and to deliver adjusted EPS of at least $4.40, a 10% increase, versus 2018, on a like-for-like basis. This guidance anticipates a full-year share count of approximately 578 million shares, and a tax rate in the range of 24% to 26%. This tax rate range is consistent with our midterm expectations.Guidance provided for our revised non-GAAP measures adjusted EPS excludes realignment charges, and other unusual items, if any, net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, and the tax effects of the above adjustments. Our guidance also does not account for the impact from shifts in the regulatory environment, including areas such as immigration and tax. We are committee to the more balanced approach to capital allocation that we outlined at our Investor Day, last November.Beginning in 2019, we intend to utilize approximately 50% of global free cash flow annually, for dividends and share repurchases. This, should allow us to maintain a dividend payout ratio of about 20%, and reduce our outstanding share count by approximately 1% annually. The board has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share for shareholders of record at the close-of-business, on February 21 st .Additionally, 25% of our annual global free cash flow is intended to be used for acquisitions that enhance our longer-term strategy of enriching our digital capabilities, expanding our geographic footprint, and enhancing vertical expertise.In summary, our solid execution in 2018, along with continued investment in the business has positioned us well to deliver another solid year of revenue and earnings growth in 2019....Operator, we can open the call for questions.Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you'd like to ask a question, please press *1, on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in question queue. You may press *2, if you'd like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the * keys.Our first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang, with JPMorgan. Please, proceed with your question.Hi, thanks so much. I just want to say, Frank, congrats on an amazing run as CEO. I enjoyed working with you, and interacting with you. So, best wishes to you, and Raj, as well. Let's start with that, I guess, on the CEO succession. So, Brian Humphries, you gave a lot of good detail there. What stood out for him to be chosen as CEO, as an outsider? Can we infer that his international experience maybe signals a greater global focus for Cognizant, on top of carrying forward the plan you set up 3 months ago?Tien-Tsin, thanks a lot for the kind words. Look, I think that -- I'll say a couple of things. When we set out to think about my successor, the board conducted a thorough process. What we were really focused on, Tien-Tsin, was, sort of, the strategy that we laid out for all of you at Investor Day, as sort of the core of what's going to take the company forward. And as we assessed our choices, Brian is just a solid choice. He is well-regarded, a highly regarded technology executive, he's got a great track record of success across multiple companies, industries, technologies, geographies, roles, and organizational cultures.I think, with his global perspective, but also, client-focused experience with transformational technologies, he is the right executive to execute on our strategy as digital continues to permeate and power every industry.Got it. Got it. So, maybe, if I can just add a quick outlook question, just thinking about Fiscal 19, the big differences here, and how you might see growth shape up versus 2018. It looks like you're guiding the top end of the outlook to be pretty consistent with what you achieved in 18.I think that's fair. Tien-Tsin, if you remember back at Investor Day, right, we talked about that we thought near-to-midterm growth would be in the 6% to 9% on an organic constant currency perspective, and that in the near term, we'd be at the lower end of that range. And then, as we continued to grow, and add on more acquisitions, we would move up the range. So, as we're seeing this year, we think it plays out very consistently with what we outlined at Investor Day. Q1, is a little bit slower than the full year, but as we talked about in my comments, we are starting to see some nice recovery with some of the new partnerships in financial services, particularly in the European markets. And so, we're very confident that as we get into the second quarter, that we'll start to accelerate growth in banking, which then, obviously, support the overall growth rates for the year. But I think, in terms of general trends, obviously, shift to digital continues, and really, no significant changes from where we saw, the recent quarters.All right, appreciate it. ThanksThank you, our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis, with MoffettNathanson. Please, proceed with your question. -- Hi, good morning. I'll echo Tien-Tsin's comments, Frank, congratulations on a phenomenal run. I think we're all curious to see what you're off to next. I will actually start then, taking this opportunity to ask you one more long-term industry vision question. As you are moving out of your CEO role at Cognizant, when you look out over the next 5 to 10 years, in what ways in your mind will the IT services industry be meaningfully different? And comment on Cognizant's distinctive positioning relative to those changes, things that perhaps we don't have from our seats, the opportunity to see in the way that you do.Thanks, a lot, Lisa, I appreciate, again, the kind words. It's been quite a run. Just as an anecdote, I was thinking about it the other day, this is my 48th quarter that I will be reporting as the CEO of this place. Anyway, I guess, as a CEO, you measure by public company quarters.I think, Lisa, here's what I would say to your question. I think, that as I look forward, the difference that we're going to see over the next 5-10 years, is -- and we've been saying this, and it may even sound somewhat clich\u00e9 at the moment. Technology is really going from a decade ago, when it was supporting the back offices of business, to really being the very essence of businesses today. I say, often, that every enterprise is now a technology enterprise, every business leader is really a technology leader, every budget can be considered a technology budget inside of our clients.I mean, there's really this pervasiveness of technology, where we're already starting to see, and therefore, which I think we're going to continue to see as technology becomes just more and more integral to not just businesses, but governments, and societies, and so on, and so forth.Against that context, I think that firms like ours need to really have a set of capabilities that line up directly with that role that technology will play going forward. That's why I think that the six capabilities that we outlined for you at Investor Day are so important. If you look at them as capabilities, they individually represent big market opportunities. But if you look at them as a set, as a group, they really represent what I believe are the core capabilities that every enterprise is going to need to embed deeply into their operations, into their P&L, into their business, so that they can fully take advantage of Digital at Scale.And so, I think that this notion of how you organize yourself as a services business, and how you respond to this idea of Digital at Scale, the pervasiveness of technology across the enterprise is really going to be the core trend that services businesses will have to respond to over the coming decade. -- Great, thank you. And then, maybe as my follow-up, I'll ask the inevitable every two-year's question, I suppose, with new congress in session, inevitably, over the next couple of months, I imagine we'll hear some noise surrounding H1B Visa reform. So, just perhaps to get ahead of that, can you proactively highlight what progress Cognizant has made over the last couple of years reducing your dependence on H1B Visas. I recall, I believe, at Investor Day, you gave some statistics about the percentage of your U.S. workers that are now permanent residents or citizens, etc. Can you just maybe put those top-of-mind before we see any of that noise coming out over the next couple of months? Thanks.Thanks, Lisa. Look, I always start the immigration questions with the big-picture answer, which is that the reality is that in many parts of the world, certainly, in the United States, many parts of Western Europe, there really is a significant shortage of technology talent, which needs to be addressed for these economies to remain competitive. If you go back to the first part, or your first question, as the world becomes more technology-intensive, these economies really need skilled technologists to maintain the competitive edge.We continue to make progress. At Investor Day, we shared with you that at the moment, in North America, over 40% of our North American workforce, or let's say, our U.S. workforce is citizens or permanent residents. We continue to make significant progress, and I expect that in the medium term, we'll be well over 50%.And I think, Lisa -- this is Karen, if I could just add to that. I mean, as I think you know, if you will recall, last year, we setup our U.S. Foundation, which we funded with $100 million, initially, to continue to launch more training programs in the U.S. As Frank said, obviously, the biggest challenge is shortage of talent, not just here, but in other parts of the world, as well. So, we are certainly focused on helping to change that trajectory in the coming years. -- Terrific. Thank you, both. And congrats, again, Frank.Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Edward Caso, with Wells Fargo Securities. Please, proceed with your question.Hi, good morning. I was curious if you could give more color to your strategic accounts, 385 of them. Sort of, how many, at this point, are above the desired $5 million? And maybe, like some of your peers, could you array them as to over $100 million, over $50 million? Just give us a little bit more color other than it goes up 7 every quarter. Thank you.So, Ed, this is Karen. All of those accounts are actually over $5 million. And most of them, are considerably above $5 million on an annual run rate. We have not broken out how many accounts we have over $100 million, but it is in the range of -- doing this off the top of my head, about 30, over 30 accounts, at this point. So, there's a fairly large number of significant clients that have emerged over the years.Right. My other question is on the healthcare. How sensitive are you to winning sort of these large transformational deals to sort of get the healthcare group back on track? Thanks, and congrats to Frank.Thanks, Ed. Look, I don't think we are dependent on winning large transformational deals. The business is built on this -- and the vast majority, whether it's in healthcare, or in any of the other verticals, it's built on this idea of continuing to grow with our clients in a methodical way. That usually involves many, many small and medium-sized projects with each client, to continue to grow. We'll continue to do large transformational deals. We announced the deal that Karen spoke about this quarter, with the three Finnish banks. That's a great example of a transformational deal that plays into our strategy, platforms, and so on, and so forth. So, I certainly will not rule out doing those deals going forward, but I don't think the engine, or the Cognizant business is built on an assumption that we're going to do those deals to continue to grow.And I think, Ed, if could just also add to what Frank said. I think we talked about this last quarter a little bit. Right? Particularly, with the platform deals, the TMG deal, and the EmblemHealth deal, you want certainly, that large-feed client to launch the platform, and be able to build out the capability, and so forth. But after that, it actually enables you to add a lot of smaller engagements, and smaller clients that historically, we may not have been able to really support in a meaningful way. And we're certainly starting to see that traction now, particularly, with the TMG relationship, and being able to onboard now, smaller opportunities, which obviously, you can move a lot faster, and they become accretive quite quickly. So, that's certainly happening in that side of the business.And then, overall, in healthcare, as we had talked about, there's been, obviously, a number of mergers that are under way in healthcare. While, we certainly expect to get our fair share of the integration work once that commences, we certainly have seen a little bit of pullback recently, as those clients are planning for integration; that's typical. We said that at some point, we thought that would happen, and we've seen that a little bit over the last few weeks. At some point, they will move into execution of the integration.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex, with Morgan Stanley. Please, proceed with your question.Good morning, and thank you for taking the question. Karen, I was wondering if you could touch on inorganic contribution in the quarter. You guys had a pretty active fourth quarter, with deals, and it sounds like you continued that activity into this year. Just wondering what the contribution is, and how we might anticipate contributions through the remainder of the year. And I have a quick follow-up.Sure. So, M&A contribution in Q4, was about 250 basis points on a year-over-year perspective. That is also true in Q1, so you will see that again in Q1. For full year 18, it was about 150 basis points, on a year-over-year basis, versus 17. And in our 2019 guidance, that includes the deals that we have already completed, which is also about 150 basis points of revenue. New deals, as we talked about at Investor Day, we would expect to add about 150 to 200 basis points a year of new deals. So, we've obviously done that for 18, we've done it again, included in our 19 guidance. And then, new deals in 19 would be beyond that.Got it, that's super helpful. And then, you know, maybe if we could touch on -- you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the impact of the rupee appreciation gave you a little bit of flexibility to invest for growth. I think, some are anticipating a little bit of maybe that's flipping to a headwind this year. And if that's the case, what measures might you have to continue to -- or I guess, to manage that, and continue to invest for growth throughout Fiscal 19?Sure. So, I mean, we certainly ramped up hiring in the fourth quarter to support growth as we go in to 19. And we'll put those folks to good use. I think, as we look at 2019, utilization stayed fairly consistent last year with 17. We know we've got a little bit of room to continue to push that, if need be. Certainly, we continue to focus on our pyramid as we move into 2019. And then, really scaling some of the larger, more structured deals, or platform opportunities, as we had said. Really, two years ago, when we started outlining this new framework that, initially, those deals do tend to be margin dilutive, and as you get into the outer years, such as where we're starting to get now, with some of the original ones, you start to see that margin accretion kick in, which then allows us to continue to fund more investments. So, those would be some of the major things that we're looking at this year, as well as continuing to leverage SG&A. But really, our focus right now, is driving for growth, and making sure that we're investing in the talent, and rescaling, and so forth, to do that.Great. Very helpful. Thank you, very much.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider, with Goldman Sachs. Please, proceed with your question.Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Good luck to you, Frank, in your next phase of your career. Maybe just to start off, on the overall IT spending environment -- from your customers right now, clearly, they're spending more on digital, and less on maintenance. Can you maybe talk about their overall posture as they go into 2019? Any signs of worries around an economic slowdown or a pullback in IT spending? Or are things pretty much running the same course as they have been?Jim, it's Frank. Look, I think, as I said in my prepared comments, what I see is an environment, as you said, in traditional, in what you would think of as traditional IT, clearly, a pressure on running the business, maintenance types of activities, in order to free-up the dollars to invest in growth. That trend has been going on for a while. Equally importantly as I said, as technology permeates organizations, I think we are able to tap into new budgets. As I said, almost every budget is now somewhat a technology budget, whether it's the R&D budget, whether it's the marketing budget, all of these become new sources of opportunity for us.Overall, I think our market opportunities has never been larger; it continues to expand given technology permeating all aspects of organizations. I think, as it relates to the macro environment, clearly, there are concerns out there about various issues in Europe, relations with China, and so on, and so forth. I haven't seen it yet translate into a meaningful impact on demand for us. So, at this point, when I think about 2019, I see a solid demand environment.Thanks, and maybe, as a follow-up. Regarding the outlook in financial services in particular, I think Karen referenced a couple of specific deal wins that would improve that trajectory in Q2. I guess, what's your level of confidence in that improvement in financial sustain itself? Can you maybe just kind of address what you're seeing in your U.S. banking client base as well?Sure. So, in terms of the confidence, Jim, as we talked about the Finnish deal, for example, as a signed deal -- so, we're just waiting for final clearance and closing of that. We have other deals, similarly, in the pipeline that we're very close to finalizing here. So, we have a high degree of confidence, particularly, in the European markets, in terms of what we're seeing. And then, as it relates to -- I'm actually going to talk about North America, as well as the Top 5. So, if you recall at Investor Day, right, we talked about the Top 5, and that two of them had returned to very nice growth. That continued in Q4, and continues into Q1, where we're talking about, in some cases, double-digit year-over-year growth, and those are obviously, very large relationships. So, it's a very nice turnaround there.The other three accounts continue to be under some pressure, and at this point, we're certainly not assuming a big turnaround for our guidance for those accounts. But then, if we look at the rest of the North America banking business, it has and continues to grow quite nicely. It just gets under pressure when you have some of these larger relationships pulling down the overall growth rate of the business.Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane, with Deutsche Bank. Please, proceed with your question.Congrats, Frank. I did want to ask about the CEO change, a little bit surprised it didn't -- you know, the background of Brian isn't somebody with a little bit more IT services background, or an executive from one of your peers, or competitors. Can you just talk about why somebody outside the industry, necessarily, was the right hire for Cognizant?Thanks, Bryan. As I said before, the board conducted a very methodical search for my successor. We kept in mind very carefully the strategy that we outlined for you during our Investor Day, a few months ago. As we went through that process, we just determined that Brian is the right executive. We think that he's got a terrific track record of success across companies in the technology space, multiple industries, obviously, technologies, themselves, geographies, roles in organizational cultures. And when we put all of that together, we just think that Brian is the right executive to execute on the strategy that we outlined for you at Investor Day, as digital continues to permeate and power, as I said before, every industry.Okay, that's helpful. And then, Karen, just thinking about the guidance, I know the fourth quarter came in about 8.8% in constant currency. Guidance is calling for 7 and 9. So, I guess, you're already running at the high end of the revenue guide, and with financial services improving in 2019, just thinking about what pulls down, maybe, the range toward 7 and 9, and not a touch higher, since you guys have a little bit of momentum heading into 2019.I think, Bryan, I mean, certainly, the guidance is consistent with what we outlined at Investor Day. Q1, is a little soft, which obviously puts a little bit of pressure on the full year. Although, we're very comfortable with the ramp for the back half of the year. I think, obviously, we like to be prudent, particularly, earlier in the year. As we see things start to evolve, we will certainly take that into consideration. But I think, right now, we're very comfortable this is consistent with what we said back, in November, and we've made the investments to support this growth range for this year.All right, thanks, guys.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin, from Cowen & Company. Please, proceed with your question.Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Regarding your onshore hiring efforts, can you comment on the inflation levels in this tight labor environment? Particularly, around digital capabilities. And then, how are clients responding on pricing? And your ability to pass those costs through.I would say a couple of things, which we've said in the past. On a like-for-like basis, once you look at all-in costs, our talent base in the U.S., whether that talent base is, if you will, hired locally, or folks that are here, on some sort of a visa, there isn't a meaningful cost difference between those two talent pools. So, we are, from a cost standpoint, indifferent. Of course, as I said earlier, we are in a tight, in a constrained market, as you pointed out. So, given the demand for our services, we're always struggling to find the talent that we need to fulfill our growth ambitions. But like-for-like, you know, all-in, the costs are about the same.Yes, and I think -- just to add to that, too -- talking a little bit about pricing. I think, as Frank said, like-for-like, you're not actually seeing a big change, and certainly, I don't think wage inflation, given the skills we're hiring, we've seen that in a significant way. What you do see, obviously, is -- and this is always true -- skills, that are in hot demand, come with a high price. That's no different now versus the last 10 or 20 years. But the flipside is that, in this environment, clients need that talent as much as we do, and you'll get the pricing to accommodate that. I think, as we talked about last year, pricing has remained quite consistent, and in fact, last year, was the first year in quite a while that you actually had some pricing strength in the market because of the shortage of talent. That trend has continued.You know, the last thing, maybe I'll add -- sorry, to jump back in. Remember, when we look at our portfolio of digital -- our revenue from digital that is running -- it has, and continues to run at above company average margins, which, I think, speaks to our ability there, to drive pricing despite the fact that, in general, the talent pool, as Karen pointed out, in the digital part of the business, is a higher cost talent poolThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman, with BMO Capital Markets. Please, proceed with your question.Hi, thank you, very much. First, Frank, congratulations on Brian. I know him from his HP days. I think he's a terrific choice. As a matter of fact, I think getting somebody from outside of industry could certainly help Cognizant quite a bit. So, congratulations on that.My question was a little bit different in that if I read the press release correctly, you're the founder of the company, as you said, have tremendous success over a number of years. You're going to move to the board seat, I think, after a transition period. Frequently, particularly with founders, there are situations in which, when new leadership comes on board, they eventually get off to allow the new leadership to have unbridled capabilities to direct the strategy, but it doesn't sound like you plan on doing that. Am I correct in reading that?You know, Keith, my primary, and really, only goal here is to ensure that we do whatever is necessary to make sure that Brian is incredibly successful as we go through the transition, and beyond that. And my commitment to my fellow board members and to the company, is that I will play whatever role is necessary to make sure that that happens, and not a bit more than that. And so, we will play that as things come. But at the moment, my commitment is, to all of you, to our shareholders, to my 282,000 fellow associates around the world, and to my fellow board members, that my commitment is to make sure that I do whatever is in my power to ensure we have an absolutely smooth transition.Fair enough. Fair enough. Just one for you, Karen. I just want to understand 606 in 2019. 606, was a help, both the top line, and the margins in 2018. My assumption is, it's neutral in 2019. I know it's hard to predict because it depends on the nature of the contracts. But is that the right assumption, that 606 is neutral to both the top line and to the margins in 2019?Yes, that is a fair response from Keith, and we will no longer, in 2019, we will not be breaking it out. That was a one-year requirement to make that disclosure. But from a modeling perspective, just assume it's neutral.Many thanks, cheers.Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, our last question this morning will come from the line of Rod Bourgeois, with DeepDive Equity Research. Please, proceed with your question.Hey, there. And I'd echo the last comment. I think Brian is a great hire, and it's nice to see the new thinking about being more global, and so on. I wanted to ask, in that context, a couple of things. Do you expect, as the CEO change occurs that anything related to guidance or financial targets might be reconsidered? And also, do you expect any management departures related to the CEO change, besides the one that's already been announced?Rod, it's Frank. Multiple parts to your question there. Let me just, first of all, just say that as we think about Raj, I want to just say that it's worth really, spending a minute to thank Raj for his countless contributions to the growth and success of Cognizant. When Raj joined the company, I think we were $20 million in revenue, and from that, to over $16 billion last year, Raj has provided leadership, operational skills, passion for clients for over 2 decades, in a variety of operating roles. He's, as you know, served as our president for the past 2 and a half years. So, I just want to thank Raj, acknowledge his many, many, many contributions to the company on this call. I wish him well in his future endeavors.I think, as we've outlined for you today, our targets and our guidance for 2019 are based on our best view of the business at this point for the year. We're providing those to you, as we always do, having considered all of the factors that could positively or negatively influence our performance. And this is our best view, and that continues to be the case with the 2019 guidance. I'm sure that, as Brian comes in, he'll bring his perspectives to the role. And when we have updates, we'll provide those to you -- or Brian will, going forward. I don't think we have anything else to add to that.So, I guess, thanks very much, everybody. Thanks, again, for joining the call. I want you all to know that I've truly enjoyed the many, many interactions with all of you over the 48 quarters that I've done this. I look forward to introducing Brian to you in the days ahead, and during the transition process, once he's on board. So, thank you, very much....Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference.

(Symbol: CTSH) saw new options become available this week, for the March 15th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CTSH options chain for the new March 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $65.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.00. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $65.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $64.00 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CTSH, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $69.06/share today.Because the $65.00 strike represents an approximate 6% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 78%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of CTSH stock at the current price level of $69.06/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $70.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.04% if the stock gets called away at the March 15th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CTSH shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CTSH's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $70.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $70.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 54%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce  . In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Cognizant currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.94%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's nex  to be released on February 6, 2019.When the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Outsourcing growth benefited from the acquisition of Bolder Healthcare.The acquisition of Advanced Technology Group (ATG), which has deep Quote-to-Cash (Q2C) domain expertise and offers extensive Salesforce based CPQ and Billing solutions, strengthens Cognizant's cloud solutions portfolio.Moreover, the acquisition of privately-held consulting firm, SaaSfocus expands Cognizant's end-to-end digital transformation services in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, particularly Australia and India.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 6. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the  , it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.This information technology consulting and outsourcing firm is expected to pos  of $1.07 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.9%.Revenues are expected to be $4.11 billion, up 7.5% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Cognizant, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.94%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Cognizant will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the las  ed quarter, it was expected that Cognizant would pos  of $1.13 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.19, delivering a surprise of +5.31%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Cognizant appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Acquisitions are enabling the company to enhance cloud capabilities.The company recently reported strong first-quarter fiscal 2019 results, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Adjusted earnings of $1.96 per share surpassed the consensus estimate by 12 cents and improved from the year-ago quarter's figure by 17 cents. Net revenues of $10.6 billion beat the consensus mark by $131.9 million and rose 7% year over year on a reported basis and 9.5% in terms of local currency.Accenture has an impressive earnings surprise history. It surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 4.6%. For the fiscal second quarter, the consensus estimate moved down 2.5% in the past 30 days.In fiscal 2018, Accenture closed acquisition deals for a total consideration of $596 million. By the end of 2018, the company had made a total of 135 acquisitions. These buyouts have enabled Accenture to enter new markets, diversify and broaden product portfolio, strengthen cloud capabilities and maintain strong market position. They are expected to contribute significantly to the company's revenue stream. | As enterprises progress with digital transformation efforts, the use of cloud services is expected to significantly increase going forward. Research firm Gartner expects worldwide public cloud revenues to grow 17.3% in 2019 to $206.2 billion, up from $175.8 billion in 2018. Per International Data Corp. (IDC), the public cloud services and infrastructure market will witness a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21% during the 2016-2021 period, with spending reaching $266 billion in 2021.So, the strategy of enhancing cloud capabilities through acquisitions is a step in the right direction and will drive growth in the long term.These two businesses of Accenture are growing steadily on rising demand for expertise to improve efficiency and reduce costs. On the outsourcing front, the company continues to see strong demand to assist clients with the operation and maintenance of digital-related services and cloud enablement. On the consulting front, Accenture experiences strong demand for digital, cloud- and security-related services.As of Nov 30, 2018, the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $4.4 billion. A strong cash position enables Accenture to pursue strategic acquisitions, invest in growth initiatives and return cash through regular quarterly dividend payment and share repurchases.Higher talent costs due to a competitive talent market coupled with President Trump's stringent policies on immigration is hurting consulting services providers like Accenture. The industry is labor intensive and heavily dependent on foreign talent.Accenture's market share and revenues are primarily dependent on client relationships and the number of contracts secure. This along with the limited scope for product differentiation makes the renegotiation of large contracts extremely important. That said, competition from strong companies like Genpact  , Cognizant  and Infosys  is a persistent pressure. This eventually leads to pricing pressure.Accenture currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

For the First Trust Multi Cap Value AlphaDEX Fund ETF (Symbol: FAB), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $62.31 per unit.With FAB trading at a recent price near $49.69 per unit, that means that analysts see 25.41% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.

The door has been opened to a wave of generic competition that has been in the works for a while. The therapy generated $960 million worth of sales for J&J last quarter alone.RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro is still bullish, however. He wrote after the ruling, \"While this is a negative outcome, it removes a key overhang and improves visibility on J&J's 2019 outlook ...

(NASDAQ: CTSH)Q3 2018 Oct. 30, 2018 , Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Cognizant Technology Solutions Third Quarter 2018 . All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you.I would now like to turn the conference over to David Nelson, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer at Cognizant. Please go ahead, sir. -- Thank you, operator. And good morning, everyone. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release for the company's third quarter 2018 results. If you have not, a copy is available on our website, cognizant.com. The speakers we have on today's call are Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer; Raj Mehta, President; and Karen McLoughlin, Chief Financial Officer.Before we begin, I would like to remind you that some of the comments made on today's call and some of the responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to the risk and uncertainties as described in the company's earnings release and other filings with the SEC, including our Form 10-Q that we filed later today.I would now like to turn the call over to Francisco D'Souza. Please go ahead, Francisco. -- Hello, everyone. And thanks for joining our call. This morning, I'd like to cover two topics. First, a few highlights from Q3; and second, since or about two weeks away from Cognizant's Investor Day, I thought I'd give you a preview on what we will be discussing. Let's begin with the quarter.Third quarter revenue was $4.08 billion, within our guided range and up 8.3% year-over-year. Three of our four business segments delivered a strong performance in the quarter, driven largely by the increasing adoption of digital across these segments. And in the fourth segment, Banking and Financial Services, we see good growth in our digital offerings, which continues to be offset by pressure on run-the-bank spending. As a result, our digital revenue in the quarter grew in the low 20% range, well above company average and now over 30% of total revenue, reflecting the continuing shift across segments to digital revenues.Underscoring the relevance of our industry specific digital services to clients, we continue to see our digital portfolio generate margins above the company average. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 21.1% for the quarter, putting us on track to deliver on our full year margin commitment. And quarterly non-GAAP EPS was $1.19. As these results suggest, our sustained emphasis on digital services is helping us win more business with attractive margins and deliver higher quality growth as clients shift more of their spending from traditional IT to digital services.Turning to guidance. We expect fourth quarter revenue to be within a range of $4.09 billion to $4.13 billion. For the full year, we expect revenue to be within a range of $16.09 billion and $16.13 billion, a growth of 8.6% to 9%. And we remain confident in our previously stated guidance of achieving a non-GAAP operating margin in 2018 of approximately 21%.Over the last couple of months, we've announced three acquisitions to further enhance our digital capabilities. Two of them, which closed earlier this month relate to the sales force platform, where Cognizant has one of the industry's largest roster of certified consultants. We acquired Advanced Technology Group, which provides customer and revenue management consulting and implementation services that are focused on the sales force platform. Advanced Technology Group headquartered in the US has expertise in implementing automated, cloud-based, quote-to-cash business processes, a new and fast growing part of the Salesforce ecosystem. The capabilities will strengthen our cloud solutions portfolio as clients shift the business models based on recurring revenue streams.During the quarter, we also acquired SaaSfocus, one of the largest independent sales force platinum consulting partners in the Asia Pacific region with operations across Australia and India. SaaSfocus will expand our end-to-end digital transformation services and Salesforce cloud capabilities in Asia Pacific.We're especially excited about the anticipated acquisition of Softvision, announced earlier this month, which will expand our digital engineering capabilities once completed. Softvision is a leader in software product innovation and development using modern, agile software engineering tools, techniques and processes. Softvision will bring more than 2,800 technologist to Cognizant, increasing our ability to provide software engineering services to our clients from a new Eastern European base in Romania, a fast emerging hub for software developers. We expect the acquisition to close later this quarter.Adding Softvision to Cognizant will enable us to create one of the world's largest digital engineering companies. Our acquisition activity complements our ongoing organic investment in digital capabilities, domain knowledge, global and local delivery and overall ability to deliver for clients from strategy through implementation and outcomes.Okay. So let's move to my second topic, Investor Day, which is scheduled for Friday, November 16th in New York. Our goal for Investor Day is to discuss our mid-term strategy and growth path over the next several years. The strategy centers on helping clients become digital at scale by digitizing their products and services, personalizing their -- the experiences they offer their customers, fully automating their business processes and modernizing their IT infrastructures.Clients find digital at scale compelling, because it generates new revenue streams, new operating models and new ways of delighting their customers. And we find digital at scale compelling, because of how well positioned we are to seize what's becoming a massive market opportunity.At Investor Day we will also cover the financial objectives we will seek to deliver for the company and for shareholders, including our targets for revenue, margins, EPS and capital return for the next few years. In addition, we'll give you the opportunity to meet and hear from a cross-section of our executive leadership team. Overall, our goal for Investor Days is to present our plan for the future.One more point before I turn the call over to Raj. For Cognizant, 2018 has been a year of solid execution across many dimensions of the company. We've accelerated Cognizant's pivot to digital, while driving revenue growth, margin improvement and capital returns. And therefore, we expect our forward momentum to continue to deliver strong results.And now over to Raj, who will give you an update on the performance of our industry verticals. Raj? -- Thanks, Frank. And good morning everyone. Cognizant's orientation is digital first and digital at scale. It's the way we think and the way we work based on what clients need. With that in mind, let's look at our industry segments performed in the quarter, beginning with Communications, Media and Technology, which has strong year-over-year growth of 17.1%.Within Communications, we're helping clients co-innovate the networks of the future to enable rich, complex information to move at speeds more than 30 times faster than what's possible today, leading to a significant improvement in virtual reality, robotics, healthcare and more.Within media, analytics has become essential to our clients' long-term success. And in our technology vertical, content moderation continues to drive client revenue. We're proud to be working with several of the world's largest born digital companies, which also engage us to apply AI, software engineering and IoT solutions to help develop new business models. They know that to retain their customers, they must constantly create new and compelling experiences.And its worth noting that, in the third quarter two of our technology clients were part of Cognizant's 10 largest clients and both are continuing to grow. That compares with just three years ago when our entire top 10 were either banking or healthcare clients.Moving to Products and Resources, we increased revenue 11.5% year-over-year, led by strong growth from our retail and manufacturing clients. In retail, we had one of our best quarters in years. Traditional retailers are racing to strengthen their digital business channels to meet the Amazon challenge of frictionless omni-channel experiences, hyper personalized retailing and responsive supply chain systems. We're helping retailers to implement the next stage of unified commerce and partnering with them to enable enterprisewide transformation.An example tells the story. A mid-sized US retailers wanted to offer their customers a more engaging experience, as well as, the convenience of buy anywhere, fulfill anywhere and return anywhere. We help the clients define a omni-channel road map and implement cloud-based commerce solution that provides full scale order management. With the new solution in place, our client has increased the number of orders through digital channels to around $1 million a month. And we see plenty of opportunity ahead in retail, as clients strive to achieve better consumer engagement and retention by using advanced e-commerce and digital ecosystem management.In manufacturing, spending among our clients remain strong, as they continue to invest in making their products smarter and their consumer experiences richer. This effort is also driving digital initiatives on the factory floor, including more use of AI driven autonomy to augment human decision making. The newest phase of manufacturing uses automated and digitized systems to bring together physical with digital. This phase combines machine-to-machine communication, Internet of Things, analytics and big data to provide much better visibility into operations.For example, we're working with a global industrial manufacturing leader to improve their overall plant efficiency and transform their operations, while saving them several hundred million dollars over the next few years. We're doing this by reducing maintenance downtime, improving throughput, lifting worker productivity and enabling increased levels of automation. Our engagement will cover more than 20 global manufacturing sites and create digital trends of their environment. These are virtual replicas of what's happening on the factory floor in near real-time and continuously analyze incoming data streams. Clients will use this analysis to manage the performance of their machine, lines and plants with the aim of achieving significant gains and up time in productivity.Now let's turn to banking and financial services, which grew 2.6% year-over-year. Banks realize they need to break away from their legacy IT foundations and become digital at scale. That's the best way to reinvent their business models, improve their customer engagement and achieve the technical agility needed for rapid learning and adapting. As mentioned on prior calls, our banking clients intense focus on continuing their run -- the bank spending has affected a substantial portion of our work for them. But even with that, these clients are stepping up their spending on advanced technologies to transform their businesses. And as we extend our portfolio of services, our banking related digital revenue has seen solid growth. We believe this growth will increasingly offset the pressure we are seeing on the run-the-bank spending.We are optimistic about the shift for two reasons. First, all banks realized they must rewrite their futures with digital. And second, our banking client headquartered in North America are beginning to see their spending on technology rise with a growing portion of that spend allocated to digital transformation. In Europe, we expect banks to follow a similar trend. So the expansion of our digital services is starting to bring growth back into a number of our large banking clients. This is especially true in the areas of core modernization and digital engineering services.For example, a major banks sort our help to move their legacy applications onto a cloud native architecture to reduce cost and complexity, increase their output productivity and become more agile. Drawing on a deep knowledge of the bank's systems, we worked with Pivotal Software to refactor legacy applications on to the Pivotal Cloud Foundry and open source platform. We demonstrated how seamlessly we can integrate legacy technologies with cloud native architectures. We're able to dramatically reduce the time it takes to release code and we provide the bank with agile capabilities such as auto scaling and auto recovery.Now let's look at Healthcare, where revenue was up 9.6% year-over-year. For healthcare providers and peers the focus continues to be on improving efficiencies and advancing patient care and satisfaction. We continue to invest and position our healthcare practice to capture demand as clients shift their underlying business models from fee-for-service to value-based care. To complement our strong position in the peer market, we've expanded our scope to include the provider network of doctors, hospitals and other clinicians and we see continuing traction in this network. During the quarter, our healthcare consulting practice, Cognizant's largest consulting practice had very strong growth.Turning to our life science practice. We excel at helping biopharma and med-tech companies thrive in a world of shrinking patent exparations, while improving their product development and manufacturing processes in a stringent regulatory environment. We are encouraged by a couple of developments that are driving growth in this practice. First, we see continued traction in our platform solutions. Our shared investigator platform is now live at five large pharmaceutical clients. This cloud-based collaboration platform makes it easier for a critical trial researchers to access, share and analyze data. We have another five clients signed up with implementation expected over the next few quarters. And along with the license revenue from our shared investigator platform, we will typically realize consulting, implementation and processing services.The second development fueling growth is a number of large enterprise transformation deals in the process of ramping up. For example, we're working with one of the world's largest medical device and pharmaceutical companies to help drive several of their billion dollar brands in more than a dozen markets across the globe.Our client needed to create an agile, efficient and skilled global marketing organization. So we're enabling this with our assetSERV Digital Asset Management Solution. It's a cloud-based pre-configured platform that helps the enterprises manage end-to-end content life cycle and deliver engaging customer experiences. We're helping the client support new ways of working by enabling reduce duplication and spend, enhanced collaboration, greater asset use and reuse and leverage scale.Overall, the story of our industry segments continues to be one of steady execution and progress. We are resolved to be our clients' go-to transformation partner. To that end, we continue to invest significantly in digital engineering, interactive, intelligent process automation, platform solutions, analytics and AI and core modernization, all of it is directed at helping our clients drive digital at scale.With that, I'll turn it over to Karen. Karen? -- Thank you, Raj. And good morning, everyone. The business performed within expectations in the third quarter as revenue of $4.08 billion was within our guided range and increased 8.3% year-over-year, including a 70 basis point negative impact from currency. The adoption of the new revenue recognition standard had a $33 million positive impact to revenue in the quarter.Europe grew 15.1% year-over-year in Q3, including a 130 basis point negative impact from currency. And the rest of world was up modestly from a year ago, including a 590 basis point negative impact from currency. Similar to trends that we saw in the second quarter, results in both the UK and Asia-Pacific were impacted by the weakness in some of our larger banking clients. While acquisitions like Netcentric and Mirabeau are enhancing our digital leadership in continental Europe, leading to a number of recent digital wins.Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses and realignment charges were 21.1% and non-GAAP EPS was $1.19 exceeding our guidance due to solid operating margin performance and a lower non-GAAP tax rate. The Q3 GAAP tax rate of 28% was higher than our previous guidance of 26%, primarily due to higher net non-operating foreign exchange losses, driven by the depreciation of the Indian rupee, partially offset by changes to our geographic mix of earnings. The Board has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share for shareholders of record at the close of business on November 20th.Before turning to details of our financial performance, I'd like to provide an update on the status of the FCPA investigation. As a reminder, in September of 2016 we voluntarily notified the DOJ and SEC of possible FCPA violations. And during 2016, we recorded out of period corrections related to $4 million of potentially improper payments.Our discussions with the DOJ and SEC have progressed to a point where we are now able to reasonably estimate a probable loss and have recorded an accrual of $28 million in our financial statements in Q3. While we believe that we are getting closer to the conclusion of this matter, we are unable to predict with certainty the timing of a final resolution.Now turning to our financial performance. Consulting and technology services represented 57.7% of revenue and outsourcing services 42.3% of revenue for the quarter. Consulting and technology services grew 6.6% year-over-year and outsourcing services revenue grew 10.7% from Q3 a year ago. Outsourcing growth benefited from the inclusion of our recent acquisition of Bolder Healthcare, as well as large client engagement such as TMG Health.During the third quarter, 36% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts. And transaction-based contracts were approximately 11% of total revenue during the quarter. We added seven strategic customers in the quarter defined as those with the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue. This brings our total number of strategic clients to 378.And now, moving to an update on margins. In the third quarter, we had solid margin performance as we continued to build on the improvements we've made in our business over the last 22 months, such as sustained higher levels of utilization, optimal pyramid structure, simplification of our business unit overhead structure and leveraging our corporate function spend more effectively. Specifically during the quarter, we continued to improve our cost structure by further optimizing the higher end of our resource pyramid, resulting in $11 million in realignment charges.Net of hedges, our Q3 margins also benefited from the depreciation of the Indian rupee versus the prior-year quarter by 74 basis points. Solid margin performance allowed us to absorb the wage increases and promotions in the quarter, while remaining on track to achieve our full year non-GAAP operating margin target of approximately 21%.As we drive toward approximately 22% non-GAAP operating margins in 2019, we expect continued margin improvement to be underpinned by both ongoing operational efficiency and discipline, as well as affecting a shift within our business to focus on higher-value services, improving profitability within our portfolio of large structured contracts and reassessing less profitable opportunities that do not further our position in the digital marketplace.From a people and talent perspective, our annualized attrition rate of 22% remains elevated. The value that we create for our clients is predominantly knowledge-based work. So we depend heavily on the insights, passion and collaboration of our global associates. We believe that the higher attrition is largely the result of increasing global demand for the various skills we specialize in. The growing shortage of technology talent, particularly in local markets and the transition our organization has gone through to build a scalable foundation for expanding our digital leadership. We continue to focus on our workforce strategy and management.Turning to our balance sheet, which remains very healthy. We finished the quarter with $4.8 billion of cash and short-term investments. This balance, net of debt was down by $144 million from December 31st, and includes restricted short-term investments of $405 million. These restricted amounts are related to the ongoing dispute with the Indian Income Tax Department.We had strong cash generation in the quarter with cash flow from operations of $862 million and free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow, net of CapEx was $768 million. Our outstanding debt balance was $724 million at the end of the quarter and there was no outstanding balance on our revolver.During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares, including 1.1 million, which represented final share settlement of the $600 million ASR launched in June. Our diluted share count decreased to 580 million shares for the quarter.I would now like to comment on our outlook for Q4 and the full year 2018. For the full year 2018, we expect revenue to be in the range of $16.09 billion to $16.13 billion, which represents growth in the range of 8.6% to 9%. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not forecasts for potential currency fluctuations over the remainder of the year.Based on current exchange rates and the positive currency impact realized year-to-date, the full-year favorable revenue impact from currency is now expected to be approximately 30 basis points versus the full year 2017. This is down from our original estimate of 100 basis point impact at the beginning of the year.For the fourth quarter of 2018, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $4.09 billion to $4.13 billion. Based on current exchange rates, the Q4 negative impact on currency is expected to be approximately 100 basis points versus Q4 of 2017. For the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $1.05, this guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 582 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 31%.For the full year 2018, we expect non-GAAP operating margins to be approximately 21% and to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $4.50. This guidance anticipates a full year share count of approximately 584 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 28%. Our expected GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter and for the full year is higher than our previous guidance, due to incremental foreign currency exchange losses driven by the depreciation of the INR against the US dollar, which are not deductible for tax purposes.Additionally, earlier this month the state of New Jersey enacted legislation that would result in an incremental annual income tax expense of approximately $70 million, beginning in 2018. However, we intend to implement prudent and feasible tax planning strategies during the fourth quarter of 2018, which we expect to significantly reduce this income tax expense resulting from this enacted legislation. Accordingly, our Q4 and full year estimated tax rate reflects the anticipated implementation of these tax planning strategies.We are maintaining our full-year EPS guidance despite the out performance in Q3 to absorb the higher than expected tax rate. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes stock-based compensation, acquisition-related expenses and amortization, realignment charges, net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, the tax effects of the above adjustments and adjustment to the onetime 2017 incremental income tax expense related to the Tax Reform Act and our initial contribution to the Cognizant US Foundation. Our guidance also does not account for the impact from shifts in the regulatory environment including areas, such as immigration or tax.In summary, our solid execution in Q3, along with continued investment in the business has positioned us well to deliver another solid year of revenue and earnings growth in 2018.Operator, we can open the call for questions.Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). The first question comes from the line of Edward Caso with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. -- Hi. This is Justin Donati on for Ed. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, can you break out the organic revenue growth in the healthcare unit ex Bolder? -- This is -- Good morning, Justin. This is Karen. We've have not broken that out, but the Boulder contribution in the quarter was fairly small. We've said, when we acquired Boulder earlier in the year that the full-year estimate was about $100 million for the year. So roughly little over $30 million a quarter is what that's running.Thank you. The next question is from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. -- Hi. I wanted to ask you about the tax rate, it's running, I guess a little bit higher and that's causing the EPS to drop lower than consensus. So can you talk a little bit about, Karen, the sustainability of that higher tax rate as we go forward and as we model our 2019. And then secondly, Raj, some speculation around CEO succession planning, maybe you can comment on those plans? Thanks. -- So, Bryan, it's Karen. I'll answer the tax rate and I'll turn over to Frank to talk about the -- any succession planning that here may or may not be happening. So the tax rate, so this has happened before, if folks go back and take a look at the spring-summer time frame of 2013, when there is a sudden depreciation in the rupee, we've seen this impact before, because what happens is, with so many of our assets being in India and the depreciation of the rupee, we end up with the big foreign exchange movement that is not deductible for tax purposes in India. And so that drives up the consolidated rate. But it doesn't have a long-term impact. So essentially, the impact hits the quarter in which it happens and there will be a little bit of spillover into Q4, just because of the timing of the rupee movement, but if we assume that the rupee stays fairly stable going forward, then we will actually revert back to the guided tax rate.So if people recall it earlier in the year, we had guided to a longer-term tax rate of 24% to 26% with the implementation of the guilty tax at the federal level. Early in the year, we said people should guide toward the higher end of that tax rate and that is still a reasonable position for people to assume. -- And Brian, this is Frank. I'll take the question about succession planning. At this point, there are no changes to my responsibilities or to Raj's responsibilities. You address the question to Raj, but I'll take it. As I've said before, succession planning is the responsibility of the Board and specifically the Nominating and Governance and Public Affairs Committee of the Board and we've not made any announcements on that, except that you would have seen announcement recently that as it relates to the Chairman of the Board, Michael Patsalos-Fox was elected Cognizant's new Chairman. And he has been on the Board since July of 2012, has a long history and long background in management, technology, consulting from his many years at McKinsey. And he succeeds John Klein, who was elected to our Board in -- back in 1998 and who had served as Chairman of the Board since December of 2003. John will continue to remain on the Board.Thank you. The next question is from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. -- Thank you so much. Good morning. Just wanted to clarify and then ask a follow-up, just on the revenue revision to the year. Can you tell that first-hand between FX, acquisitions, and what might be incrementally weaker? And then, I wanted to ask around the Softvision acquisition, we like that you guys getting into the software engineering side. What kind of synergies might you expect by putting Softvision on to the Cognizant network. Do we expect something different here versus other deals and maybe, can we expect more in the way of investment going ahead? Thanks. -- So, let me do the revenue roll forward Tien-Tsin, and then I'll turn it over to Frank to talk about Softvision and the benefits there. So from a revenue perspective, I would think about it basically on a full-year basis. So on a full year basis, essentially the 606 benefit that we've received to date in this quarter, little over $30 million is essentially kind of wiped out by the foreign currency movements. So FX and rev rec essentially offset each other on a full year basis or year-to-date, anticipated to be on a full-year basis at this point.And then from a -- from an inorganic perspective, it's less than a point of revenue at this point. I think it's about 40 basis points in the quarter, in Q3 it was (inaudible) of inorganic revenue growth, so it's been fairly small. -- Tien-Tsin, let me talk about -- it's Frank, let me talk a little bit about digital engineering and Softvision in particular. When Softvision closes -- we anticipate it to close in Q4. Putting Softvision together with Cognizant's existing software engineering capability, we think will create one of the largest software engineering capabilities in the industry. Cognizant already has a very strong software engineering capability that we've built largely organically over the years. Part of that has come also from acquisitions that we've done in the past. For example, TriZetto and so on, which came with a strong software engineering DNA.What Softvision will bring to us once it closes is, of course, the 2,800 creative technologists, the base in Romania that we think is a significant source of software engineering talent. And of course, software engineering and digital engineering is the new way of developing software. And so, we see revenue synergies as we bring that combined Cognizant and Softvision platform to many of our clients across industries. Including, as Raj said in his prepared comments, due to the financial services industry. -- And Tien-Tsin, sorry before we move on, Katie just point out to me that I misspoke the inorganic impact for the quarter was about 0.5 for the year, it's about a point of revenue year-to-date. So, apologies for that.Your next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. -- Hi, good morning, and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering maybe, Raj, could you speak to some of the hiring trends that you're seeing in the market, we're hearing about some of the peers, particularly in India. I guess pursuing retention payments to improve retention rates. I know you guys have focused more on training up within your organization, in particular with regard to full stack developers? And then maybe on the mix shift where -- how you're seeing the mix shift of headcount with that attrition, are you hiring in places that you're not seeing the attrition. And how you anticipate that impact margins going forward? -- Yeah, Brian. Look, I think overall in terms of headcount, look, our global headcount increased to about 274,000 over, up from 268,000 from the last quarter. So it was by the net addition of about 5,300. And overall in the year we are continuing to find the talent in the marketplace in all of our geographies, we hired about 14,000 professionals around the world. And we also have a stated goal of hiring about 25,000 profession also in the US over the next couple of years.So I think there is a lot of talent in the marketplace. We are obviously addressing some of the attrition, attrition was a little bit high for us and we're obviously continuing to investing in cross training our resources, looking at ways in terms of employee engagement, in terms of retaining our talent, looking at ways of also creating new opportunities in terms of job rotation as well to control that. But in terms of the -- look, in terms of the mix of the pyramids and geographical splits, no major changes. I mean, obviously, you'll have certain projects that have some greater onsite components at certain traces of the life cycle, but overall, no major shifts in terms of onsite and (inaudible).And I think, in terms of the margin point that you pointed out, it's important to note, I mean, as we continue to hire locally, look, you have some resources that will be a little bit more expensive than resources that we have leveraged in the past on visas. But I think, overall, when you look at it, the total cost when we include them, migration costs, the travel costs, it's fairly constant. So it doesn't really impact margins significantly, whether you hire individuals locally or leverage.Our next question comes form the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your question. -- Hi. Thank you very much. I also want to ask to, I wanted to start Karen with you on the margins. If I look at your margin performance this quarter, frankly, it was disappointing. And I think the stock is reflecting that. If you take out the benefit of currency and the benefit of the accounting transition, your margin was actually down year-over-year. And it's unclear to me, when you're talking about the 22% margin aspiration for CY '19. You're actually growing more than 100 or intend to grow more than 100 basis points. And it's just hard to reconcile how that margin aspiration isn't going to have revenue consequences and cause your revenues to frankly underperform industry growth rates? And I'd like to follow up with a question as well. -- So Keith, you also have to keep in mind that in Q3 of this year which we do not have last year. We also had the raises in promotions, which was about a point of margin impact. So, when you look at what's happening certainly in the quarter, while there was some benefit for the rupee on a year-to-date basis, the rupee benefit is about zero. And while there has been some benefit, obviously, from the new rev rec, we've also had about 80 basis points of true operational improvement through continued driving of utilization, as well as managing the pyramid and our SG&A cost effectively as well.So we are extremely comfortable with both where the company is performing today, we are exactly inline with the goals that we set for ourselves, which was approximately 21% margin this year and on-track to deliver the -- approximately 22% margin target for next year. As we have always said, we do not anticipate exceeding the margin target for the year, we will continue to take any dollars that we can and continue to reinvest those in the business above the 21% and continue to drive the shift to digital. We're very pleased with how that transition is taking place. We're very pleased with the solid revenue growth that the company has had for the year and the fact that we are very much in line with the expectations we set out both for ourselves and with our shareholders at the beginning of this year. And this is a big transition that the company is going through, but we believe managing very well both at the top line and at the bottom line, and we'll continue to do so. -- My follow-up is to Francisco. And it's -- I want to ask a question that was asked slightly differently, previously. But there has been some newspaper articles written about succession issues at Cognizant. And you are a member of the Board. And frankly, your stock has underperformed almost every metric from the last one, two and three years. And I'm just curious how you think the Board takes that into account when thinking about succession issues in terms of looking internally versus externally and thinking about succession plan? Thank you. -- Keith, let me just -- I'll come to that in a second. I just want to go back to the point Karen was making on margin and reiterate the point that Karen made, which is that, we've said that for '18 we will deliver approximately 21% operating margin. In the way we run the business, as we have in the past and as we have for many, many years is, once we've set a target operating margin for a given year or given period we take that very seriously, we deliver to that. But then, we reinvest back in the business, anything above that. So our goal is, this year not to, as Karan said, deliver above the approximately 21% that we are targeting for the year, but to reinvest on top of that as we run the business -- or rather reinvest the excess on top of that back in the business for growth and for the transition that we're going through. And that's sort of the approach to margin.So as Karan said, in any given period we'll have some operational improvements that drive margin improvement. We have some good guys from other parts, from other things that may or may not be inside of our control. The way we look at that sort of as a portfolio of drivers of margin, which we then used to say, how much do we reinvest back in the business for growth and long-term sustainability.Look, I have nothing more to add Keith on the issue of succession, except to what I said. As I said, the Board is constantly looking at this. The issue of succession planning is the responsibility of the Board and we are continuing to assess and continue to make plans on that topic. We have nothing to announce at this point and when the Board is ready to make announcements, we'll do that.Thank you. The next question is from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. -- Hi, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to ask on BFSI. Were there specific large clients that drove the decel (ph) from 2Q and was that all still Europe driven. Just trying to understand what changed there? And can you comment on whether you have any better visibility for a potential inflection point in overall BFSI growth? Thank you. -- Yeah, Brian, this is Raj. Look, overall BFSI, I think it's still a mix of a couple different stories going on. Insurance continues to be strong, we're doing really well on the mid-tier banks. It's good to see now that we're starting to see the shift in North America. All of our North American large banking clients in the last quarter, we saw digital really driving a lot of the growth that we've had. And we're seeing good traction in terms of making the shift on the North American based clients where digital is outpacing some of the losses that we have in terms of just to run-the-bank spending that's going on.So I think North America is in good shape. Some of the -- I would say a couple of the global banking clients that are outside of North America are the places that we still have some challenges, but I think the good news is, we know how to manage that shift and we expect that over a period of time. Those clients as well will significantly start seeing the shift more toward the digital spend.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. -- Hi. Sorry about that, I was on mute. I guess my question is with regards to attrition which remains high. Could you break out voluntary versus involuntary? And what's the plan to reduce it? Also, if you can breakdown by level of organization or function? Any color there would be great. Thanks. -- So, Ashwin, it's Karen. We didn't break out involuntary versus voluntary, but the involuntary in the quarter -- there was no real change from where it's been -- obviously, it'll be fairly small. There was a small restructuring we did over the summer, which was about 200 people at the senior levels. I think what we continue to see is that, attrition tends to be skewed toward the very lower end of the pyramid, for the junior staff attrition at the senior levels, other than what we did with the involuntary program continues to be very, very low, very low-single digits.And we tend to see attrition skewed as usual, a little bit more offshore than on site. So, really no changes in the trend. It's just -- obviously, the overall number has continued to remain a little bit higher than we'd like it to be. But I think a lot of that is driven by the market demand and that we're seeing both with not just competitors, but clients in other companies or I think everybody around the world right now is struggling with the shortage of technology talent.Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. -- Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Raj, I was wondering if you can maybe give us a little bit more color on the dynamic you highlight for several quarters, now about run-the-bank spend versus digital spend? As as we look into 2019, what are your clients on the banking side, telling you about their first of all, overall wallet spend expectations? And secondly, what is the pace of the declines in some of the run-the-bank spend could moderate at all? -- Yeah, Jim. So look, I think it's a little too early right now to start getting into 2019 in terms of the budgets that we have from some of our large clients. The good news is, I mean, based on current trends, I mean, they does look we are optimistic going into next year. Again, as I mentioned, I think we've made that turn in North America where we're starting to see significant spend start coming in, in terms of the digital. I think with especially lot of the large banking clients, you had a lot of in-sourcing that has been going on as well. But I think we've managed to do that and we are starting to see growth in all of our large clients. And I think you'll start seeing that going into next year. The challenge, as I mentioned earlier, right, has been some of the banks that are outside of North America for its (ph) headquarters, they are -- again, you're seeing some in-sourcing in some of the run-the-bank spending, but I think the good news is the relationships are very healthy. We continue to win more than our fair share at those banks. And we're still strategic clients at those banks and I see the same playbook that we used in North America working for us as those banks continue to shift more of their spend toward digital into next year, so --Thank you. The next question is from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. -- Hey, guys. Thanks. Let me just start off, I mean, a little bit higher level on a macro basis. Can you just provide a little more color on what you're seeing broadly with regard to IT spend from your clients in discussing, as we start to get closer to the end of the year now. Anyone changing their turnaround spending around macro, given macro trends or tariffs or turnover rate concerns or anything else that you're noticing in terms of a pivot in any way, one way or the other? -- Darrin, it's Frank. I'll take that. I don't see that happening. I continue to see clients investing in technology, investing in digital. As I think, Raj said in his prepared comments, I think it's notable that we had the strongest quarter in digital that we've had in the -- excuse me, in retail that we've had in many, many years. If you look at the mix of our clients, another data point that Raj had in his prepared comments is that, in the quarter two of our top 10 clients came from the technology space as opposed to three years ago, where all of our top 10 clients who are in financial services and healthcare.So we haven't seen a shift in demand or in the short term as a result of the -- perhaps what you're alluding to is the volatility that we've seen over the last month or so. We continue to see just clients sort of doubling down now and saying, how do we get to digital at scale and continue to play into that demand as we go into next year.Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Joseph Foresi with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question. -- Hi. I wanted to go back to the margin question. Now, it kind of appears to be a good time to invest to take digital market share. Why not back off the margins and try to grow faster? And then just building on that, has the cost cutting got too disruptive to the culture and do you think -- how do you think about that as you sort of continue to drive toward efficiency? Thanks. -- I'll let Karen also. It's Frank. I'll let Karen jump in here. I think that it's not always the case that there is this trade-off between margins and growth. There seems to be the thesis that there's a direct trade-off between margins and growth. And while at some point that is certainly the case. As we've said for a while and in fact 18 months ago when we did the analysis on the topic, a lot of the core operational improvements that we've done in the business to drive growth are good operating hygiene types of things that we think are opportunities for us just to run the engine better, we've had -- in two months we'll celebrate 25 years of the company. We had 20 something years of very, very strong growth. The focus during those years was less on operational excellence. That creates lots of opportunities for us to optimize things around the business, and those things are just good operating discipline. In most cases, those things don't have a direct impact on growth.And so, while it may seem at the 50,000 foot level that there is a trade-off between margins and growth at the place where we are right now. I feel like we are optimizing places where the company had excess, where the company wasn't optimal, we were not best-in-class relative to our peer set. We're looking at that carefully, we had done that analysis when we began this exercise. We had a third party come in and look at our operational metrics relative to competition. We've identify areas that where we're not best-in-class and we're focused on closing the gap. And in many of those cases, as I said, there isn't a trade-off with growth.As it relates to culture, I think we're building a muscle in the place around operational excellence and around operational discipline. I think that's a good muscle. I think it's a muscle that will serve the company well into the future. And I think that, that is a good muscle to we are building and not one that I think is disruptive to the culture. And Karen if you want to add. -- No, I would -- I think I would echo Joe what Frank said. And I think just add to that, the benefit of what we're doing today is that, because we are growing, this isn't really about cost cutting. In many cases, this is about cost avoidance and really leveraging the investments that we've already made more effectively, particularly around corporate functions and so forth. And if you think about where we have done some headcount reductions, they've been extremely minor. So in 2017 in the summer, we did a voluntary program that -- few hundred people took that program. This year, we did an involuntary program at the senior level, that was 200 people on a basis of 270,000 people plus. That is an absolute net.So I think, as Frank said, this is about getting the organization to think about operational excellence and discipline along with revenue growth. And we think it's a very healthy exercise for us to be going through.Thank you. The next question is from the line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question. -- Hey, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Karen, what are your assumptions for organic growth for Q4? And then you keep on mentioning pruning or pruning of low-margin businesses. Is there any way you can quantify the impact of that pruning on the top-line growth this year or maybe for the quarter? I think any color here could be helpful. Thanks. -- So, on the -- I'll start with the second piece first, Moshe. On the, what we'll call the long tail accounts, there's been very little revenue impact. Again, this is partly going back to the operating muscle that Frank was just talking about is getting the teams to look at clients who are perhaps were not getting the growth and the margin trajectory that we would like to see and contemplating whether there is truly a strategic relationship there, and if not perhaps finding reasonable ways to exit, but the dollars, those are very, very small revenue dollars. And what we tend to see is, some of those come with some of the acquisitions we've done in the past where they may have a handful of clients that we would consider strategic clients where we think there's a bigger market opportunity, then they may have a handful of smaller clients that just won't have the scale to really partner with us in a meaningful way.So that's a constant thing we look, but in the revenue line, it doesn't really have a material impact. In Q4, in the guidance, obviously, we've assumed both the ATG and SaaS focus deals, which closed in October, but those are small, just a few million dollars of revenue. And then, we're anticipating that Softvision will close later in the quarter, but again in terms of Q4 incremental dollars that we expect, that would be very, very small where we get, maybe a few weeks of revenue if that going into the quarter. So beyond that, it's just the acquisitions that we've already done, which is primarily Boulder is the biggest one this year, which we said is running about $35 million a quarter of revenue.Operator. I think we have time for one more question.Yes. The question is coming from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. -- Hi. Good morning, guys. Glad to be back in the call. This one is I think for Frank, maybe Raj. As you're looking forward, presumably a major goal right now for Cognizant is to get your revenue growth to turn and reaccelerate. Can you just talk about what in your view is sort of building blocks for that are, meaning, do you need to get attrition down to a certain level, do you need financial services growth to kind of recover to a certain level, what's the role of acquisitions in that roadmap, is digital mix need to get to a certain level. How do you think about that? -- So, Lisa, I would say -- it's Frank. It's a combination of some of the things that you talked about. I would say, we are -- we're are quite comfortable with the digital portfolio as it is right now, but we'll continue to do acquisitions to strengthen that portfolio of services. Obviously, once Softvision closes, that will be an important arrow in the quiver, as it relates to digital engineering. The second is the turn if you will in banking and financial services. As you saw in this quarter we were quite pleased with the growth in three of our four segments which all showed good growth. Financial services, as Raj said, we see the turn happening in North America where the digital revenue growth is now starting to offset the pressure on the run-the-bank spending when that turn comes to our clients in the rest -- in our financial services clients in the rest of the world, then I think that will remove a drag from a segment perspective. I would point to those two as the two major factors at this point. And it goes without saying that as we execute against our plan, as you've seen for many, many quarters now. The revenue base of the company diversifies away from financial services and healthcare as the other two segments grow faster off a smaller base. And so we view those as large incremental market opportunities in addition to financial services and healthcare that continue to be a large opportunities in their own right.So we think that overall, there is a big market opportunity. The digital portfolio continues to grow at very healthy rates. And so it's a question of focusing that digital portfolio on the large market opportunity that we have. And then, of course, the last lever is our global growth. We continue to expand the footprint of the company to markets outside of our traditional markets in North America and Europe. And so the rest of -- what we call the rest of the world, Asia Pacific continues to be a focus area for us for growth.Good. I think with that we'll wrap up the call. I want to thank everybody for joining us today and for your questions. And we look forward to speaking with you again in just a couple of weeks here at our Investor Day. Thank you.Thank you.

The company's earnings have beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 4.62%.In the last reported quarter (second-quarter 2018), Cognizant's adjusted earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by nine cents.Moreover, the company's top line has beaten the consensus mark in two of the trailing four quarters. In second-quarter 2018, revenues came in at $4.01 billion, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.02 billion but increasing 9.2% from the year-ago quarter.For third-quarter 2018, Cognizant expects revenues of $4.06-$4.10 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be at least $1.13 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $4.08 billion, which reflects year-over-year growth of 8.3%. Moreover, the consensus mark for earnings has been steady at $1.13 over the last seven days.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Cognizant is gaining from steady demand across payer clients and increasing interest in the company's digital, analytics, cloud and virtualization solutions. The company is consistently developing its capabilities to gain from the ongoing digital transition, especially from the integration of the new digital framework with legacy technology platforms. | The company's strategic customer base (clients with the potential to generate $5-$50 million or more in annual revenues) continues to expand. Cognizant now has more than 371 strategic clients.Acquisitions such as the Adaptra, TriZetto, Bolder Healthcare, Mirabeau BV, and the technology and business process services unit of Frontica Business Solutions AS are benefiting the company. Cognizant has not only gained new customers from these buyouts but also expanded its digital delivery capabilities.Notably, acquisitions like Netcentric and Mirabeau strengthened Cognizant's digital leadership in Europe. Outsourcing growth benefited from the acquisition of Bolder Healthcare.The acquisition of Advanced Technology Group (ATG), which has deep Quote-to-Cash (Q2C) domain expertise and offers extensive Salesforce based CPQ and Billing solutions, strengthens Cognizant's cloud solutions portfolio.Moreover, the acquisition of privately-held consulting firm, SaaSfocus expands Cognizant's end-to-end digital transformation services in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, particularly Australia and India. Notably, SaaSfocus is one of the largest independent Salesforce Platinum consulting partners in this fast growing region.However, the company faces significant geographic, domain and customer concentration risks. Further, lackluster spending by large banks in the financial services sector and stiff competition in the IT services market are concerns.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

The company already has significant exposure to the fast-growing verticals like financial services and healthcare.

The company is consistently developing its capabilities to gain from the ongoing digital transition, especially from the integration of the new digital framework with legacy technology platforms. | Further, accretive acquisitions such as the Adaptra, TriZetto, Bolder Healthcare, Mirabeau BV, and the technology and business process services unit of Frontica Business Solutions AS are benefiting the company. Cognizant has not only gained new customers from these buyouts but also expanded its digital delivery capabilities.Notably, acquisitions like Netcentric and Mirabeau strengthened Cognizant's digital leadership in Europe in the last reported quarter. Outsourcing growth benefited from the acquisition of Bolder Healthcare.Most recently, Cognizant announced the acquisition of Advanced Technology Group (ATG), which has deep Quote-to-Cash (Q2C) domain expertise and offers extensive Salesforce  based CPQ and Billing solutions. The acquisition strengthens Cognizant's cloud solutions portfolio.Moreover, the acquisition of privately-held consulting firm, SaaSfocus expands Cognizant's end-to-end digital transformation services in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, particularly Australia and India.

To get help keeping up with the rapid pace of advances in the tech industry, many enterprises turn to  (NASDAQ: CTSH) and its expertise with IT systems and solutions. Yet even though  has been extremely rewarding to shareholders, the company's performance more recently has raised questions about whether  that made it the industry powerhouse it's become.Coming into Tuesday's third-quarter financial report, Cognizant investors expected to see solid gains in earnings and sales from the tech consultant. The IT consultant was largely able to deliver on those expectations, but some still weren't satisfied about the slowdown that the company saw in a key sector as well as the somewhat lackluster guidance it gave for the remainder of the year.Image source: Cognizant.Cognizant's third-quarter results were largely favorable, although some weren't satisfied with the long-term trends that remained in place. Revenue climbed 8.3% to $4.08 billion, which matched up well with what most of those following the stock were looking to see. Despite a 4% hit to GAAP net income due to currency impacts that resulted in bottom-line profit of $477 million for the period, adjusted earnings of $1.19 per share topped the consensus among investors for $1.13 per share.For the most part, Cognizant saw solid contributions from most of its business segments. The most successful division in terms of revenue growth was the communications, media, and technology group, which enjoyed 17% gains from the third quarter of 2017. Similarly, the products and resources division posted a nearly 12% rise in segment revenue. Even on the healthcare front, which is Cognizant's second most important category, sales climbed almost 10%, sustaining healthy levels of overall growth.But once again, Cognizant wasn't able to get the growth it wanted from its key financial services segment. There, top-line growth was limited to 2.6%, and although the unit remains the most important contributor to overall revenue, its lagging growth rates have allowed smaller segments to catch up considerably over the past couple of years.Looking at Cognizant's global operations, the company still got the bulk of its revenue from North America and Europe. Sales in North America were up 7.5% from year-earlier levels, and after a long period of underperformance following the Brexit decision, U.K. revenue at Cognizant returned to a more attractive 8% growth rate. In the rest of Europe, sales were up almost 22%, and that helped to offset the stagnant 0.4% rise in revenue for Cognizant's rest-of-world segment -- the one that took the biggest hit from currency-related moves in the Indian rupee versus the U.S. dollar.CEO Francisco D'Souza was generally upbeat with the news. \"Cognizant delivered strong third-quarter results in three of our four business segments,\" D'Souza said, and \"we made continued progress in our shift to digital by building new capabilities and helping our clients excel with digital services and solutions.\" The CEO highlighted the importance of helping its clients give their end-users the digital experience they now expect.Cognizant is also confident that its long-term strategy will result in building momentum. Even in financial services, the company said that banking and insurance saw modest growth, and expansion of digital services has resulted in returning growth with large banking clients. Cognizant also expects to use its healthy balance sheet to pursue strategic moves to bolster its capabilities, including some recently announced acquisitions that will add expertise in cloud-based processes and software engineering.Once again, though, Cognizant wasn't able to make all of its investors happy about its immediate future prospects. Guidance for the fourth quarter included sales projections of between $4.09 billion and $4.13 billion, which was slightly less than the $4.17 billion consensus among investors, and adjusted earnings of at least $1.05 per share seemed considerably below the $1.13 that those following the stock want to see next quarter. Full-year calls for $16.09 billion to $16.13 billion in sales and adjusted earnings of $4.50 per share or more were similarly conservative.Cognizant shareholders weren't entirely pleased with the results, and the stock fell 4% in  following the announcement. Ideally, what investors would like to see from Cognizant is more sustained growth, especially in the lagging financial services industry. Until they get it, it'll be tough for the IT consultant to rebound from its sluggish performance lately.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The press release  barely mentioned Flannery, and the shares reacted with a 15% gain in the pre-market, opening for trade Oct. 1 at $13.The new CEO is former lead director Larry Culp, who had settled into a sinecure  . Culp was replaced as GE's lead director by former  (NYSE:  ) CEO Flannery had taken over from Jeff Immelt in June 2017. That press release included  and a quote from him. Along with the new hire, GE said it would take  on its power unit. The company's fall began with Immelt's purchase of the French engine company Alstom in 2015, which he called its  at the time.However, GE's board was not happy with the slow pace of change under John Flannery. Can Larry Culp do what Flannery couldn't?Flannery had been given the unenviable task of fixing what Immelt broke, a \"transformation\" from the financial-and-entertainment giant built by Jack Welch into a faltering industrial conglomerate making engines, oil rigs and healthcare equipment.Flannery responded to the financial crisis by halving the GE dividend and breaking General Electric into pieces, selling what he could and refocusing GE on the power unit. That proved his undoing, as concerns that its  were apparently the final straw for the board. The turbines apparently have an \"oxidation issue\" that means they  to customers.The turbine troubles were also  for many GE shareholders. The problem was announced in the middle of September and, within two weeks, a successor had been recruited and Flannery was out the door. The company was worth less than $100 billion at the end of September, less than half what it was worth when Flannery was appointed from GE Healthcare.GE had announced in June it would look to sell GE Healthcare to focus on power and aviation. While Flannery announced these two major re-organizations of the company, he was  . It is now possible those plans may be revisited.Culp is a true outsider, having been CEO of  (NYSE:  ) from 2000 to 2014. There, according to GE's press release, \"he led the highly successful transformation of the company from an industrial manufacturer into a leading science and technology company,\" increasing its market cap five-fold. This hints at Culp's strategy.Culp is quoted in the press release calling GE \"fundamentally strong\" and promising to deleverage the balance sheet. He also said he will work on \"opportunities for continued board renewal,\" an indication that more board members may soon be replaced.  consists almost entirely of outsiders, with three from financial companies and only one from technology,  (NASDAQ:  ) CEO Francisco D'Souza.Culp, a 1990 graduate of Harvard Business School, was profiled by the school's magazine  . He helped integrate industrial testing company Fluke into Danaher before becoming its COO, then CEO after the man who hired him, George Sherman, retired.When Culp left Danaher at age 51, after 14 years in charge, he said he wanted to seek new challenges That's because at Danaher, Culp had turned an industrial company into a healthcare company, and it's hope for that kind of transformation that is behind the stock's rise in the pre-market. Immelt had moved GE headquarters from Stamford, Connecticut to Boston, and if Culp can turn it around, that may prove to have been the best thing he ever did.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (NASDAQ: CTSH) has been around for about 25 years, providing essential consulting services that help other companies compete more effectively in their industries. In the early 2000s, Cognizant experienced exponential growth as it helped companies navigate the disruptions being caused by the growth of the internet and e-commerce. The stock has absolutely crushed the  index since its initial public offering in the late 1990s, returning roughly 30,000% to shareholders.While it may not be the nimble upstart it was 20 years ago, Cognizant continues to see rising demand for its services, as companies are racing to adapt to the changes being wrought by the latest technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics, in addition to growth opportunities in mobile and cloud computing.IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.As you can probably guess from the monstrous return on the stock cited above, Cognizant has been a growth machine. Between 2008 and 2017, revenue steadily grew at a compounded annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 20% per year, while net income expanded at a 19% annual rate. Those growth rates have fueled a 350% return for shareholders over the last decade. data by  .Companies continue to turn to Cognizant's team of highly skilled experts across various fields for help in different areas. Some are looking for better ways to reach customers on mobile platforms, while other companies seek solutions for reducing costs and streamlining operations. The number of customers Cognizant serves increased by 8.5% to 357 in 2017, and no single customer made up more than 10% of revenue last year.While total revenue growth has cooled down as it's grown larger, Cognizant is starting to see strong demand for digital services, which rose more than 20% in the second quarter of 2018 against the prior-year quarter. Digital services are nearing 30% of total revenue on an annualized basis. Large tech giants in Silicon Valley have turned to Cognizant for help in monitoring user data and managing their advertising operations. Cognizant has also seen increased demand from banks to set up more efficient ways to detect fraud using AI and machine learning.Overall, Cognizant saw a year-over-year increase of 9% in total revenue in the second quarter. Adjusted earnings per share grew 28% against the prior year. Faster growth on the bottom line resulted from management's implementation of a multifaceted plan to expand adjusted operating margin to 22% by 2019. This plan involves continued expansion of digital services, which carry a higher margin than the company average. Additionally, management is focused on reducing costs by simplifying overhead structure and reducing investment in less profitable services.The digitization of the global economy is creating faster cycles of innovation and change that makes Cognizant's services even more essential if companies want to keep up with their competitors and capitalize on new growth opportunities. This trend will not only create new clients for Cognizant but inevitably cause existing clients to use additional services.On the company's second-quarter conference call, Rajeev Mehta said, \"Some of our large banking clients are spending more on new technologies to transform their businesses. And since our digital revenue with the banking segments is seeing strong growth, we believe we're increasing our share of that change the bank is spending.\"Mehta's comment about the greater share of spending from banks hints at the company's  . Cognizant has developed very close relationships with clients, which are rooted in the high-quality service the company provides. As a client adds more services, the relationship gets stronger. This allows Cognizant to enjoy a fairly predictable revenue stream, since the client runs the risk of losing revenue and experiencing a significant disruption to its business if it were to stop using Cognizant's services.Despite Cognizant's high growth rates over the past few decades, the stock's  is currently 17 times management's 2018 adjusted earnings guidance of $4.50 per share. For a company with a strong economic moat and above-average growth potential, that valuation looks attractive.Cognizant also just initiated its first dividend last year as part of its plan to return $3.4 billion to shareholders by the end of 2018. The new dividend yields 1.05% at the time of this writing, which certainly sweetens the pot.Based on the above, Cognizant is a solid option for investors looking for a stable growth stock for the long term.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

For more details on this strategy,  : While known as the manager with whom many top managers entrusted their own money, Neff was far from the smooth-talking, high-profile Wall Streeter you might expect. He was mild-mannered and low-key, and the same might be said of the Windsor Fund that he managed for more than three decades. In fact, Neff himself described the fund as \"relatively prosaic, dull, [and] conservative.\" There was nothing dull about his results, however. From 1964 to 1995, Neff guided Windsor to a 13.7 percent average annual return, easily outpacing the S&P 500's 10.6 percent return during that time. That 3.1 percentage point difference is huge over time -- a $10,000 investment in Windsor (with dividends reinvested) at the start of Neff's tenure would have ended up as more than $564,000 by the time he retired, more than twice what the same investment in the S&P would have yielded (about $233,000). Considering the length of his tenure, that track record may be the best ever for a manager of such a large fund. : Validea is an investment research service that follows the published strategies of investment legends.

The company's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 3.41%.In the last reported quarter, Cognizant delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.95%. Revenues of $3.91 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased 10.3% year over year, driven by growth in all the four domains.For second-quarter 2018, Cognizant expects revenues in the range of $4-$4.04 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be at least $1.09 per share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings has remained steady at $1.10 over the last seven days, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 18.3%. The consensus mark for revenues currently stands at $4.02 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 9.6%. | Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Cognizant is consistently developing its capabilities to gain from the ongoing digital transition, especially from the integration of the new digital framework with legacy technology platforms. Notably, digital now contributes almost 29% of revenues.Moreover, Cognizant is expected to benefit from its significant exposure to fast-growing verticals like financial services, health care, retail and manufacturing, which contribute almost 80% of revenues.The financial Services segment is driven by growth in insurance companies and mid-tier banks, which offset the softness from large banks. Moreover, higher demand from payer and top-tier consulting clients in the healthcare segment is likely to help the company sustain the momentum.Cognizant is also likely to gain from increasing spending on high growth digital technologies such as digital engineering, cybersecurity, cloud migration, replatforming to the cloud, robotic and intelligent process automation, and Artificial Intelligence (AI).The company's strategic customer base (clients with the potential to generate $5-$50 million or more in annual revenues) continues to expand. Cognizant now has more than 364 strategic clients.Acquisitions have been a key growth driver for Cognizant. Buyouts like that of Boulder Heath, TMG Health, Japan-based Brilliant Service, Adobe partner Netcentric and Zone have widened the company's domain and overall digital delivery capabilities.Additionally, the company gained deep industry expertise and knowledge of the domains through partnerships with top firms like Microsoft and SAP SE.Partnerships with leading IT-firms have enabled the company deliver more value to clients and capitalize on new opportunities. It has also provided a competitive edge against the likes of Accenture, Infosys and Wipro.Moreover, Cognizant's expanding presence in international markets, which are fast growing than those in the United States, is expected to drive top-line growth in the to-be reported quarter.According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

This sent INFY stock below the $20 per share level yet again.The $20-per-share price ceiling has plagued the India-based IT consulting firm since 2000. Profits have seen a massive increase since the height of the tech bubble, which should put upward pressure on the stock long term.Despite the revenue miss, INFY continues to position itself to push its stock higher. This revenue miss does not change the fact that INFY stock can move higher, once it permanently breaks the $20 per share price ceiling.The company reported Q1 earnings per share () of 25 cents. This amounts of a modest improvement from the same quarter last year when the company earned 24 cents per share. Revenues for the quarter came in at $2.83 billion. Though they showed a year-over-year increase of 6.8%, Wall Street had predicted $2.86 billion. This sent the stock down by close to 4% in morning trading.The stock also faces a long-time top. INFY stock hit a high of $23.44 at the peak of the tech bubble in 2000. During this period, it pulled back after breaching the $20 per share mark. It did not reach the $20 per share again until 2016, where the equity again hit the ceiling and came back down.The recent earnings report takes INFY stock below the $20 per share level yet again.Given the long-time survival of this ceiling, investors should expect it to remain in place in the near term. However, the fundamentals may finally remove this psychological barrier.The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands close to 18. That's close to the five-year average P/E of 17.95. Analysts expect profit levels to remain close to the $1.10 per share the company earned last year for another two years. However, they predict $1.34 in earnings for 2021. They also estimate the average annual profit growth of 10% per year over the next five years.Investors also need to pay attention to the dividend. The annual dividend now stands at about 67 cents per share. This translates into a yield of around 3.5%. While this dividend amounts to almost double the average  dividend, it faces some risks.Since the dividend is first paid in rupee, investors assume the currency risk. The dividend also changes frequently in its native currency. Still, since 2011, the dividend has generally trended higher. With a 10% five-year growth rate, the dividend will likely either stay near these levels or improve.Dealmaking backs up this growth. The company partnered with  to develop apps for MindSphere. It also works with  a division of  (NYSE:  ) to provide an inter-bank cash management system to Santander's customers. Considering its partnerships and growth, the company should remain competitive with peers such as  (NYSE:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ), and  (NYSE:  ).INFY stock enjoys many positive factors that can push the stock higher - once it can break its 18-year-old price ceiling. In its Q1 earnings report, Infosys met earnings expectations but saw a slight miss on revenues. This took the stock below the psychologically-important $20 per share level yet again.Although analysts expect earnings growth to stagnate for the next two years, they also believe earnings will see double-digit growth beginning in 2021. A rising dividend with a yield of 3.5% also bodes well for the stock.Both the dividend yield and the P/E above 18 would not break the price ceiling on INFY stock by themselves. However, rising profits and continued dividend increases will build pressure. This pressure will break the ceiling at some point. When this barrier finally falls away, expect INFY stock to spring higher.Discovered almost by accident, Louis Navellier's incredible trading breakthrough has delivered 148 double- and triple-digit winners over the past 5 years - including a stunning 487% win in just 10 months.Learn to use this formula and you can start turning every $10,000 invested  . to review Louis' urgent presentation.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" study of analyst recommendations at the major brokerages shows that International Business Machines Corp (Symbol: IBM) is the #24 broker pick, on average, out of the 30 stocks making up the Dow Jones Industrial Average, according to  .

For the Large Cap US Equity Select ETF (Symbol: RNLC), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $24.74 per unit.With RNLC trading at a recent price near $22.33 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.78% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of RNLC's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.

The company is consistently developing its capabilities for the integration of the new digital framework with legacy technology platforms.Additionally, transactions such as the TriZetto buyout and more recently, the acquisitions of Bolder Healthcare and Mirabeau are likely to benefit the company. Apart from gaining new customers from these buyouts, the company expanded its capabilities in the healthcare industry and improved overall digital delivery abilities.Cognizant is expected to continue benefiting from solid demand for high quality, lower cost technology services. Based on its global delivery model and capacity expansion in low cost areas in India, China, Philippines and Latin America, the company remains well-positioned in the outsourcing market. | However, the company faces significant geographic concentration risks, with North America's significant contribution to its revenues. Cognizant also earns nearly 40% of its revenues from the financial services industry. Therefore, any slowdown in the region's economic environment or consolidation in the financial services industry is anticipated to have a negative impact on the company.Cognizant too faces stiff competition from the likes of Infosys Technologies  , Accenture  , Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro among others, which is an added concern.Furthermore, the company relates to the nature of its business, which necessitates bringing employees into the United States for on-site application maintenance work. With continuous pressure to avoid outsourcing and employment of foreign nationals, the U.S. government under President Donald Trump is mulling to reduce the number of H1-B visas granted each year. This, in turn, might negatively impact Cognizant's performance.Nevertheless, the company's foray into growth-oriented markets, strong domain expertise and ability to keep up with ongoing digital transformation justify the retention of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock in investors' portfolio.A better-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is NVIDIA  sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see The long-term earnings growth rate for NVIDIA is projected to be 10.3%.Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["hares of  have gained 37.7% over the past year, outperforming the 28.5% rally of the  it belongs to.

To make matters worse, a 2 nd consecutive month of decline in household spending will weigh on GDP numbers, the Japanese economy expected to contract in the 1 st quarter, bringing an end to 8 consecutive quarters of growth, its longest stretch of growth since the 80's.The Japanese Yen moved from \u00a5109.099 to \u00a5109.009 against the Dollar upon release of the figures, before easing back to \u00a5109.08 at the time of writing, down just 0.01% for the morning. , retail sales were flat in March, falling short of a forecasted 0.2% increase, following February's 0.6% rise.According to the ABS, a 0.7% rise in food retailing was offset by a fall in spending across all other sectors, with caf\u00e9, restaurants and takeaway seeing the largest fall in sales, down 0.8%, while other retailing (-0.6%), household goods retailing (-0.3%), department stores (-0.5%) and clothing, footwear and personal accessory retailing (-0.2%) also declined.For the 1 st quarter, turnover rose by 0.2%, easing from a 4 th quarter of last year 0.8% rise.The Aussie Dollar moved from $0.75217 to $0.74962 upon release of the figures, domestic consumption continuingly identified as a key risk to the Aussie economic outlook.Out of China, trade data impressed with China's April USD balance jumping from a $4.98bn deficit to a $28.78bn surplus, widening beyond a forecasted $27.50bn surplus.The Aussie Dollar moved from $0.75044 to $0.75038 upon release of the figures, with the positive stats unable to bring an end to morning's Aussie Dollar reversal, with the widening in the trade surplus with the U.S likely to get a negative reaction from the U.S administration, in spite of supporting a positive outlook for growth through the 2 nd quarter.

Whether the EU economic projections can ease some of the pain remains to be seen, but if the economic indicators and data are anything to go by, even the projections will need to be on the bearish side for the 2 nd quarter and that's before considering the possibility of a trade war between the U.S and China.At the time of writing, the EUR was down 0.08% to $1.1913, with $1.18 levels now on the cards, with a downward revision to February's factory orders suggesting that Germany's industrial production may have seen further decline in in March. , it's another quiet day ahead on the data front, with key stats this morning limited to April's Halifax price index figures that are unlikely to have a material impact on the Pound this morning.Focus is on this week's monetary policy meeting and, with no material stats scheduled for release until production and trade data on Thursday, there's little to shift sentiment on policyAt the time of writing, the Pound was down 0.05% to $1.3550, with the Pound giving up gains from Monday, monetary policy divergence remaining in favour of the Dollar.Across the Pond, it's a quiet day on the data front, with stats limited to March's JOLTs job openings out of the U.S, while FED Chair Powell is also scheduled to speak this morning, which will have some influence on the Dollar should there be any policy talk.At the time of writing, the Dollar Spot Index was up 0.13% to 92.866 and, while both Powell and the jobs data can influence, Trump's decision on whether the U.S will remain within the Iran nuclear agreement will also have impact later in the day.Across the borders, stats out of Canada are limited to April's housing start figures that will have a relatively muted impact on the Loonie this afternoon, with NAFTA the key focus for the markets this week.At the time of writing, the Loonie was down 0.24% to C$1.2912 against the U.S Dollar.This  was originally posted on FX EmpireThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , on 5/21/18, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.

Disney's impressive second-quarter fiscal 2018 results benefited from continuing strength at Parks & Resorts segment and stupendous success of Marvel title  , which were enough to mitigate another dismal performance from its ESPN segment.Parks & Resorts gained from significant visitor growth, increased per capita spending and shift in the timing of the Easter holiday. However, higher programming costs negatively impacted ESPN's profitability. The Zacks analyst thinks continued subscriber loss remains a concern for the division.Additionally, higher spending on ESPN+ is likely to hurt profitability. Nevertheless, Disney's scintillating slate of movie titles,  's impressive collections and strong book rates at Parks & Resorts are positive developments that will help the stock to rebound in the rest of fiscal 2018.(You can\u00a0  ).Shares of Strong Buy-ranked  have gained +49.4% over the past year, outperforming the Zacks Construction and Mining industry which has increased +47.6% over the same period. Caterpillar's first-quarter earnings per share (EPS) soared 120% while revenues surged 32% on a year-over-year basis.Higher sales volume owing to improved end-user demand across all regions and end markets drove results. Driven by strong order rates, increasing backlog, positive economic indicators Caterpillar expects adjusted EPS at $10.25-$11.25 for 2018, the mid-point of which reflects year-over-year rise of 56%.The Construction segment will benefit from infrastructure development in China and continued demand improvement in North American residential, non-residential and infrastructure markets. Rising commodity prices will drive Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation's revenues. Cost cutting efforts and additional investments in expanded offerings and services will drive growth.(You can\u00a0  ).Buy-ranked  ' shares have outperformed the Zacks Domestic Automotive industry over the last one year, increasing +6.1% vs. -1.2%. General Motors' first-quarter 2018 earnings and revenues beat expectations. During the quarter, crossover sales rose 23% on a year-over-year basis. However, both earnings and revenues declined on a year over year basis.The Zacks analyst thinks the company's capital allocation strategy, initiatives to make its vehicles more advanced, safer and fuel efficient and focus on technology development are major positives. Its restructuring activities are also expected to benefit the company in the long run. Also, the company is raising investment in emerging markets to boost global sales.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  ,  ,  ,  and  .The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Disney, Caterpillar and General Motors. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today. 's shares have lost -5.3% year to date, underperforming the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry's -2.4% decline in that same time period. Disney's impressive second-quarter fiscal 2018 results benefited from continuing strength at Parks & Resorts segment and stupendous success of Marvel title  , which were enough to mitigate another dismal performance from its ESPN segment.Parks & Resorts gained from significant visitor growth, increased per capita spending and shift in the timing of the Easter holiday. However, higher programming costs negatively impacted ESPN's profitability. The Zacks analyst thinks continued subscriber loss remains a concern for the division.Additionally, higher spending on ESPN+ is likely to hurt profitability. Nevertheless, Disney's scintillating slate of movie titles,  's impressive collections and strong book rates at Parks & Resorts are positive developments that will help the stock to rebound in the rest of fiscal 2018.Shares of Strong Buy-ranked  have gained +49.4% over the past year, outperforming the Zacks Construction and Mining industry which has increased +47.6% over the same period. Caterpillar's first-quarter earnings per share (EPS) soared 120% while revenues surged 32% on a year-over-year basis.Higher sales volume owing to improved end-user demand across all regions and end markets drove results. Driven by strong order rates, increasing backlog, positive economic indicators Caterpillar expects adjusted EPS at $10.25-$11.25 for 2018, the mid-point of which reflects year-over-year rise of 56%.The Construction segment will benefit from infrastructure development in China and continued demand improvement in North American residential, non-residential and infrastructure markets. Rising commodity prices will drive Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation's revenues. Cost cutting efforts and additional investments in expanded offerings and services will drive growth.Buy-ranked  ' shares have outperformed the Zacks Domestic Automotive industry over the last one year, increasing +6.1% vs. -1.2%. General Motors' first-quarter 2018 earnings and revenues beat expectations. During the quarter, crossover sales rose 23% on a year-over-year basis. However, both earnings and revenues declined on a year over year basis.The Zacks analyst thinks the company's capital allocation strategy, initiatives to make its vehicles more advanced, safer and fuel efficient and focus on technology development are major positives. Its restructuring activities are also expected to benefit the company in the long run. Also, the company is raising investment in emerging markets to boost global sales. Yet frequent vehicle recalls, high inventory level of passenger cars and unfavorable currency translation effects are few headwinds for the company.Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Capital One and Cognizant.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

For the Vanguard Mega Cap ETF (Symbol: MGC), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $101.98 per unit.With MGC trading at a recent price near $91.89 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.98% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of MGC's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (Symbol: CTSH), Berkshire Hathaway Inc (Symbol: BRK.A), and Anadarko Petroleum Corp (Symbol: APC). Although CTSH has traded at a recent price of $77.86/share, the average analyst target is 15.14% higher at $89.65/share. Similarly, BRK.A has 13.92% upside from the recent share price of $295600.00 if the average analyst target price of $336750.00/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting APC to reach a target price of $73.50/share, which is 11.36% above the recent price of $66.00.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Tuesday, shares of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks! -- Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. This morning, I'd like to cover two topics. First, a few highlights from our Q1 performance, and second, an update on how we're competing effectively and scaling up our business in the current environment. Let's begin with the quarter. We've gotten the year off to a solid start. First-quarter revenue was $3.91 billion, at the high end of our guided range and up 10% year over year. Our first-quarter digital revenue grew about 27%, well above company average, and represented about 29% of total revenue, reflecting the profile of many of our clients, who are pivoting quickly to digital. Our portfolio of digital services generated above-company average margins and our non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.06.Turning to guidance, we expect second-quarter revenue to be within a range of $4 billion to $4.04 billion. We now expect full-year revenue to be within a range of $16.05 billion and $16.3 billion, a growth of 8.4% to 10%, and we remain confident in our previously stated guidance of achieving a non-GAAP operating margin in 2018 of approximately 21%.Moving to my second topic, thriving in today's environment, Cognizant continues to be one of the world's fastest-growing professional services companies, even at our scale. We've sustained our growth by innovating in response to macroeconomic and technological changes and the resulting shift in our clients' needs. The current environment is defined in part by global economic momentum, accelerating technological progress, and increasing demand for collocating with clients. As a result of these trends, we see tightening labor markets and skill shortages in many parts of the world. To thrive in this environment, we continue to emphasize three broad approaches that I'd like to cover this morning. I'll refer to them as digitize, internationalize, and localize.Let's start with digitize. We have a distinctive approach to digital that really resonates with our clients. We help them become digital to their core, digitizing their products and services, personalizing the experience they offer customers, fully automating their business processes, modernizing their IT infrastructures, and doing all of this in tandem. We use this approach to transform clients' entire enterprises: Their business, their operating, and their technology models.This three-layer transformation enables us to build digital at scale and at speed through our three practice areas: Digital business, digital operations, and digital systems and technologies. This ability to, in essence, run a digital plumb line through all layers of a client's enterprise gives us an edge in pursuing and capturing a significant portion of the huge market opportunity for enterprise transformation. It also serves to expand our presence well beyond the CIO to other decision makers within our accounts, like the CFO, COO, and the Chief Marketing Officer. Reflecting our commitment to partnering with the CMO, we're delighted that Cognizant Interactive, which is part of our digital business practice, was just recognized by  as one of the world's largest digital  agency networks.At the same time, we've built a strong and scalable foundation on which to keep advancing our digital capabilities and leadership. Our growth foundation has many elements. These include our trusted, intimate relationships with strategic clients and our penetrating knowledge of clients' industries, business models, and technology environments. We know how to apply powerful new technologies like artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, virtual and augmented reality, robotic process automation, blockchain, cloud, and more. As clients more fully adopt these technologies, we will be able to use our leadership position in these areas to capture a substantial portion of the growth opportunity for all of the services and solutions that will emerge.In the meantime, our understanding of how to apply these technologies serves to amplify our ability to anticipate clients' needs and rapidly develop solutions at scale and at the highest levels of reliability. Perhaps the most important elements of our growth foundation are our high-end skills, our global and local delivery, and the end-to-end capabilities which include our global consulting teams that advise on strategy, operations, and technology, all of which enable us to build and deliver specialized software platforms and industry-specific solutions to quickly create new value for clients. And therefore, we're sustaining our investment to further scale our digital practices aggressively across industries, geographies, both organically and through acquisitions.Now, with over 80% of our revenue coming from the work we do for clients in financial services, healthcare, retail, and manufacturing, we're at the center of the fintech, health tech, biotech, and smart product revolutions. Our clients depend on us to keep them at the leading edge of these shifts. We do so by developing solutions to advance their businesses. Here are two quick examples. We partnered with an engine manufacturer to identify potential engine failures on long-haul truck runs. We helped the client increase truck utilization and capture 20,000 faults per month, enabling preventive maintenance across a fleet of 150,000 vehicles.We also helped a leading healthcare company save as much as $60 million by identifying 85,000 at-risk patients. We developed an advanced machine learning algorithm to analyze and report on the warning signs of patients who are exhibiting behavior that may indicate patterns of substance abuse. This enables professionals to intervene early to improve these patients' quality of life.We continue to invest to broaden and deepen our services and capabilities, and we've intensified our focus on developing more end-to-end industry-specific solutions. Based on our forward momentum and sustained investment, we expect our digital portfolio to continue to grow at double-digit rates.Our second approach to today's environment is to further internationalize. Non-U.S. markets are, of course, sizable and fast-growing, and the application of digital technologies is absolutely a worldwide phenomenon. Last year, our businesses outside the U.S. crossed the $3 billion revenue mark for the first time. We've expanded our geographic footprint organically, adding new delivery and operations centers as well as collaborators in our key global markets. We have digital at-scale projects under way with the likes of the English Football Association, Soft Bank Robotics, Centrica, Dexia, BHP, and a consortium of Indian life insurers, to name just a few projects.And, many of our acquisitions over the past couple of years have been outside the U.S., among them Idea Couture, Mirabeau, Brilliant Services, Adaptra, Netcentric, and Zone. In essence, we've been methodically planting seeds across Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America, and many of these have already become growth engines for us. In short, we have the clients, the talent, the operating model, and the integrated delivery to excel outside the U.S., and we see the potential for several of our non-U.S. markets to each become billion-dollar businesses early in the next decade.Our third emphasis is on continuing to localize. As you can imagine, when you're partnering with clients to transform their business, operating, and technology models, the need to engage with them locally is essential. In fact, the growing volume of digital at-scale work we're doing typically involves agile development and a deeply consultative, in-person approach with clients. So, we continue to invest extensively in trading and rescaling our teams and in substantially expanding our local workforces around the world.Our goal is to complement the massive delivery capability and operations we have in India with additional specialized points of delivery around the globe. That's why we've built a network of local and regional delivery centers in Europe, Asia, North America, and Latin America. With their proximity to clients, these delivery centers also enable high-quality digital, agile, and secure services that comply with local regulations and have delivered using the technologies and languages clients require. These centers also enable us to hire, develop, and retain talented local people who conserve multiple clients. By the way, as we build skills and capabilities in the local communities where we operate, we're also partnering with educational institutions to establish and fund retraining programs in high-demand digital technologies.To wrap up, our business is strong, as is our ability to sense and respond quickly to market shifts. Our digitized, internationalized, localized approach is serving us well in today's business environment. We're one of a small handful of companies with the range of capabilities to help clients transform at every level of their enterprises. We've developed a strong and scalable foundation on which to extend our leadership as the builder of the digital economy, and we expect our forward momentum to deliver a strong 2018. And now, over to Raj, who will discuss how we're working with clients to speed them along their digital transformation journeys as well as the specifics of our business segment performance. Raj? -- Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. To echo Frank, we feel very good about Cognizant's range of capabilities, business model, and sustained investment. In combination, they're enabling us to be the scale builder of the digital economy and the go-to transformation partner for our clients. I'm going to cover our industry segment and geographic performance, but first, I want to add to Frank's discussion about how we create value for clients, and there's no better way than with a concrete client example.Consider the work we're doing with a top property and casualty insurer of high-net-worth individuals and families. Our client needed help rethinking and redesigning a key moment of truth in their clients' process. This is the point where a policyholder calls to report an accident or damage to property. Of course, people are often stressed when they make such a call, so that experience can determine client satisfaction and retention. Cognizant developed an analytics platform informed by artificial intelligence to transform this first notice of loss. Our AI solution enables the insurer to audit and analyze conversations between policyholders and customer service representative and guide the rep in real-time about how best to respond.We've brought together machine learning, chatbots, voice-to-text transcription, and analytics to automate repeatable processes. The machine learning alone grew our knowledge gained from reviewing 25,000 policyholder calls. This has improved the quality of the information captured and reduced the likelihood of misunderstandings that can result in litigation or fraud. As a result, insurers saw about a 30% reduction in call length and associated expenses and a 15% reduction in total labor and expect to see significant improvement in client satisfaction.We have many other client engagements under way in which we're doing AI-enabled work that delivers business outcomes of this importance. It's this combination of capabilities, including continued investment in our client-facing teams and further scaling of our practice areas, that equips us to be the go-to partner for our clients' digital at-scale transformations.Let's look now at how our industry segments performed in Q1. Banking and Financial Services grew 6.2% year over year. In the quarter, we had double-digit growth in our insurance business that was driven primarily by large, strategic deals. Insurers are increasingly interested in using advanced technology to transform the customer experience, as conveyed by my earlier example. Moving to banking, we continue to see strong growth among our mid-tier banking clients as they work to transform their business models, which involves greater investment in advanced technologies. As large money center banks report a more positive industry business climate, they're putting more pressure on their run-the-bank spending while stepping up investment and  bank technology. While we're seeing a pickup in this digitally intensive work, we anticipate continued optimization of the legacy portion of our banking business and a modest overall improvement.Turning to Healthcare, our revenue was up 11.8% year over year. We saw consistent demand across payer clients with increasing interest in our digital, analytics, cloud, and virtualization solutions. We continue to invest and position our healthcare practice to capture demand as clients shift their underlying business models from fee-for-service to value-based care. To complement our strong position in the payer market, we've expanded our scope to include the provider network of doctors, hospitals, and other clinicians.We've recently closed our acquisition of casually held Boulder Healthcare Solutions, a leading provider of end-to-end revenue cycle management solutions to hospitals and physicians. Boulder expands our healthcare consulting, IT, and business process services portfolio and extends our leadership in digital healthcare technology and operations. By bringing together Boulder Healthcare with TriZetto, TMG Health, and Top Tier Consulting, we now have offerings that span the payer and provider business value chain.Turning to Products and Resources, we increased revenue 11.4% year over year. Strong growth from our manufacturing and logistics clients continues, which offset sluggish growth in retail. Our strength in the manufacturing, logistics, energy, and utility areas results from our emphasis on leading with digital offerings. An infusion of digital has already made many products smarter and made consumer experience richer. And now, AI-based autonomy, enabled by sensors, data analytics, and machine learning, is making machines far more versatile and self-driven than ever before. This has caused the attention of CXOs, who are increasingly engaging us to implement advanced digital approaches to transform their business models.Communications, Media, and Technology had another strong quarter of broad-based growth, up 18.4% year over year, with an expansion in areas like creating and curating digital content for digital platform providers. The digital economy is all about creating meaningful experiences with personalized content. As we have seen with many of our Silicon Valley clients, this requires the ability to help manage and run digital business to deliver personalized content. These clients seek our help with sheer volume of content monitoring and moderation, particularly as they intensify their efforts to verify the authenticity of user-generated content and scale globally.Looking at our geographies, our markets outside the U.S. continue to exhibit strong growth. Europe grew 22.4% year over year in Q1 including 11.7% positive impact from currency, and the rest of the world was up 11.9% from a year ago including a 310-basis-point positive impact from currency. We now have offices in over three dozen countries, and much of our growth has been enabled by successful localization across many of these countries. The value we create for clients is predominantly knowledge-based work, so we depend heavily on the insights, passion, and collaboration of our global associates. We continually invest in the skills and development of all our associates to keep Cognizant strong and relevant to clients.At the same time, we're aware that our annualized attrition rate of 20.3% this quarter is several points higher than our historic norm for Q1. We believe the high attrition is largely the result of increasing global demand for the very skills we specialize in. The growing shortage of technology talent, particularly in the local markets and the transition our organization has gone through to build a scalable foundation for expanding our digital leadership. We continue to focus on our workforce strategy and management. To sum up, over the past year, we've focused considerable energy and investment in strengthening our foundation for profitable growth and extending our capabilities to help clients succeed in their transformation journeys. Karen, over to you.Thank you, Raj, and good morning, everyone. The business got off to a solid start in Q1, which positions us well to achieve our updated full-year revenue and margin guidance. First-quarter revenue of $3.91 billion was at the high end of our guidance range and represented a year-over-year increase of 10.3% including a positive 210-basis-point impact from currency. Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related expenses, and realignment charges, was 20.3%, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.06.Our Q1 non-GAAP tax rate of 24.6% was higher than expected, primarily due to the updated interpretation of the global intangible low-taxed income -- or GILTI -- provision of the new U.S. tax law. As I will discuss further in the guidance section of my remarks, this updated interpretation of the GILTI provision is estimated to have a full-year EPS impact of $0.09 per share.In the first quarter, we demonstrated our commitment to return capital to shareholders through launching a $300 million accelerated share repurchase -- or, ASR -- program in March, with completion expected during the second quarter. This ASR marked the second piece of our expected $1.2 billion share repurchase by the end of 2018. Today, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share for shareholders of record at the close of business on May 22nd.Additionally, during the quarter, we repatriated $2 billion of earnings that were available for distribution to the United States as a result of U.S. tax reform. We have already deployed approximately 25% of that cash through the acquisition of Boulder. We are continuing to evaluate the implications of U.S. tax legislation on our overall capital return program.Now, let me discuss additional details of our financial performance. Consulting and technology services and outsourcing services represented 58% and 42% of revenue respectively for the quarter. Consulting and technology services grew 10.7% year over year and outsourcing services revenue grew 9.7% from Q1 a year ago. During the first quarter, 39% of our revenue came from fixed-price contracts, and we continue to make progress over the long term, changing the mix of our business to more fixed-price or managed services arrangements.Also, as we've spoken about for some time, we are seeing an increasing trend toward output or transaction-based pricing, and so, beginning with Q1, we are breaking out transaction-based contracts separately, which were approximately 9% of revenue in the quarter. We added seven strategic customers in the quarter, defined as clients that have the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenue, bringing our total number of strategic clients to 364.And now, moving to a discussion on margin, we remain committed to and are on track to achieve our target of 22% non-GAAP operating margin in 2019. In the first quarter, we continued to focus on driving higher-value services in addition to continual improvement in our business, focusing on levers such as sustained higher levels of utilization, optimal pyramid structure, simplification of our business unit overhead structure, and leveraging our corporate function spend more effectively. Our offshore utilization for the quarter was 79%, offshore utilization excluding recent college graduates who are in our training program was 83%, and onsite utilization was 92% during the quarter.Turning to our balance sheet, which remains very healthy, we finished the quarter with $5 billion of cash, short-term investments, and restricted cash. Net of debt, this was up by $33 million from the quarter ending December 31st and up $1.15 billion from the year-ago period. This balance at the end of the quarter includes restricted cash and short-term investments of $507 million. These restricted amounts are related to the ongoing dispute with the India Income Tax Department.Receivables were $3 billion at the end of the quarter. We finished the quarter with a DSO of 75 days, up four days versus last quarter. The adoption of the new revenue recognition standard increased our DSO for the quarter by two days. Our outstanding debt balance was $773 million at the end of the quarter. Our diluted share count was 589 million shares for the current quarter.I would like to now comment on our outlook for Q2 and the full year 2018. For the full year 2018, we expect revenue to be in the range of $16.05 billion to $16.3 billion, which represents growth of 8.4% to 10%. Our guidance is based on the current exchange rates at the time at which we are providing the guidance and does not forecast for potential currency fluctuations over the course of the year. For the second quarter of 2018, we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $4 billion to $4.04 billion, and for the second quarter, we expect to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $1.09. This guidance anticipates a share count of approximately 586 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 27%.For the full year 2018, we expect non-GAAP operating margins to be approximately 21% and to deliver non-GAAP EPS of at least $4.47. This guidance anticipates a full-year share count of approximately 585 million shares and a tax rate of approximately 26%. As I mentioned earlier, our tax rate expectation has increased from our previous guidance due to an updated interpretation of the GILTI provision. The impact of this higher estimated tax rate on EPS is partially offset by our better-than-expected performance in Q1 as well as the expected benefit from the Boulder acquisition, which closed last month. As we receive additional clarification and the interpretation continues to evolve, our estimate of the impact of the GILTI provision could change.Our non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes stock-based compensations, acquisition-related expenses and amortization, realignment charges, net non-operating foreign currency exchange gains and losses, any future adjustments to the one-time 2017 incremental income tax expense related to the tax reform act, and our contribution to the new Cognizant U.S. foundation, which we expect to fund in the second quarter of this year. Our guidance also does not account for the impact from shifts in the regulatory environment in areas such as immigration or tax.In summary, our solid execution in Q1, along with continued investment in the business, has positioned us well to deliver another strong year of revenue and earnings growth in 2018. Operator, we can open the call for questions.Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question and answer session. If you'd like to ask a question, please press *1 on your telephone keypad and a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press *2 if you would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants that are using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing *. In the interests of time, we ask that you limit yourself to one questions. One moment, please, while we poll for questions. Our first question is from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. -- Thanks, good morning. I wanted to ask if there's any change to your organic revenue growth outlook versus 90 days ago. The Boulder Health deal -- I thought that would have had a little bit more impact starting in the second quarter, so can you also maybe update us on the acquisition contribution to revenue this year? Thanks.Sure, Tien-Tsin. Let me take that. So, as you would have seen, obviously, we took up the bottom end of the revenue guidance to 8.4%, which did account for the Boulder acquisition. However, FX also moved against us, so that offset about half of the benefit that we'll get from Boulder this year. So, if you recall, at the beginning of the year, we had said there was about 100 basis points of FX year-over-year impact. That number has now dropped to about a 70-basis-point impact on a year-over-year basis because of the recent movement in the European currencies. -- Got it. So, on the organic revenue side, any change there? Since I'm at it, on the 606 front, can you -- go ahead.On an organic basis, no changes in our guidance other than for Boulder and the FX movement, as we talked about. The 606, as you saw, was a little over $20 million for the quarter. Obviously, that's more of a timing issue than anything because ultimately, that reverses as those contracts mature, so, on a full-year basis, we still don't expect to have a material impact from 606. -- That's for the rest of the year? Okay, thank you, Karen.Our next question is from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. -- Hi, guys. I'll ask my questions up front. Just looking at financial services on the larger bank spend, it doesn't look like we've seen any real pickup and increase in spend there. Secondly, Karen, how long can you guys continue to grow the revenue growth high single digits, low double digits, without growing net headcount much? Thanks. -- I'll take the first part and Karen can answer the second part. Look, our banking portfolio is in transition. Obviously, you're seeing a good, healthy growth in the mid-tier banks, but the challenge is obviously the large money center banks. Honestly, our portfolio is in transition, and one side, you have some of the portfolio which represents more of the legacy work. That continues to get optimized. With that, we continue to evaluate what we think is strategic and to make sure that we continue to deliver high margins on that work.And then, we're starting to see a strong pickup on the digital portfolio at these banks, and we're actually winning a lot of work there. We're winning in mobility solutions, we're winning in legacy app modernization, even some initial work in blockchain. So, the business in digital is really growing at a healthy pace consistent to the overall Cognizant digital growth. So, overall, the business is growing there, but the portfolio -- as the additional digital spend continues, I think we'll start getting back to the healthy, strong growth that we've seen in banking.Bryan, to answer your question about headcount, I do think that as we look to the next few months, we'll start to see headcount increase on an overall basis. There's a number of things -- obviously, we did a great job of bringing up utilization last year, and it held fairly flat on a sequential basis from Q4 to Q1 both onsite and offshore, but I wouldn't want to take it up much beyond where we are right now given the current environment, the demand environment, the need for new skills, and so forth that we're seeing in the marketplace.But, having said that, while you've got headcount growth and strong demand, obviously, in digital, then there are parts of the business were automation and so forth are also helping us to drive utilization and manage headcount more effectively. So, I do think you'll see headcount grow in the coming months, but as we've talked about in the past, I would no longer expect headcount and revenue to grow in line with each other as business continues to evolve. -- Okay. Thanks for the color.Our next question is from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. -- Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just one more on the financials, Karen. If you could maybe talk about the extent to which you expect attrition to tick down, either short-term -- and, what your plans are to reduce the attrition rate over the longer term, and maybe talk about how much of the attrition was voluntary versus involuntary in the quarter. -- Hi, Jim. We don't break out the voluntary and involuntary. The key point to note is the number that we quoted includes everything, includes our attrition that happens in our BPO business, our training pool, all the voluntary, involuntary, and plus the trainees. I think one thing you've got to keep in mind is obviously, we're committed to reducing the number and in terms of attrition, but we've invested a lot over the past seven years around digital, especially with all of our SMAC -- social mobility, analytic, and cloud -- initiatives.In addition to that, we've trained many of our associates around all the digital skills, and so, it's not surprising, especially in this environment that we're at. A lot of our employees, a lot of our associates -- given the latest digital technology skills, it's not a surprise our competitors use that as an opportunity to attract associates, but we continue to monitor the levels. I think we've seen this in the past. During the dotcom days, we had fluctuations in terms of attrition, but we continue to attract, we continue to monitor, we continue to engage our employees, and we think we have a great platform for growth for our associates, and we would expect that the attrition levels are coming down in the future quarters.And also, keep in mind there is some seasonality to attrition. We tend to see attrition spike after bonus payments. You tend to see it spike after promotions, raises, and so forth. If you recall, last year, we deferred our promotions and raises until the fourth quarter, so we've seen a little bit of a change in the seasonality pattern. Obviously, this year, we expect to do raises and promotions on a normal schedule back in early Q3, but there is some seasonality to those numbers. -- Okay, thank you. That's helpful. And then, maybe just as a follow-up, could you maybe provide us with a little bit of an update on your M&A outlook, particularly your willingness to commit to some larger deals rather than some of the tuck-in acquisitions you've been doing thus far? -- I would say largely consistent with what we have said in the past, which is that the primary focus will continue to be small tuck-ins, and as we've said in the past, as we become bigger, the definition of what is small and what tucks in gets larger. Boulder was a little bit bigger compared to things that we've done in the past, but I'm also -- and, I've said that we are open to looking at something that's larger, more transformative, if it's the right thing. We feel like the TriZetto acquisition that we did a few years ago is now well integrated. We have the capability and the capacity, the management bandwidth, to be able to integrate something larger at this point. But, we'll be cautious, and we will only do something large if it makes strategic sense, and the economics work, and we think we can create value for shareholders, obviously.The places that we'd obviously be continuing to look would be things like digital -- we've talked a lot about digital and the progress we've made there. If we found something that could accelerate our shift to digital, we would consider something along those lines. We look at international expansion. We talked about international on the script today in prepared comments. I think those are also interesting potential opportunities. We think there's plenty of growth left for us in non-U.S. markets, so we could look at something like that. And then, of course, we continue -- like we did with TriZetto -- to look at software, and IP, and platforms, and those kinds of assets.Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. -- Thanks, guys. Good morning. I just wanted to ask a follow-up to start on the attrition point, and I wanted to see if you could give us a little bit of color on which parts of the pyramid, perhaps, drove the increase. I know in the past when there's been a spike, it's tended to be at the lower levels and around the middle. Last year, we had that dynamic. Are you contemplating higher wage increases this year vis-\u00e0-vis last year to try and combat some of the war for talent?Sure, Jason. So, in terms of where the attrition is happening, it does tend to be in the lower end of the pyramid, which is historically where we've seen attrition. Over the years, the middle to upper end of our pyramid tends to have very low attrition, tends to be skewed toward offshore, obviously, which is where the vast majority of the junior part of our pyramid is based, so it's fairly consistent with what we've seen during other periods of high attrition. In terms of wages, we will base ourselves on what the market does, both in India and elsewhere around the world, so as that becomes a little bit more apparent as to what competitors are doing, we will certainly make sure that we are competitive in the marketplace in that regard.Thank you. The next question is from the line of Moshe Katri with Wedbush Securities. -- Thanks. Just for clarification, when you spoke about financial services, did you say that you expected a modest improvement this year? And then, just to follow up, is there a way to quantify the portion of the legacy business and financial services just to give us a feel on how to look at the growth of the entire vertical this year? Thanks. -- Yeah, Moshe. What I said is that we're having -- we're starting to see a pickup on the spend on the digital side of the business, and it is growing at a very healthy pace in line with the company. I think with that, as we continue -- in the large money center banks, you're starting to see obviously much healthier with some of the changes with the tax reform, you're starting to see more spending there, so, I would expect that as some of these engagements continue to get larger and more prevalent with the money center banks, at some point, you'll get the increasing demand there to outstrip some of the optimization that's happening on the legacy portfolio.So, in terms of the business, we are growing -- the business is growing, even with all of the focus on some of the optimization. Along with that, you have some of the money center banks also looking at -- with some of the changes in regulatory and amount of work that they've outsourced, to continue to look at some work in-house as well, too. So, overall, with all that, the business is growing, and I would expect some sort of pickup at some point later in the year.Yeah, and Moshe, if I could add to that -- obviously, while banking is growing slower than the overall financial services practice, Q1 was, in fact, its strongest year-over-year growth in the last several quarters. So, while it's still not where we'd like it to be, it's certainly starting to trend in the right direction. And then, in regards to your question of legacy versus digital-type spend, the banking practice is right in line with the company average. The company average is 29% of our revenue right now is digital, and that's right in line with where our financial services practice is as well.Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. -- Hi, thanks. I wanted to start off with a clarification. Karen, when you said full-year, ASC 606 is immaterial for revenues, would that apply to operating income and EPS as well? And then, the question on reskilling, can you comment broadly -- as you roll out technology training and such, what percent of new skills come from new hires versus reskilled people, and does that have an impact on attrition?Ashwin, in terms of the revrec changes, obviously, a lot of this is a timing issue. So, depending on the timing of context, the structure of context, and so forth, revenue will either get pushed forward or deferred, and similarly, on the margin side, what happens is under the new rules, there are more of what I would call the transition or implementation costs that we are required to capitalize than we did in the past. So, you saw a little bit of that impact in Q1. At this point, we're not expecting that to have a material impact on the quarter -- on the year, rather -- but obviously, as new contracts come in, that will certainly make the final determination of what that looks like. I'll turn it over to Frank for reskilling. -- Ashwin, I'm not sure exactly how to answer your question on reskilling. As you know, we reskilled tens of thousands of employees last year. We continue to do that quite aggressively. But, that's not a recent phenomenon. As Raj pointed out, we've been skilling and training, and more than skilling and training, we've been executing projects in the digital area for the better part of seven or eight years now, from the time we first talked to you about SMAC and so on and so forth. And so, we think we've got a very digitally scaled and skilled workforce, and as Raj pointed out, I think part of the reason that we're seeing higher attrition is that competitors view us as a good place to get talent from. Again, that's not inconsistent with what we've seen in past technology transitions.We have a very structured process and a very -- we're very focused. When we reskill or retrain somebody, we get them deployed in the new skills as quickly as we can so that from a career management standpoint, obviously, it's maximizing our investment when we do that, but it's also an important retention tool. So, when you think about how we go through the process, reskilling, retraining, and redeploying is really the primary source, and then we rely on recruiting to fill gaps when our reskilling and retraining and redeploying doesn't create the right skills in the right geographies or the right locations. So, recruiting is sort of, in a sense, the last resort when we can't fill from internally. When I say \"recruiting,\" I mean experienced recruiting, of course. We're always recruiting at the entry level to continue to grow the business.Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. -- Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. I was wondering if I could first start with a follow-up to Jim's question. Maybe outlook for M&A through the remainder of the year, and maybe to follow up, how much cash in the U.S. on the balance sheet might we see? Is there an acceleration there? Maybe with the composition of what your pipeline looks like relative to prior periods -- is that getting more robust? Just a little color on what expectations for the rest of the year might be. -- Brian, I would say the pipeline of small tuck-in acquisitions continues to be robust. I would characterize it as about the same as it's been over the last 12 months -- maybe a little bit more robust, but not meaningfully so. And then, the bigger deals are... We continue to evaluate different things, but those are so unique that I don't think we'd have any more of a substantial pipeline than we've had in the past. We've always continued to look at the bigger deals, but as I said before, we'll be very careful and cautious on what we do, and it's got to be a good fit. So, if we find something that makes sense this year, clearly, we'll look at it and we'll execute on it, but it isn't a foregone conclusion by any stretch that we would do something this year. We'll continue to look and evaluate. I'll turn it over to Karen on U.S. cash.As I talked about on the call, we did bring back about $2 billion to the U.S., which was obviously a benefit we could do after U.S. tax reform. We spent about a quarter of that -- just under $500 million -- on Boulder. Certainly, our objective is to make sure that we have enough flexibility around the world -- not just in the U.S., but in Europe and elsewhere -- to take advantage of transactions as they occur. As Frank said, the timing is not always that predictable. So, certainly, we will continue to evaluate our cash needs around the world and also evaluate the capital return program as we look forward over the next few months.Thank you. The next question is from the line of Rod Bourgeois with DeepDive Equity. Please Proceed with your question. -- Okay, great. I want to ask about how the underlying margin picture might be changing over time. In the industry at large, on the negative side, we've seen margin disappointments at Accenture and IBM, and Infosys just guided to some meaningful margin contraction, and our pricing data do show some challenges in certain key markets. But, on the positive side, your commentary about digital margins has suggested pretty good prospects, so in this context, I want to ask is your path to achieving your long-term margin targets looking more difficult or easier given these big factors in the industry? I'm not asking about guidance. I know your guidance for margin is unchanged. I'm asking about the challenges involving getting to those margin targets and whether the challenges are becoming bigger or smaller as you get closer to 2019.Rod, let me take a stab at that. As you said, there's a number of different factors at play, and as we think about our margin profile and the targets that we set out for ourselves -- the 22% in 2019 -- that was really a compilation of a number of things. So, we knew -- and, I think we said this last year -- that certainly, the 2017 and early 2018 improvements would come from utilization and optimizing some of our SG&A spend and some of our business unit overhead spend, and certainly, we've been right on track with the benefits that we expected to achieve from that. We took a lot of those actions in '17. You're now getting the full-year benefit of that in '18.And then, as we look forward into 2019, it is more about the shift in the business -- so, the shift to digital, which is currently running at higher margin than the core business -- as well as the platform business. As that continues to evolve and mature, that starts to look much more like a nonlinear business and drive higher margins. So, we're right in that pivot of now looking toward the shift in the business mix to continue to drive the margins for next year, so you do have a number of things that are offsetting each other, but we are very comfortable with the trajectory of the business at this point. We've made very good traction on what I would call the cost optimization. There's still more room and things we think we can do around pyramid and driving automation and so forth in the business, but we continue to evolve. And then, obviously, we'll have to see where the market is heading as we get into 2019 and beyond.Our next question is from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen and Company. -- Good morning, thank you. I wanted to ask on healthcare -- can you comment on the overall large-deal healthcare pipeline? And then, how may Boulder affect an integrated large-deal offering across healthcare organizations? Thanks. -- Overall, healthcare continues to do well for us. I think probably one of the few companies that have been able to -- with the investments that we've made in healthcare now that we -- not only the payer side of the business, but we also have an opportunity to expand our provider side of the business as well. Look, in terms of the large pipeline, I think those deals like we have done, those B-pass deals around TriZetto -- there continues to be some large type of deals sort of like the emblem one that we've done in the past, but those take a long time to materialize, so it's hard to predict when they will come in, but we do have some of those out there. And, in addition to that, we've seen a lot of progress around our TMG B-pass solution as well. As you're aware, it addresses the Medicare/Medicaid.So, we're seeing a lot of good traction, and along with that, a lot of new products that are coming out of the TriZetto space as well, the QNXT platform that addresses more of the small player, and then, our Cure Advanced solution as well. So, in addition to that, as you're aware, there's a lot of potential mergers and acquisitions that are out there. We're excited about the opportunity because not only are we working for the company that may get acquired but the acquiree as well, so as those transactions continue to develop, I think there will be a good opportunity for future M&A work as well.If I could just add to that, Bryan, what's nice with the suite of offerings we have now in healthcare and with the Boulder acquisition in particular is it really does open up that full end-to-end market of not just the payers, which is our historical strength, but also the provider market, and with the platforms now that we have between Boulder, TriZetto, and so forth, we can really offer that full-service suite of offerings for clients, and it also opens up a whole new market of clients, not just in the providers, but in the payer space. What we're seeing is now, with the platform business, bigger opportunities for what I would call small and midsized payers who historically wouldn't have had enough spend, frankly, to be significant clients for us, but with the platform business, we can really open up those opportunities now. So, we continue to be very bullish on the long-term benefits and opportunities for healthcare.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer. -- Thanks. Good morning. I'll ask a couple questions up front. Given the size of the Boulder acquisition, maybe you could help us frame the annual revenue contribution, the impact on margins, and give us some sense of what kind of growth expectations for it. And then, the follow-up for Raj would be -- I thought I heard you say that retail was somewhat sluggish, which seems somewhat counterintuitive to me given that the retail environment actually seems fairly solid. So, maybe just some color there.On Boulder, Glenn, we didn't break it out, but it's roughly -- this year will be roughly $100 million of contribution, fairly neutral on the margin line -- a little bit dilutive, but not enough to be material. And then, obviously, we'll expect the synergies to start to kick in, probably not this year, but maybe toward the end of this year or as we get into next year. -- Glenn, look, I think we're starting to see a little bit of pickup in retail, but I think when I compare it to previous years, it's still a little sluggish. We're starting to see that retailers are starting to invest a lot in emerging technologies such as robotic, RPA, and intelligent automation, and even AI algorithms. So, we're starting to see that, but again, when I compare to previous years, it's still a little sluggish for us.Our next question is from the line of Arvind Ramnani with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question. -- Hi. Just a quick clarification. From my understanding, your guidance doesn't include M&A, right?Arvind, our guidance does not include prospective M&A. It includes the benefits of Boulder and the deals that we've already completed, but it does not include prospective M&A. -- Great. Just a broader question on digital -- the definition has certainly evolved from SMAC to digital. Can you comment on what the high growth areas of digital are and how you're able to stay in front of these newer technologies? And also, if you can expand on how you're changing your sales and delivery team's definition of \"digital\" keeps evolving. -- I guess there are a number of different areas within digital, so I'll point out a few of the key high-growth ones. First of all, digital engineering, which is sort of the new way of app development, is obviously high-growth, and continuing within what we call digital systems and technology, things like cybersecurity, cloud migration, replatforming to the cloud -- all of those are high-growth. Within the digital operations business, the higher-growth parts there are, as Raj pointed out, robotic process automation, intelligent process automation, using other forms of automation and artificial intelligence to automate key business processes.And then, within our digital business practice, virtually all of that is higher-growth. You look at things like data and insights, you look at Cognizant Interactive that I just spoke a little bit about during my prepared comments, look at smart products and  in the digital business portfolio. So, digital business is almost entirely all high-growth. That gives you a little bit of a picture. As we've said in the past, there is no real consistent definition of \"digital\" across the industry, so I think our definition is a prudent but somewhat conservative definition. We're trying to give you a good sense of what we think of as the core high-value digital work that we do so that you get a sense of the progress that we're making as we continue that shift.And, I think the second part of your question was on skilling and retraining. I think that we've talked a lot about skilling and retraining, and we're doing a lot of it, equally focusing on rotation of our associates across the business because we think it's important to give people exposure to multiple technologies and skills and capabilities. I think one of the things that's just worth noting is that in many ways, the company has a very strong engine of retraining and reskilling. It's not something that's new in the digital world. We've been reskilling and retraining our employees from Day 1, so we've got a very strong DNA, we've got a very strong capability, and I think reskilling/retraining is something that we do particularly well.Thank you. We've reached the end of our question and answer session. We have time for one final question, which will be coming from the line of Frank Atkins with SunTrust. -- Thanks for squeezing me in at the end. I appreciate it. Quick question -- in your prepared remarks, you talked about driving further international business. Can you talk about demand outside the U.S. -- especially on the digital side and the margin -- for that work? And then, as my second part, can you explain a little bit more clearly exactly what the change was in the view on taxes for the year? Thanks. -- Sure, Frank. Let me talk about growth outside the U.S. As I said during the prepared comments, last year, our non-U.S. markets crossed $3 billion. We still think there's tremendous opportunity outside in growth there. As you know, the economies around the world, and certainly, in the markets where we participate, are largely doing quite well, so we see the same fundamental drivers of growth in many parts of the world as we see in the U.S. -- of digital adoption as we see in the U.S. In some parts of the world, as happens with technology, you even see stronger growth as some economies leapfrog one generation of technology and go straight to digital, skipping over older generations of technology. So, we see good demand around the world, and in general, as we've said, the margin on our digital work is higher than company average margins. Let me turn it over to Karen on the tax question.Sure. So, Frank, regarding the tax rate, I think as we all understand, the new U.S. tax laws were put in place fairly quickly back in the fourth quarter, and as we've gone into 2018, there's just been a lot of folks continuing to look at the language and the tax law and continuing to refine both the interpretation of the laws, and in some cases, there have been some clarifications and updates to that.In particular, the one area of focus that has received some of what I would call reviewed scrutiny is around what they call the global intangible low-tax income, or GILTI. Essentially, what that means for us is that it provides a limit on the amount of foreign tax credits that we're able to get. This was not clear back in the fourth quarter and back in February, when we gave the original guidance, but as we've looked at the laws more closely, at least in its current writing, we believe that that will impact our tax rate for this year, and as we said, it's about $0.09 of EPS.It is possible that there may be some clarifications around this either later this year, or in the future, or perhaps even a complete revision. We're not sure at this point, but for now, we thought it prudent to base our guidance and our tax rate EPS on the law as it is currently drafted, and that's what caused the change in the impact. For anybody who has more questions, you can certainly reach out to us on that, or there will be more clarification in our 10-Q when that is filed later today or tomorrow. -- Great. And, with that, I think we'll wrap up. I want to thank everybody for joining us again today, and for your questions, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thanks, everybody.This concludes today's Cognizant Technology Solutions First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect. --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Cognizant Technology Solutions wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks!The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (NASDAQ: CTSH) has been a key player in the technology revolution over the past 25 years. By providing much-needed information technology consulting services, Cognizant has been able to succeed in  effectively and competitively. Even with some of its rivals having competitive advantages in the form of lower labor costs, Cognizant nevertheless has found ways to keep expanding and growing its footprint.Coming into Monday's first-quarter financial report, Cognizant investors were expecting the company to keep on producing the impressive gains that they've seen in recent quarters. The IT consultant's numbers were solid, but some investors weren't entirely pleased with the pace of growth that its guidance implied. Despite past successes, now's a crucial time for Cognizant to keep moving forward and sustain its momentum.Image source: Cognizant Technology.Cognizant's first-quarter results were reasonably good. Revenue picked up 10% to $3.91 billion, just barely inching over the consensus forecast among those following the stock.  net income eased slightly lower from year-ago levels, but after making allowances for certain extraordinary items, adjusted earnings of $1.06 per share climbed by more than 20% compared to the first quarter of 2017. The figure exactly matched what most investors were looking to see.Cognizant continued to make itself a more balanced operation. The relatively small communications, media, and technology group saw the strongest year-over-year revenue growth, weighing in at 18%. Two of Cognizant's larger segments, healthcare and the products and resources unit, posted double-digit percentage gains of 12% and 11% respectively. Only the financial services division lagged, and even there, gains of 6% were slightly faster than the unit posted in the fourth quarter of 2017.North America still dominates Cognizant's geographical footprint, but growth there has been less impressive than what the IT company has seen abroad. Gains in Cognizant's home market came in at almost 8%, but European sales were up 22%, due in large part to a nice rise in the value of the euro against the U.S. dollar. Revenue from the rest-of-world category rose at a 12% clip.CEO Francisco D'Souza explained the moves behind the company's recent performance, saying, \"Cognizant has built the capabilities and scale to help clients digitize their offerings, create personalized customer experiences, instrument their operations, and modernize their IT infrastructure.\"D'Souza pointed to ongoing progress in Cognizant's shift to digital services and solutions in driving the company forward.Cognizant is still optimistic about the likely consequences of the strategic moves it's made. As D'Souza put it, \"This digital-at-scale value proposition is winning with clients and positioning us well to deliver a strong 2018.\"Yet one source of disappointment came from  . As CFO Karen McLoughlin explained, Cognizant's guidance for 2018 had to be adjusted to \"reflect a higher than originally anticipated effective income-tax rate due to the updated interpretation of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\"As a result, Cognizant now expects adjusted earnings of at least $4.47 per share, down $0.06 from its guidance three months ago. The company did boost the lower end of its full-year revenue expectations by $50 million, setting a new range of $16.05 billion to $16.3 billion. For the second quarter, Cognizant sees sales of $4 billion to $4.04 billion, and adjusted earnings should come in at or above $1.09 per share. The second-quarter numbers weren't as favorable as some had hoped, and the drop in bottom-line projections for the full year came as a disappointment.Cognizant shareholders didn't celebrate the results, and the stock was down 4% in  following the announcement. With plenty of competition in the IT consulting space, Cognizant can't afford to let up in its efforts to grab as much market share as possible with its digital initiatives if it wants to keep up its solid growth from recent years.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

For more details on this strategy,  : While known as the manager with whom many top managers entrusted their own money, Neff was far from the smooth-talking, high-profile Wall Streeter you might expect. He was mild-mannered and low-key, and the same might be said of the Windsor Fund that he managed for more than three decades. In fact, Neff himself described the fund as \"relatively prosaic, dull, [and] conservative.\" There was nothing dull about his results, however. From 1964 to 1995, Neff guided Windsor to a 13.7 percent average annual return, easily outpacing the S&P 500's 10.6 percent return during that time. That 3.1 percentage point difference is huge over time -- a $10,000 investment in Windsor (with dividends reinvested) at the start of Neff's tenure would have ended up as more than $564,000 by the time he retired, more than twice what the same investment in the S&P would have yielded (about $233,000). Considering the length of his tenure, that track record may be the best ever for a manager of such a large fund. : Validea is an investment research service that follows the published strategies of investment legends.

Shares have been on the move with the stock up 8.5% over the past month. QTWO hit a new 52-week high of $52.25 in the previous session. Q2 Holdings has gained 35.4% since the start of the year compared to the 1.4% move for the Computer and Technology sector and the 7.7% year-to-date return for its peer group.The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on February 14, 2018, Q2 Holdings reported EPS of $0.05 vs.the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.02 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 0.02%.For the current fiscal year, Q2 Holdings is expected to post earnings of $0.16 per share on $235.09 million in revenues. This represents a 433.33% change in EPS on a 21.19% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $0.38 per share on $292.64 million in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 139.58% and 24.48%, respectively.Q2 Holdings may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for QTWO? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Q2 Holdings has a Value Score of F. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 316.3X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 713.9X versus its peer group's average of 24.8X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 15.81. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective. | We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Q2 Holdings currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Q2 Holdings meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though QTWO shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.Shares of Q2 Holdings have been moving higher, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks, including Cognizant Technology Solutions  , CACI International  , and Baidu  , all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.However, it is worth noting that the Zacks Industry Rank for this group is in the bottom half of the ranking, so it isn't all good news for Q2 Holdings. Still, the fundamentals for QTWO are promising, and it still has potential despite being at a 52-week high.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Revenues of $3.83 billion were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased 10.6% year over year driven by growth in all the four domains.For first-quarter 2018, Cognizant expects revenues in the range of $3.88-$3.92 billion.

The company serves more than 430 organizations that support more than 70% of the Medicare Advantage and managed Medicaid markets.The company's strategic customer base (clients with the potential to generate $5-$15 million or more in annual revenues) continues to expand. Cognizant now has more than 357 strategic clients.Moreover, acquisitions have been a key growth driver for Cognizant. Buyouts like Japan-based Brilliant Service, Adobe partner Netcentric, and Zone, a U.K. based digital aganecy have widened the company's domain and overall digital delivery capabilities.The acquisition of TMG Health has expanded Cognizant's position as a leading software-as-a-service (SaaS) healthcare partner in a growing market for government programs.Additionally, the company gained deep industry expertise and knowledge of the domains through partnerships with top firms like Microsoft and SAP SE.The partnerships with leading IT-firms have enabled the company to deliver more value to clients and capitalize on new opportunities.

Non-GAAP earnings (excluding the effect of US tax law changes) of $1.58 per share, outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents and improved 18.8% year over year. Also, revenues increased 15% year over year to $9.6 billion and surpassed the consensus mark by 3.2%.Furthermore, the company's surprise history has been impressive as it surpassed the consensus mark in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of 3.8%. For the fourth quarter, the consensus estimate moved down 1.7% over the past 30 days.Notably, shares of Accenture have gained 28.4% in the past year, significantly outperforming the  's 24.1% rally.In fiscal 2017, Accenture closed 37 acquisition deals worth $1.7 billion. So far this year, the company has either closed or is in the process of acquiring five businesses. Over the last three fiscals, Accenture has invested approximately $3.4 billion in acquiring nearly 70 companies or start-ups.For fiscal 2018, the company anticipates to invest close to $1 billion on acquiring assets. This is because acquisitions have enabled Accenture to enter new markets, diversify and broaden its product portfolio, and maintain its leading position. Going ahead, such buyouts are expected to contribute significantly to the company's revenue stream. | Accenture's strategy of enhancing its cloud capabilities through acquisitions and partnerships should benefit the company. This is evident from the recent forecast by several independent research firms. According to a research firm, Gartner, the public cloud services market is likely to witness a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.3% during the 2016-2019 period, reaching $383.4 billion by 2020 end.In fact, we believe that exponential growth in the amount of data, complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals compelled several companies to turn to cloud-computing vendors. Therefore, considering the growing need for cloud-based applications and software, Accenture's investments in this space are anticipated to propel long-term growth.Accenture has strengthened its digital marketing capabilities through some significant acquisitions, including Reactive Media, Acquity Group Ltd., dgroup and OCTO Technology. Again, the company inked a deal to acquire New York-based digital agency, Meredith Xcelerated Marketing, last month.Accenture Interactive is a well-integrated platform, enabling CMOs to devise marketing strategies and derive higher ROI (return on investment) from it. Considering the growing need for digital marketing, we expect Accenture's investment in digital and marketing capabilities to boost its long-term growth. This will also facilitate the company in effectively competing with other digital marketing service providers such as IBM, Deloitte and Dell.Although acquisitions improve revenue opportunities along with business mix and profitability, it adds to integration risks as well. Moreover, frequent acquisitions are a distraction for management, which might impact organic growth moving ahead.Further, competition from companies like Genpact  , Cognizant  and Infosys  is a mounting pressure. In fact, competition is particularly tough in the case of resurgent regions like Europe, since all the major players are fighting for business. This naturally increases pricing pressures.Accenture carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see  .It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

But with ever changing market dynamics, this may not yield the desired results every time. Therefore, using conventional strategies, based on key fundamentals, to choose stocks is always a wise decision.One such strategy is sales growth. Maintaining steady sales growth is the key to survival for any business. Sales growth as such remains a vital measure for any corporate house, as it is important to growth projections and strategic decision making.So, when companies incur losses for a temporary period, they are valued based on their revenues, as top-line growth (or decline) is usually an indicator of a company's future earnings performance. Also, in contrast to price to earnings and price to book value ratios, which can turn negative and cease to be relevant, price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is available even for companies that have hit choppy waters.Additionally, profits and book value are largely influenced by several factors including accounting decisions tied with depreciation, significant charges and inventory. However, management has limited opportunities to manipulate sales, which further underscores the importance of P/S ratio.Hence, P/S ratio can serve as a more reliable metric for stock valuation. Focusing solely on sales growth is, however, not enough.A consideration of a company's cash position along with its sales can be a more dependable strategy. Significant cash in hand and steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments.Zacks.com created the first and best screening system on the web earning the distinction as the \"#1 site for screening stocks\" by Money Magazine.

Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock have gained 43.2% in the past year, substantially outperforming the  's rally of 31.0%.The momentum can be attributed to regular customer additions and positive acquisition synergies.Let's delve deeper and find out why the stock is worth retaining.Guidewire has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering a positive average earnings surprise of a whopping 203.86%.On the valuation front too, the stock looks attractive. The company currently trades at a forward P/B multiple of 5.59x, significantly lower than the industry's average of 10.31x.Over the last 30 days, fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 estimates were revised upward, resulting in the Zacks Consensus Estimate rising significantly from 60 cents to 74 cents per share. The figure reflects year-over-year growth of 25.42%.For 2019, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $1.33, translating to a year-over-year rise 31.55%.Further, it has a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 8.00%.Transition from the term license based model to subscription base is anticipated to be beneficial for Guidewire in the long run as majority of the enterprises are expected to lean toward cloud based infrastructure.The company's cloud deployment partner, Amazon Web Services is also gaining momentum and this is a positive. According to Gartner, the global Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) market is expected to increase at a four-year CAGR of 18.4% over 2016-2020 time frame. It reinforces the company's growth prospects further.However, in the near term, it may negatively impact the top line as license revenues include advance payments while subscription-based revenues are a bit delayed.Guidewire's acquisition strategies significantly contribute to growth. The acquisition of ISCS (now called Insurance Now), FirstBest (now called Guidewire Underwriting Management) and EagleEye Analytics (now known as Guidewire Predictive Analytics) are not only bolstering revenue growth but also aiding to expand clientele.However, this move might expose the company to integration risks consequently, creating pressure on cash flow.Guidewire reported stellar second-quarter results and raised fiscal 2018 guidance. The company's elaborate partnership programs, strong performance of subscription products and strategic collaborations remain major growth drivers. The company's Partner Connect Program has been implemented worldwide, benefiting its customers in the property and casualty insurance industry.Recently, the company's services were selected by Atlas Financial, Mutual of Enumclaw Insurance and Mitsui Sumitomo Marine Management (U.S.A.).

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["hen it comes to choosing stocks, investors often opt for complex investment strategies in a bid to book higher returns. But with ever changing market dynamics, this may not yield the desired results every time. Therefore, using conventional strategies, based on key fundamentals, to choose stocks is always a wise decision.One such strategy is sales growth. Maintaining steady sales growth is the key to survival for any business. Sales growth as such remains a vital measure for any corporate house, as it is important to growth projections and strategic decision making.So, when companies incur losses for a temporary period, they are valued based on their revenues, as top-line growth (or decline) is usually an indicator of a company's future earnings performance. Also, in contrast to price to earnings and price to book value ratios, which can turn negative and cease to be relevant, price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is available even for companies that have hit choppy waters.Additionally, profits and book value are largely influenced by several factors including accounting decisions tied with depreciation, significant charges and inventory. However, management has limited opportunities to manipulate sales, which further underscores the importance of P/S ratio.Hence, P/S ratio can serve as a more reliable metric for stock valuation. Focusing solely on sales growth is, however, not enough.A consideration of a company's cash position along with its sales can be a more dependable strategy. Significant cash in hand and steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and investments.In order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected  and  as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy. This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company's revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales. Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in stock price. Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company. This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable. Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see  .Here are five of the 12 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in West Palm Beach, FL,  produces and sells specialty chemical products.

(Symbol: CTSH) saw new options become available this week, for the May 18th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CTSH options chain for the new May 18th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $80.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.60. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $80.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $77.40 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CTSH, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $80.91/share today.Because the $80.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of CTSH stock at the current price level of $80.91/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $82.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.99% if the stock gets called away at the May 18th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CTSH shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CTSH's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $82.50 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $82.50 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

The year-over-year growth was driven by robust performance of its product offerings like NSX and vSAN.Notably, VMware beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in all of the trailing four quarters. The top line also surpassed the consensus mark in all of the trailing four quarters. | We believe, expanding product portfolio, partnerships with the likes of IBM, Amazon  , Pivotal and Alphabet, along with continuing enterprise deal wins, will continue to drive growth.VMware has collaborated with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to offer an integrated hybrid cloud solution, functioning much like a software-defined data center (SDDC). Apart from the internal servers, this contract enables users to run VMware software (vSphere, Virtual SAN and NSX) on the Amazon cloud.VMware recently expanded VMware Cloud on AWS to Europe. The expansion will allow European users to access a broad range of innovative AWS services including compute, databases, analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), security, mobile, application services and more.VMware also has a similar deal with IBM, which enables the company's VSphere customers to initiate workloads on the IBM SoftLayer cloud infrastructure.Further, the company recently expanded its portfolio of cloud services that now include VMware Hybrid Cloud Extension Service for Private Cloud, Wavefront by VMware Service, Log Intelligence Service and Cost Insight Service.These factors are expected to drive VMware's earnings growth in fiscal 2019.

Moreover, higher domestic cash level will make the technology stocks less susceptible to an anticipated interest rate hike in 2018.Further, improving liquidity level will allow these companies to spend more on the emerging technologies like ADAS, IoT and AR/VR.BlackRock expects ADAS market to grow at least 20% each year through 2025, creating significant growth opportunity for manufacturers of camera lenses, sensors and other items.Per market research firm IDC, global  on robotics and drones solutions will increase 22.1% year over year to $103.1 billion in 2018.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["nvestors on the lookout for stocks with the potential for maximum growth and value investing may consider the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy.This popular strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks with impressive growth prospects that are trading at a discount. GARP investing employs popular value metrics - price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book value (P/B) ratio - to evaluate whether a stock is undervalued.The GARP approach helps identify stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Strong earnings growth history and impressive prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.GARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics - price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Novartis (NVS), BP (BP) and Biogen (BIIB). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see  ' shares have underperformed the Zacks Large-Cap Pharmaceuticals industry (+0.8% vs. +3.2%), over the last six months. Novartis' fourth-quarter results beat both earnings and sales estimates on strong performance of Cosentyx and Entresto. The generic division, Sandoz also combatted pricing pressure strongly buoyed by biosimilar launches of Rixathin and Erelzi.Novartis has a strong oncology portfolio of drugs like Afinitor, Exjade, Jakavi, Zykadia, Tasigna, Jadenu and Kisqali. The approval of Kymriah for acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a major boost given the potential in the CAR-T therapy space.Meanwhile, the strategic decision on Alcon to retain the business or separation via capital market transactions such as a spin-off or an initial public offering has been postponed for 2019. However, the loss of patent protection for some of the key drugs in Novartis' portfolio is a cause of concern. Moreover, Kisqali's uptake has been slow.(You can  ).Shares of  are up +16.1% over the last one year, outperforming the Zacks International Integrated Oil industry (up +7.2%). During 2017, the leading integrated energy firm brought online seven key upstream projects. BP is also expected to bring online five more developments in 2018.All these projects along with the developments placed online during 2016 will likely help the energy giant add 800,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to net production capacity by 2020. The firms' fourth-quarter 2017 earnings skyrocketed year over year, courtesy of record oil and gas production and higher commodity price realizations.However, the bottom line missed expectations, thanks to a surge in exploration expenses. Moreover, the oil spill incident of 2010 in the BP-operated Macondo Prospect continues to affect the company. BP anticipates cash out flow related to the incident of $3 billion through 2018 against the prior projection of slightly more than $2 billion.(You can  ). 's shares have outperformed the Zacks Biomedical and Genetics industry over the last year (+20.9% vs. +0.8%). Biogen had a mixed fourth quarter as it beat estimates for earnings but missed the same for sales. However, Biogen issued an upbeat outlook for 2018.Biogen has a strong position in the MS market with a wide range of products including Avonex, Tysabri, Tecfidera & Plegridy. The Zacks analyst likes its efforts to diversify beyond MS to other areas like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and stroke, among others. Meanwhile, its newest drug Spinraza has witnessed strong patient uptake in the U.S. and internationally.However, weakening MS trends is a concern. Tecfidera is witnessing slight decline in U.S. patient demand due to increasing competition from oral medicines and a slowdown in the overall MS market. Meanwhile, the launch of Ocrevus by Roche is beginning to have a negative impact on MS franchise sales in the U.S., mainly on Tysabri.(You can  ).Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Emerson Electric (EMR), eBay (EBAY) and Cognizant (CTSH).Here's another stock idea to consider.

(Symbol: CTSH) saw new options become available this week, for the October 19th expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 238 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CTSH options chain for the new October 19th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $80.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.90. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $80.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $75.10 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CTSH, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $81.26/share today.Because the $80.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of CTSH stock at the current price level of $81.26/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $82.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.29% if the stock gets called away at the October 19th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CTSH shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CTSH's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $82.50 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $82.50 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

Companies like  (NASDAQ: CTSH) that have significant overseas businesses stood to take massive one-time hits from the bill's provisions, but going forward, the impact of lower tax rates and friendlier treatment of foreign income should more than make up for the immediate tax hit. That's one reason why investors have been optimistic about  .Coming into Wednesday's fourth-quarter financial report, Cognizant investors knew that tax reform would be a one-time hit, but they wanted to see signs of underlying growth. What they saw didn't disappoint them, and the company seems poised to keep picking up speed in 2018. Let's look more closely at Cognizant and what its latest numbers mean for its future.Image source: Cognizant Technology.Fourth-quarter results ended the year on a positive note. Revenue gains of almost 11% to $3.83 billion were slightly higher than the numbers most of those following the stock had expected to see. Cognizant posted a small GAAP loss, but after accounting for tax reform and other one-time issues, adjusted operating income of $754 million was up 16% from the prior year's quarter. Adjusted earnings of $1.03 per share topped the consensus forecast among investors for just $0.97 per share on the bottom line.Tax reform did have a sizable downward impact on earnings. Cognizant said that taxes on foreign earnings accounted for $635 million in charges, and a combination of foreign tax and U.S. state income tax will largely wipe out the smaller benefit that came from revaluing deferred tax liabilities that the company owed.As  , Cognizant's most impressive growth has come from some of its smaller business operations. The key financial services segment continued to lead the way forward in terms of putting up the most sales, but its 5.4% year-over-year gain was by far the slowest among its peers. By contrast, healthcare revenue rose at a 12% clip. Gains of 14% and 19% for the products and resources segment and the communications, media, and technology business, respectively, capped strong years for both of the smaller segments. Sequential growth overall slowed to 1.6%, with healthcare leading the way forward.Geographically, Cognizant continued to thrive internationally. North American sales grew just 8.5%, compared to an 18% rise both in Europe and in the company's rest of the world segment. Sluggishness in the U.K. held back Cognizant's top-line growth, but the remainder of the European continent posted breakneck gains of almost 32% to lead the company higher.CEO Francisco D'Souza was pleased with how the company did. \"As companies that are already leaders in their industries integrate their domain knowledge with today's tremendously powerful technologies like artificial intelligence, analytics, and cloud,\" D'Souza said, \"we see a new generation of digital heavyweights emerging.\" He wants to continue the solid execution strategy that has brought Cognizant success in 2017.Cognizant believes it can become a dominant player even in a crowded market. In D'Souza's words, \"Cognizant is resolved to be the go-to partner to these digital-industrial leaders and also to our fast-growing digital-native clients.\"The company's guidance was also favorable. For the first quarter, Cognizant expects revenue of between $3.88 billion and $3.92 billion, and adjusted earnings should come in at or above $1.04 per share. For 2018 as a whole, initial guidance includes revenue of $16 billion to $16.3 billion, with adjusted earnings of $4.53 per share. Both sets of figures are on the high side of what most of those following the tech stock expected to see.Cognizant shareholders were happy with the results, and the stock jumped 6% in morning trading following the announcement.

That is what investors were betting on Jan. 17, with the stock rising 3% in early trading to about $169 per share, its highest level since last April.A growing IBM, or at least one with expanding margins, has ample room to grow in market cap. Even at $169 per share, the stock is trading at just 14 times earnings, absurdly low for a tech stock.

GE stock, which has long been dinged as the Dow's biggest loser, has had a remarkable start to 2018. It is up 6% in just a few trading days, versus a 3% move higher for both the  and  .Has GE stock turned a corner? Is this a case of \"new year, new outlook\" for GE?I think so. Here's why.It is not just GE. Pretty much all industrial stocks have been in rally mode to start the year.Part of it is tax reform optimism. Part of it is more bullish expectations for higher infrastructure spend. Another part of it is underlying commodity strength. In sum, what we have right now is synchronized global economic growth. And when the global economy is ticking higher, industrial stocks go higher with it.GE stock is no exception here. A favorable macro situation won't fix all of GE's problems, but it will help accelerate a recovery in the stock. For example, oil prices are rising quickly and have now passed the $60 mark for the first time in more than two years.A big part of GE's business is oil, so rising oil prices should create an operational tailwind. This tailwind won't fix GE, but it will help the numbers.This is true across the board at GE's businesses. As end-market demand rises across different businesses, GE's numbers will get better. That won't fix GE's problems, but it will help accelerate the turnaround effort.All in all, GE, alongside other industrial names, is a good stock to own amid the strengthening global economy.There isn't much visibility as to where GE will be in 12 months. But GE has some exceptionally valuable underlying assets.Its power business is struggling, but it is still a high-moat, hard-to-replicate business that has tremendous long-term value. The aviation business is equally high-moat and hard-to-replicate, and arguably even more valuable because it actually is growing.The healthcare business is another high-moat and hard-to-replicate business with enduring value. The list goes on and on.GE will spin off some of these business over the next several quarters, and what GE will look like in 12 months is largely a mystery. But it is hard to imagine that a company with so many valuable assets continues to go belly-up.A not-that-unlikely outcome for GE is that the company spins off all its businesses aside from the aviation business, at which point GE turns into a  (NYSE:  ). Go look at a Boeing stock chart. That company isn't doing too bad for itself.Perhaps the most convincing reason to buy GE at these levels is the huge insider buying.When GE dipped below the all-important $20-level (a place the stock hadn't ventured since 2012), insiders started buying. In bulk.Four insiders have together purchased nearly $56 million worth of GE stock while it has languished under $20. And those insiders may be some of the most knowledge people in this sector.The insiders include the CEO of GE, the CEO of  (NYSE:  ), the CEO of  (NASDAQ:  ), and the CEO of  (NASDAQ:  ).That is a smart group. To seem them buying in bulk is a pretty bullish indicator.The turnaround may take some time to materialize, but with the global economy strengthening, insiders buying in bulk, and the dividend cut behind us, this certainly feels like a bottom in GE stock.The best move is buy GE here and wait.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CTSH options chain for the new February 2018 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $70.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.85. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $70.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $68.15 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CTSH, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $71.86/share today.Because the $70.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

For the First Trust NASDAQ-100-Technology Sector Index Fund ETF (Symbol: QTEC), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $79.04 per unit.With QTEC trading at a recent price near $72.06 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.69% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of QTEC's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (Symbol: CTSH), Micron Technology Inc. (Symbol: MU), and Lam Research Corp (Symbol: LRCX). Although CTSH has traded at a recent price of $72.11/share, the average analyst target is 16.49% higher at $84.00/share.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["For most of 2017,  (NYSE:  ) stock has been that kid at the party that no one wants to talk to.While the  has partied its way to a near 20% gain this year, GE stock has lost more than 40% of its value. Weakness in the company's power and oil and gas businesses are to blame, as well as operational mismanagement, which dates back decades.But now people - important people - are starting to talk to that kid at the party.When GE stock dipped below the all-important $20-level (a place the stock hadn't ventured since 2012), insiders started buying. In bulk.Four insiders, including the current CEO, have together purchased nearly $56 million worth of GE stock while its languished under $20.Is that a reason to buy? Yes.The demise of GE has been greatly exaggerated. This company is in some big, complicated businesses that have enduring value. The stock will bounce back. It isn't a matter of \"if.\" It's a matter of \"when\".With insiders buying in bulk now, \"when\" might be relatively soon.The big culprit behind GE's demise is significant weakness in the power and oil and gas businesses. Revenue there is falling and profits are falling even more. General Electric has long been known as a power and oil and gas company. So when those three business segments fail, GE stock does not work.But even with those businesses struggling mightily, GE still only saw organic revenue decline 1% last quarter. Operating profits slipped just 7%, and earnings were off by simply 9%.That isn't so bad. If that's as bad as it gets for General Electric, then the company must be doing a bunch of other things right.Indeed, General Electric is executing on other fronts. Excluding power and oil and gas, organic revenues rose 2%. Aviation and healthcare posted strong quarterly profit gains. All segments, excluding power and oil and gas, expanded profit margins last quarter. Meanwhile, GE is flirting with potentially super-charged growth in the Internet of Things (IoT) segment. GE can tap into this massive growth area by simply attaching a smart sensor to each big industrial device the company sells.Overall, the GE growth story isn't that bad. And the parts of GE that are bad will be cut out over the next 24 months. Management plans to divest $20 billion worth of assets in that time frame. That fat-cutting will come primarily from management's focus on streamlining business operations and simplifying the product portfolio.Meanwhile, GE expects to pull about $2 billion in costs out of the operating model by 2018.The net result will be a streamlined GE focused on growth segments, not scattered across unrelated operating segments. Revenues will be lower, but profit margins will be significantly higher. In the long-term, then, GE stock will be just fine.From this standpoint, buying GE stock is simply a matter of \"when.\"Insiders think that time is now.Over the past 2 weeks, four important insiders have together purchased $56 million worth of GE stock. Here are the purchases:The insiders who bought GE stock over the past 2 weeks are very important and very smart people who know a lot about GE's business.And they bought a ton of GE stock.Their bullish sentiment matches my bullish sentiment that GE stock will only go up from here as the company's operations are streamlined.I think now is a good time to be bullish on GE stock.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" .  reported third-quarter 2017 non-GAAP earnings of 98 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents and increased nearly 14% from the year-ago quarter.

Robust growth in the company's Products & Resources segment along with its Communications, Media and Technology segments boosted its top line.Moreover, the company has gained deep industry expertise and knowledge of the domains through partnerships with top firms like Microsoft  and SAP SE  .This strategy has enabled the company to deliver more value to clients and capitalize on new opportunities. It has also provided a competitive edge against the likes of Accenture  , Infosys and Wipro Ltd.Cognizant's stock has gained 35% year to date, significantly outperforming the 28% rally of the  it belongs to.Segment-wise, Financial services (37.9% of revenues), which includes insurance, banking and transaction processing, grew 3.8% year over year to $1.43 billion. The segment was driven by growth in insurance companies and mid-tier banks, which offset the softness arising from large banks.Healthcare (28.8% of revenues) grew 9.3% year over year to $1.09 billion. Notably, Cognizant completed the acquisition of TMG Health in August, which enabled it to expand its healthcare offerings and thereby cater to growing demand from its payer clients.Products and Resources (20.6% of revenues) continued its growth momentum and surged 14% year over year to $774 million driven by growth in manufacturing, logistics, energy and utilities clients.Communications, Media and Technology (12.7% of revenues) were $480 million, up 18.2% from the year-ago quarter.Region-wise, revenues from North America increased 6.7% year over year and represented 76.8% of total revenues.Revenues from the United Kingdom increased 2.7% year over year (8% of the total revenue). Rest of Europe continued to show strength with revenues soaring 34% from the year-ago quarter.

However, it plunged 4.7% on a year-over-year basis.

Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated to come between 47 and 52 cents. | Teradata revenues are being adversely impacted by the company's ongoing business transformation. Also, restructuring related costs, a sluggish spending environment in the domestic market and increasing competition will continue to weigh on its financials.However, we expect growth to come from new strategic partnerships as Teradata has long-standing business relationships with large organizations such as Accenture  , Capgemini, Deloitte, Cognizant  , IBM  , Wipro Limited, among others in the same niche market. We believe that new customer wins and strengthening relationships with large vendors will primarily drive revenues and profits.The company is expected to benefit from transition to the subscription-based revenue model in the long run.Teradata carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(NASDAQ: CTSH) provides the information technology support that businesses need in order to use tech-related tools to maximum advantage, and the IT specialist's recent focus on what it calls the  has paid off with solid results in past quarters.Coming into Wednesday's third-quarter financial report, Cognizant investors were expecting that the tech consultant would be able to keep growing at a healthy pace. The results showed consistent progress along its long-term growth trajectory, and Cognizant remains confident in its capacity to help more clients upgrade their IT systems. Let's take a closer look at Cognizant to see how it's doing and what's ahead.Image source: Cognizant Technology Solutions.Cognizant's third-quarter results were modestly upbeat, which is a consistent theme from  over the past year. Revenue rose more than 9% to $3.77 billion, matching the consensus growth forecast among those following the IT consultant. Net income came in at $495 million, up 11% from the year-ago quarter, and adjusted earnings of $0.98 per share were better than the $0.95 per share figure that most investors were expecting to see.Cognizant has seen its four primary business units converge in terms of revenue, and that trend continued during the third quarter. The small communications, media, and technology segment experienced the strongest growth rate, with an 18% sales gain compared to the third quarter of 2016. The products and resources unit also saw outpaced segment revenue growth of 14%, making up about a fifth of Cognizant's total business. Year-over-year gains of 9% on the healthcare segment's top line were consistent with the overall company's growth, but the financial services division lagged, posting just a 4% rise in segment revenue. Sequential gains were more measured, with all four segments within a range of 1% to 4% growth.Cognizant also saw stronger performance overseas than in the core North American market. European revenue was up 17%, bolstered in part by a rebound from the U.K., which finally returned to year-over-year growth after fully integrating the negative impact of the Brexit vote into its operations. Outside the U.K., Cognizant saw revenue in Europe jump by more than a third, and a 20% rise in the rest of the world dwarfed gains of just 6.7% in North America.CEO Francisco D'Souza put the results in context. \"We are making consistent progress,\" D'Souza said, \"in executing the plan to accelerate our shift to digital services and solutions.\" The CEO sees the digital at scale initiatives as reflecting Cognizant's ability to help its clients modify their business, operating, and technology practices in a favorable way.Cognizant expects its client relationships to expand in the future. As the consultant gets to know its customers better, it can fully understand their priorities and find the customized solutions to meet those priorities.Those efforts are likely to result in financial performance that's consistent with what investors expect, at least for the immediate future. Cognizant's guidance for the fourth quarter includes revenue of between $3.79 billion and $3.85 billion, and adjusted earnings should come in at or above $0.95 per share. For 2017 as a whole, Cognizant narrowed its revenue guidance to the upper portion of its range from three months ago, and the company now believes that it will bring in between $14.78 billion and $14.84 billion in sales. A minimum of $3.70 per share in adjusted earnings would be $0.03 higher than what it previously expected.Cognizant investors have enjoyed a strong run that has added more than 40% to its share price over the past 12 months. Yet if the technology consultant can take full advantage of favorable conditions in the industry and serve a wider customer base, then its fundamental business could see even more spectacular growth in the future.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In the trailing four quarters, the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions, delivering an average positive surprise of 1.72%.Last quarter, Cognizant delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.33%. Revenues of $3.67 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.66 billion and increased 8.9% year over year driven by growth across all the four domains.For the third quarter of 2017, Cognizant expects revenues in the range of $3.73-$3.78 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be 94 cents per share.Shares of Cognizant have gained 34.5% year to date, significantly outperforming the  26.9% rally.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Cognizant's domain expertise is a key catalyst. The company is consistently developing its capabilities to benefit from the ongoing digital transition, especially when it comes to integration of the new digital framework with legacy technology platforms.Cognizant is significantly benefiting from accretive acquisitions. The buyouts have not only led to an increase in new customers but also enhanced its overall digital delivery capabilities.The company's large exposure to fast growing financial service and health care sector, through partnerships with top firms like Microsoft  , has helped it to outpace Tier-1 peers.Notably, Cognizant completed the acquisition of TMG Health in August. The integration of TMG Health and the company's TriZetto platform reinforces its leading service provider position for the government-managed healthcare programs in the United States. It will enable the company to expand its healthcare offerings and thereby cater to growing demand from its payer clients.Growth in the company's Products & Resources segment along with its Communications, Media and Technology segments is also anticipated to boost its top line. The company's share-repurchase initiatives are expected to drive the bottom line.However, Cognizant is exposed to significant geographic concentration risks with North America contributing to the majority of its revenues. Therefore, opening of its new London Digital Business Collaboratory in July is a positive in our view.Further, competition from peers like Accenture, Infosys and Wipro is a major concern. Besides, increasing investment owing to the TMG Health deal and ongoing development strategies may weigh on margins. | According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive  .

The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (the BEA) revised its previous real GDP growth estimate for the 2nd quarter a final time to +3.1%. The second estimate was +3.0%. The BEA attributed this final revision to an increase in private inventory investment, business stockpiles, and in particular, farm inventories. It's harvest season, right? Revised final numbers barely altered the previous picture of a relatively solid expansion in the second quarter, after a modest first quarter growing at +1.2%.Added to this, this upward second quarter revision has been supplemented by an increase in the ISM manufacturing index, rising to 60.8 in September from 58.8 in August, a 13-year high! The ISM measure includes factors such as output, sales, and hiring. It is a key gauge of conditions in the manufacturing sector. What of the recent series of hurricanes hitting the South of the USA? They do not seem to have affected the ISM index.Both the GDP revisions and ISM numbers suggest an increasing pace to global growth and a relatively soft U.S. dollar continue to support a modest expansion in growth in the internal U.S. economy.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

(Symbol: CTSH) saw new options become available today, for the June 2018 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 248 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the CTSH options chain for the new June 2018 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $72.50 strike price has a current bid of $4.40. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $72.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $68.10 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of CTSH, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $73.74/share today.Because the $72.50 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of CTSH stock at the current price level of $73.74/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $75.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.08% if the stock gets called away at the June 2018 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if CTSH shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing CTSH's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $75.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $75.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

Perhaps in the HOT Tech space?Take a look at the Business Software Services industry. This is a Zacks industry with a sizeable 12 publicly-covered companies. This active Info Tech niche is currently ranked #21 out of 265 industries we rank. That is in the top 8%.The YTD 2017 return is a superb +28%. It's tough to beat share performance like that.Further, it doesn't look like covering analyst earnings upgrades will stop arriving anytime soon. As evidence for that, I see 8 upgrades and just 1 downgrade in our system. The proprietary Zacks Heat Map shows this group has stayed hot, going back 8 weeks in a row, and it is getting hotter over time.A recent industry report (put out by Grand View Research) stated the obvious. Expect the global business software and services  to grow smartly - they say primarily due to a relentless need for transparency and efficiency -- in ever more complex, Info Tech-oriented internal business functions.Furthermore, compliance with stringent government regulations assist the broad implementation of such software.Business software can improve productivity and minimize complexity. Often known as enterprise software and services by this 'wonkie' crowd, their programming efforts facilitate the integration of numerous business processes.Their latest software upgrades assist a smoother flow of information across functions. That makes for quicker decision-making and speeds up both worker and machine-based productivity.The business software industry segments it's programming effort based on functions: usually into finance, human resource and supply chain.The finance function accounts for a maximum share of activity. Software makes it easy to manage different financial activities including investment, accounting, asset management and cash flow management.Yet, the human resource function should show the maximum growth. This is due to ballooning organizations in rapidly expanding companies.A high cost of implementation -- and a high level of competition within this very established market -- acts as the major restraint for those in the business.Now, here are three top Zacks Ranked picks to look into: A Zacks Rank #1 (STRONG BUY). This is a $5.1 billion market cap stock. Though it is priced at $131 a share, the stock garners a B in Value (with a 14.9 Forward P/E), but an F in Growth (where 2017 earnings are at $8.79 and 2018 is at $9.56). That $0.77 in future earnings growth doesn't add up to enough, in a fast-growing space like this.Yet, my colleague Tracey Ryniec wrote up this stock on Oct. 10 th for Zacks Bull of the Day: \" Synnex Corporation is a business process services company. The company provides a range of distribution, logistics and integration services for the tech industry and provides outsourced services focused on a unique customer engagement strategy. It operates in two segments: Technology Solutions and Concentrix. A Zacks #2 Rank (BUY). This is a $44 billion market cap stock. It is priced at $75 a share. Momentum is on. This stock started 2017 as a $55 a share stock. After that nice run up, the stock garners a C in Value (with a Forward P/E at 23) and a C in Growth.Cognizant's strong growth can be attributed to its significant exposure to the fast-growing industry verticals like Financial Services and Health Care.The firm operates in four segments: Financial Services, Health Care, Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics and Other. Headquarters is in Teaneck, NJ.For Finance and Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics, its consulting and technology services include strategy consulting, business and operations consulting, technology strategy and change management, and program management consulting services.Also, they offer application design and development; systems integration; and application testing, consulting and engineering services, as well as enterprise information management services.The company also develops, licenses, implements, and supports proprietary and third-party software products for the Health Care industry.Finally, it provides more generic outsourcing services.The big risk is the stiff competition:  faces significant competition from the likes of  and numerous local providers.That gets me to my last pick\u2026 A Zacks Rank #2 (BUY) stock. This a cheap value stock in the space, currently trading at a technical low near $5 a share. The stock had gotten to $7 a share in recent years. The Forward P/E is 20, which amounts to a Zacks Value rank of B.This is a classic Info Tech outsourcing company, based out of India. 2017 annual earnings look to be $0.27 a share, while $0.29 a share is the 2018 consensus. In its recent Oct. 7 th earnings report,  offered its shareholders just 7 cents a share in quarterly earnings. The company also missed on revenue growth and showed some market stress, with a -0.5% annual revenue growth rate.WIPRO provides comprehensive IT solutions and services, including systems integration, Information Systems outsourcing, package implementation, software application development and maintenance, and research and development services -- to corporations globally.Zacks \"Profit from the Pros\" e-mail newsletter provides highlights of the latest analysis from Zacks Equity Research.  .

Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 1.33%. Notably, over the last four quarters, it has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.6%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We are positive about Accenture's latest product additions in the analytics application space, given the increasing demand for digital solutions. Moreover, the company's strategy of growing through acquisitions is encouraging. These acquisitions have enabled Accenture to foray into new markets, diversify and broaden its product portfolio, as well as maintain a leading position. We believe these will have a positive influence on the company's upcoming quarterly results.Furthermore, the recent forecast for worldwide IT spending by Gartner gave some optimism about Accenture's near-term performance. The research firm estimates worldwide IT spending to grow 2.4% to $3.48 trillion, marking a solid recovery after two consecutive years of decline.The research firm noted two major catalysts which, it believes, will drive IT spending this year. The first catalyst highlighted by Gartner is decline in the U.S. dollar against several foreign currencies. Secondly, the firm foresees an uptick in digital transformation projects in the near term, which will enable organizations to spend more on IT related infrastructure, products, and services. All these encourage us about the company's fiscal fourth-quarter overall performance.Nonetheless, Accenture's February 2017 announcement of creating 15K new jobs by 2020 and investment plan of $1.4 billion for employee training and opening of 10 innovation centers across the U.S. cities may dent its bottom-line results, in our opinion. The company has already started to work on this space, by opening two innovation centers and hiring people over there.The company is believed to be preparing itself for a more protectionist U.S. technology-visa program under President Trump. It should be noted that out of more than 394,000 of its total workforce, 140,000 are in India, which provides it a cost advantage. With the addition of 15,000 new jobs, Accenture's total employee count in the United States will increase by 30% to 65,000, thereby increasing its salary expenses significantly.Additionally, heightening competition from peers such as Cognizant Technology Solutions  and International Business Machines Corporation, as well as an uncertain macroeconomic environment may deter its growth to some extent.Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter's earnings is pegged at $1.46 on $9-billion revenue projection. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Accenture will likely beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below: Accenture's Earnings ESP is -0.29%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . Accenture carries a Zacks Rank #2. Though a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company's negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are a couple of companies which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Paychex, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.06% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see Constellation Brands Inc  , has an Earnings ESP of +0.99%, and carries a Zacks Rank #2.Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

The Zacks analyst also likes its efforts to diversify beyond MS to other areas like Alzheimer's. Meanwhile, Spinraza has witnessed faster-than-expected adoption in the U.S. and Biogen is ramping up launch efforts outside the U.S.However, Biogen has its own set of challenges.

When hedge fund managers appear to be thinking alike, we find it is a good idea to take a closer look.Before we proceed, it is important to point out that 13F filings do not tell the whole story, because these funds are only required to disclose their  positions with the SEC, but are not required to disclose their  positions.

The company is looking to extend its positive momentum with its next batch of results coming Aug. 3 before market open.For the second quarter, management expects revenue to be in the range of $3.63 billion to $3.68 billion, an 8% to 9% increase over last year. Adjusted non-GAAP earnings are expected to be at least $0.89 per share.While revenue and earnings get the most attention in earnings releases, Cognizant investors would be wise to pay attention to these developments at the company.Image source: Cognizant Technology Solutions.In November of last year, activist investment firm Elliott Management put pressure on Cognizant to focus on increasing its profitability. While the company experienced over 20 years of rapid growth, it hasn't all gone to the bottom line. Elliott Management argued that despite a long track record, margins were much lower at Cognizant than at its closest competitors.At the time, Cognizant had an 18% operating margin, while competitors like Tata Consultancy Services and  boasted 26.6% and 25.4% margins, respectively. Cognizant bowed to Elliott's pressure and reached a  with the activist in Feb. 2017.Management has committed to reaching 22% non-GAAP operating margin in 2019. For the second quarter, it should reach 19.4%, a sequential improvement from the 18.9% reported in the previous period.Cognizant has focused on costs, operational efficiency, and increased utilization (the percentage of time consultants spend on billable activities) by slowing the rate of new hires and better aligning resources with customer demand. The company also cut costs by reducing advisory fees, terminating leases, and shutting down facilities. It incurred about $11 million in restructuring costs at the start of the year to drive future savings down the road.On June 22,  (NYSE: ACN) , a major competitor, reduced its outlook for the remainder of the year, citing uncertainty around healthcare legislation. Accenture stock tumbled that day but despite higher exposure to the industry,  .Healthcare accounts for over 28% of its revenue and is still a major driver of overall growth with year-over-year sales increasing nearly 10% in the first quarter. Given the multiple attempts to repeal and/or replace The Affordable Care Act, it'll be interesting to see if Cognizant can continue growing its healthcare segment in the second quarter.Last quarter, company President Rajeev Mehta appeared optimistic despite uncertainty around healthcare legislation:After multiple failures by GOP Senators to repeal the current healthcare law and pass new legislation, they appear to be moving on. However, that uncertainty still remains as President Trump has threatened to cut off federal payments to insurers. Given Accenture's warning, it wouldn't surprise me if customers in the healthcare industry are hesitant to engage with Cognizant as well.With monumental returns since its IPO in 1998, Cognizant investors haven't had to worry much about the company's long-term trajectory. Industry dynamics may come into play in the upcoming report, but the company's shift to cost cutting and operational efficiencies should lead to higher profitability.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be 89 cents per share.Shares of Cognizant have gained 48.5% year to date, significantly outperforming the  's 18.2% rally.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Cognizant is consistently developing its capabilities to benefit from the ongoing digital transition, especially when it comes to integration of the new digital framework with legacy technology platforms. Accretive acquisitions have been a key catalyst in this regard. | Over the past few years, Cognizant outpaced its Tier-1 peers on account of more exposure to fast-growing verticals like Financial Services and Healthcare. High quality, lower cost technology services and strategic partnership with the likes of Microsoft  and SAP SE are also big positives for the company.Moreover, Cognizant's expansion into Latin America with the opening of the new center in Sao Paulo, Brazil is positive for the company's top-line growth. Further, lower share count due to aggressive share buyback is expected to drive earnings in the going-to-be reported quarter.However, the company is witnessing some sluggishness of late in the healthcare and financial sector. Stiff competition from peers like Accenture, Infosys and Wipro is a major concern.Moreover, second-quarter earnings is expected to be negatively impacted by additional costs related to severance (including voluntary separation program) lease termination and other facility-related shutdown costs as well as higher advisory fees.However, our proven model does not conclusively show that Cognizant is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

With approximately 250 employees, apart from life sciences, the company offers its services to various other industries, including chemicals, resources, energy, consumer goods, and government.With the successful completion of the buyout, the company has established a new business division - Accenture Scientific Informatics Services.Accenture is planning to leverage its digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, automation, analytics and cloud, with a fundamental redesign of the scientific user experience. With this, the company's new division will be able to help life sciences companies in better capturing, managing, integrating and analyzing complex research data, thereby giving better ideas to identify new and more effective treatments for patients.We believe that this acquisition will enhance Accenture's portfolio of life sciences services. The acquisition of LabAnswer will not only bring in a huge talent pool, but will also expand its reach in different markets.We are encouraged by Accenture's strategy of growing through acquisitions. These buyouts have enabled the company to foray into newer markets, diversify and broaden the product portfolio, as well as maintain a leading position. We believe that regular acquisitions will significantly contribute to its revenue stream.Notably, shares of Accenture have outperformed the  , over the last one year.

But most of them need help, and  (NASDAQ: CTSH) wants to be  .Coming into Thursday's second-quarter financial report, Cognizant investors wanted to see at least modest gains in revenue and earnings from the IT services provider. Cognizant did better than that, and the tech specialist is hopeful about its prospects for the future. Let's look more closely at Cognizant and what it said about its recent performance.Image source: Cognizant.Cognizant's second-quarter results slightly outpaced what most investors were expecting to see. Revenue was up nearly 9% to $3.67 billion, just barely exceeding the $3.66 billion consensus forecast among those following the stock. GAAP net income nearly doubled to $470 million, but even after taking out the impact of extraordinary items that depressed the year-ago figures, adjusted earnings of $0.93 per share were higher than the $0.91 per share that most shareholders projected.Taking a closer look at Cognizant's numbers, the company's business segments  . The most impressive growth came from the communications, media, and technology segment, posting a 17% rise from year-ago levels. The products and resources unit enjoyed 13% growth, while the larger healthcare segment managed to achieve nearly 10% gains in revenue. The financial services business was the laggard, but even it managed to grow its segment top line by 4%. All of the businesses saw their sales climb from the first quarter of 2017.Cognizant's various regional performance was fairly balanced. North American sales were up 9%, consistent with the performance of the overall business. The U.K. continued to hold Europe back, but the continent still managed a nearly 6% rise. The rest of the world saw revenue climb by more than a fifth, showing the international flavor of Cognizant's business.CEO Francisco D'Souza was happy with how the company did. \"Cognizant delivered strong second-quarter results,\" D'Souza said, \"which reflect our continued progress in helping clients achieve the value of digitizing their entire enterprises.\" The CEO believes that the importance of being \"digital at scale\" is only increasing as more businesses adopt enterprise-based information technology solutions.Looking forward, Cognizant is optimistic about its ability to keep up with and lead innovation going forward. In D'Souza's words, \"We remain dedicated to accelerating our shift to digital services and solutions as we continue to invest in our core business and execute our margin improvement and capital return programs.\"Cognizant gave some favorable comments about its future results that were received well. For the third quarter, Cognizant expects between $3.73 billion and $3.78 billion in sales, with adjusted earnings of at least $0.94 per share. Both figures are consistent with investor expectations. For the fullyear, Cognizant guided investors toward the upper end of its previous revenue range, now expecting between $14.7 billion and $14.84 billion on the top line. The company also gave a $0.03 per share hike to its adjusted earnings target and now believes it will bring in at least $3.67 per share.Cognizant investors were slow to react to the news, but by the end of the day, the stock had finished up by more than 2%. As long as companies continue to want the benefits of digital innovation, Cognizant has positioned itself to be the go-to company to provide the consulting and technical services necessary to make its clients' visions reality going forward.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(Symbol: CTSH) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $68.44, changing hands for $68.83/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 16 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $49.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $75.00. The standard deviation is $7.004.But the whole reason to look at the  CTSH price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with CTSH crossing above that average target price of $68.44/share, investors in CTSH have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $68.44 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.:\n  \nThe average rating presented in the last row of the above table above is from 1 to 5 where 1 is Strong Buy and 5 is Strong Sell.

The IT consulting firm delivered 7% revenue growth, increased its market share, and grew net income 34% from the same period a year ago. Despite its strong quarter, the stock fell as much as 6% after the announcement and ended the day down 4%. One possible reason was that Accenture lowered its annual guidance of 6% to 8% revenue growth to a 6% to 7% increase. The culprit for the reduced outlook was uncertainty around U.S. healthcare policy.CFO David Rowland had this to say about the remainder of the year.After taking an unpopular draft of healthcare legislation off the table earlier this year, the House of Representatives on May 5 voted to pass an alternative plan to replace the Affordable Care Act. However, after opposition from their own party, Senate Republicans recently decided to delay a vote on the replacement bill, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowing to go back to the drawing board to come up with a plan that will garner enough support to pass the Senate.Image source: Getty Images.The uncertainty affecting Accenture's business comes from the unknowns of what future legislation looks like when it will pass, and the aftermath of the change. To add to that uncertainty, President Trump tweeted that he may just push to repeal the Affordable Care Act before having a plan to replace it.Accenture's revenue guidance changed by only 1% on the high end, but the stock still took a decent hit. Given that 17.5% of the company's revenue comes from the health and public service industries, the drop isn't surprising. What is surprising is that competitor  (NASDAQ: CTSH) didn't get similar treatment from Wall Street. With 28.3% of Cognizant's revenue coming from healthcare, the smaller IT consultant is far more exposed to the industry than Accenture is. Yet, on the day Accenture lowered its guidance because of uncertainty over healthcare legislation, Cognizant's stock price remained relatively flat.Part of the reason Cognizant didn't take the hit Accenture did is that healthcare reform may be negatively affecting Accenture more than it's affecting Cognizant. In its most recent quarter, Accenture reported revenue growth of just 1% from the healthcare industry, a marked decline from the same quarter last year, when it delivered 11% growth. Meanwhile, Cognizant's healthcare segment accelerated, with 10% revenue growth in its most recent quarter, compared with only 4% last year.Although Cognizant President Rajeev Mehta did acknowledge the uncertainty around healthcare legislation, his tone wasn't as pessimistic as Accenture.There are a lot of unknowns about where healthcare legislation is going. Accenture is beginning to feel the effects, but Cognizant appears to be getting the benefit of the doubt for now. Whether that optimism changes remains to be seen, but investors will have a clearer picture of the impact of healthcare legislation's effect on Cognizant's business when it reports earnings again in early August. But the level of clarity around healthcare in the United States is another story.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The platform is an interconnected network of different digital technologies that help companies to tackle business issues.\"Genpact Cora allows our clients to deploy leading digital technologies using a modular and scalable platform built on an open architecture that drives flexibility, agility, and long-term investment protection,\" said Sanjay Srivastava, senior vice president and chief digital officer, Genpact.Genpact Cora integrates technologies across three key segments namely, Digital Core, Data Analytics and AI. While Digital Core covers Blockchain and cloud technologies among others, Data Analytics will cover Big Data and Internet of Things (IoT). Machine learning and Data Science will be taken care of by the Artificial Intelligence segment. Reportedly, this is the first-of- its-kind integrated platform and is expected to provide Genpact an edge over others.We note that Genpact has outperformed the Zacks  on a year-to-date basis. While the industry lost 3.9%, the stock returned 16.2% over the same time frame.Artificial intelligence technologies which include machine learning, natural language processing, and data analysis among others, have been gaining momentum in almost all industries worldwide. Per Tractica, AI application revenues will increase from $358 million in 2016 to $31.2 billion by 2025, representing compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 64.3%.Hence, there is significant opportunity for the deployment of AI at enterprises. We believe that Genpact is well positioned to grab this opportunity. The company also announced the acquisition of Rage Frameworks, a provider of AI services on knowledge-based automation technology, in March. The acquisition will meaningfully contribute to Genpact's portfolio, which already includes robotic automation and machine learning.Rage Frameworks recently published a research report based on survey information from a few senior level business executives. While 82% of the participants stated that their organization will be using AI technologies in 2017, 11% said they would think of starting to use AI. Only 7% of the respondents were negative on adopting the technologies. | We believe artificial intelligence will provide the company a competitive edge against its peers such as Accenture  , Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation  and International Business Machines Corp.  .Genpact currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company has approximately 150 employees. Intrepid's client list includes some big names such as WBUR, Procter & Gamble Co.  and Newbury Comics.It should be noted that Intrepid's services are mostly bent toward connected devices.

The acquisition of Intrepid will not only bring in a huge talent pool, but will also expand its reach in different markets.We are encouraged by Accenture's strategy of growing through acquisitions. These buyouts have enabled the company to foray into newer markets, diversify and broaden the product portfolio, as well as maintain a leading position. We believe that regular acquisitions will significantly contribute to its revenue stream.Notably, shares of Accenture have outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry, over the last one year.

ID2020 is a public-private partnership devoted to resolve the challenges of providing digital identity for people all over the world.The main objective behind the collaboration is to create a type of database system which will enable multiple parties to access the same data with a high level of confidentiality and security. We note that Microsoft's very own cloud-based platform Azure will be utilized to deploy this large scale blockchain and biometric technology.Simply put, a blockchain is a chain of blocks, where each block represents an electronic record that cannot be revised or tampered with once it is included in the chain. Each block has its own timestamp and a link to an earlier block in the chain, which enables all the parties to have easy access to information via a secure network.About one-sixth of the world's population is excluded from contributing in cultural, political, economic and social life as it's harder for them to prove their identities through proper documents.That's why this new software tool, revealed at the United Nations, is a major deal. It will help millions of refugees and other people worldwide to present their IDs via an app on their smartphones to immediately prove their identity and location.David Treat, one of the managing directors in Accenture's global blockchain business, stated, \"People without a documented identity suffer by being excluded from modern society.\" Further he added, \"Our prototype is personal, private and portable, empowering individuals to access and share appropriate information when convenient and without the worry of using or losing paper documentation.\"Per MarketsandMarkets, the blockchain market size is estimated to grow from $210.2 million in 2016 to $2,312.5 million by 2021 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 61.5%.

Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 2.31%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.The latest forecast for worldwide IT spending by Gartner raises concerns about Accenture's fiscal third-quarter performance. The research firm lowered its forecast on IT spending for 2017. The recent forecast of 1.4% year-over-year growth in IT spending is 1.3% lower than its previous projection of 2.7% growth. Moreover, as Accenture is the world's leading IT services provider, a decline in IT spending will surely have a negative impact on the company's to-be-reported quarterly results.Furthermore, Gartner cited rising U.S. dollar exchange rate as the main reason behind lowering its estimate. Notably, Accenture derives approximately 54% of total revenue from outside the U.S. in the form of key currencies such as pound, Euro, Australian Dollar and Yen. Thus, a rise in U.S. dollar exchange rate will also adversely affect the company's overall performance, which we may see in the upcoming quarterly results.Additionally, increasing competition from peers such as Cognizant Technology Solutions  and International Business Machines Corporation, as well as an uncertain macroeconomic environment may deter its growth to some extent.Nonetheless, we are positive about Accenture's latest product additions in the analytics application space, given the increasing demand for digital solutions. Moreover, the company's strategy of growing through acquisitions is encouraging. These acquisitions have enabled Accenture to foray into new markets, diversify and broaden its product portfolio, and maintain a leading position. We believe all this have a positive impact on the company's upcoming quarterly results. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Accenture will beat on earnings this quarter.

(Symbol: CTSH) shares, but tentative about paying the going market price of $66.22/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2019 put at the $40 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of 90 cents. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.2% return against the $40 commitment, or a 1.4% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to CTSH's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $40 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. sees its shares fall 39.5% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $39.10 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the 90 cents from $40), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 1.4% annualized rate of return.Interestingly, that annualized 1.4% figure actually exceeds the 0.9% annualized dividend paid by Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., based on the current share price of $66.22. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 39.49% to reach the $40 strike price.Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., looking at the dividend history chart for CTSH below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 0.9% annualized dividend yield.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., and highlighting in green where the $40 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2019 put at the $40 strike for the 1.4% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $66.22) to be 27%.

There are a few lingering concerns which are short-lived. So, the stock has the potential to perform well in the long run.The stock returned approximately 4.43% in the past six months, marginally outperforming the Zacks categorized  industry's gain of just 4.42%.Let's look at the reasons behind Stratasys' solid momentum.The benefit from improved pricing is well reflected in the company's better-than-expected last-quarterly results. In the company's third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, revenues not only increased 5.1% year over year to $8.867 billion but also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.815 billion. The year-over-year increase was aided by a 4% increase in Consulting revenues ($4.82 billion). Outsourcing revenues were up 6% on a year-over-year basis ($4.05 billion).Accenture posted non-GAAP earnings of $1.52 per share, which was a couple of cents ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The non-GAAP figure includes a settlement charge of 47 cents per share related to the termination of its U.S. pension plan. Moreover, earnings increased from $1.41 per share on a year-over-year basis.An encouraging top- and bottom-line performance, which is higher than the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate, helped in boosting investors' confidence in the company's prospects.Further, Accenture provided encouraging revenue guidance for the fourth-quarter. For fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, Accenture expects net revenue between $8.85 billion and $9.10 billion (mid-point $8.975 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $8.97 billion.The company has revised its earnings guidance range for the fiscal 2017 due to a settlement charge of 47 cents related to the termination of its U.S. pension plan. Earnings per share on GAAP basis are now projected in the range of $5.37-$5.44. On non-GAAP basis, it anticipates earnings in the range of $5.84--$5.91. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $5.87.For fiscal 2017, 7 out of 15 estimates over the last 30 days went upwards. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 went up by 1 cent to $5.87 per share over the same time frame.Recently, Accenture teamed up with Microsoft Corporation  to create digital ID databases for more than 1.1 billion people globally, by using the blockchain technology.Per MarketsandMarkets, the blockchain market size is estimated to grow from $210.2 million in 2016 to $2,312.5 million by 2021 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 61.5%. In the report, 2015 is considered the base year, while the forecast period is 2016-2021. We believe that Accenture is well positioned to tap this opportunity.Moving ahead with its cloud first strategy, Accenture recently entered into an agreement to acquire Alexandria-based Phase One Consulting, a cloud computing and digital services provider.Post the completion of the acquisition, Accenture intends to integrate the latter under its Accenture Federal Services subsidiary. We believe that the recent acquisition will not only strengthen the company's Salesforce capabilities, but will also help it in gaining more and more federal contracts, thereby boosting its top-line performance.We are encouraged by Accenture's strategy of growing through acquisitions. These buyouts have enabled the company to foray into newer markets, diversify and broaden its product portfolio and maintain a leading position. We believe that regular acquisitions will significantly contribute to the company's revenues.However, Accenture's recent announcement of creating 15K new jobs by 2020 and investment plan of $1.4 billion for employee training and opening of 10 innovation centers across the U.S. cities may dent its bottom-line results, in our opinion.Additionally, increasing competition from peers such as Cognizant Technology Solutions  and International Business Machines Corporation  , and an uncertain macroeconomic environment may deter its growth to some extent.Notably, the company is on a growth trajectory, gathering momentum from its positive earnings surprise history and strong fundamentals. It delivered a positive earnings surprise in all the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 2.6%.Given that the company's long-term earnings per share growth rate is 10.33% and has a  of \"A\", we believe that the stock still has much upside potential. We can essentially filter the negatives and focus on the positives which drive price.Accenturecarries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Heightening fears involving H-1B visa program, conflict within the top brass, rumors of a stake sale by founders and bad press have been doing the rounds, maligning the reputation of India's second largest IT firm.Though management has nullified rumors of a stake sale, it appears that the other challenges will continue to spook investors, at least in the short run. The share price movement over the past three months mirrors the troubling times, as Infosys' shares have lost 3.8% against the Zacks categorized  industry's gain of 2.0%. Analysts also have their fair share of apprehensions over the company's prospects, and their estimates show a similar trend. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for full-year 2017 earnings has inched down from 98 cents to 97 cents, due to three downward estimate revisions versus none upward.The clouds hanging over the company were strongly reflected in its latest annual filing of the company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Given its array of problems, we believe that Infosys is in for an even bumpier ride in the foreseeable future. Let's take a deeper look at the headwinds, which have significantly thwarted the company's growth drive.The unexpected victory of Donald Trump in the presidential election had sent the Indian IT industry into panic mode, as frontrunners feared Trump's stance on anti-immigration policies. Six months later, matters are still looking unclear as no major changes have materialized yet. However, it is hard to ignore the deafening echo of Trump's \"Buy American, Hire American\" program.Infosys is already feeling the heat - just last month, it had announced plans to hire about 10,000 American workers over the next two years. The company has decided to stop junior employees from applying for H-1B visas to ease things out. The changing times are a direct threat to the company's economical cost structure, which focuses on using its workforce on site located abroad. Infosys' profitability remains questionable till matters relating to the migration policy become clearer.If the external troubles are not enough, in the past few weeks, trouble within the top tier of the management has surfaced, making matters worse. There have been reports about a tussle between the founder and promoters of the company. The company's board has received flak from its co-founder, N.R. Narayana Murthy, over the high compensation of Vishal Sikka, the company's CEO and MD.Rumors of the boardroom bickering continue further. Some sources claim that Murthy has asked chairman R. Seshasayee to step down. However, in a recent interview with Financial Times, Seshasayee denied rumors of the conflict.Infosys' biggest problem at the moment might be the weakening demand of its traditional business, which has put its top line under pressure. Rapid proliferation of customizable internet-based software has been hampering Infosys' traditional outsourcing business. The company is struggling with a precipitous decline in client spending, which continues to thwart growth.Most clients now prefer to seek service delivery through digital technology, adding to Infosys' woes. Also, slower project ramp-ups in large deals are adding to its challenges. The company, considered as a gauge for the health of the $3-trillion global enterprise-spending market, reduced its guidance for fiscal 2018 to 6.1-8.1%, which is much lower than the market's expectations.Also, intensifying competition from established IT peers as well as new competitors is likely to pressurize margins. In fact, the company's growth forecast is lower than that of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation  , which expects to grow between 8-10%. In light of these intensifying problems, the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock has not confirmed its ambitious $20 billion revenue and 30% operating-margin target (expected to achieve by 2021) in its 2016-17 annual report.Some better-ranked stocks in the broader sector include Applied Materials, Inc.  and Cohu, Inc.  . Both Applied Materials and Cohu sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see With four back-to-back beats, Applied Materials has an average positive surprise of 3.3% for the trailing four quarters.Cohu has a striking earnings surprise history, with an average positive surprise of 121.2% for the trailing four quarters, beating estimates all through.At Zacks, we're mostly focused on short-term profit cycles, but the hottest of all technology mega-trends is starting to take hold...By last year, it was already generating $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

The move is part of Accenture's efforts to enhance its digital marketing capabilities through Agile methods. Financial details of the transaction were kept under wraps.SolutionsIQ provides Agile Transformation Solution to improve performance which includes effective digital delivery and shortened cycle time for software development which helps to address the other business needs. The solution helps in improving customer experience and thereby enhances the overall business value.According to Bhaskar Ghosh, group chief executive of Accenture Technology Services, \"This acquisition brings tremendous value to Accenture and our clients.\" He further added, \"Today Agile is more than just a software development methodology. SolutionsIQ coaches will expand our ability to help clients reduce investment risk, accelerate time to market for new products and services, and support design that delivers better customer experiences.\"With this acquisition, the company will be able to help clients in creating, managing, integrating and analyzing value-focused solutions, thereby reducing cost and giving clients heightened responsiveness to change.Accenture pursues strategic acquisitions to diversify its offerings and expand operating markets. Last year, the company completed or signed about 12 acquisition deals across various business segments, including IT security, CRM capabilities and strategy consulting. In 2015, it closed 21 takeovers.These acquisitions have enabled Accenture to foray into newer markets, diversify and broaden its product portfolio and maintain a leading position in the market. A strong cash balance of $3.24 billion and an operating cash flow of $1.24 billion at the end of second-quarter fiscal 2017 are expected to support Accenture's inorganic growth strategy.Shares of Accenture have outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry over the last one year.

Whether this shift is actually occurring or not can be argued, but Buffett agreed with the questioner about the idea of investing in businesses that return gobs of capital with minimal investment. He said, \"Buying a high return on assets, very light capital-intensive business that's going to grow beats the hell out of a business that requires a lot of capital to grow.\"This isn't the first time that Buffett has expressed his fondness for a business with high returns, low capital requirements, and high growth. However, after reiterating his ideal business characteristics, Buffett's followers are likely clamoring to find the next company that matches a few of the Oracle's investing criteria. Let's see if  (NASDAQ: CTSH) fits the bill.Cognizant is in the IT services business, providing consulting and professional services to a variety of clients. With over 260,000 employees, its greatest assets are its people rather than equipment or software. As a result, Cognizant has been able to generate gobs of cash.\n  \nData source: Thomson Reuters. Chart by author. All numbers in millions.Despite the dip in 2016, Cognizant's management has done a solid job generating cash. The company also recently began paying a $0.15 per share dividend and announced a plan to return 75% of its free cash flow to shareholders, through either share buybacks or dividends.While free cash flow is a great metric to analyze a company's performance, a better measure to see if management is adding value is return on equity (ROE). Over the trailing 12 months, Cognizant's ROE came in at 16.5%. While impressive, the downward decline over the past five years is concerning. data by  .A declining ROE is often a sign of either increased competitive pressures or that the company is earning less and less on each dollar invested by its shareholders. A lack of value-added investment opportunities may also be the reason for the company's new shareholder return program. On a positive note, in its most recent quarter ending in March, Cognizant's ROE increased to 22.3%. Assuming the bump is not a head fake, an increasing ROE combined with a strong capital return program can be a boon for Cognizant shareholders.High returns on assets with low capital requirements are often a recipe for a solid investment. However, if you can combine those two traits with high growth, you may be looking at a great investment. Let's see where Cognizant stands in terms of growth.According to data from S&P Capital IQ, Cognizant has grown its revenue at 17.1% annualized over the last five years. Earnings and cash flow growth didn't come in as strong but are fairly solid at 12.3% and 13.8%, respectively, over the same period. Despite strong growth over the last half decade, growth has slowed more recently as the company has matured. In its latest quarter, revenue growth slowed to 10.7%.Despite the slowing growth, Cognizant is not resting on its laurels. The company has been aggressively making acquisitions in the fast-growing digital technology space, gobbling up smaller consultant firms like Idea Couture, Mirabeau, and Adaptra. On March 1, Cognizant made its seventh acquisition in just one year by purchasing Japan-based Brilliant Service Co. Ltd.Cognizant appears to meet Buffett's criteria of achieving high returns, having low capital requirements, and growth. However, there are some concerns about declining returns and slowing growth. That growth also appears to be more and more dependent on acquisitions. Additionally, given Cognizant's footprint in the technology space, I wouldn't exactly call the IT services company an ideal Buffett investment.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

However, the CEOs of  (NASDAQ: CELG) ,  (NASDAQ: CTSH) ,  (NYSE: GE) ,  (NYSE: MA) , and  (NASDAQ: TXN) have been able to achieve this translation very well.You don't have to run a huge enterprise to benefit from the experience and wisdom of the heads of these outstanding companies. Here are five leadership lessons from these exceptionally successful CEOs that are applicable to leaders of organizations of all sizes.Image source: Getty Images.Mark Alles was named CEO of rapidly growing biotech Celgene in March 2016. Before taking the helm, Alles served as president and COO of the company. He joined Celgene in 2004.Alles says some of the most important leadership lessons he learned came from his time as an officer in the U.S. Marine Corps. In  , Alles stated that the \"idea that you must stay focused on developing and establishing the best people at all levels of the organization is something I learned very early as a Marine.\"Celgene seems to like having former Marines in the top spot. Alles' predecessor as CEO, Bob Hugin, also served in the Marine Corps. So did Hugin's predecessor, John Jackson. The Marines' core principle of developing people at all levels of the organization appears to have paid off for Celgene. It ranked as the  of the past five years.Francisco D'Souza was one of the founders of successful international consulting company Cognizant. His tenure with the company dates to 1994, when it was still part of  .In D'Souza's view, the key to effective leadership is in understanding change and moving quickly. He believes that leadership is \"about rapidly understanding the context, having the courage to set a direction based on that understanding of the context, and then building a team and inspiring that team to follow and pursue that direction.\" D'Souza thinks the best way to accomplish this is to trust and empower staff at the front line, because they're usually the ones to pick up on change at the earliest stages.This rapid assessment and response to change has been key to Cognizant's growth. The company has adapted as significant technology shifts occurred over the past two decades. Cognizant is now quickly shifting to the latest change by focusing on digital services and solutions.Jeff Immelt took over the top position at General Electric from a business legend, Jack Welch, in 2001. Since then,  has named Immelt one of the world's best CEOs three times.Jeff Immelt. Image source: General Electric.GE is well known for its leadership training program. However, Immelt has stated that he's \"paranoid\" about making sure the company's leadership development doesn't fall behind. As a result, he has led GE to look outside the company every now and then to see what others are doing. In other words, Immelt's approach is to be a copycat. He's not too picky about whom GE copies, either, citing the U.S. Military Academy and even the Communist Party School in Beijing as sources of ideas.This copycat principle doesn't just apply to developing leaders within the company. GE isn't reluctant to emulate others in its business operations. For example, the company has  to help lower costs and even made a couple of 3D printing acquisitions last year.Ajay Banga has served as MasterCard's CEO since 2010. Banga joined the credit card payment company the previous year after a 13-year stint at  .An alumnus of the Indian Institute of Ahmedabad (IIM-A), the top business school in India, Banga had an opportunity to speak about leadership to the school's graduates in 2015. His top advice about leadership was this: Have a sense of urgency. Banga said the world is moving too quickly for any leader to procrastinate.MasterCard practices what Banga preaches. The company has  that enable it to compete effectively in the marketplace. MasterCard has also made strategic acquisitions to quickly adapt to changing technology, including buying NuData Security for its passive biometrics software that can detect if a user is authorized by how fast he or she types a password or holds a smartphone.Rich Templeton became CEO of Texas Instruments in 2004. He joined the technology company in 1980, right out of college.  has named him among the top-ranked semiconductor CEOs multiple times.When Templeton spoke to graduates at the University of Texas at Austin, his parting words of wisdom were \"don't be afraid to give back.\" His meaning is applicable in several ways. One is by helping others succeed just as others have helped you to achieve your goals. Another is to give back to the community, something that Templeton does in Texas.Templeton also applies his advice to the graduates to the context of giving back to the organization where you work. He says much of his energy goes into leaving TI stronger than it was when he became CEO. It appears that Templeton has attained his goal: TI's stock price has more than tripled since he took the helm.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Yet much of the time, the most solid companies have less exciting but steady and dependable growth. That's been the case lately with  (NASDAQ: CTSH) , which is at the forefront of the shift toward digital IT services and has fought hard to maintain its competitive position in an increasingly cutthroat industry.Coming into Friday's first-quarter financial report, Cognizant investors were looking for the company to keep improving its results bit by bit, and the company largely delivered on those expectations. Let's take a closer look at Cognizant and what its latest results say about its future.Image source: Cognizant.Cognizant's first-quarter results were consistent with its past performance. Revenue climbed 10.7% to $3.55 billion, which was slightly better than most of those following the stock had expected and was a higher pace from the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted net income came in at $669 million, up 5% from a year ago, and that produced adjusted earnings of $0.84 per share. That figure was $0.01 higher than the consensus forecast among investors.Looking more closely at the report, Cognizant once again saw its best performance from its smallest business divisions. The communications, media, and technology segment enjoyed the fastest growth rate, seeing sales climb by nearly 17% compared to year-ago levels. The products and resources group almost matched that growth rate with 16% gain. Yet combined, the two segments make up just a third of Cognizant's overall revenue.Growth rates for the rest of Cognizant's businesses were slower, but still strong. Healthcare enjoyed sales gains of nearly 10%, while the largest group, financial services, brought up the rear with a 7% growth rate. Healthcare saw sequential declines compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, but Cognizant's other units managed to keep their upward momentum.From a geographical standpoint, Brexit once again made the U.K. Cognizant's weakest region, with sales falling 8%. But the rest of Europe made up for the U.K.'s shortfall, salvaging a nearly 7% revenue increase for the region as a whole. North America saw 11% gains in year-over-year revenue, while the rest-of-world region again saw the fastest growth, climbing by more than a quarter.CEO Francisco D'Souza took the quarterly results as a milestone toward more important long-term goals. \"We delivered solid results in the first quarter,\" D'Souza said, \"and continued to build our digital solutions portfolio, expand our skills, and enhance our engagements with clients.\" The CEO is optimistic about the company's ability to move forward.In particular, time is increasingly of the essence for the IT services provider to keep up with competitors. In D'Souza's words:Cognizant's guidance reflected some of that enthusiasm. For the second quarter, revenue should come in between $3.63 billion and $3.68 billion, with adjusted earnings of at least $0.89 per share. Cognizant kept its full-year guidance largely unchanged, with revenue still expected between $14.56 billion and $14.84 billion. The company boosted its adjusted earnings target by $0.01 and now believes it will earn at least $3.64 per share. The IT provider's estimates have generally been solid in the past, and they're consistent with what investors have expected from Cognizant.Cognizant investors seemed reasonably happy with the report, and the stock climbed a bit more than 1% in  following the announcement. Despite the importance of keeping pace in a fast-moving industry, Cognizant's steady growth is reassuring to many tech investors seeking more dependable long-term business models in which to invest.

However, financial details of the transaction were kept under wraps.Headquartered in Sugar Land, TX, LabAnswer is specialized in providing informatics consultancy services to scientific and research laboratories. With approximately 250 employees, apart from life sciences, the company offers its services to various other industries, including chemicals, resources, energy, consumer goods, and government.Upon successful completion of the buyout, the company intends to establish a new business division - Accenture Scientific Informatics Services.Accenture is planning to leverage its digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, automation, analytics and cloud, with a fundamental redesign of the scientific user experience. With this, the company's new division will be able to help life sciences companies in better capturing, managing, integrating and analyzing complex research data, thereby giving them better ideas to identify new and more effective treatments for patients.We believe that this acquisition will enhance Accenture's portfolio of life sciences services. The acquisition of LabAnswer will not only bring in a huge talent pool, but will also expand its reach in different markets.Accenture pursues strategic acquisitions to diversify its offerings and expand operating markets. Last year, the company completed or signed about 12 acquisition deals across various business segments, including IT security, CRM capabilities and strategy consulting. In 2015, it closed 21 takeovers.These acquisitions have enabled Accenture to foray into newer markets, diversify and broaden its product portfolio, as well as maintain the leading position. A strong cash balance of $3.24 billion and an operating cash flow of $1.24 billion at the end of second-quarter fiscal 2017 are expected to support Accenture's inorganic growth strategy. | Accenture's long-term prospects look promising due to its sustained focus on innovative product launches, continuous investments in enhancing digital and marketing capabilities, as well as major acquisitions. Moreover, we believe that regular acquisitions will significantly contribute to the company's revenue stream.Nonetheless, Accenture's recent announcement of creating 15K new jobs by 2020 and investment plan of $1.4 billion for employee training and opening of 10 innovation centers across the U.S. cities may dent its bottom-line results, in our opinion. Furthermore, increasing competition from the likes of DXC Technology Company  and Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation  , and an uncertain macroeconomic environment may deter the company's growth to some extent.Accenture currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock worth considering in the consulting industry is NV5 Global Inc.  , which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Yet the IT consulting field has gotten increasingly competitive, and late last year, Cognizant attracted the attention of activist investor Elliott Management, which urged changes in the way the company does business. Coming into Wednesday's fourth-quarter financial report, Cognizant investors expected solid earnings and revenue gains, and the IT consultant did a good job of producing growth.Yet perhaps more important was a deal with Elliott under which Cognizant will pay a dividend and accelerate its shift to emphasize digital services and solutions. Let's look more closely at Cognizant to see how it did during the quarter, and what's ahead for the IT consultant going forward.Image source: Cognizant Technology Solutions.Cognizant's fourth-quarter results were generally favorable. Revenue was up 7.1%, to $3.46 billion, which was slightly slower than the nearly 8% growth rate that most investors were looking to see.  net income was down 2%, to $416 million, but when you take out stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges, and some other one-time items, adjusted earnings of $0.87 per share were $0.01 better than the consensus forecast among those following the stock, and up about 9% from year-ago levels.Taking a closer look at Cognizant's results, the IT consultant's smaller business segments showed the greatest revenue growth. The manufacturing, retail, and logistics business posted gains of almost 13% in segment revenue compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, and the catch-all \"other\" segment saw sales climb nearly 15%. By contrast, the bigger healthcare segment only posted growth of 5.6% in its top line, and financial services was the laggard, climbing at only a 3.5% pace. Sequentially, financial services actually saw revenue  compared to the third quarter, pulling down gains elsewhere.Geographically, the U.K. once again pulled down the company's growth. Sales there dropped almost 11% on a year-over-year basis. By comparison, North America posted 7% gains, and the rest of Europe soared 22%, bringing the total for the U.K. and Europe up to 2.7% growth. Cognizant doesn't do much business in the rest of the world, but its sales there gained nearly 18%.Yet CEO Francisco D'Souza had his attention squarely focused on the future. \"As we enter 2017,\" D'Souza said, \"the time is right for us to accelerate the shift to digital services and solutions to meet the growing demands from our clients to transform their business models in the face of the rapid business and technology shifts disrupting their industries.\" The CEO went on to note that scaling up its digital capability and improving core efficiency will be essential in driving growth throughout the year.Also, Cognizant will reward investors with a plan to return $3.4 billion in capital to shareholders, meeting some of the demands of Elliott Management. An immediate stock buyback of $1.5 billion and ongoing stock repurchases of $1.2 billion will make up the bulk of the capital program. Cognizant will also pay a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share, starting in the second quarter of 2017.Separately from the earnings announcement, Cognizant said that it had reached a cooperation agreement with Elliott. Under the deal, three new independent directors will join the company's board, including two for 2017 and one more for 2018.Meanwhile, Cognizant's guidance for the first quarter and full 2017 year was reasonably good. The company expects revenue for the first quarter of between $3.51 billion and $3.55 billion, producing adjusted earnings of at least $0.83 per share. For the full year, revenue of $14.56 billion to $14.84 billion should bring in adjusted earnings of at least $3.63 per share. Those targets are generally in line with what investors were expecting, especially if Cognizant can beat its \"at least\" targets slightly.Cognizant investors were happy with the news, as the stock climbed 6% in  following the announcement. By coming to terms with Elliott, rewarding shareholders with capital returns, and adopting a pro-growth digital strategy, Cognizant appears to be firing on all cylinders in its attempt to maximize its opportunities going forward.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

The company reported earnings per American Depository Share (\"ADS\") of 24 cents for the quarter, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and up 4.3% on a year-over-year basis.However, investors were disappointed by the company's subdued outlook for the coming fiscal and its shares reflected the sentiment as they declined 4.7% in  at one point.The bottom line benefited from a modest top-line performance and diligent operational execution.For fiscal 2017, Infosys reported earnings of 94 cents per ADS, up 4.4% over the prior fiscal.Revenues increased 5% year over year to $2,569 million, but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,586 million. Moreover, in terms of constant currency, revenues were up 5.3%.Top-line growth was largely supported by lucrative contract wins, the Renew New strategy, growth in delivery services and lucrative client wins. During the reported quarter, the company added 71 clients, which also proved conducive to revenue growth.For fiscal 2017, revenues came in at $10,208 million, up 7.4% over fiscal 2016.Infosys' operating profit inched up 1.5% year over year to $634 million. Management believes that strong focus on operational improvement helped maintain the company's operating profits in the quarter.The company witnessed growth in three of the four regions where it operates. Fourth-quarter sales in North America, India and Rest of the World improved about 4.2%, 9.6% and 9.5% year over year, respectively. However, revenues from Europe declined 2.4% year over year.Infosys has been diligently following the \"Renew New\" program, which lays the blueprint of its long-term growth. Under the \"Renew\" initiative, the company introduced offerings in the areas of Digital, Cloud, Data Sciences, Mainframe Modernization, Cyber security, API Microservices and Internet of Things.Currently, Infosys is witnessing impressive market demand for mainframe modernization across all verticals, and is working jointly with Amazon Web Services and Azure, to help clients embrace cloud platforms. Under the \"New\" initiative, Infosys has been recording robust momentum in software and services.Moreover, most of Infosys' businesses, particularly EdgeVerve software products, continued to deliver sturdy performance in the quarter. The EdgeVerve business clinched 30 wins and 26 go-lives from both the Finacle and Edge suite of solutions in the reported quarter.The company's three distinguished offerings - Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge-based IT and Design Thinking - are proving to be key profit churners, helping to expand its market share.As of Mar 31, 2017, Infosys had cash & cash equivalents of $3,489 million, compared with $4,935 million recorded as of Mar 31, 2016.For fiscal 2017, the company announced a final dividend of $0.23 per ADS. | Concurrent with the fiscal fourth-quarter earnings release, Infosys declared that Mr. Ravi Venkatesan, Independent Director, will be appointed as Co-Chairman of the Board.Venkatesan will support the management in executing the company's strategy.Infosys, considered as a gauge for the health of the $3-trillion global enterprise spending market, reduced its guidance for revenue growth this fiscal year to 6.1-8.1%, which is much lower than the market's expectations. In fact, the growth forecast is lower than that of rival Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation  , which expects to grow between 8-10%.Infosys faced unexpected execution challenges and diversions in what is already a seasonally soft quarter. However, CEO Vishal Sikka maintained that the company is seeing many positive developments in its strategy execution, as its software-led offerings continued to gain momentum, and client success and employee engagement continued to decrease attrition, especially with top performers.Despite the positives, three back-to-back guidance tweaks indicate the tough macroeconomic conditions under which the company is operating. Rapid proliferation of customizable Internet-based software has been hampering Infosys' traditional outsourcing business, thus thwarting growth. Moving ahead, developments on the H-1B visa front and the foreign currency movements could prove to be formidable risks to the company. Though the extent of this impact is yet to be determined, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is likely to face the brunt as major western clients might curtail spending further.Some better-ranked stocks in the broader computer & technology sector are Science Applications International Corporation  and Sphere 3D Corp.  , both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see Science Applications International Corporation provides technical, engineering, and enterprise information technology services in the U.S. It boasts a remarkable average surprise of 9.2% for the trailing four quarters, beating estimates all through.Sphere 3D is a virtualization technology solution provider.

The strategy helps investors pick stocks that are available at a discount and have solid growth potential. Though it looks to be quite similar to the blend strategy, there lies a significant difference between the two. While the blend strategy chooses value and growth stocks, GARP investing looks for stocks that provide the best of both value and growth investing.The GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment option by borrowing the best features of both value and growth investing. While investors following the GARP strategy give precedence to value ratios such as price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book value (P/B) ratio, they also use earnings per share (EPS) growth rates and return on equity (ROE) like growth investors to identify potential stocks. However, the range of the values of metrics that are considered by GARP investing may differ from those that are considered by value or growth investors.While value investors look for an extremely low P/E ratio to choose a company, the GARP strategy focuses on acquiring stocks that have relatively higher ratios but less than their respective industry median. Meanwhile, GARP investing chooses stocks with P/B ratios lower than their industries similar to value investors.Separately, investors following the GARP strategy give priority to stocks with an impressive EPS growth track record over those with extremely high growth rates. Companies that qualify the norms of GARP investing are believed to have past as well as expected growth rates between 10% and 20%.over the next few yearsAnother metric, which is borrowed by GARP investors from growth investing, is return on equity (ROE). Like growth investors, the GARP strategy looks for stocks with higher ROE than their industry median.Along with the criteria we discussed in the above section, we have also considered favorable Zacks Rank - Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) - to make the strategy more profitable.(Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through.)\u2022 (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)\u2022 (Higher ROE compared to the industry median indicates superior stocks.)\u2022 (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry median indicate that the stocks are undervalued.)Just these few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only five.Here are the five stocks that made it through the screen: (NYSE:  -  ) is a global investment banking and securities firm.

The strategy helps investors pick stocks that are available at a discount and have solid growth potential. Though it looks to be quite similar to the blend strategy, there lies a significant difference between the two. While the blend strategy chooses value and growth stocks, GARP investing looks for stocks that provide the best of both value and growth investing.The GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment option by borrowing the best features of both value and growth investing. While investors following the GARP strategy give precedence to value ratios such as price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book value (P/B) ratio, they also use earnings per share (EPS) growth rates and return on equity (ROE) like growth investors to identify potential stocks. However, the range of the values of metrics that are considered by GARP investing may differ from those that are considered by value or growth investors.While value investors look for an extremely low P/E ratio to choose a company, the GARP strategy focuses on acquiring stocks that have relatively higher ratios but less than their respective industry median. Meanwhile, GARP investing chooses stocks with P/B ratios lower than their industries similar to value investors.Separately, investors following the GARP strategy give priority to stocks with an impressive EPS growth track record over those with extremely high growth rates. Companies that qualify the norms of GARP investing are believed to have past as well as expected growth rates between 10% and 20%.over the next few yearsAnother metric, which is borrowed by GARP investors from growth investing, is return on equity (ROE). Like growth investors, the GARP strategy looks for stocks with higher ROE than their industry median.Along with the criteria we discussed in the above section, we have also considered favorable Zacks Rank - Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) - to make the strategy more profitable.(Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through.)\u2022 (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)\u2022 (Higher ROE compared to the industry median indicates superior stocks.)\u2022 (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry median indicate that the stocks are undervalued.)Just these few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only five.Here are the five stocks that made it through the screen: is a global investment banking and securities firm.

Last quarter, it posted a positive earnings surprise of 8.00%. In the trailing four quarters, the company has recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 7.26%.In the past one year, Cognizant's shares have generated a negative return of 13.35% compared with the Zacks  industry's loss of 8.06%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.In the last reported quarter, the company beat estimates on both counts. Plus, on a year-over-year basis, Cognizant recorded sales growth of 8.4%.Cognizant is consistently developing its capabilities to benefit from the ongoing digital transition especially when it comes to integration of the new digital framework with legacy technology platforms. Moreover, accretive acquisitions such as the TriZetto and more recently, the buyouts of Mirabeau BV and the technology and business process services unit of Frontica Business Solutions AS are likely to benefit the company.However, the company has been seeing some sluggishness of late in the healthcare and financial sector, which are its biggest markets. Moreover, stiff competition from peers like Accenture  , Infosys and Wipro Ltd.  remains a concern.For the fourth quarter of 2016, the company expects revenues in a range of $3.45 billion to $3.51 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be in a band of 85 cents to 88 cents. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cognizant is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Earnings ESP for Cognizant is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 77 cents per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he  is up .37 to 5,025.27.

Unlike a blend strategy, a portfolio that uses GARP investing is expected to have stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.Both strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings growth prospects in the coming years are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy.

It is used to identify stocks that have solid growth prospects but are available at discounted prices. Unlike a blend strategy, a portfolio that uses GARP investing is expected to have stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.Both strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings growth prospects in the coming years are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, they choose stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate instead of choosing those with extremely high growth rates. Growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal in GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flows get precedence in GARP investing.GARP investing gives precedence to one of the popular value metrics - price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style chooses stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, they avoid picking companies with extremely high P/E ratios.Moreover, price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered in GARP investing.Using GARP principles, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer good returns in the near term.Along with the criteria we discussed in the above section, we have also considered favorable Zacks Rank - Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) - to make the strategy more profitable.(Only Strong Buy and Buy rated stocks can get through.)\u2022 (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)\u2022 (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)\u2022 (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicate that the stocks are undervalued.)Just these few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only six.Here are the six stocks that made it through the screen: is a mass media company that creates and distributes industry-leading content to audiences worldwide.

(The editors would probably go with option 2.) Nevertheless, it happened on Wednesday about a month later than initially expected. You may remember that the Dow had come within 25 points of the mark shortly before Christmas with many predicting it would get over the hump before 2016 was out. But it wasn't to be, and most of January has been too concerned with the new president than hitting some psychological target.Mercifully, it only took two strong sessions to get the job done, rather than meandering around like before. Today, the Dow climbed 0.78% to 20,068.5. It was 200 points away as recently as Monday. Now, the S&P is nearing its own bit of history, having climbed 0.80% to within two points of 2300 at 2298.4. The NASDAQ was up 0.99% to 5656.3. Needless to say, these are new all-time highs.

This chemical company is part of a space in the top 28% of the Zacks Industry Rank.-- The chart for Argan (AGX) is  , while projections for top line growth of 9% this year suggests more EPS surprises could be at hand. The company provides wiring services to the Feds and underground/aerial construction services to major telecoms and utilities.-- Finally, Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH) is in turnaround mode with a compelling valuation and the potential to bust above some heavy resistance.

First up, the portfolio bought an approximately 8% position in Pure Storage (PSTG), a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) enterprise data storage platform that has moved to under $12 from $15. The editor really likes this space and believes that recent reports from STX and WDC will benefit shares.The other buy today was Jabil Circuit (JBL), a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) provider of electronic manufacturing services.

The company has a market cap of $72.6 billion with long-term earnings growth expectation of 10.25%.Adding to the positives, Accenture's remarkable run may continue next year as the company is currently trading at a lower price/earnings (P/E) multiple than the industry average. So, we believe that Accenture with its light forward P/E valuation of 19.9x compared with the industry average of 86.1x may be an optimistic bet. Moreover, the stock currently carries a  of \"B,\" which makes us hopeful about the stock's future.Most recently, Accenture announced that it has completed the acquisition of Defense Point Security, LLC DPS. However, the financial details of the transaction were kept under wraps.The two companies had entered into an acquisition deal in October. The move marks Accenture's efforts toward improving its government security portfolio. The latest acquisition is expected to expand Accenture's federal services capabilities as well as strengthen its leadership position in providing cybersecurity solutions to the U.S. federal departments.Accenture, continuing with its strategy to grow through acquisitions, also inked an agreement to acquire Arismore, a privately held company in France. The latest deal is expected to expand Accenture's existing identity and access management services and security-as-a-service capabilities. It is also likely to strengthen its leadership position in France.Considering the growing need for digital marketing, we expect Accenture's investment in digital and marketing capabilities to boost long-term growth. It will also help the company in effectively competing with other digital marketing service providers such as International Business Machines Corp.  , Dell and Deloitte.Accenture pursues strategic acquisitions to diversify its offerings and expand operating markets. So far this year, the company has either completed or signed over 12 acquisition deals across various business segments, including IT security, CRM capabilities, strategy consulting, etc. Last year, it had closed 21 takeovers.These acquisitions have enabled Accenture to foray into newer markets, diversify and broaden its product portfolio, and maintain its leading position. A strong cash balance of $4.08 billion and an operating cash flow of $1.08 billion at the end of first-quarter fiscal 2017 are expected to support the company's inorganic growth strategy.Accenture's long-term prospects look promising due to its sustained focus on new and innovative product launches, continuous investments in enhancing digital and marketing capabilities, as well as major acquisitions. Moreover, we believe that regular acquisitions will significantly contribute to the company's revenue stream.However, increasing competition from Cognizant Technology Solutions  , a strained spending environment and Accenture's broad European exposure may temper its growth to some extent.Currently, Accenture has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

(Symbol: CTSH) stock, but cautious about paying the going market price of $56.20/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2019 put at the $32.50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.60. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 4.9% return against the $32.50 commitment, or a 2.4% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to CTSH's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $32.50 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. sees its shares fall 42.1% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $30.90 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.60 from $32.50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 2.4% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., and highlighting in green where the $32.50 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2019 put at the $32.50 strike for the 2.4% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $56.20) to be 31%.

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he  is down -1.38 to 4,750.57.

However, the financial details of the transaction were kept under wraps.Based in Alexandria, VA, the privately held cybersecurity company, DPS, was founded in 2007. The company is well known for providing advanced cyber defense solutions to the U.S. federal government. Additionally, DPS is specialized in providing advanced Security Operations Center (SOC) expertise, cyber operations, security engineering and cyber analytics to the same.Upon successful completion of the acquisition, Accenture intends to integrate DPS business with the Accenture Federal Services business, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Accenture LLP. The company claims that its \"federal business has served every cabinet-level department and 30 of matt the largest federal organizations\".Therefore, the latest deal is expected to expand Accenture's federal services capabilities as well as strengthen its leadership position in providing cybersecurity solutions to the U.S. federal department.David Moskovitz, chief executive at Accenture Federal Services, said that \"The addition of DPS' specialized cyber defense tools and methodologies, together with our powerful client insights, will further propel our strategy to be a leading provider of end-to-end, federal enterprise security services.\"Accenture pursues strategic acquisitions to diversify its offerings and expand operating markets. So far this year, the company has either completed or has signed about eleven acquisition deals across various business segments, including IT security, CRM capabilities, strategy consulting, etc. Last year, it had closed 21 takeovers.These acquisitions have enabled Accenture to foray into newer markets, diversify and broaden the product portfolio, and maintain its leading position. A strong cash balance of $3.50 billion and an operating cash flow of $2.52 billion at the end of third-quarter fiscal 2016 will support Accenture's inorganic growth strategy.Accenture's long-term prospects look promising due to sustained focus on new and innovative product launches, continuous investments in enhancing digital and marketing capabilities, as well as major acquisitions. Moreover, we believe that regular acquisitions will significantly contribute to the company's revenue stream.However, increasing competition from Cognizant Technology Solutions  , International Business Machines Corporation  and CoreLogic, Inc.  remains a concern. Also, we are cautious about its near-term performance, given a strained IT spending scenario. As per a research report by Gartner, worldwide IT spending is expected to remain flat year over year in 2016 at $3.41 trillion, due to currency fluctuations triggered by the Brexit episode.Beyond this Analyst Blog, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are not available to the public?

Although economic conditions in many areas of the world have been sluggish at best, Cognizant has nevertheless sought to overcome some of the headwinds that its competitors have cited in seeing their growth slow. Coming into Monday's third-quarter financial report, Cognizant investors wanted to see continued growth in the IT consultant's top and bottom lines, and the company generally delivered on that score. Moreover, Cognizant said that it continues to see client demand for its services, suggesting that it believes it can overcome any potential slowdown. Let's take a closer look at Cognizant's latest results and what they say about the state of the IT consulting industry.Image source: Cognizant Technology.Cognizant's third-quarter results generally stayed the course in the company's ongoing growth trends. Revenue climbed 8.4% to $3.45 billion, which was almost exactly what most investors following the stock had expected to see. Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income climbed 12% to $444.4 million, and after making allowances for extraordinary items, adjusted earnings of $0.86 per share were $0.02 higher than the consensus forecast among investors.If we look more closely at the numbers, Cognizant's business segment results revealed some trends going on within the company. Among the three most important segments, the manufacturing, retail, and logistics business performed the best, posting 12% year-over-year growth in revenue compared to the year-ago quarter. Healthcare once again trailed, with gains of just 5.7% compared to a year ago, but its sequential revenue growth was the highest among Cognizant's businesses. The key financial services division remained the largest by revenue, but its 7% gain in sales compared to the third quarter of 2015 slowed considerably from where it was in recent quarters. The segment into which Cognizant reports its other revenue actually had the best year-over-year performance, picking up nearly 14%.In terms of geography, the impact of the U.K. Brexit decision was the most obvious factor. Sales in the U.K. fell 2.3%, even as the rest of Europe saw sales soar by 17%. North America's 7.9% growth was squarely in the middle, and beyond North America and Europe, revenue from the rest of the world soared by nearly a quarter compared to year-ago levels.Cognizant CEO Francisco D'Souza pointed to what he saw as good conditions for the company. \"We see ongoing client demand for our services across industries and geographies,\" D'Souza said, and \"as the physical and digital worlds converge, we have made it easier for clients to work with us by aligning our organizational structure and capabilities around the broader focus of assisting clients drive digital transformations.\"Going forward, Cognizant sees reason for optimism. The CEO pointed to the company's newly named president, Raj Mehta, and his ability to lead his executive team toward implementing strategic initiatives. Moreover, the company keeps adding new staff to meet anticipated demand, with net additions to the headcount coming in at about 11,500.Cognizant's guidance for the immediate future was mixed in most investors' eyes. On the top line, anticipated fourth-quarter revenue of $3.45 billion to $3.51 billion would be slightly less than the $3.52 billion consensus forecast among those following the stock. However, adjusted earnings of $0.85 to $0.88 per share would fall within the anticipated range among investors.For the full year, Cognizant now believes that it will bring in between $13.47 billion and $13.53 billion in sales, which basically narrows its previous guidance to the bottom of its earlier range. However, adjusted earnings of $3.38 to $3.41 per share represented a narrowing above the midpoint of its previous range, showing the disparity between earnings and revenue performance.Cognizant investors seemed to like the news, sending the stock up nearly 4% in  following the announcement.

The firm is also making inroads into web analytics and digital marketing services, and it's migrating customers to a subscription model for its \"Creative Cloud\" suite of software products, creating a long and steady revenue stream.The stock: At 30 times estimated profits, the stock isn't cheap. But Adobe is growing rapidly. Wall Street analysts see sales climbing 22%, to $7 billion, in the fiscal year that ends in November 2017. Profits should increase even faster, rising by 33%, a rate of growth that makes the high price-earnings ratio palatable, says brokerage firm Canaccord Genuity. Although the firm doesn't see big share-price gains over the near term, Adobe has \"the ingredients for an exceptional long-term investment,\" Canaccord says.See Also: The business: Celgene makes the cancer-fighting drug Revlimid and other biotech medicines.What will drive growth: Boosted by Revlimid--a drug that modifies the body's immune system to fight cancer--Celgene aims to hit $21 billion in sales in 2020, up from an estimated $11.1 billion in 2016. Initially approved in 2006 as a second-line defense against multiple myeloma, a common type of blood cancer, the drug won approval in 2015 for patients newly diagnosed with the disease, expanding its sales and market potential. Revlimid has also been approved for other uses, and Celgene is now testing it to combat some types of lymphoma and leukemia. Other products in Celgene's lineup include medicines to treat advanced breast cancer and psoriasis. In addition, Celgene expects results in the next few years from more than a dozen late-stage drug trials--a pipeline of potentially new and expanded-use products that looks \"underappreciated,\" says Bank of America Merrill Lynch.The stock: Celgene's P/E has tumbled from 59 times earnings in 2014 to 17 times estimated year-ahead profits. The stock also slid, down 13% in the past year, due to concerns about unsustainably high drug prices and disappointing results in some of Celgene's clinical trials. Still, the shares now look cheap relative to expected earnings growth, estimated at 23% in 2017 and 24% in 2018.See Also: The business: Cognizant provides information-technology consulting services, overseeing complex software projects for large companies.What will drive growth: Global demand for IT services is climbing at an annual pace of 4.6%, according to research firm Gartner. But Cognizant is likely to boost sales at double that rate. Financial and health care companies--its core market--are hiring Cognizant to oversee software development in areas such as social media, mobile technology and cloud-based computing. The firm outsources much of that work to India. But it forges close ties to clients, maintaining about 30% of a project's senior staff on site. Those relationships tend to result in contracts that run longer and are more lucrative than those won by most other IT outsourcing firms, says Morningstar analyst Andrew Lange. Analysts estimate that Cognizant will collect $13.6 billion in revenues in 2016, 32% more than the company generated in 2014. Wall Street analysts expect revenues and profits to rise by more than 10% a year through 2018.The stock: At 15 times estimated earnings, the shares look cheap, says S&P  Intelligence analyst David Holt.

It now aims to focus on fast-growing products in health care and life sciences. The firm recently spun off a big chunk of its industrial businesses into a separately traded company, Fortive (  ), and announced plans to buy medical diagnostics company Cepheid for $4 billion. That follows up on a 2015 deal to buy medical toolmaker Pall for $13.8 billion. The risk with Danaher is that it could overpay for growth. But its freewheeling ways have paid off: Over the past 15 years through September 14, Danaher's shares returned 14.3% annualized, more than double the 6.7% annualized gain of Standard & Poor's 500-stock index (both figures include dividends).The stock: Analysts see sales climbing 4% to 5% annually over the next two years, hitting $18.3 billion in 2018. Profits should climb faster, though, as Danaher shaves costs and improves the bottom line at companies it buys.

The company owns best-selling brands for cabinetry, doors and faucets. It's ramping up manufacturing in the U.S. and recently opened a Moen plant in China to fuel international growth. Fortune also aims to expand with acquisitions; the firm added cabinet maker Norcraft and safe supplier SentrySafe to its lineup in recent years. Even if new housing construction slows, Fortune should benefit from strength in the remodeling market, which accounts for two-thirds of its housing-related sales (excluding its much smaller security business).The stock: Fortune shares look a bit pricey, trading at 19 times estimated year-ahead profits, compared with 17 for the S&P 500. But the P/E is reasonable given that analysts expect sales to climb 7.7%, to $5.5 billion, in 2017 and see profits rising 14.6%. Fortune's prospects would dim if housing took a dip.

It's also making acquisitions to fuel its expansion, such as a recent deal to buy e-commerce company Demandware for $2.8 billion. Wall Street expects revenues to top $10.1 billion in the fiscal year that ends in January 2018, up from an expected $8.3 billion in the prior year. Over the next decade, sales should climb by an average 12% a year, says Morningstar.The stock: Salesforce's shares have been scintillating, soaring more than 11-fold since February 2009. That kind of appreciation isn't sustainable, especially with the stock trading at 63 times estimated year-ahead profits. Nonetheless, Bank of America Merrill Lynch expects the shares to hit $100 over the next year. By 2020, the bank figures, Salesforce could double annual revenues. If the company can achieve that feat, its stock price would likely double by then, too.See Also: The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he following companies are expected to report earnings prior to market open on 11/07/2016.

Frontica is a subsidiary of Norwegian oil investment services company, Akastor ASA.In a statement, Cognizant's President, Global Growth Markets, stated \"The acquisition helps us strengthen our oil and gas industry expertise, expand our presence in key markets, and deepen and broaden our service portfolio for our clients. Frontica will play a key role in helping us realize these benefits through their specialized capabilities in serving the oil and gas industry.\"Acquisitions have been a key growth catalyst for Cognizant. In January this year, Cognizant acquired KBACE Technologies, which specializes in cloud strategy, implementation and integration. It will aid in expanding the company's advanced IT capabilities, especially for Cloud and SaaS offerings. Also, it bought a 49% stake in ReD Associates that specializes in understanding customer behavioral pattern and applying the same to business strategy. Recently, the company also declared its plans to acquire Idea Couture, which will be integrated with Cognizant Digital Works.Earlier, the company completed the acquisitions of TriZetto, iTask, Cadient, Odyssey and itaas. The company has not only gained new customers from these buyouts but also expanded its capabilities in the healthcare industry and enhanced its overall digital delivery capabilities. Among these, TriZetto happens to be Cognizant's largest acquisition to-date. The company spent $2.8 billion to acquire the healthcare IT solutions provider to develop, license, implement and support proprietary and third-party software products for the healthcare industry. Currently, the combined entity generates more than $3 billion in revenues from the healthcare sector. | The news of the Frontica acquisition comes on the heels of an ongoing corruption probe. Last week, the company said that it was carrying out an internal investigation, related to a possible infringement of US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act with regard to charges of bribery in its Indian operations.The company appointed Rajeev Mehta as its President. Mehta replaces Gordon Coburn. Though media reports suggest that the departure of Coburn is linked to the ongoing corruption probe, the company refrained from commenting over this.At present, Cognizant carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the same space include SYNNEX Corp.  , Asure Software, Inc.  and LightInTheBox Holding Co., Ltd.  . All three sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  .Earnings per share estimates for SYNNEX Corp, Asure Software and LightInTheBox have improved over the last 30 days.

Management's caution about IT spend in Cognizant's BFS (Banking and Financial Services) segment trace back to the prolonged low interest rate environment along with increased uncertainty in the macro environment-particularly attributed to the \"Brexit\" vote, which was relatively fresh news at the time of management's comments. We do not think this weakness has materialized in the near-term, at least to the extent that management was implying. In addition, but not necessarily new, Cognizant has four clients in the HMO (health-maintenance organization) industry, all attempting to merge with or acquire the other. Though the extended timeline of these M&A deals likely pushes out the timing of expected work for Cognizant at each of these four clients, we think Cognizant's longer-term positioning as a key partner at all four HMOs will continue to allow them to capture wallet share, regardless of M&A outcomes. Near-term, we expect investors to remain skittish around the shares, if only because the investor base has been skittish for years, with the NTM P/E multiple of Cognizant typically vacillating -\u2026%-'\u2026% per year. Despite these recent headwinds to topline growth, we think Cognizant maintains a long- term runway for generating attractive organic growth, as the company benefits from the secular shift of IT spend towards digital solutions.

The day marked the end of the third quarter, and solid gains for stocks meant that investors got through another year without seeing a major September downward surprise.Greater confidence in the health of German banking giant  helped allay fears of a possible European financial crisis brewing, and less fear meant that the  (NYSEMKT: UVXY) lost 7.5%, as volatility fell. Even though the market was higher, several stocks lost ground, and  (NASDAQ: CTSH) ,  (NYSE: PIR) , and  (NASDAQ: OPHT) were among the biggest decliners on the day.Cognizant Technology Solutions fell 13% in the wake of an internal corruption probe and the replacement of company president Gordon Coburn, who resigned. The technology services provider and consultant said that it was looking at possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act linked to its operations in India, notifying the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC that it had taken action.At this point, Cognizant wasn't able or willing to make predictions about what the investigation would find, but investors didn't wait to put pressure on the stock. Some analysts downgraded Cognizant, in part because of the uncertainty that the probe introduces going forward.Pier 1 Imports dropped 5%, giving back its gains from Thursday following its fiscal second-quarter financial report. The retailer had reported a smaller loss than most investors had expected, but Pier 1 still suffered a nearly 7% drop in revenue on a comparable-store sales decline of 4.3%.The company's guidance for the full fiscal year included top-line contraction of 4% to 6% and negative comps of -2% to -4%, but the real surprise isn't so much that the stock dropped today, but rather that it gained ground yesterday. Going forward, Pier 1 will have to work harder to stand out from the retail crowd in a tough industry environment in order to get its stock moving in the right direction.Finally, Ophthotech took a 15% hit. The company itself didn't have any news, but industry peer  (NASDAQ: REGN) announced results of a phase 2 clinical trial that showed that a combination of its already-approved blockbuster eye drug Eylea and a developmental-stage drug performed worse than using Eylea alone.

Luxoft stock has declined in 2016, as investors have become concerned with slowing growth. The recent move by the U.K. to leave the European Union exacerbated the weakness as the European banks (including Deutsche Bank (  ), Luxoft's largest customer) are being pushed to multi-year lows. However, Luxoft remains a premium vendor whose services are mission-critical for clients. The recent renewal of a five-year Master Services Agreement ((  )) with Deutsche Bank illustrates customers' reliance on Luxoft despite a challenging market environment.With a revenue base of over $680 million, Luxoft resembles Cognizant (  ) 10 years ago, highlighted by a comparable growth trajectory. Cognizant's revenue exhibited a remarkable 37% CAGR over a 15-year period, developing from a modest $89 million in 1999 to a $10 billion offshore powerhouse. We think LXFT can grow at a similarly high rate over the next 10 years. Our view is underpinned by management's recent guidance of 20% compounded revenue growth, $1.5 billion in revenue by FY 2020, and a resulting market capitalization of $3 billion within five years. In fact, we think that forecast is conservative. A more likely scenario: LXFT multiplies its revenue base by 4-5x supported by its position as a best-in-class provider of high-end software developers serving a massive total addressable market. Our DCF analysis suggests shares are worth ~$108 today (105% upside) and likely more in time.Luxoft's differentiated focus on high-end software development is executed via engagement of leading programming talent in the science-centric Central and Eastern European ((  )) region. Unlike the large Indian vendors deriving value primarily from labor arbitrage, LXFT's value proposition is predicated on an exceptionally skilled employee base to deliver sophisticated domain expertise. The company employs nearly 9,000 offshore programmers in the CEE geography, a region deeply rooted in science and technology; these emerging economies produce nearly one million engineering graduates annually. It has already achieved success with this strategy, growing revenue at a 27% CAGR over the last five years, while building out proficiency in sectors such as financial services and automotive. Furthermore, Luxoft commands a premium bill rate and generates the highest revenue per employee within the offshore industry. In an industry that competes aggressively for talent, LXFT boasts the lowest attrition rate amongst its peers.The offshore IT services industry is well positioned to grow, fueled by a significant enduring cost differential between U.S. and non-U.S. IT employees. The current climate of hyper-paced digital advancements within every industry, coupled with a shortage of talent in the U.S. will result in continued outsourcing of labor to countries with a cheaper and more abundant workforce. While the total offshore IT industry is expected to grow at 9% through 2019, the application outsourcing sub-segment in which Luxoft operates is projected to grow at 14%. The company's ~9,000 IT employees represent a mere fraction of the hundreds of thousands employed by the Indian vendors, and its LTM revenue of $681 million is a tiny portion of a thriving $60 billion industry. If LXFT and its CEE peers attain a quarter of the success realized by their Indian counterparts in the late '90s and early 2000s, LXFT will not remain only a $1.7 billion, or even $10 billion, company for much longer.Weakness in Luxoft shares began in early 2016 due to concerns of slowing growth and the perceived risk of losing Deutsche Bank, the company's largest customer. The sell-off of Luxoft was exacerbated by Brexit and the overall weakness of the banking sector, leading to all-time lows for DB shares. The market now completely ignores fundamentals and Luxoft's significant growth opportunity, evident by the recent direct correlation of LXFT shares with DB. We believe these concerns are overblown. Even in the most turbulent times (the financial crisis of 2008-2009 and the European debt crisis of 2012), the company managed to grow within its largest clients. We believe over the long term, current concerns around Luxoft's relationship with DB will prove to be short-lived as the business continues to execute, grow and diversify.Luxoft focuses on Deutsche Bank's front-office rather than back-office functions, with its projects supporting entire processes that are critical for operations. Furthermore, as a result of increased regulations, the majority of its services help to keep Deutsche Bank in compliance with regulatory bodies in both the EU and the U.S. An example of a project that Luxoft assists with Deutsche Bank is Arena. Arena was a platform that was co-developed by Luxoft about 10 years ago and is a critical trading platform used for equities (acts as an order management system for DB's equity traders). This has been an ongoing project for years and is just one of many that Luxoft's ~2,600 engineers at DB help to manage (more examples of specific projects are available later in this report).We find it unlikely that the company faces any imminent risk of completely losing this account given the renewal of the DB MSA earlier this year which runs through 2020. DB, which has utilized Luxoft since 2003, plans to reduce costs significantly through \"  ,\" but based on our conversations with management, we don't expect those cuts to impact LXFT.In previous financial crises (the financial crisis of 2008-2009 and the European debt crisis of 2012), Deutsche Bank consolidated many of its smaller IT vendors and shifted more work to Luxoft. In 2012, the bank undertook a major vendor consolidation and reduced the number of large IT vendors from 12 to 4. Luxoft benefited from that consolidation and attained Key Strategic Vendor status, which led to an expanded footprint within the investment bank. While Luxoft is certainly larger today at DB than it was in 2012, we believe that given Luxoft's critical role within DB's core operations, any potential consolidation will likely occur with smaller, less-strategic vendors.Today, non-strategic vendors account for about ~40% of Deutsche Bank's IT offshore budget (equivalent to ~$800 million of total ~$2 billion). We think any further consolidation would result in re-allocating more of the budget to strategic vendors. Luxoft's CEO believes that going forward the share of strategic vendors could grow from 60% to 80%, positioning the company favorably as a top strategic vendor.Despite the significant European exposure, Luxoft will not be impacted by the recent devaluation of the British pound. In the latest fiscal year, revenues from the pound accounted for 7% of total revenue, while expenses accounted for 12%. With a greater exposure to the pound in expenses, we actually expect the company's margins to improve y-o-y as a result of the currency's devaluation. As evident by the chart below, Luxoft is paid by clients primarily on a USD and euro basis.With Luxoft still in its nascency, customer concentration isn't an immediate concern for us at a current revenue base of $681 million, because we believe the company will be many times larger in the future, and it's rapidly expanding beyond its top five customers. Luxoft reported 56% revenue growth in the FY 2016 from accounts outside the top 5; we are confident that customer concentration will not present an issue in the not-too-distant future.Our revenue projections call for 15% top line CAGR over the next 10 years. We believe Luxoft's 20%+ growth over the next 1-3 years will be supported by proliferation in accounts outside the top 5. For DB, we assume little to no growth over our projection period. Management has made it clear that its base case is for DB to stabilize around $200 million over the next few years. For UBS Group (UBS), we have revenue reaching around $200 million, per management guidance. We do not assume significant growth for Harman (HAR) beyond the $50-60 million threshold, and expect Credit Suisse (CS) to be on a similar trajectory as UBS. Outside of these large clients, we arrived at 30-35% growth, a hurdle which we think Luxoft will easily surpass given recent performance as well as the growing portfolio of high-potential accounts (\"HPAs\").The number of high-potential accounts increased from 12 at the IPO in 2013 to more than 40 at present. Clients are classified as HPAs if management believes the accounts have the potential to reach at least $5 million in recurring annual revenue within the short to mid-term. During the 9-month period ending 12/31/15, revenue from this account base grew at 177% y-o-y and comprised at least 25% of revenues in FY2016.Overall, we foresee the slowdown of the top accounts being offset by a large and diverse customer base experiencing strong growth. While much attention is focused on Luxoft's work in the financial services sector, there's likely additional upside from the developing automotive segment (more detail on this sector later in the report), which continues to grow at 40%+. Luxoft CEO Dmitry Loschinin said automotive remains a high priority, and the firm's investments appear to be paying off, as an automotive OEM account added last year is already a top 10 account. The company has demonstrated a willingness to allocate capital for M&A, and with its unlevered balance sheet, future tuck-in acquisitions provide yet another avenue of growth in excess of our base scenario.Through our diligence with management, former executives and current customers, we discovered that demand far outpaces supply, and Luxoft struggles to hire enough talented engineers as fast as it would like. Historically, the company had excess demand to allocate an additional ~1,000 engineers for current customers. We think even in the unlikeliest scenario that projects get scaled down significantly at Deutsche Bank, Luxoft's revenue base would be protected by its ability to reallocate personnel to other customers.The company publishes very detailed job postings on its  , and we believe the number of job postings is a good proxy to measure excess demand. Throughout 2016, the number of job postings stayed in the ~620 area, implying that demand remains very strong.Despite the challenges Deutsche Bank faces in an uncertain economic environment, Luxoft has proved resilient in similar macro environments, and we believe Luxoft will ultimately grow out of this perceived issue as management continues to expand within other customers. Given the 20%+ growth and long-term potential to compound, we think the company is too cheap at 18x earnings. Its projects are long-term in nature, with average engagements of at least 3-5 years; moreover, Luxoft is entrenched with DB until at least 2020, and growth from accounts outside the top 5 is resilient. We anticipate that the recent sell-off of in the stock price will prove temporary, and expect to see a significant return on our investment, as Luxoft shares are currently trading at bargain prices.   Since FY 2011, Luxoft posted an impressive 27% revenue CAGR, and we believe the business will continue to compound 15-20% on the top line over the next 10 years. Given projected growth for the application outsourcing sub-segment (14% through 2019), as well as Luxoft's relatively small scale (~9,500 engineers), we're very bullish that the company can exceed overall market growth by a significant margin over the next decade.Luxoft's staff of 11,000 is miniscule relative to the size of the Indian offshore players. Despite being the sixth largest Indian offshore vendor, HCL still boasts an employee count 10x greater than LXFT's. Even if Luxoft's headcount increased at a 20% CAGR over the next 10 years to ~57k, it would still represent an immaterial fraction of the offshore industry. While we're not arguing that the company's employee base will approach the scale of its Indian competitors anytime soon, the growth opportunity remains quite compelling. Luxoft's total addressable market - namely, the demand for organized teams of sophisticated programmers - is massive.Offshore IT services growth will be supported by the material cost differential between U.S. and non-U.S. IT employees. Based on Susquehanna research, U.S. IT personnel are expected to command a 66% and 25% premium to Indian and Eastern European employees, respectively. We believe this cost delta will continue to drive demand for outsourcing work to these geographies. Luxoft employees not only cost less, but have proven domain expertise, particularly in the financial services and automobile sectors.Furthermore, the shortage of engineering talent in the U.S. will be exacerbated over the next decade. According to the  , there is a significant gap between the supply and demand of science, technology, engineering and mathematics ((STEM)) graduates in the United States.The legacy of the Soviet educational complex focused on mathematics and engineering is evident throughout the CEE region. According to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics, Russia and Ukraine churn out nearly 600k engineering graduates annually (LXFT's engineers are predominantly concentrated in these countries). While the U.S. ranks second in number of engineering graduates, the statistic is marginal relative to density per population. Ukraine currently produces ~130k annual engineering graduates, nearly half of the total U.S. number. Yet, the population of Ukraine is only 44 million, compared with 319 million in the U.S. With Luxoft strategically focused on this STEM-centric geography, we believe future growth will be supported by access to this talent-rich resource pool.For our revenue forecasts, we project that Luxoft's employee base tracks the overall offshore application outsourcing market (about 14% CAGR over projection period). Based on the recent 18-20% growth of the employee base, we modeled 15% for FY 2017, eventually receding to ~10% per year beginning in FY 2022. In terms of revenue per employee, we project a 3% increase in productivity over the projection period, about 100bps lower than the 4% CAGR between FY 2011 and 2015. Management's goal is to reach $100k/employee, and we have modeled in a scenario where that is nearly achieved by year 10. Aggregating these estimates results in a revenue CAGR of ~15% and a business that is 4x larger by 2026 - and that's just if we model employee growth at an 11% CAGR. The forecasts appear even more attractive as growth rates approach those achieved by the Indian offshore industry between 2000 and 2010. For reference, CTSH grew sales from $137 million in 2000 to $4.6 billion in 2010, and Infosys (INFY) sales increased from $414 million in FY'01 to $4.8 billion in FY'10.We think Luxoft is too cheap at its current valuation of 18x FY17E P/E given its long-term growth potential. It is a well-managed operator with a sticky customer base, a differentiated product and a massive and rapidly growing total addressable market. We think the current share price undervalues LXFT's potential to multiply its revenue base by at least 4-5x over the next 10 years.The evolution of the Indian IT industry provides a cautionary study of how investors fixated on current free cash flow yields can miss out on a long-term growth story. While \"value investors\" may balk at Luxoft's seemingly high valuation, we would argue that a P/E multiple of 18x is a significant discount to where Indian vendors such as CTSH have traded since 2000. At the height of the tech bubble, CTSH traded as high as ~73x P/E (1-year forward basis), and between 2001 and 2007, it averaged 37x P/E. Investors who avoided the stock on account of its optically high 30x+ valuation multiples missed out on a tremendous opportunity: a CTSH investor who bought shares in 2000 and held to today would have earned 30x his investment, representing a 23% IRR over a 16-year period.Despite valuation multiples consistently above 30x between 2000 and 2007, investors earned outstanding returns because the Indian IT companies succeeded in compounding at very high growth rates. CTSH, INFY and Wipro (WIT) achieved 36%, 31% and 20% CAGRs, respectively, over a 15-year period.Luxoft and EPAM Systems Inc. (EPAM), the preeminent CEE players, exhibit similar revenue trajectories.To value Luxoft, we use a discounted cash flow analysis. A DCF properly captures the long-term opportunity as compared to a 1- or 2-year forward valuation multiple metric. Our conservative analysis suggests an intrinsic share value of ~$108, implying 105% upside.The revenue build-up is identical to our previously discussed revenue analysis. We project top line growth of 15% CAGR, with EBIT margins expanding by approximately 370 basis points over the projection period. Similar to other IT services businesses, Luxoft's operating margins should have room to increase as the business scales. Historically, CTSH reinvested incremental earnings above a 19-20% EBIT margin threshold, so we believe a 350 basis point expansion to ~19% for LXFT by 2026 is reasonable. Our other assumptions include:Luxoft has succeeded in establishing a unique edge in offshore IT services, an industry where many key players have failed to differentiate themselves. Given the small scale of Eastern European companies relative to the Indian heavyweights, investors often overlook the differences between some of the small Eastern European players and the Indian providers, assuming the services of Luxoft and its larger peer EPAM are comparable to those of Indian vendors Infosys, Cognizant, Wipro, etc.However, Luxoft is focused exclusively on application services and advanced, customized IT solutions. Specifically, the company's forte is application development, as opposed to more mechanical application maintenance and testing. Clients turn to Luxoft for complicated tasks, customized solutions and adept programmers who take ownership of deliverables, not simply an army of bodies. The more rudimentary offerings of the Indian providers present a poor substitute.The IT services industry can be segmented into three areas: business process outsourcing ((BPO)), infrastructure services and application services. Indian providers such as Cognizant, Infosys, HCL Technologies and Wipro provide services across the entire spectrum; Luxoft focuses exclusively on the application services sub-segment.Buzzwords applied in the IT industry can be confusing, often obscuring what some of the services actually encompass. While we've divided the IT outsourcing industry into three distinct sub-segments for illustrative purposes, the different functions are separated by more of a \"dotted grey line,\" as projects could entail both labor-intensive BPO work and bespoke application development. For instance, Cognizant might be hired to build software from scratch, and a different vendor might be engaged to help with the maintenance. With that said, the differences between BPO, infrastructure outsourcing and application services could be simply defined as follows:The chart below outlines the various sub-segments and provides some high-level examples. We will follow with specific examples.Infrastructure outsourcing consists of services related to helping an enterprise manage its IT assets (i.e., data centers, network hardware, security services) and end-user support. Services may include management of help desks (i.e., assist end-users with basic IT issues), end-user devices, data centers, network services and IT spend. Specific examples of infrastructure outsourcing services include the following:- Large global bank hires IT outsourcer to help integrate different IT systems of numerous acquired entities.- Large global corporation hires IT outsourcer to help manage the demand for 24/7 technical support due to a significant increase in the number of applications and device usage.Exponential growth in the offshore outsourcing industry in the late '90s through early 2000s was largely attributable to U.S. and European corporations taking advantage of cheap labor in countries like India. The industry grew very rapidly as global corporations realized significant cost savings from outsourcing non-complex, non-strategic tasks, such as those related to human resources, financial processes (i.e., A/R, A/P, billing and document management), other administrative processes and customer services (i.e., customer call centers). These fairly mundane tasks, outsourced to 3rd party vendors, can be categorized within the BPO umbrella. The chart above provides some high-level categories within BPO; additional examples include the following:Companies rely on 3rd-party vendors to build software from scratch when requisite packaged software does not exist. Large banks like Deutsche Bank and UBS benefit from outsourcing to specialty vendors such as Luxoft and EPAM, which possess a thorough understanding of their clients' industries and can quickly develop software tailored to address a specific need. Luxoft focuses predominantly on application development, a service that is primarily project-based and involves customizing a solution from scratch. Unlike the Indian vendors that work across the IT services spectrum (BPO, infrastructure and application outsourcing), Luxoft focuses on the industries in which it has the greatest expertise to develop unique and sophisticated software solutions for clients. The company's high-quality output is best exemplified by real projects; we have provided a selection of these initiatives below.1. Designed a  to pull real-time and historical equity and equity derivatives data for a global top 10 investment bank.- DB required an application to execute time-series analysis on equity and equity derivatives market data to help develop internal trading strategy and portfolio management- The requirements included:- Luxoft ultimately delivered a solution which reduced costs for the client through:2.  for a large global investment bank.- Luxoft created an online portal for prime brokerage clients, which provided access to accounts, investment products and customer service.- The portal allows customers to receive information on:- The portal allows self-service functions such as:The project required 40+ Luxoft staff and over 1 year of development time.3.  for a large global investment bank.- Following the global financial crisis, this client hired Luxoft to develop a new system that would measure and analyze end-of-day liquidity in a way that complied with Basel II requirements.- This bank originally began the development with support from an Indian vendor, but as the system's complexity and size hit critical levels, it selected Luxoft as the new partner.- Luxoft delivered the project on time and within the budget, and the system was able to provide the following functions:4.  for a leading financial print and media company in the UK.- Luxoft developed a secure, controlled-access VDR to facilitate due diligence for M&A transactions, IPOs and audit transactions.5. Loan collection management system for a large Russian corporate and retail bank.- Luxoft developed a loan collection management system to monitor unpaid debt and to automate and streamline the collections process.- High growth of Russian corporate and retail lending resulted in increased risk of delinquent debt.- Luxoft's solution included functionality for the following:Luxoft's go-to-market strategy is to continue developing proficiency in its core industries. The success of this approach is demonstrated by the revenue generated from clients in financial services and automotive; these two verticals account for nearly 80% of total revenue. Between FY 2011 and FY 2015, revenue from financial services and automobile grew at a CAGR of 37% and 40%, respectively. While Luxoft is well known for its financial services expertise, thanks in large part to Deutsche Bank and UBS (which we discuss later in this report), revenue from automobile clients continues to account for significant growth.The company's expertise in the automobile sector is human machine interface (HMI). In a consumer vehicle, HMI is essentially a tool that presents information to the driver (e.g., a digital cluster that shows how fast you're driving, how much gas you have left, etc.). Luxoft has relationships with Tier 1 auto suppliers (like Harman) and plays a vital role in ensuring functionality of software for the affiliated hardware to be implemented in a vehicle.A good example of HMI technology is the heads-up display (also known as HUD), which is a transparent display installed right above the driver's side of the dashboard or integrated directly into the windshield, allowing the driver to see data (current speed, speed limit, directions from navigation, gas tank indicator, etc.) without looking away from their direct viewpoint.The coding required to build the software behind this kind of technology is extremely complicated, and manufacturers rely on Luxoft to ensure that this technology works seamlessly. While revenue from the automobile segment accounts for only 12% of total revenue, the industry is rapidly expanding and evolving to incorporate sophisticated components like the HUD. The market for the HUD alone is expected to grow from 6.6 million units in 2012 to over 75 million units in 2020, per LXFT.Other examples of the company's projects in automobile are below:1.  for in-car infotainment system for Ford (F).- Ford decided to develop an interactive tutorial to help new drivers and auto dealers learn the in-car communications and entertainment system as quickly and conveniently as possible.- Luxoft created the MyFord Touch Guide as a multi-platform application that is able to run on iOS, Android and Windows devices.- The company completed the project within the 6-month requirement as set forth by Ford.2. for BMW (BAMXY).2.  for BMW (BAMXY).- Luxoft designed solution for a BMW's new 7 Series line.- The system provides driving and navigation guidance with the interaction system overlapped directly to the environment (i.e., directly on the windshield).- Numerous functions, including:3. for a European manufacturer of automotive infotainment, multimedia and navigation systems.3.  for a European manufacturer of automotive infotainment, multimedia and navigation systems.4. for a large vendor of automotive electronics, multimedia and related systems (which we suspect to be Harman, Luxoft's 3rd largest customer).4.  for a large vendor of automotive electronics, multimedia and related systems (which we suspect to be Harman, Luxoft's 3rd largest customer).- The client looked to the company to jointly develop a universal car infotainment and multimedia system that would include telephony, internet communications, onboard navigation and interactive speech control as a platform for a number of high-end vehicle manufacturers (think BMW, Mercedes, etc.).- Luxoft cooperated with several other hardware and software vendors to deliver a complex solution with multiple applications, including:At the company's Investor Day last November, Harman's CEO made several remarks that confirmed Luxoft's reputation for providing high quality services in the automobile sector. Harman's CEO suggested that Luxoft will play an increasingly larger role in the automotive space and he will remain a long-term customer. Some of his quotes are below.Quantitative metrics reinforce the positive qualitative commentary above. Relative to the rest of the industry, the company boasts the highest billing rate at $77k per IT employee. We believe Luxoft's unique approach to software development is a meaningful contributor to the premium its engineers command over the competition.   More impressive still is that the bill rate has grown over the past five years, from $62k per employee to $77k per employee. We attribute this growth to two factors: (i) a growing proportion of fixed-price contracts, and (ii) deeper penetration of clients. In recent years, Luxoft has restructured its pricing with large customers like Deutsche Bank and UBS from time-and-materials (T&M) contracts to fixed-price ones. Under a fixed-price arrangement, Luxoft has more control and flexibility to scale staffing requirements, prompting opportunities for increased margins and revenue per employee. In addition, the company has made tremendous strides in further penetrating large clients. During our due diligence, we learned that projects become more predictable as relationships with vendors lengthen, enabling LXFT to streamline project management.The importance of focusing on application development was also highlighted in Cowen's Mid-Year 2015 IT Spending Survey published on May 26, 2015. The survey included respondents across a variety of sectors and titles. In terms of spending, Cowen found that application development was considered the top priority, garnering 34% of the votes, materially greater than the 20% received in each of the prior two surveys.The survey was particularly relevant to Luxoft because participants from the financial services sector comprised the largest group of respondents, at 36% of the sample size (followed by manufacturing at 25% and healthcare pharma at 16%). With Luxoft generating two-thirds of its revenue from the financial services sector, we believe this survey supports our thesis that its market opportunity in financial services will grow as companies respond to new government regulations.Based in Eastern Europe, Luxoft benefits from the highly educated workforce prevalent in this geography. Nearly one in five students in the CEE region will graduate with degrees related to science, technology or engineering. This excerpt from EPAM's  provides additional color on the quality of talent in Eastern Europe:Luxoft benefits from this attractive demographic, as 80%+ of its employees have at least a master's degree. Additionally, 79% of employees have at least five years of professional experience.Employee attrition is a critical metric when analyzing companies in the IT outsourcing space. Luxoft's low attrition is especially impressive when measured against revenue growth over the past twelve months. Compared to peers, the company stands out with the lowest attrition and highest LTM revenue growth rate.The low attrition is attributable, in part, to the higher salaries offered by Luxoft relative to competitors. For the fiscal year ended 3/31/2015, we estimate that the average employee was paid ~$41k in USD terms, significantly higher than the GDP per capita in the company's largest geographies.Luxoft's multi-year relationships with its two marquee clients, Deutsche Bank and UBS, are a paradigm for its potential to augment growth via new client acquisition.The company's history with Deutsche Bank demonstrates its ability to establish deep customer relationships. Luxoft's engagement with Deutsche Bank began in 2003 through a referral. Initially, it provided a 30-person team to assist DB with application support for the cash equities desk. Upon successful completion, Luxoft was engaged for numerous other projects. Ultimately, its mandate expanded to encompass areas such as fixed income and derivatives as the company was recognized for its innovative and scalable solutions.Examples of projects that Luxoft has completed for Deutsche Bank include:1. Development of a web-based lending tool called  .- The Risk Management Advisory ((RMA)) group at DB wanted to develop an internal, automated credit decision engine which would assist in evaluating credit risks of potential new clients.- Luxoft developed COMPAS, an advanced web-based lending tool used as a credit assessment tool and scoring model for clients ranging from large corporate borrowers to middle-market and commercial accounts as well as retail customers.- Goals for COMPAS included:- Some specific functions include:2. Project StRIDe- Large-scale effort aimed at automating and optimizing the financial infrastructure of the global banking unit.- The implementation involved multiple segments across the organization, including retail banking, commercial and investment banking and asset management.- Luxoft is overseeing 100% of the development.- Project StRIDe helps DB create better internal financial reporting (P&Ls, end-of-day flash reports).- Optimizes compliance process, as management is required to sign documents to attest to accurate records of the firm.- Extremely complex project with hundreds of thousands of man hours already spent since launching in 2012.3. Client clearing tool for the investment bank (corporate finance).- Luxoft helped to re-develop and upgrade a proprietary DB system that's been used by the investment bank for over 20 years.- The core function of the system is to manage conflict clearing in the investment bank.- Luxoft manages/maintains this system and is responsible for upgrading the system, which occurs 3-4 times annually.4. Credit risk management system for global lending.- Luxoft created a credit risk modeling system used by DB's credit officers and certain investment bankers.- The credit decision model would assist in evaluating credit risks of potential new clients and monitoring existing clients.- A complex interface with numerous inputs allows for testing of various scenarios.- The model has hundreds of data points including commodities, currencies, fixed income exposure.- Very integral to the core lending function, and Luxoft handles a majority of the work.- This project is integrated with Project StRIDe mentioned previously.5. Developed  ((CRM)) solution for Deutsche Bank's global banking business.- DB looked to Luxoft to develop a comprehensive CRM platform which would aggregate customer data from numerous existing systems.- Users included sales managers, global relationship managers, and senior executives within Global Banking (both commercial and investment bank).- The project required over 30 Luxoft staff and over 5 years of development and maintenance work.In 2012, DB came under immense pressure to reduce costs amid the European debt crisis. During that time, the bank undertook a vendor consolidation and reduced the number of IT services vendors from 12 to 4. Luxoft survived that consolidation and gained business previously given to other IT outsourcers. DB also restructured its pricing arrangement with the company to move away from T&M to fixed price, forcing Luxoft to temporarily sacrifice margins. Luxoft fulfilled DB's requests during the course of that turbulent transition and, consequently, was named a key strategic vendor in 2012, leading to an expanded footprint within the investment bank. As a result, ~70% of Luxoft's DB revenue is now generated from the investment bank, while the other 30% comes from the treasury services segment that offers cash and liquidity management services for mostly large corporate clients.Luxoft's success with UBS began with a history that mirrors the Deutsche Bank story. This relationship began around 2006, when UBS opened its Moscow office and management looked to bring in local IT resources for application support on the equities trading desk within the investment banking division. As Luxoft repeatedly impressed UBS, the relationship soon grew out of the Moscow office to other business segments and geographies. The relationship reached a turning point in 2012, when UBS began to wind down its fixed income business and relied on Luxoft for IT support as a majority of the existing employees were laid off in that division. Luxoft's performance on that transition was well received by UBS management and resulted in its recognition as a strategic vendor. Luxoft's headcount at UBS more than doubled, increasing from 600 to roughly 1,300 over the two-year span from 2013 to 2015. In FY 2015, the company generated $105 million of revenue from this relationship alone, counting UBS as its second-largest client.RevenueCustomer Since2003 (13 years)2006 (10 years)Allocated Resources2,600 Employees (30 in 2003)1,300 Employees (600 at LXFT IPO in 2013)Other VendorsAccenture and TCSAccenture, CTSH and EPAMRevenue by Bank Segment~70% Investment Bank / ~30% Treasury/CFO & Other~80% Investment Bank / ~20% Wealth ManagementOtherMSA renewed in 2016 Currently in 5th year of contract.Admittedly, the level of concentration at DB and UBS (which together accounted for 56% of total revenue in FY 2015) appears concerning at face value. However, we perceive the concentration risk to be less pronounced given Luxoft's deeply embedded position with these clients amid an uncertain and complicated regulatory environment. In the post-financial crisis era, regulators have unleashed an avalanche of compliance and regulatory demands, and the implementation of final rules is not even complete and the list continues to grow - as of December 2015, only  .Considering both these regulatory trends and feedback from former Deutsche Bank and UBS employees, we feel confident that Luxoft will remain deeply entrenched with its core banking customers. Earlier this year,  discussing StRIDe, a major internal IT initiative at DB aimed at creating a central warehouse for all of the investment bank's risk and finance data. Interestingly, Luxoft was listed as the sole software developer for this large-scale engagement designed to aggregate information from all of the bank's legal units (~1,000 data streams and more than 100 transaction systems).With Luxoft still in its nascency, customer concentration is not an immediate concern, particularly as the company expands beyond its top five customers. In fact, LXFT has been experiencing solid revenue growth in its smaller accounts, with sales from clients outside of the top five growing from $56 million in FY 2011 to $228 million in FY 2016. In FY 2016, revenue outside of the top 5 grew at an astounding 56%.Luxoft's portfolio of high-potential accounts (\"HPAs\") grew from 12 at the IPO in 2013 to more than 40 today. Clients are classified as HPAs if management believes the accounts have the potential to reach at least $5 million in recurring annual revenue within the \"short to mid-term.\" On the FQ3 2016 earnings call, management disclosed that HPA customers generated more than 177% growth year over year in the 9-month period:In the IT services industry, as in other asset-light and people-oriented businesses, talent is one of the most valuable resources. As such, employee growth is a vital metric when analyzing businesses like Luxoft, which rely on human capital. We have observed a strong correlation between employee and revenue growth for IT outsourcing vendors. Specifically, employee growth on a two-quarter lagging basis appears to have historically been a fairly predictive indicator of future revenue growth. The correlation coefficient (a measure of linear correlation) between the two variables was 79% for CTSH and ~60% for Wipro, also suggesting near-term employee growth may be a relevant indicator of revenue growth.Unfortunately, Luxoft's publicly available quarterly growth data is only obtainable starting in 2013, making it difficult to determine whether a strong correlation exists, as we'd prefer more data. The chart below shows what the historical correlation has been since FQ1 2015.However, the company posted robust employee growth over the past few quarters (22% in FQ3'16 and 23% in FQ2'16), giving us confidence that the pipeline of current activity remains extremely strong.One data point we employ to track current demand for employees is Luxoft's  . The page lists job postings by function and geography, and listings are updated on a daily basis. Historical data is accessible via the  , an online web archive service.Before July 2015, the number of job postings consistently remained around 350 for total employees. Beginning in July and through late August of 2015, we saw total job postings and development positions grow to ~400-450. Recently, we saw this spike to ~600, implying that demand remains very strong. This data may prove a reliable proxy for future employee growth - and thus, future revenue growth - with sudden spikes or declines signaling fluctuation in the current state of customer demand.EPAM Systems is Luxoft's primary CEE competitor in the emerging IT services industry. Like Luxoft, EPAM focuses predominantly on application development and employs talent in similar geographies, principally Belarus (Luxoft has no presence), Ukraine (#1 Luxoft location) and Russia (#2 Luxoft location). Revenue per employee is higher at Luxoft ($76k vs. $65k), but attrition levels have historically been similar, between 10% and 12%. At a high level, the firms appear fairly similar, even sharing some customers: UBS is EPAM's largest customer and Luxoft's second largest. Admittedly, this overlap in value proposition and edge makes us bullish on EPAM's prospects (i.e., focus on application development, access to talent in CEE, etc.). With that said, our work clearly demonstrates Luxoft to be the higher-quality provider.One way to distinguish Luxoft from EPAM is by comparing the revenue generated from T&M versus fixed-price contracts. For the latest LTM period, LXFT generated 55% of revenue from fixed-price contracts as compared to 13% for EPAM. Under a T&M pricing structure, clients are billed at a pre-determined rate for the total hours worked. Vendors sign a MSA with clients that includes a rate card outlining the hourly rates for each level of employee (i.e., the rate set for entry level, experienced programmer, project manager, etc.). Under fixed-price contracts, vendors are paid a pre-arranged fixed price and are responsible for managing their own resources. The primary difference between the two arrangements is that with fixed-price contracts, the vendor can potentially make a greater profit (relative to T&M, where margin is fixed), while also facing the risk of exceeding the estimated cost.Luxoft and EPAM have different contract structures due to their different delivery models. There are two widely adopted delivery models for offshore IT vendors: staff augmentation and managed services. EPAM derives most of its revenue using the staff augmentation model, while Luxoft generates ~55% of revenue from managed services. The most widely adopted model for offshore IT services is staff augmentation; however, the industry is gradually shifting to the managed services model. Under the staff augmentation model, pricing is based on T&M, and companies pay for each staff member at an agreed-upon rate. Staff augmentation is beneficial to companies looking for rapid access to temporary employees with specific capabilities and skills. Additionally, there's no waste of time or resources for companies trying to recruit new employees to fill needs that may only be temporary. When considering an offshore vendor, customers seek the lowest cost per contractor, encouraging stiff competition among suppliers.While staff augmentation is ideal for short-term solutions, the model does not work well for customers seeking a long-term partnership. When used as a long-term solution, the staff augmentation model is more expensive. The cost benefit gained in the short term (through avoidance of HR costs associated with hiring) is lost. Perhaps even more significant is that reliance on staff augmentation as a long-term solution could lead to poor management of resources. Under this model, the company is responsible for managing the vendor's resources. This gives the vendor limited incentive or accountability for the outcomes and quality, as no specific requirements or deliverables are specified in the staff augmentation contract.Another significant issue with the staff augmentation model is the risk that knowledge will be retained with the contractors and not with the hiring organization. As contractors spend more time on a specific project, they accumulate knowledge and capabilities that become invaluable. The vendor could potentially use this knowledge to hold the customer hostage, leading to a more permanent engagement utilizing an expensive delivery model.The alternative delivery model is known as managed services. Under this model, vendors agree to deliver a specific capability or functionality with a desired level of results for a fixed price. This differs significantly from staff augmentation, which revolves around defining cost inputs; with managed services, the vendor is committed to delivering an outcome at a fixed price. This model requires a higher level of trust as customers cede more control to the vendor. The customer defines the requirement and desired outcome, but the vendor is responsible for managing all resources, assuming the risk of meeting the delivery commitment. Since engagements are on a fixed-price basis, vendors are highly incentivized to maintain high productivity, as any delays would result in cost overruns borne solely by the vendor, not the customer.Based on our discussions with former customers and executives in the industry, the utilization of one model over another is the best way to distinguish Luxoft from EPAM. Staff augmentation was the primary delivery model for Luxoft several years ago, but between FY 2011 and FY 2015 revenue from T&M declined from 91% of total revenue to 41%.Luxoft's success in implementing this model with clients is evident in its enduring relationships with DB and UBS, customers since 2003 and 2008, respectively. Due to the long-term nature of these relationships, projects become more predictable, creating an opportunity for the company to maximize efficiency. We think this explains, in part, why LXFT's gross margins are higher than EPAM's. While EPAM's gross margins have declined over the past 7 years (EPAM management attributes the decline primarily to wage inflation), Luxoft has managed to keep gross margins stable at 42-44%.As corporations increasingly look to utilize technology to boost their competitiveness, the world will turn to providers of high-end developers such as Luxoft. Who programs the dashboard in your car? Who builds the capital adequacy reporting software of our leading financial institutions? How do local retailers build their online marketplaces? The United States simply does not graduate enough software engineers to satisfy the burgeoning demand for customized application development. This shortage of talent will result in the continued outsourcing to companies like Luxoft that specialize in recruiting, training and mobilizing teams of highly talented and experienced programmers. We believe Luxoft is in the early stages of a rapid, long-term growth trajectory that its Indian peers experienced in the late '90s and early 2000s. If the company repeats even a quarter of those achievements, its shares will be a tremendous investment.See also  on seekingalpha.comThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["op Tech StocksMSFT +0.31%AAPL +0.83%IBM +1.01%CSCO +1.07%GOOG +0.42%Technology stocks were rising, with shares of tech companies in the S&P 500 climbing more than 0.7% in recent trade.In company news, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp (  ) fell to a nearly two-year low on Friday after the technology consulting company said it promoted Rajeev Mehta, the CEO of its IT Services unit, to be its new president following the resignation of Gordon Coburn amid an internal investigation into improper payments tied to some of its facilities in India.The probe currently is focusing on only a small number of facilities in its early stages and is being led by the audit committee of the company's board of directors along with outside counsel, according to a Cognizant regulatory filing this morning.

In fact,  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) were particularly poor performers today.It's not clear if there was any wrongdoing, but the fact that Cognizant Technology Solutions President Gordon Coburn has unexpectedly resigned would at least suggest something is amiss.CTSH ended Friday more than 13% lower following reports that the company was investigating whether it violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by making improper payments to a facility in India. The company voluntarily informed U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission of its investigation, which isn't an admission of guilt, but it does create an alarming implication.Citi downgraded CTSH from a \"Buy\" to \"Neutral\" following the announcement, deeming that the probe made the stock uninvestable until the shadow of doubt was gone.CTSH wasn't the only name to plunge following the unexpected departure of a key executive. Wynn Resorts Macau President Gamal Abdelaziz also resigned today, sending WYNN shares more than 3% lower as a result.Wynn made it clear in an official statement that \"Mr. Aziz has confirmed that he has no disagreement with the board and that there are no other matters in relation to his resignation that need to be brought to the attention of the shareholders of the company.\"Still, it's a disruption at a point when the company didn't need one.While Macau was considered the next Las Vegas when the Chinese enclave finally allowed gambling establishments to be built there several years ago, its heroic growth hit a wall as a result of a regulatory crackdown that began in 2014.With the greater scrutiny and new rules now more than a year old, year-over-year revenue was expected to start growing well again for Macau's casino operators like Wynn Resorts. That growth has been anemic so far, however, and not everyone is confident Wynn will fully participate in whatever gambling recovery Macau can muster. Abdelaziz may well be one of the doubters.Last but not least, wireless communication technology company reported earnings after yesterday's close that fell short of expectations, sending CAMP shares lower as a result. All told, CalAmp earned 27 cents per share on revenue of $90.5 million in its fiscal second quarter, versus expectations for earnings of 28 cents per share and a top line of $92.1 million.The forecast for the current quarter was similarly disappointing.

Financial details of the transaction were kept under wraps. The move is a part of Accenture's strategy to strengthen its position in Workday so that the company can better serve clients around the world.Founded in 2009, DayNine is a leading global Workday Services Partner that serves clients across an extensive range of industries including consumer goods, healthcare providers, pharmaceuticals, financial services, and communications, media and technology. The company has employee strength of over 260, serving at its offices in the U.S., Germany, UK, Japan and China.As per Accenture's press release, \"Our clients are increasingly choosing Workday to drive their cloud transformations, so we are taking this important step to meet the growing demand.\" DayNine helps organizations to transform their employee experience and financial management systems using Workday in order to gain maximum value and drive growth.With this buyout, Accenture will be able to leverage the latest technology, provide enhanced performance and strengthen its position as a global leader in cloud-based applications as well as deploy advanced Workday solutions across technology, processes and people.

Investing for the long haul can smooth out the risks of buying individual stocks, which may tumble or stay depressed for ages before taking off.The following three technology companies possess attractive long-range prospects: Each should be able to expand its sales and profits at rates well above the market average for years. (Read  to learn about seven more picks outside the tech sector.)Investing for the next decade doesn't mean you can buy these stocks then forget about them. You'll need to follow them closely and may have to sell if cracks emerge in the business. Still, if these tech companies can keep building on their recent successes, they have a good shot at delivering superb returns over the long run.Symbol: Share price: $98.79Market capitalization: $49.2 billion52-week high/low: $71.27 - $104.16Estimated earnings per share for the fiscal year ending in November 2016: $2.87Estimated earnings per share for the fiscal year ending in November 2017: $3.81Price-earnings ratio: 30Dividend yield: noneThe business: Adobe sells software, such as Photoshop, used by consumers and businesses for graphic design and digital imaging, along with cloud-based services and digital marketing tools.What will drive growth: Creative types in advertising, media and other fields rely heavily on Adobe software, which faces scant competition in its niche. The firm is also making inroads into web analytics and digital marketing services, and it's migrating customers to a subscription model for its \"Creative Cloud\" suite of software products, creating a long and steady revenue stream.The stock: At 30 times estimated profits, the stock isn't cheap. But Adobe is growing rapidly. Wall Street analysts see sales climbing 22%, to $7 billion, in the fiscal year that ends in November 2017. Profits should increase even faster, rising by 33%, a rate of growth that makes the high price-earnings ratio palatable, says brokerage firm Canaccord Genuity. Although the firm doesn't see big share-price gains over the near term, Adobe has \"the ingredients for an exceptional long-term investment,\" Canaccord says.See Also: The business: Cognizant provides information-technology consulting services, overseeing complex software projects for large companies.What will drive growth: Global demand for IT services is climbing at an annual pace of 4.6%, according to research firm Gartner. But Cognizant is likely to boost sales at double that rate. Financial and health care companies--its core market--are hiring Cognizant to oversee software development in areas such as social media, mobile technology and cloud-based computing. The firm outsources much of that work to India. But it forges close ties to clients, maintaining about 30% of a project's senior staff on site. Those relationships tend to result in contracts that run longer and are more lucrative than those won by most other IT outsourcing firms, says Morningstar analyst Andrew Lange. Analysts estimate that Cognizant will collect $13.6 billion in revenues in 2016, 32% more than the company generated in 2014. Wall Street analysts expect revenues and profits to rise by more than 10% a year through 2018.The stock: At 15 times estimated earnings, the shares look cheap, says S&P  Intelligence analyst David Holt. Rating the stock a \"buy,\" he sees it hitting $67 in a year.See Also: Symbol: Share price: $73.82Market capitalization: $50.1 billion52-week high/low: $84.48 - $52.60Estimated earnings per share for the fiscal year ending in January 2017: $0.95Estimated earnings per share for the fiscal year ending in January 2018 $1.27Price-earnings ratio: 63Dividend yield: noneThe business: Salesforce sells web-based software that helps companies generate and manage sales.What will drive growth: Already a powerhouse in subscription-based, online \"software-as-a-service\" for big businesses, Salesforce is broadening its product lineup and pushing into areas such as data analytics and digital marketing. It's also making acquisitions to fuel its expansion, such as a recent deal to buy e-commerce company Demandware for $2.8 billion. Wall Street expects revenues to top $10.1 billion in the fiscal year that ends in January 2018, up from an expected $8.3 billion in the prior year. Over the next decade, sales should climb by an average 12% a year, says Morningstar.The stock: Salesforce's shares have been scintillating, soaring more than 11-fold since February 2009. That kind of appreciation isn't sustainable, especially with the stock trading at 63 times estimated year-ahead profits. Nonetheless, Bank of America Merrill Lynch expects the shares to hit $100 over the next year. By 2020, the bank figures, Salesforce could double annual revenues. If the company can achieve that feat, its stock price would likely double by then, too.See Also: The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["lobal IT services provider,  recently joined forces with Oracle Corp.  to make infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) solutions available through Accenture Oracle Business Group. This alliance will further strengthen their longstanding partnership. However, financial aspects of the deal were not disclosed.Accenture Oracle Business Group has been offering software-as-a-service (SaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) solutions, which help Accenture to meet the growing demand in the public cloud sector. The extension of the IaaS offering will place \"Accenture as Oracle's largest global systems integrator (GSI) and a leader in Oracle Public Cloud.\"Formed in Apr 2015, Accenture Oracle Business Group has been developed on Oracle's Public Cloud Platform. It helps enterprises extend SaaS, IaaS and PaaS applications and migrate from existing on-premise applications to the cloud. The latest offering will enable users to better manage their digital assets on Oracle Public Cloud and help reduce risk.The public cloud offering will provide more choice and flexibility to customers. Now both the companies will be able to provide solutions for Oracle applications, middleware and databases. The partnership will allow both the companies to compete effectively with local cloud-based software providers.According to Paul Daugherty, Accenture's chief technology officer, \"Oracle is expanding their cloud capabilities at an impressive pace, and we are pleased to now provide joint clients with a complete suite of offerings and industry solutions through the Accenture Oracle Business Group.\" Further, \"The addition of new IaaS offerings reflects our ongoing commitment to help clients achieve value through Oracle's cloud solutions and solidifies Accenture's position as the first managed services provider for Oracle's cloud portfolio.\"Though Accenture has been offering Oracle cloud solutions for a long time, the company did not have adequate solutions to meet the growing demand from the public sector. The latest partnership will allow Accenture to significantly expand its IaaS offerings to the public sector across the globe. We believe that this partnership will substantially add to the company's cloud capabilities, giving it an edge over its peers.With this acquisition, Accenture will be better positioned to leverage the latest technology for its clients, provide enhanced performance and strengthen its position as a global leader in IaaS based applications as well as SaaS and PaaS services. The acquisition will also help Accenture to improve its customer relationships and expand market share by solving business critical issues.Accenture currently has over 52,000 skilled Oracle consultants worldwide. Moreover, as Oracle is one of the largest providers of cloud-based applications and software, it becomes necessary for Accenture to enhance its capabilities in delivering Oracle-based business solutions.According to a recent Forbes article that gathered data from research firms such as International Data Corporation, Forrester, Gartner, Ovum, Wikibon and others, the global SaaS marketing will grow to $67 billion in 2018 from $49 billion in 2015. The article also indicated that IaaS spending was $16.5 billion in 2015, up roughly 33% from 2014.According to Centaur Partners, SaaS and cloud-based business applications are likely to grow from $13.5 billion in 2013 to $32.8 billion in 2016, reflecting a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.5%.Another research firm, IDC projected last year that public IT cloud services spending will grow at a five-year CAGR of 22.8% to over $127 billion in 2018. The growth rate is six times that of the broader IT market. In 2018, public IT cloud services will make up more than 50% of global software and storage development.The exponential growth in the amount of data, complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals compelled several companies to turn to cloud computing vendors. Therefore, considering the growing need for cloud-based applications and software, we expect Accenture's investments in this space to boost long-term growth. | We are encouraged by Accenture's strategy of growing through acquisitions and partnerships. These have enabled Accenture to enter newer markets, diversify and broaden its product portfolio and maintain a leading position. We believe that the company's regular acquisitions and partnership strategies will significantly contribute to the revenue stream.However, we remain slightly cautious about the intensifying competition from Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.  and an uncertain IT spending environment, which may undermine the company's near-term performance.Currently, Accenture carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Also, Accenture announced a definitive agreement to acquire a 47.4% stake in OCTO Technology.We are encouraged by Accenture's strategy of growing through acquisitions. These buyouts have enabled the company to foray into newer markets, diversify and broaden its product portfolio, and maintain a leading position. We believe that regular acquisitions will significantly contribute to the company's revenue stream.Going forward, Accenture's solid performance across insurance, banking and health care segments reflects strong demand for its services, which will boost its long-term growth prospects.However, increasing competition from Cognizant Technology Solutions  and International Business Machines Corporation, a strained spending environment and Accenture's broad European exposure may temper its growth to some extent. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Accenture is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below. Earnings ESP for Accenture is +0.77%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.31 per share is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.30. We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Strong Sell) stocks going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some companies with a positive ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank that you may want to consider:IHS Markit Ltd.  with Earnings ESP of +22.22% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see  .Actuant Corporation  with Earnings ESP of +3.45% and a Zacks Rank #3.Beyond this Analyst Blog, would you like to see Zacks' best recommendations that are not available to the public?

(NASDAQ: CTSH) released slightly better-than-expected second-quarter 2016 results on Friday and expanded its share repurchase program in the process. But despite bucking a  of weaker results from its peers in Q2, shares of the IT consulting and business process services company are little changed since then. So let's take a look at how Cognizant capped the first half of the year and what to expect going forward.Quarterly revenue climbed 9.2% year over year to $3.37 billion, and based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), that translated to a 39.9% decline in net income to $252.4 million, or $0.41 per diluted share. On an adjusted (non-GAAP) basis, however -- which adds perspective by excluding items like stock-based compensation and acquisition-related charges -- Cognizant's net income per share increased 10.1% year over year to $0.87.By comparison, Cognizant's guidance in May called for roughly the same revenue in the range of $3.34 billion to $3.4 billion and lower adjusted earnings per share of $0.80 to $0.82.Cognizant president Gordon Coburn stated:Cognizant CEO Francisco D'Souza elaborated that the results \"represented broad-based revenue growth across service lines, geographies and industries, including healthcare and financial services.\"Let's get a little more specific and break down revenue by segment. The quarterly results show that financial services sales climbed 8.1% year over year to $1.351 billion, healthcare grew 6.9% to $958.8 million, manufacturing/retail/logistics segment sales grew 14.2% to $660.4 million, and all other categories increased 11.2% year over year to $399.5 million.On a geographic basis, North American revenue increased 8.3% to $2.624 billion, United Kingdom revenue grew 4.4% to $310.7 million, Rest of Europe sales increased 15.5% to $236.5 million, and Rest of World revenue rose 25% to $198.6 million.During the subsequent conference call, D'Souza elaborated that after Cognizant's slow start in the first quarter, the financial services and healthcare segments returned to positive sequential growth in the second quarter as expected, helping to drive one of the company's strongest ever performances in terms of sequential dollar growth.D'Souza also offered some color on Cognizant's progress driving its three strategic initiatives, which aim to foster the aforementioned digital transformation.As a reminder, first among those initiatives is helping clients build new front-end capabilities, both through investing organically and through select acquisitions. Regarding the latter, just last week Cognizant announced its acquisition of Idea Couture, a privately held \"digital innovation, strategy, and design firm\" that specializes in designing and prototyping products, services, and business models to support growth and build competitive advantage. Idea Couture will become part of Cognizant Digital Works.Second, Cognizant is working to drive efficiency in the core transaction processing operations of its clients, building platform-based solutions and industry utilities that are offered to customers in a Business Process as a Service (BPaaS) model. Following Cognizant's $2.7 billion deal to acquire healthcare information specialist TriZetto in 2014, for example, the company has secured several such deals with a combined total contract value approaching $2 billion -- which helps explain its relative strength in the healthcare sector -- and is chasing additional similar opportunities in the pipeline.And third, Cognizant is working to bring clients' existing systems up to date with next-gen IT, including standardizing infrastructure and simplifying how applications are developed and delivered.\"We're making good progress in each of these areas,\" D'Souza stated, \"and we're confident that this framework will differentiate our services and solutions in the marketplace now and in the future.\"Also during the quarter, Cognizant executed a one-time remittance of $2.8 billion from India, increasing its cash balance in the U.S. by $1 billion, net of taxes, and in other international markets by $1.6 billion.\"This provides additional financial flexibility in funding our strategic investments to drive long-term growth for Cognizant,\" explained CFO Karen McLoughlin.As in Cognizant's last two quarterly reports, however, management again warned that discretionary spending in the banking sector remains soft. And macroeconomic headwinds, including uncertainty and currency pressure stemming from the recent \"Brexit\" vote -- as well as persistently low interest rates -- could potentially crimp growth in the financial services and healthcare sectors in the second half of the year.As such, Cognizant anticipates third-quarter revenue in the range of $3.43 billion to $3.47 billion and adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0.82 to $0.85. For the full fiscal year 2016, Cognizant now expects revenue in the range of $13.47 billion to $13.6 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $3.32 to $3.44.By comparison, Cognizant's previous 2016 guidance called for the same EPS range, but on higher revenue of $13.65 billion to $14 billion.To their credit, management continues to insist that despite the near-term headwinds, Cognizant's pipeline remains healthy, and the company's compelling medium- to long-term story remains intact. And they're putting their money where their mouth is: With $1.9 billion of its existing $2 billion stock repurchase program now exhausted, Cognizant's board approved a $1 billion increase in the authorization, to $3 billion, and extended the program's term by one year to Dec. 31, 2018.In the end, though the market may frown upon Cognizant's conservative outlook and potential short-term struggles, I think patient, long-term investors should be content with where it stands today.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Let's take an early look at Cognizant Technology to see what investors should pay attention to in its results.Data source: Yahoo! Finance.In recent months, investors have gotten minimally more pessimistic about Cognizant's earnings, cutting their second-quarter projections by $0.02 per share and making similarly modest downward adjustments to full-year estimates for 2016 and 2017. The stock has also given up some ground, falling 3% since mid-April.Cognizant's first-quarter results showed some of the countervailing factors affecting the IT consulting company. Sales climbed 10%, helping to push net income upward by 15%, but Cognizant's traditional areas of strength in the healthcare and financial industries saw their growth rates slow down somewhat from past quarters. The manufacturing, retail, and logistics segment picked up the slack with faster growth, and revenue gains in Europe and the rest of the world outpaced what the company produced within the U.S. market. However, Cognizant gave guidance that was somewhat discouraging, pushing its full-year revenue target toward the bottom end of its previous range. Projections for the second quarter also indicated a slowing pace of growth for Cognizant.Part of the issue that Cognizant faces is that relatively weak economic conditions throughout much of the world have potential customers thinking twice before boosting their IT spending. As analysts at Pacific Crest noted in assigning an overweight rating to the stock in early July, when customers do pull the trigger with technology upgrades, Cognizant has done a good job of building up its reputation within the information technology space and competing for lucrative business at the high end of the industry. Clients who have used Cognizant in the past generally have trust in the company, and that should spur repeat business in the future.The weakness in the industry was evident from the results that rival  (NYSE: INFY) announced in late June. The IT consulting competitor said that fallout from the U.K. decision to leave the European Union would prevent it from reaching its previous sales guidance for the fiscal year, and the company's first-quarter earnings were less than most investors had expected. Because of Brexit, Infosys reduced its revenue growth rates by 1 to 2.5 percentage points. Infosys has particularly strong exposure to British financial companies, and so if London ceases to be as large a player in Europe's financial industry, Infosys arguably has more to suffer than some of its peers. Nevertheless, Cognizant also works in the U.K. and has a lot at stake in ensuring that the European economy continues to perform well and produce the strength necessary to spur customers to upgrade their technology infrastructure.Still, Cognizant is working hard to make the most of its opportunities. In late June, the company said that  had selected its SmartTrials platform to help manage its clinical trial operational and patient data. Given the need for biotech and pharmaceutical companies to collect data efficiently in a way that complies with regulatory requirements, Cognizant hopes that the selection will lead to still more companies in the healthcare and life sciences industry selecting the consultant for their needs.In the Cognizant earnings report, investors should look for similarities and differences between the challenges that Infosys faces and what Cognizant sees as its biggest threats. The need for IT consulting will only get larger in the years to come, so it's largely up to Cognizant to set the stage for maximizing its own growth going forward. Even if it takes a short-term hit, Cognizant has plenty of longer-term opportunities ahead of it.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The company has been steadily gaining traction in its Outsourcing business, driven primarily by the increase in demand for technology that can improve operating efficiencies and cut costs.The upward trend continued through the third quarter, with Outsourcing revenues growing 6% in local currency on a year-over-year basis. The improvement resulted mainly from rising demand for Accenture's outsourcing solutions supported by most of its operating industry groups across all geographic regions.Furthermore, amid the growing need for digital marketing, we are encouraged by Accenture's efforts to enhance its digital marketing capabilities through acquisitions.

Even earlier, in 2014, the company had made four major acquisitions, Reactive Media Pty Ltd., Hytracc Consulting, Enkitec and i4C Analystics.These acquisitions have enabled Accenture to enter new markets, diversify and broaden its product portfolio, and maintain its leadership position.

However, financial details regarding the same are still under wraps.Founded in 1996, IMJ strives to help other companies in transforming their businesses using its end-to-end digital marketing services.

It provides digital strategy services as well, which comprise strategies to improve the brand identity of clients, thereby helping them to maximize return on investment (ROI) from their digital programs. | IMJ will join the Accenture Interactive platform, which is part of the company's digital marketing-services arm, Accenture Digital. Accenture Interactive was formed in 2009 to offer superior consulting, technology and analytics services to chief marketing officers (CMOs).Since the formation of Accenture Interactive, the company has made strategic acquisitions to enhance digital marketing capabilities, including the acquisition of Reactive Media Pty Ltd., an Australian digital services provider; and Brightstep, a Swedish digital content and commerce solution provider.This latest acquisition will help Accenture to provide end-to-end digital marketing services, bringing a deeper and broader set of digital solutions to clients.Furthermore, according to Atsushi Egawa, country managing director at Accenture Japan \"Acquiring a majority stake in IMJ provides us with enhanced capabilities to deliver digital services in this dynamic market.\"IMJ, on the other hand, will be able to leverage Accenture Interactive's complete suite of digital marketing services.

This will also help the company in effectively competing with other digital marketing service providers such as International Business Machines Corp.  , Dell and Deloitte.Although Accenture's strategy of growing through acquisitions is encouraging, we are slightly cautious of intensifying competition from the likes of Cognizant Technology Solutions  and a strained IT spending environment.Currently, Accenture has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 5.1% return against the $42.50 commitment, or a 3.1% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to CTSH's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $42.50 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. sees its shares fall 31.9% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $40.35 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $2.15 from $42.50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.1% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., and highlighting in green where the $42.50 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2018 put at the $42.50 strike for the 3.1% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (considering the last 253 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $62.40) to be 28%.

In other words, if we look at the number of call buyers and then use the long-term median to project the number of put buyers we'd expect to see, we're actually seeing more put buyers than expected out there in  so far today.  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" .'s  first-quarter 2016 adjusted earnings of 76 cents per share came surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 70 cents while revenues of $3.20 billion fell short of the Consensus Estimate of $3.23 billion.Segment wise, the Financial services segment (40.2% of revenues) that includes insurance, banking and transaction processing grew 10.7% year over year to $1,285.7 million.

Yet the IT consulting business relies on clients being willing to spend money on capital improvements to their own technology platforms, and navigating those choppy waters has put pressure on some players in the industry. Coming into Friday's first-quarter financial report, Cognizant shareholders believe the IT consultant should continue to grow at a healthy pace, and they hope that pace will accelerate into the future.Let's take an early look at how Cognizant Technology is likely to perform and what's ahead for 2016.\n  \nData source: Yahoo! Finance. In recent months, investors have pulled back on their view of Cognizant's earnings, reducing their first-quarter projections by $0.02 per share and cutting their full-year 2016 and 2017 estimates by between 2% and 4%. The stock has been volatile, falling 4% since late January but having made substantial swings in either direction since then.Cognizant's fourth-quarter results reflected the company's ability to grow, but it also highlighted investor concerns about the future. Cognizant's revenue rose by 18%, leading to a similar 17% rise in net income. The healthcare and financial services segments continued to lead the way higher for Cognizant's business, and solid performance from the manufacturing, retail, and logistics arenas also helped buoy the company's results. Even hard-hit areas of the world like Europe managed to post double-digit percentage gains in revenue.However, investors have gotten used to strong guidance from Cognizant, and there, the company fell short. Pressures could persist not only in the first-quarter results we're about to see, but in Cognizant's full-year performance as well, and the IT consultant is dealing with a raft of competition from other companies in the business. For instance,  has moved forward with plans to focus on its areas of highest potential, and with cloud-computing and cybersecurity among the key sectors in which Accenture expects to concentrate, Cognizant will have to work hard to carve out and defend its own niche in those spaces.Cognizant hasn't hesitated to turn to partnerships in order to further its own growth opportunities. In April, Cognizant joined forces with  in order to play a role in helping its enterprise customers work with the Box Platform product. The idea behind the collaboration is to help modernize client business processes in a way that will utilize the power of cloud computing to replace more expensive and inefficient older models of technology. A Cognizant executive noted that \"documents still sit at the core of many business processes today,\" and emphasized the ability that Box will be able \"to quickly build flexible solutions that leverage enterprise-grade content management, collaboration, and security capabilities.\"Similarly, Cognizant also partnered with mobile-solutions provider Kony in April, saying they will work together to develop mobile applications for a wide range of industries, including banking, healthcare, manufacturing, retail, and government. With Kony integrating mobile-app design capabilities into the Cognizant Digital Collaboratory's offerings, the two companies believe it will be easier for designers to envision solutions for enterprise customers' needs.In the Cognizant Technology Solutions earnings report, the IT consultant needs to keep pointing to future opportunities to collaborate and innovate in order to stay ahead of its competition. As long as Cognizant gives its clients a reason to stick with it -- and for new clients to jump on board -- it will have a strong chance to grow and even accelerate its growth into the future.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The report cited that Cognizant is gaining significant traction with its capacity to \"transform data into tangible business benefits through a global innovation and delivery ecosystem.\"While the company has been a prominent technological services provider for the last few years, it is increasing its focus towards high profit areas like professional consulting and business-process outsourcing.Analytics, that is obtaining actionable insights from large amounts of structured or unstructured data, has been gaining popularity among the tech companies. This is because it is one of the important technologies that support the automation, which has clearly become a focus area of most tech providers. Cognizant is increasingly leveraging analytics to provide more sophisticated end-to-end solutions (like outcome-based models) for its clients. The company has already been working on Business Process-as-a-Service, or BPaaS, which deploys both automation and analytics to enhance client processes.Apart from analytics,Cognizant has also been gradually expanding its offerings in growth areas like social, mobile and cloud computing in order to get a more optimal business mix. We believe that these emerging areas can become key growth drivers for the company going ahead.Increasing exposure to fast growing verticals like financial services and healthcare is also a positive for the company.Overall, we believe that these areas are placing the company quite well to drive growth in the long run, especially given the slowdown in global IT spending.However, rising wages and customer concentration remain headwinds in the near term.

This will also help the company in effectively competing with other digital marketing service providers such as International Business Machines Corp.  , Dell and Deloitte.Although Accenture's strategy of growing through acquisitions is encouraging, we are slightly cautious because of intensifying competition from the likes of Cognizant Technology Solutions  , and a strained IT spending environment.Currently, Accenture has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Another well-ranked stock in the technology sector is Lexmark International Inc.  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Oil prices continued to dominate proceedings, falling through the first half of the month on discouraging data and the lack of consensus among major oil exporting countries on a production cut.However, prices recovered during the second half as discussions on curbing supply seemed to be progressing in a positive direction. Domestic economic data was mixed in nature, showing signs of improvement toward the second half. However, earnings remained lackluster in nature and weighed on investor sentiment.For the month, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq declined 0.4% and Array.2%, respectively. The indexes posted losses for three straight months for the first time since Sep 20ArrayArray. Meanwhile, Dow increased by 0.3% last month, its highest pace of increase since Nov 20Array5. Benchmarks ended the month mostly in the red due to volatile movement of  , discouraging quarterly reports and mixed economic data.Oil prices remained volatile during the month following uncertainty regarding possible production cuts. Moreover, doubt over Fed rate hike prospects and increasing oil loan defaults possibilities weighed on the key U.S. indexes. Lower-than-expected earnings results of major companies impacted the market negatively. However, Dow ended in the green for February due to broad-based reasons. Gains in Apple Inc.  also boosted the blue-chip index.Some earnings results provided a certain amount of impetus to the markets. Better-than-expected GDP rate growth also boosted investor sentiment. However, a concurrent increase in inflation heightened rate hike fears.Once again, oil prices were the primary factor determining market movement. Prices declined during the first week of the month as prospects of production cuts by major oil producers declined. OPEC's unwillingness to enter into any deal with Russia to control the supply glut reduced the possibility of a production cut. Iran is aiming to boost its output after sanctions were lifted and is not immediately ready to participate in any production cut.Prices continued to fall during the second week due to persistent fears about the global supply glut. Further, Venezuela failed to convince Saudi Arabia to trim oil production levels on Sunday. On Feb 9, members of OPEC failed to come to an agreement regarding production cuts. As sanctions were lifted from Tehran, OPEC's oil output increased.As a result, the International Energy Agency (IEA) issued a warning about a further fall in oil prices. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) also projected that average gasoline prices at pumping stations will decline to $Array.98 per gallon in 20Array6.On Feb ArrayArray, the persistent decline in oil prices fueled investor worries. However, indexes recovered some gains after UAE's oil minister said members of the OPEC are willing to cooperate to cut oil production. The WTI crude slumped below the $27 level - its lowest in Array3 years.Prices recovered during the second half of the month. Prices increased during the third week after Iran's Oil Minister indicated that Iran is ready to support Saudi Arabia's and Russia's move to hold crude production in line. The oil price rise had a positive impact on energy stocks and eventually on the broad-based market.During the fourth week, WTI increased Array0.6%, witnessing its highest gain since August following a positive outlook by the IEA and OPEC secretary general's encouraging comments. Lower-than-expected crude inventories data from the EIA, favorable gasoline data and an encouraging statement from Venezuela's oil minister also boosted the oil price. This had a positive impact on energy stocks and eventually on the broad-based market.As per the \"second\" estimate by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the fourth quarter output of goods and services increased at an annual rate of Array%, higher than the consensus estimate of 0.4% growth. Fourth-quarter GDP data was revised upward from the previously estimated 0.7% rise.The economy expanded in the quarter due to a significant increase in inventories and decrease in imports. Inventories increased $8Array.7 billion, higher than the prior estimate of $68.6 billion. Separately, while imports fell 0.6% instead of the earlier estimate of a Array.Array% increase, exports decreased 2.7% instead of the earlier estimate of a 2.5% fall.A mixed job report hurt investor sentiment and raised concerns about a possible Fed rate hike this year. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the U.S. economy generated a total of Array5Array,000 jobs in January, missing the consensus estimate of Array95,000. The tally was also significantly lower than December's job number of 262,000.However, the unemployment rate declined from 5% in December to 4.9% in January, the lowest level witnessed since 2008. The jobless rate was also lower than the consensus estimate of 5%.Moreover, average hourly earnings gained almost 0.5% in January from the previous month's figure to $25.39 per hour, higher than the consensus estimate of a 0.3% rise. Average hourly earnings witnessed a 2.5% rise from the year-ago figure.Data released through the month was mixed in nature. The ISM manufacturing index remained flat at 48.2% in January, coming in under consensus expectations. The ISM services index declined and factory orders fell more than expected. Construction spending also gained lower than expected. Consumer confidence also declined significantly for the month of February.However, retail sales gained more than expected in January while December numbers were revised significantly upward. Industrial production also came in much higher than expected.But the uptick in personal consumption expenditure price index (PCE) was probably the most significant economic event of the month. PCE showed an increase of Array.3% year over year, the highest gain since Oct 20Array4. The rise in core PCE nearly doubled from December's increase of 0.7%, which is quite close to the Fed's target of 2%. This raised possibilities that the Fed may raise interest rates much sooner than expected.Over the month, the housing recovery seemed to be slowing. Construction spending increased at a slower-than-expected pace in December. Housing starts declined 3.8% in January. The S&P/Case-Shiller Home 20-city index remained flat in December.New home sales fell to their lowest level since October. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) homebuilders' sentiment index fell to its lowest level since May. Pending home sales declined to their lowest level in a year. On the positive side, existing home sales continued to increase in January, touching a six-month high.Lower-than-expected earnings results of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.  , Yahoo! Inc.  and Exxon Mobil Corp.  impacted the market negatively. Additionally, Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s  shares decreased following a discouraging earnings report and poor outlook.However, strong earnings reports from Aetna Inc.  , Alphabet Inc.  and Comcast Corp.  had a positive impact on benchmarks. Moreover, gains from companies like Chesapeake Energy Corp.  and salesforce.com, inc.  following better-than-expected earnings results pushed market upward.The minutes of Federal Reserve's January meeting indicated that Fed officials may wait for an improvement in the U.S. economic outlook and achieve an inflation rate of 2% before deciding on a rate hike.According to the minutes, Fed policymakers \"agreed that uncertainty had increased, and many saw these developments as increasing the downside risks to the outlook.\" Fed officials thought of \"altering their earlier views of the appropriate path for the target range for the federal funds rate.\"In her semiannual testimony before Congress, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen indicated that the Fed may not opt for any rate hike immediately. However, she did mention that she \"does not expect the FOMC is going to be soon in the situation where it is necessary to cut rates.\" She added that the labor market scenario is improving and it won't be fair to jump to any conclusion about the state of the economy.Yellen defended the Fed rate hike in December on the second day of her testimony before the Senate Banking Committee. She did not agree with the view that the Fed had adversely impacted the financial markets with its December rate hike. She however added that the Fed is not actually ruling out possibilities of a negative interest rate.I ran a screen on  for companies with the following parameters:(  ): (See the performance of Zacks' portfolios and strategies here:  ).Here are the top 5 stocks that made it through this screen: together with its subsidiaries is a property and casualty insurance company.Price gain over the last 4 weeks = 22.6%Expected earnings growth for current year = 26.4%United Insurance has a Zacks Rank #Array (Strong Buy).

However, this has been a relatively easier month for the markets with benchmarks ending mixed. Oil prices have once again determined market movement, but a recovery has been witnessed. This is primarily attributable to efforts being made by major oil exporting nations to cut production.Meanwhile, earnings reports have also been disappointing, further dampening investor sentiment. Additionally, uncertainty over the possibility of a Fed rate hike following encouraging data on GDP and inflation also weighed on stocks.Given the central bank has adopted a data dependent approach to decision making, economic reports continue to hold the key to market movements. Of course, positive developments on this front are like a double edged sword. While they will indicate that the economy is in good health, investors may get edgy that such data could trigger a rate hike. Investors will continue to remain apprehensive ahead of the Fed's March meeting.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Coming into its fourth-quarter financial report Monday, Cognizant investors had already seen bad news from the cloud-computing realm crush tech sector stocks in the previous week, and they wanted reassurance that Cognizant would continue to produce healthy growth at a pace that would demonstrate its competitive advantage against  and other rivals in the industry. Despite posting solid results for the quarter, Cognizant's guidance didn't give investors the all-clear signal they'd hoped to see. Let's take a closer look at Cognizant's latest results and what could lie ahead for the IT consultant for 2016. Cognizant's fourth-quarter results continued the company's trend toward reasonable growth. Revenue climbed 18% to $3.23 billion, just barely falling short of the consensus forecast among investors. GAAP net income rose 17% to $423.4 million, and after accounting for extraordinary items, adjusted earnings of $0.80 per share were $0.02 higher than investors had expected.Looking at Cognizant's segment numbers, the company kept seeing the fastest growth in the same areas we've seen in past quarters. Healthcare saw the biggest jump in revenue, climbing 23% from the year-ago quarter and now making up almost 30% of Cognizant's overall sales. The financial services segment kept its leadership role within the company, and revenue there rose 17% to $1.31 billion, making up 40% of total sales. Gains of 14% to 15% in the manufacturing, retail, logistics, and other segments helped push Cognizant's overall performance higher as well.Cognizant got a good mix of business from across the world. As in past quarters, North America led Cognizant higher with sales growth of 19%. But Europe held its own with a nearly 10% rise in revenue, and the \"rest of world\" segment climbed by more than a third to lead the pack in a small but rapidly growing area.CEO Francisco D'Souza put the results in context. \"At a time when major technology shifts are disrupting all industries,\" D'Souza said, \"clients are looking to a partner like Cognizant to work with them to create the winning business models of tomorrow at the intersection of the physical and digital worlds.\" The CEO also pointed to its prowess in coming up with strong solutions for its clients to transform their enterprises from an IT perspective. Cognizant also has high hopes for the future. Claiming an ability to navigate changing industry conditions well, the IT specialist thinks that it can win market share against Accenture and other IT consultants to become the go-to source among companies seeking tech services.Yet for the first time in a while, Cognizant didn't deliver the strong guidance that shareholders wanted. For the first quarter, revenue of $3.18 billion to $3.24 billion and adjusted earnings of $0.78 to $0.80 per share were both below the consensus forecast that investors had made. Full-year 2016 guidance also came in slightly weak. Cognizant expects full-year revenue of $13.65 billion to $14.2 billion, which should produce adjusted earnings of $3.32 to $3.44 per share.Moreover, Cognizant needs to anticipate further competition ahead. In its quarterly report in December, Accenture said that it would focus on rotating toward digital, cloud-computing, and cybersecurity services. The IT consultant believes that those areas have the highest growth potential, and that means that Accenture will increasingly seek to thwart Cognizant's hopes to capitalize on growth in IT-related areas.Cognizant investors were disappointed by the news, and the stock fell 8% in  after the announcement. With so much uncertainty in the global economy right now, it'll be tough for Cognizant to hold Accenture and other rivals at bay and deliver the growth that its shareholders demand.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Also, revenues increased on a year-over-year basis, reflecting increased focus on the Consulting and Outsourcing business, new bookings and continuous return of shareholders' value. Moreover, the upbeat revenue and earnings guidance for fiscal 2016 were encouraging.Notably, the company hit 52-week highs on two consecutive days in response to the second-quarter results and solid fiscal 2016 guidance. Year-to-date, the stock gained approximately 9.3%.Accenture's solid performance across insurance, banking and healthcare segments reflects strong demand for its services, thereby boosting long-term growth prospects. The company has been steadily gaining traction in its Outsourcing business, primarily driven by the increase in demand for technology that can improve operating efficiencies and cut costs.The upward trend continued during fiscal second quarter, with Outsourcing revenues growing 6% in local currency on a year-over-year basis. The improvement mainly resulted from rising demand for Accenture's outsourcing solutions supported by most of its operating industry groups across all geographic regions.Furthermore, considering the growing need for digital marketing, we are encouraged by Accenture's efforts to enhance its digital marketing capabilities through acquisitions. Accenture made several acquisitions last year to expand its product and service offerings as well as client base, including Reactive Media Pty Ltd., Hytracc Consulting, Enkitec, i4C Analystics, CRMWaypoint, PacificLink Group and Tquila UK.However, we remain cautious due to the intensifying competition from the likes of Cognizant Technology Solutions  and International Business Machines Corporation  , and uncertainty in the IT spending environment.Currently, Accenture carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Both camps are fervent advocates of their respective beliefs, and there seems to be no feasible middle ground or compromise. Unfortunately, I believe that the dogmatic positions of both groups create a roadblock to investing enlightenment. In truth, there are valid arguments supporting both sides of these hotly-debated subjects. On the other hand, there are also valid arguments supporting investing for income over total return, and vice versa.But more importantly, with investments there are many other considerations besides returns. The amount of risk a person is willing or capable of taking is a major consideration. There's also the size of an investor's portfolio relative to their future or current needs. In conjunction with portfolio size, there is the issue of how much time an investor has before they will need to begin harvesting money from their portfolio. Speaking of time, there are also the considerations of how much time and effort the investor is willing or capable of putting into managing their portfolios. These represent just a few of the other important considerations.At the end of the day, how a portfolio is managed is ultimately dependent upon the goals, objectives and risk tolerances of each unique individual investor. With investing, there is no one size fits all, and there are numerous options to choose from. The key is to pick the strategies and investment vehicles that are best aligned with your own unique situation and needs. The portfolio that's right for you may not be the portfolio that's right for me. Consequently, we are all free to build, design and manage our own portfolios consistent with our individual circumstances.Therefore, I see no reason for arguing for or against one strategy over another. On the other hand, regardless of whether we are investing for total return or income, I would argue that it's imperative that we understand the ins and outs of each respective strategy. Because in order to make the most appropriate decisions, it is imperative that we are fully cognizant of the advantages, disadvantages, benefits and pitfalls of each strategy. This article is offered to cover a few of the major differences between investing for income versus investing for total return.In part 1 of this 2-part  , I presented the primary sources or drivers of long-term returns.I consider this critical information regarding choosing the strategy or strategies that are most appropriate for your own goals, objectives and needs. When you are aware of where and how returns are generated, as well as the risks associated with generating them, you are on your way to making rational decisions about how your portfolios can or should be run. Therefore, here in part 2, I will elaborate on why earnings growth (and/or cash flow growth) and valuation are the primary sources of total return.In the comment thread on part 1 of this series, my position that earnings growth (and/or cash flow), in conjunction with valuation as the primary sources of total return was challenged. Therefore, I want to take this opportunity to clarify what I was saying and validate the veracity of what I said.The principal reason why earnings and/or cash flow growth is a primary source of return is simply because these metrics are value creators. A business creates value for its shareholders in direct proportion to its operating success in the long run. The faster a business grows the more value it creates as it generates a higher level of earnings and/or cash flow - and does so faster.Consequently, I submit that earnings and/or cash flow growth is a primary source of the returns you can expect to earn through investing in a business over the long run. These long-term returns can manifest as pure capital appreciation that will highly correlate to the company's rate of change of earnings growth. Importantly, this will occur whether a company pays a dividend or not.If a company pays a dividend, those dividends are paid out of earnings or cash flows, and as such, will contribute to total return via the income component. Total return is capital appreciation plus dividend income - if any. However, dividends are not the source simply because they are paid out of the source and therefore only contribute when the total return calculation is made.I contend that you make your money on the buy side. Consequently, when you invest in a company at a fair or sound valuation, your long-term returns will be highly correlated to the company's earnings and/or cash flow growth. To clarify this, I am suggesting that if a company grows earnings at 10% per annum, you can expect to generate capital appreciation of 10% per annum when purchased at sound value. If a company grows earnings at 5% per annum, your capital appreciation will be 5%, and so on.Once again, this capital appreciation component will occur regardless of whether a dividend is paid or not. If the company does pay a dividend, your total return will be higher than the company's earnings and/or cash flow growth in direct proportion to the amount of dividends received over time.On the other hand, if you overpay when you originally invest, overvaluation will reduce your total return to a level less than the company's earnings and/or cash flow growth rate. Of course, if you originally invest in a business at a low valuation, your long-term total return will exceed the company's growth rate. Additionally, it's important to understand that your total return will also be impacted by the valuation of your stock at the time performance is measured.These valuation principles are why I also consider valuation a primary source of total return. In short, valuation will affect both the amount of capital appreciation and the amount of dividend income you will ultimately earn. Importantly, when valuation is in alignment at both the beginning of your investment as well as the ending period, your capital appreciation will be directly proportionate to the earnings growth rate your company achieved.Since a picture is worth a 1000 words, I will more clearly illustrate these principles at work by presenting several divergent examples via  . However, before I do, I want to be crystal clear on a couple of important points.First and foremost, what follows is a historical exercise presented to illustrate the undeniable correlation between earnings and/or cash flow growth and long-term returns. Secondly, I am not recommending any of the following examples as current purchases. However, many of them are attractive at current levels depending on your investment objectives. Nevertheless, these examples are offered to illustrate that earnings and/or cash flow growth in conjunction with valuation are the primary sources of long-term returns.Therefore, my primary focus will be on illustrating the undeniable correlation between a company's business results and the returns that shareholders can expect or receive. In other words, I will be illustrating how a company's earnings growth rate will generate a very similar long-term rate of return when valuation is in alignment.Consequently, I will be presenting each example from a beginning point in time when valuation was sound relative to earnings and/or cash flows. As a result, I will be presenting these examples over various time frames in order to illustrate the functional relationships existing between earnings and/or cash flow growth and valuation.Additionally, in the commentary with each example, I will discuss important considerations regarding investing for income versus total return. As I suggested in the introduction, the proper strategy for each individual investor is the one that best meets their personal needs, goals and objectives. There is no one size fits all with investing.As a result, investing for total return is no better or no worse than investing for income and vice versa. Instead, it's all about what is best for the individual investor relative to their unique circumstances, to include risk tolerances and other important considerations discussed above. Therefore, I will present several different types of individual common stocks and provide commentary on where and for whom I believe they might fit.In order to receive the full benefit of the following presentation, it's imperative that the reader understands how to interpret the accompanying graphs. Therefore, this next series of graphs are presented one component at a time so that the reader understands precisely what they are seeing when viewing a complete graph. Furthermore, I have blocked out the name of the sample company in order to focus solely on the metrics that the graphs are displaying.This initial graph plots earnings only since 2003. There are two aspects to the orange valuation reference line on the graph. First of all, the orange line is generated by multiplying each year's earnings by the P/E ratio found in the orange colored box in the FAST FACTS section to the right of the graph. Therefore, with this sample, the orange line on the graph represents a P/E ratio of 15. The P/E ratio of the orange lines will vary with different companies in the following actual examples.The next aspect of the orange line is the slope of the line, which equals the company's earnings growth rate. The growth rate is found in the green colored box in the FAST FACTS section to the right of the graph. Therefore, the slope or growth rate of the orange line in the sample is 7.1%.The dark green shaded area represents a mountain chart of the company's cumulative earnings over the time frame measured. With this graph, I have added the dividend payout ratio line (Dividends POR). The green shaded area below this white looking line represents the portion of earnings that the company has historically paid out in dividends (the dividend payout ratio).Once dividends are paid out, they are stacked on top of the orange earnings valuation reference line indicating the portion of earnings received by the shareholder as dividends paid. Therefore, dividends are expressed in two ways on each graph. The white line graphically presents the dividend payout ratio and the light green shaded area above the orange line illustrates the dividends after they have been received by the shareholders.The final metric shown on each graph is the monthly closing stock price line (the black line). With each example to follow, the reader should note how the company's stock price follows or hovers around the orange earnings valuation reference line. The complete graph also illustrates how earnings (the orange line) generates capital appreciation, and how the light green shaded area (dividends), represent the additional income component of total return.With this first set of four examples, I will review non-dividend paying companies only. Consequently, the total return generated over the historical time frames measured will be pure capital appreciation exclusively. Most companies that do not pay a dividend fall into the growth category; however, there are exceptions to that statement. Nevertheless, the following four examples are presented in order of the earnings growth rates each achieved starting with lowest to highest.As an aside, companies of this type are generally the kind that can produce the highest long-term total returns. Therefore, if total return is truly your objective, companies like the following might be your best choices. However, it should also be considered that it is difficult to achieve high rates of earnings growth. Therefore, a faster growing non-dividend paying stock like these should also be considered riskier than blue-chip dividend paying stocks.Affiliated Managers Group is a global asset management company that has grown earnings per share at the compound annual rate of 11.4%. As you examine the earnings and price correlated graph below, note how stock price (the black line) has tracked earnings (the orange line) over this time frame. Also note that the company was moderately undervalued at the beginning of this time frame and has ended this period of time in a similar valuation. Consequently, if my thesis is correct, long-term shareholders would have received a total annual rate of return in the 11% range.Additionally, note the effect that disconnects from fair valuation (the orange line) have on shorter-term returns. In other words, note how performance was poor following periods of overvaluation and how it was greater following periods of undervaluation.The associated performance report with this first example supports my thesis that capital appreciation is functionally related to the company's earnings growth rate. Earnings grew at approximately 11%, and long-term shareholders likewise achieved capital appreciation of approximately 11% consistent with that earnings growth.Faster growing Air Methods Corp. operates in healthcare services as an air medical transport company. With this example, we see a company that, again, pays no dividend, but has grown earnings at the annual compound rate of 22.4%. We also see a second example where stock price and earnings growth are highly correlated.Note that Air Methods traded at a P/E ratio of 10.6 on December 31, 2002 or the beginning of the time frame measured, and ended with a P/E ratio of 13.3 on March 9, 2016. Consequently, we should logically expect that due to this modest P/E ratio expansion, that long-term shareholders would have achieved a long-term total rate of return modestly in excess of the company's earnings growth rate of 22.4%.The associated performance report with the above graph validates the notion that capital appreciation is functionally related to its earnings growth rate achievement and valuation. The modest P/E ratio expansion referenced above generated an annualized total return of 25.8%, which is slightly above the company's earnings growth rate, but highly correlated. Earnings growth coupled with valuation was the source of this total return.LKQ Corp. is best known as North America's largest provider of alternative collision auto parts. Since the company went public in October of 2003, it has produced consistent above-average earnings growth of 23.2%. Once again, we see a high and consistent correlation between stock price and earnings over time. We also see various time frames where stock price became temporarily disconnected from earnings. Furthermore, we might expect long-term shareholder returns to be highly correlated with the company's long-term earnings growth rate, and once again, based solely on capital appreciation and no dividends.Long-term shareholders of LKQ earned a long-term total return (capital appreciation only) of 23.8% per annum, which virtually mirrored the company's earnings growth rate achievement. When you compare LKQ's returns with the S&P 500, you see a classic example of significantly above-average total return due to above-average earnings growth.If total return is your objective, growth stocks like LKQ might be your best options. However, if current income is your objective, this kind of company might not suit your needs regardless of its excellent performance. With companies like LKQ, there are no dividends to provide a cushion during troubled markets.Since going public in December 1998, Cognizant has grown earnings at the remarkable rate of 31.9% per annum. Additionally, this IT consulting company's earnings growth has also been smooth and consistent. However, the reader should note that Cognizant looks undervalued relative to its earnings since 2011. Later, I will illustrate why this is so, and also how it supports the relationship between earnings growth, stock price and long-term returns.Notwithstanding the apparent undervaluation referenced above, long-term Cognizant shareholders received a total return that was highly correlated to its long-term earnings growth rate achievement but slightly at a lower rate. This presents me the opportunity to illustrate an important risk associated with investing in high-growth stocks. Therefore, I offer two additional graphs on this growth stock to point out two important risks with investing for growth with no dividend.This next earnings and price correlated graph on Cognizant ends on December 31, 2008 at the throes of the Great Recession. In spite of the fact that earnings growth remained quite strong in 2008, the company's stock price dropped approximately 60% from its previous high by the end of 2008. I have utilized the calculating functionality of F.A.S.T. Graphs\u2122 to illustrate this devastating short-term performance.With no dividends to cushion the blow, this had to be very traumatic for shareholders. Furthermore, for shareholders that were harvesting principle to generate income, this could only be considered catastrophic. Investing for total return can be quite fruitful, but risks can also be quite high - especially over the short run.This final earnings and price correlated graph on Cognizant is offered to provide an additional lesson on the risks of investing in high growth stocks. It is extremely difficult for a company to grow earnings at high rates as Cognizant has achieved since inception. However, there are a couple of things to notice from the first two earnings and price correlated graphs above.From inception to current, Cognizant's average earnings growth rate was 31.9% as shown in the initial graph. However, the second graph ending in 2008 shows that the company's earnings growth rate up to that time was much higher at 43.1% per annum. Clearly, Cognizant's earnings growth rate must have slowed down significantly since 2008. The final earnings and price correlated graph on Cognizant since December 31, 2008 illustrates that earnings growth since then has only averaged 20.4%. This is still a high number, but nowhere near as high as the previous timeframes shown.There are several takeaways I hope the reader receives from this analysis. Price and earnings since 2008 have also been highly correlated. However, valuation has adjusted to the lower earnings growth rate of 20.4%. Therefore, although Cognizant looked undervalued currently over its inception to date time frame, the earnings and price relationship since 2008 shows an entirely different valuation picture. I believe this clearly illustrates that earnings growth rates are a primary source of long-term returns. On the other hand, I believe this also illustrates the reality that significantly high earnings growth rates are unlikely to persist indefinitely.With this next section, I will turn to reviewing dividend paying stocks. I will start out by showing a company with a very low yield, then higher growth and then progressively move up the higher-yielding stocks.Historically, Danaher has been a fast-growing company but with a low dividend yield and low dividend payout ratio. The reader should also note that I am utilizing cash flow growth in this example. Whenever I personally analyze any company, I always look at the relationship of price to earnings and then the relationship of price to cash flow. Danaher has consistently grown cash flow per share at the rate of 13.8% per annum, and price has followed growth long term.Danaher has generated a long-term total return in almost perfect correlation to its cash flow growth. Dividends did contribute modestly to total return; however, capital appreciation was the dominant contributor.I am presenting a different timeframe with high yielding utility Consolidated Edison, in order to clearly illustrate the correlation between capital appreciation and earnings growth when valuation is in alignment. The time frame expressed in this graph is 2006-2015. The earnings growth rate over this time frame was 3.2%.In the performance report below, note that capital appreciation (annualized ROR w/o Div.) of 3.3% is virtually identical to the company's earnings growth rate of 3.2% shown above. However, also note that dividends contributed the majority of the total return achieved.With the healthcare REIT Omega, we find a classic example of an investment that would appeal to both total return and income-oriented investors. In this example, funds from operations growth (FFO) was above average at 10.6% per annum. Moreover, this high-yielding REIT would also be attractive to the income-oriented investor.When we examine Omega's performance since December 31, 2004, we see market beating capital appreciation of 9.8% in close alignment with FFO growth of 10.6%. Only Omega's current low valuation reduced capital appreciation below its FFO growth rate achievement. However, we also see a significant level of market beating total dividends declared. Since REITs are required by law to pay out approximately 90% of their distributable income, we have what might be considered the perfect compromise for both total return and income investors.My final example in the dividends low to high category is AllianceBernstein Holding L.P., a limited partnership that many readers may not be familiar with. I chose this unusual example because it so clearly illustrates how price tracks earnings over time, as well as how earnings growth over time was the source of capital appreciation.Once again, we see capital appreciation almost perfectly mirroring earnings growth over time. However, this limited partnership pays out virtually all of its earnings. Consequently, it has historically produced an astounding amount of total dividends declared but with only modest capital appreciation. On the other hand, very cyclical earnings have also led to numerous dividend cuts over the years. Nevertheless, a close examination of this example illustrates earnings and valuation as the primary sources of total return. However, in this case, dividends have made a major contribution.Deep cyclical stocks like Alcoa Inc. (AA) also validate the thesis that earnings growth is a primary source of long-term total returns. However, in this case, it is the lack of earnings growth that also produced a long-term lack of capital appreciation. But most importantly, the long-term correlation between stock price and earnings results is undeniable.Negative earnings growth of -3% produced negative capital appreciation of -3.4%, and inconsistent dividends helped, but only slightly. Nevertheless, this example illustrates the importance of earnings as the source of long-term total returns.If you fall into the camp of total return advocates, then it only seems logical to me that growth stocks should be your primary investment choice. However, logic would also dictate that you must also be willing to assume the risks that go along with investing in growth stocks. With this article, I believe I have clearly illustrated the long-term relationship between earnings growth and capital appreciation. However, the hat trick when investing in growth stocks is identifying them before the growth occurs. This requires forecasting - and all future estimates contain uncertainty.On the other hand, if you fall into the camp of investing for income, you must be willing to accept the reality that you may not get the highest total returns by doing so. This is not the case with every investment, as I illustrated with the Omega Healthcare example above. However, as a general statement, higher-yielding stocks will not be the ones that grow the fastest. Nevertheless, and again, as a general statement, they may well be the ones that produce the most current spendable income.Therefore, I submit that perhaps the most rational approach is to embrace both strategies at various stages of your investing life. Prior to retirement, a strong commitment towards investing for growth offers the possibility of accumulating more money over time. Of course, there are risks to consider when doing that. Once in retirement, current income, especially if your portfolio is large enough to produce enough, might be the more appropriate choice. On the other hand, a blending of both strategies at appropriate levels might make sense as well. There is no one size fits all with investing.

Yet  and other peers among IT outsourcing companies have suffered difficulty lately, and some industry analysts have reported expected declines in enterprise spending on technology that could bode poorly for companies like EPAM. Coming into Wednesday's fourth-quarter financial report, EPAM investors expected the company to post solid growth, and the company's results were actually stronger than many had expected, defying the industry trend. Let's take a closer look at the latest results from EPAM Systems and what they say about the company's future. EPAM Systems' fourth-quarter results were strong on all fronts. Revenue climbed to a record $260.3 million, a 29% advance from last year's quarter and easily surpassing expectations for 24% growth on the top line. EPAM's adjusted net income climbed 30% to $46.9 million, and that produced adjusted earnings of $0.78 per share, beating the consensus forecast among investors by a nickel per share.A closer look at the numbers revealed some additional details. The strength of the U.S. dollar actually held back EPAM Systems' growth, and sales would have climbed 34% had it not been for foreign currency headwinds. Still, the translation adjustments for foreign currency were only half what they were last year, showing that dollar strength appears to be moderating. On the margin front, overhead expenses climbed at almost exactly the same rate as revenue, but falling expense numbers elsewhere helped boost operating margins by a third of a percentage point to 12.2%. Stock-based compensation also continued to rise, picking up more than 50% from the year-ago quarter and affecting both gross margins and operating margins.Interestingly, cash flows from operations were down significantly both for the quarter and for the full year. In the fourth quarter, EPAM only brought in $11.8 million in cash from operations, down by about three-quarters from a year ago. Yet the company still has almost $200 million in cash on its balance sheet.CEO Arkadiy Dobkin was happy with EPAM's performance. \"Despite market uncertainties and FX challenges,\" Dobkin said, \"our investments in new digital capabilities, along with our ability to successfully integrate them with our traditionally strong software engineering skills, allowed us to reach our 16th consecutive quarter of over 20% year-over-year organic revenue growth.\" The CEO was happy about EPAM's prospects heading into 2016. EPAM's guidance for the near future was strong on the top line, albeit being somewhat conservative on the earnings front. EPAM expects first-quarter revenue of at least $258 million, which would represent 29% growth and exceed expectations for $249 million in sales. However, earnings of $0.70 per share would be $0.02 below the consensus forecast if EPAM can't exceed its reported minimum guidance. Similarly, full-year calls for revenue growth of 26% is higher than the 24% rate that investors expect, but earnings growth of 20% would be a bit shy of the $3.16 per share target that investors have.Yet the big wildcard for EPAM is whether global economic conditions will cooperate. In its report earlier in February, Cognizant Technology pointed to heavy competition in the broader IT market, giving guidance that fell short of what most investors had expected from the consultant. Cognizant still believes that it can navigate changing conditions in IT well, but the potential for a slowdown could hit Cognizant's ability to match past growth rates. EPAM could face the same problems as Cognizant on a smaller scale.EPAM Systems stock has fallen dramatically as peers have given downbeat expectations for 2016, but that leaves the shares with room to rise based on continued growth. If EPAM can do as well this year as it expects, then the stock could rebound from its poor recent performance.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Oil prices continued to dominate proceedings, falling through the first half of the month on discouraging data and the lack of consensus among major oil exporting countries on a production cut.However, prices recovered during the second half as discussions on curbing supply seemed to be progressing in a positive direction. Domestic economic data was mixed in nature, showing signs of improvement toward the second half. However, earnings remained lackluster in nature and weighed on investor sentiment.For the month, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq declined 0.4% and 1.2%, respectively. The indexes posted losses for three straight months for the first time since Sep 2011. Meanwhile, Dow increased by 0.3% last month, its highest pace of increase since Nov 2015. Benchmarks ended the month mostly in the red due to volatile movement of  , discouraging quarterly reports and mixed economic data.Oil prices remained volatile during the month following uncertainty regarding possible production cuts. Moreover, doubt over Fed rate hike prospects and increasing oil loan defaults possibilities weighed on the key U.S. indexes. Lower-than-expected earnings results of major companies impacted the market negatively. However, Dow ended in the green for February due to broad-based reasons. Gains in Apple Inc. (  ) also boosted the blue-chip index.Some earnings results provided a certain amount of impetus to the markets. Better-than-expected GDP rate growth also boosted investor sentiment. However, a concurrent increase in inflation heightened rate hike fears.Once again, oil prices were the primary factor determining market movement. Prices declined during the first week of the month as prospects of production cuts by major oil producers declined. OPEC's unwillingness to enter into any deal with Russia to control the supply glut reduced the possibility of a production cut. Iran is aiming to boost its output after sanctions were lifted and is not immediately ready to participate in any production cut.Prices continued to fall during the second week due to persistent fears about the global supply glut. Further, Venezuela failed to convince Saudi Arabia to trim oil production levels on Sunday. On Feb 9, members of OPEC failed to come to an agreement regarding production cuts. As sanctions were lifted from Tehran, OPEC's oil output increased.As a result, the International Energy Agency (IEA) issued a warning about a further fall in oil prices. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) also projected that average gasoline prices at pumping stations will decline to $1.98 per gallon in 2016.On Feb 11, the persistent decline in oil prices fueled investor worries. However, indexes recovered some gains after UAE's oil minister said members of the OPEC are willing to cooperate to cut oil production. The WTI crude slumped below the $27 level - its lowest in 13 years.Prices recovered during the second half of the month. Prices increased during the third week after Iran's Oil Minister indicated that Iran is ready to support Saudi Arabia's and Russia's move to hold crude production in line. The oil price rise had a positive impact on energy stocks and eventually on the broad-based market.During the fourth week, WTI increased 10.6%, witnessing its highest gain since August following a positive outlook by the IEA and OPEC secretary general's encouraging comments. Lower-than-expected crude inventories data from the EIA, favorable gasoline data and an encouraging statement from Venezuela's oil minister also boosted the oil price. This had a positive impact on energy stocks and eventually on the broad-based market.As per the \"second\" estimate by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the fourth quarter output of goods and services increased at an annual rate of 1%, higher than the consensus estimate of 0.4% growth. Fourth-quarter GDP data was revised upward from the previously estimated 0.7% rise.The economy expanded in the quarter due to a significant increase in inventories and decrease in imports. Inventories increased $81.7 billion, higher than the prior estimate of $68.6 billion. Separately, while imports fell 0.6% instead of the earlier estimate of a 1.1% increase, exports decreased 2.7% instead of the earlier estimate of a 2.5% fall.A mixed job report hurt investor sentiment and raised concerns about a possible Fed rate hike this year. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the U.S. economy generated a total of 151,000 jobs in January, missing the consensus estimate of 195,000. The tally was also significantly lower than December's job number of 262,000.However, the unemployment rate declined from 5% in December to 4.9% in January, the lowest level witnessed since 2008. The jobless rate was also lower than the consensus estimate of 5%.Moreover, average hourly earnings gained almost 0.5% in January from the previous month's figure to $25.39 per hour, higher than the consensus estimate of a 0.3% rise. Average hourly earnings witnessed a 2.5% rise from the year-ago figure.Data released through the month was mixed in nature. The ISM manufacturing index remained flat at 48.2% in January, coming in under consensus expectations. The ISM services index declined and factory orders fell more than expected. Construction spending also gained lower than expected. Consumer confidence also declined significantly for the month of February.However, retail sales gained more than expected in January while December numbers were revised significantly upward. Industrial production also came in much higher than expected.But the uptick in personal consumption expenditure price index (PCE) was probably the most significant economic event of the month. PCE showed an increase of 1.3% year over year, the highest gain since Oct 2014. The rise in core PCE nearly doubled from December's increase of 0.7%, which is quite close to the Fed's target of 2%. This raised possibilities that the Fed may raise interest rates much sooner than expected.Over the month, the housing recovery seemed to be slowing. Construction spending increased at a slower-than-expected pace in December. Housing starts declined 3.8% in January. The S&P/Case-Shiller Home 20-city index remained flat in December.New home sales fell to their lowest level since October. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) homebuilders' sentiment index fell to its lowest level since May. Pending home sales declined to their lowest level in a year. On the positive side, existing home sales continued to increase in January, touching a six-month high.Lower-than-expected earnings results of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (  ), Yahoo! Inc. (  ) and Exxon Mobil Corp. (  ) impacted the market negatively. Additionally, Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s (  ) shares decreased following a discouraging earnings report and poor outlook.However, strong earnings reports from Aetna Inc. (  ), Alphabet Inc. (  ) and Comcast Corp. (  ) had a positive impact on benchmarks. Moreover, gains from companies like Chesapeake Energy Corp. (  ) and  , inc. (  ) following better-than-expected earnings results pushed market upward.The minutes of Federal Reserve's January meeting indicated that Fed officials may wait for an improvement in the U.S. economic outlook and achieve an inflation rate of 2% before deciding on a rate hike.According to the minutes, Fed policymakers \"agreed that uncertainty had increased, and many saw these developments as increasing the downside risks to the outlook.\" Fed officials thought of \"altering their earlier views of the appropriate path for the target range for the federal funds rate.\"In her semiannual testimony before Congress, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen indicated that the Fed may not opt for any rate hike immediately. However, she did mention that she \"does not expect the FOMC is going to be soon in the situation where it is necessary to cut rates.\" She added that the labor market scenario is improving and it won't be fair to jump to any conclusion about the state of the economy.Yellen defended the Fed rate hike in December on the second day of her testimony before the Senate Banking Committee. She did not agree with the view that the Fed had adversely impacted the financial markets with its December rate hike. She however added that the Fed is not actually ruling out possibilities of a negative interest rate.I ran a screen on  for companies with the following parameters:(  ):(See the performance of Zacks' portfolios and strategies here:  ).Here are the top 5 stocks that made it through this screen: (  ) together with its subsidiaries is a property and casualty insurance company.Price gain over the last 4 weeks = 22.6%Expected earnings growth for current year = 26.4%United Insurance has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

However, this has been a relatively easier month for the markets with benchmarks ending mixed. Oil prices have once again determined market movement, but a recovery has been witnessed. This is primarily attributable to efforts being made by major oil exporting nations to cut production.Meanwhile, earnings reports have also been disappointing, further dampening investor sentiment. Additionally, uncertainty over the possibility of a Fed rate hike following encouraging data on GDP and inflation also weighed on stocks.Given the central bank has adopted a data dependent approach to decision making, economic reports continue to hold the key to market movements. Of course, positive developments on this front are like a double edged sword. While they will indicate that the economy is in good health, investors may get edgy that such data could trigger a rate hike. Investors will continue to remain apprehensive ahead of the Fed's March meeting.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But IT consulting has become extremely competitive, and companies like  that used to specialize in hardware have seen the profit opportunities of offering consulting services as well. Coming into Monday's fourth-quarter financial report, Cognizant shareholders expect the IT consultant to keep growing, but some fear potential fallout from a slowing global economy. Let's take an early look at how Cognizant Technology is likely to perform and what's ahead for 2016.\n  \nData source: Yahoo! Finance. In recent months, investors haven't had a big change in their views on Cognizant's earnings. They've kept their near-term estimates stable, and they've only reduced full-year 2016 projections by a couple of pennies. The stock has given up considerable ground, though, falling 12% since late October.Cognizant's third-quarter results in November showed just how much growth the company has been able to generate even in troubled times for the global economy. Sales climbed by more than 23%, and a 12% rise in net income matched up well with what investors had expected to see from the company. Cognizant's healthcare segment had the best performance in posting 43% revenue growth, but the larger financial services sector also did well, pushing sales up 19%. Even though the strong dollar had a substantial impact on the revenue and income from Cognizant's overseas business, the opportunity to help clients worldwide adapt to the digital revolution produced considerable growth even with currency headwinds. That's an edge that has helped to keep Cognizant ahead of IBM, especially since IBM has had to deal with a much broader business weighing down its competitive efforts.However, Cognizant has had to deal with a major natural disaster that had an impact on its operations. In December, the Chennai area in India suffered unprecedented flooding, and that forced Cognizant and industry peers like  to figure out how to maintain continuity of critical operations for clients. Cognizant in particular has 11 delivery and operations centers in the region. But in January, Cognizant said that its business continuity plan had successfully allowed it to avoid any major financial impact from the flooding. The company therefore reaffirmed its revenue and earnings guidance, reassuring investors who had feared that the floods could cause a one-time shortfall.Cognizant has also had the opportunity to pursue some interesting strategic moves. The company was reportedly among several players looking at potentially acquiring Perot Systems, the IT management business of now-private  . Some analysts believe that Cognizant could boost its earnings by bringing Perot into the fold, and an increase in size would make Cognizant even more competitive against IBM and other big-tech rivals. But so far, the company hasn't taken definitive action on what many expect would be a roughly $5 billion deal.In the Cognizant Technology Solutions earnings report, investors should watch to see what Cognizant's longer-term strategy is going forward. Opportunities like the Perot Systems acquisition can only succeed if they fit into the framework of a vision for growth in the long run, and it would be a mistake for the company to act too hastily just to win a bidding war. If Cognizant can keep growing while holding larger competitors like IBM at bay, then its future should look bright in 2016 and beyond.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

In 2014, for example, only 14% of large-cap fund managers beat the S&P 500 index, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The first half of 2015 featured improvement, but the numbers were still quite poor, with only 35% of large-cap managers beating the index. (Data for the second half of last year has yet to be released.)The weak recent performance is no anomaly: Since 2000, there have been only three years in which at least half of large-cap managers have beaten the S&P 500. And the results are not much better for managers of funds that pick smaller stocks.To be sure, it's not easy to beat the market. A number of factors, ranging from our own emotions and cognitive biases to the high fees many funds charge, make beating the market over lengthy periods a very difficult task. Difficult -- but not impossible, I think. And Warren Buffett agrees.In a 1984 speech he gave at Columbia University entitled \"The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville\", Buffett examined the remarkable track records of a small group of investors who studied under Benjamin Graham, the man known as \"The Father of Value Investing\". He explained that from 1954 to 1956, there were four \"peasant level\" employees working under Graham at the Graham-Newman Corporation (David Dodd and Jerome Newman were among the firm's other directors). Three of those \"peasants\" (Walter Schloss, Tom Knapp, and Buffett himself) established easily traceable track records after leaving the firm, Buffett said -- and all of those track records were tremendous:(Data from Buffett's speech, available in the revised version of Graham's The Intelligent Investor)Of course, that doesn't even include the exceptional returns Buffett has generated at Berkshire Hathaway over the past three-plus decades. What's more, he, Schloss, and Knapp weren't the only highly successful Graham/Dodd/Newman disciples. Bill Ruane, Charlie Munger, John Templeton, John Neff -- all of these gurus and others worked under or learned from Graham and company. Buffett's conclusion: \"A concentration of winners that simply cannot be explained by chance can be traced to this particular intellectual village.\"It's hard to argue the point, and my success with Graham's strategy only bolsters the already impressive case. Since mid-2003, I've run a computerized portfolio that picks stocks using the Defensive Investor approach Graham laid out in his 1949 classic The Intelligent Investor. My 10-stock Graham-based portfolio has more than doubled the S&P 500 since inception.The \"superinvestors\" aren't the only evidence that value investing works over the long haul. Other value-focused strategists, like Joel Greenblatt, Donald Yacktman, and David Herro, have also put up very strong long-term track records. While different gurus have used different approaches, I have found that the best value investors generally share two key similarities: They focus on numbers -- a company's financials and fundamentals -- rather than hype, and they stayed disciplined over the long haul.In recent years, however, value strategies have struggled. That happens from time to time, as growth and value alternate leadership of the market. But history has shown that value beats growth over the long run: From 1927-2014, value stocks averaged annualized returns of 12.9%, according to the data of noted financial researcher Kenneth French, while growth stocks averaged 9.4%.It can be hard to focus on that kind of long-term data when your value stocks are getting hit hard in the short term. But these periods of underperformance are where great value investors like Graham and Buffett do the hard work that lays the groundwork for future gains. When others bail on good stocks that are having short-term dips, those focused on the long term can swoop in and pick up the bargains left behind. It's hard to do, because in the short term your portfolio can include some very unloved, declining stocks. But, as Graham, Buffett, and other \"superinvestors\" have shown, over the long haul value and fundamentals win out. Stay disciplined, and you tilt the odds greatly in your favor.With that in mind, here are a few bargains that my Graham-inspired model and another model I base on Buffett's approach are keen on right now: Westlake ($6 billion market cap) makes petrochemicals, plastics and building products used in consumer and industrial markets, including flexible and rigid packaging, automotive products, coatings, residential and commercial construction, as well as other durable and non-durable goods.My Graham-inspired model is high on Westlake. This stringent approach requires that a firm have a current ratio (current assets/current liabilities) of at least 2.0, and more net current assets than long-term debt. Westlake delivers on both fronts, with an impressive 4.2 current ratio, and just $764 million in long-term debt vs. $1.7 billion in net current assets. It's also selling at a good price: Its P/E (using three-year average earnings, which Graham did) is 10.9. Wabtec ($6 billion market cap) provides technology-based products and services to freight rail and passenger transit industries. Its products are used in locomotives, freight cars, subway cars and buses, and other vehicles.Westinghouse's earnings per share have increased in all but one year of the past decade, part of why it gets high marks from my Buffett-based strategy. In addition to persistent earnings growth, the approach also looks for companies that have reasonable debt (debt should be no more than five times annual earnings) and high returns on equity (a sign of the \"durable competitive advantage\" Buffett is known to cherish). With debt of about $450 million and annual earnings of $387 million, and a 10-year average return on equity of 17.2% Westinghouse makes the grade -- and it trades for a very reasonable 16 times earnings. Formerly United Stationers, Essendant ($1.1 billion market cap) is a wholesale distributor of workplace essentials, with more than 160,000 products in categories including technology products, traditional office products, office furniture, janitorial and breakroom supplies, industrial supplies, and automotive aftermarket tools and equipment.Essendant is another favorite of my Graham-based model, thanks to its 2.3 current ratio, $666 million in long-term debt vs. $931 million in net current assets, 14.5 trailing 12-month P/E, and 1.2 price/book ratio. This global manufacturer of precision instruments is actually based in Columbus, Ohio, not Toledo. Its products are used in laboratory, industrial and food retailing applications. Cognizant is a provider of custom information technology, consulting and business process outsourcing services. The firm ($38 billion market cap) has grown sales at a 22% clip and earnings at a 19% pace over the long haul.Cognizant gets high marks from my Buffett-based model. A few reasons: Its EPS have risen in every year of the past decade; it could pay off its $900 million in debt in less than a year, if it wanted to, given its $1.6 billion in annual earnings; and its 10-year average ROE is an impressive 20.8%.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" .  is set to report fourth quarter and full year 2015 results on Feb 8. Last quarter, it posted a negative earnings surprise of 4.29%. However, in the trailing four quarters, the company has recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 3.58%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Cognizant has been benefiting from its healthy exposure to fast-growing verticals like Financial Services and Healthcare. The company has accumulated deep industry expertise and knowledge of these domains through partnerships with top firms. These partnerships have enabled it to deliver more value to clients and capitalize on new opportunities.The company is expected to continue to benefit from strong demand for high quality, lower cost technology services. Based on its global delivery model and expanding capacity in low-cost areas in India, China, Philippines and Latin America, the company remains well-positioned in the outsourcing market. We believe that growing demand for offshore services beyond traditional IT outsourcing namely, BPO (Business Process Outsourcing), KPO (Knowledge Process Outsourcing) and IT infrastructure services, bode well for the company.However, the company can be severely impacted by slowdown in regions like North America or unfavorable changes in industries like financial services. Also, given the breakneck pace of evolution in the technology space, the company has to constantly fend off competition from peers like Accenture  , Infosys  and Wipro Ltd.Last month, Cognizant reaffirmed its revenue and earnings guidance for 2015. Investors were pleased as it was expected that the company's financials would be impacted due to heavy floods in its India-based Chennai center. Chennai is one of the most important Cognizant facilities with as many as 11 delivery and operations centers and over 27% of the company's total workforce.Cognizant declared that it continues to expect revenues in 2015 to be approximately $12.41 billion (representing 21% growth over 2014) and non-GAAP earnings of around $3.03 per share. The company has been increasing its guidance for the trailing three quarters.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cognizant is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. Earnings ESP for Cognizant is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 71 cents. Cognizant has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here is a stock which you may want to consider as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:MaxLinear, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +2.94% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

However, Cognizant has a Business Continuity Plan, designed to enable continuing of operations even in unfavorable circumstances. This helped it to meet the deadlines for critical work.Owing to this, the company not only managed to minimize the financial impact of such a natural calamity on its business but also ensured the safety and well being of its employees.

A  detailing the media giant's plan to replace 250 employees of its IT team with cheaper hires went viral, and  .Well, the story is making the rounds again as a result of two of those that were let go suing Disney. Lawsuits were filed in Tampa federal court on Monday, alleging that Disney colluded with consulting companies HCL and  to abuse the right to use H-1B visas to attract foreigners with advanced tech skills.Cognizant responded that it complies with all U.S. regulations. Disney's statement is that the lawsuits misrepresent the facts.I'm no legal eagle. I have no idea which way the federal court lawsuits will play out. However, it's easy to see how things will play out in the court of public opinion -- and that doesn't end well for Disney.Cyberspace erupted last June after the  article came out, even though the move actually took place in late 2014. Folks argued that they would be boycotting Disney,Now we're just picking at the same scab, and folks will be reminded that Disney  be on the wrong end of a controversial decision. In fact, it could be worse this time. We're in the thick of primary presidential debates. It's no secret that at least one major candidate has been vocal in his disdain for foreigners taking U.S. jobs. It also wouldn't be a surprise if most of the other candidates from both parties take the side of the suing former employees here.It now just became that much more likely that H-1B visas get brought up in the debates, and if so Disney is going to get slammed more than it gets praised -- even if the political back-and-forth is broadcast on ABC. Media will revisit some of the saucier elements of the original story including the nugget that some of those that were displaced were asked to stick around to train their cheaper replacements.It doesn't matter that H-1B visas are perfectly legal. It doesn't matter that Cognizant and HCL are playing by the book. It doesn't matter that we're just talking about 250 employees that were cut loose two years ago for a company that provides roughly 74,000 jobs in central Florida alone. The story just makes Disney look bad, again, at the worst possible time. It places the brand in crosshairs, and that's never a good place to be.Cable is dying.

(Symbol: CTSH) shares, but tentative about paying the going market price of $56.44/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2018 put at the $32.50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.60. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 4.9% return against the $32.50 commitment, or a 2.4% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to CTSH's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $32.50 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. sees its shares fall 42.4% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $30.90 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.60 from $32.50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 2.4% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., and highlighting in green where the $32.50 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2018 put at the $32.50 strike for the 2.4% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $56.44) to be 26%.

Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" is well set on the growth trajectory, gathering momentum from its positive earnings surprise history and strong fundamentals. Also, shares of Accenture have been trending upward, yielding a positive one-year and year-to-date return.An impressive track record of better-than-expected quarterly revenues along with an encouraging fiscal 2016 revenue outlook, solid cash flows and the policy of regularly returning cash to shareholders are driving Accenture's positive share movement.Accenture's first quarter of 2016 net revenue not only increased 1.5% year over year to $8.013 billion but also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.896 billion. In local currency terms, revenues increased 10% year over year. Net revenue also came ahead of management's guided range of $7.70 billion and $7.95 billion, primarily aided by a 6% increase in Consulting revenues ($4.35 billion), which more than offset a 4% decline in Outsourcing revenues ($3.67 billion). It is worth mentioning that Consulting revenues increased 15% in local currency whereas Outsourcing revenues increased 5% in local currency.Accenture has a strong balance sheet. As of Nov 30, 2015, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $3.07 billion and long-term debt of $25.8 million. This enables the company to pursue strategic acquisitions and invest in growth initiatives.Accenture's strong operating cash flow has helped it to return cash through regular quarterly dividend payment and share repurchases. Accenture repurchased 6.5 million shares for $658 million during the first quarter. The company increased its semi-annual cash dividend by 8% to $1.10 per share during the quarter. Share repurchases are a good way of returning cash to investors while boosting the company's earnings.It is worth mentioning that Accenture has made several acquisitions to expand its product and service offerings and expand its client base. These include Reactive Media, Hytracc Consulting, Enkitec and i4C Analystics. Continuing with its strategy of growing through acquisitions, the company took over Hong Kong-based PacificLink Group in Jul 2015, and Brightstep and Javelin Group in June. These acquisitions have enabled Accenture to enter new markets, diversify and broaden its product portfolio and maintain its leading position. We believe the company's continued acquisitions will contribute to its revenue stream.Going forward, Accenture's solid performance across insurance, banking and health care segments reflects strong demand for its services, which will boost its long-term growth prospects.Nonetheless, increasing competition from Cognizant Technology Solutions  and International Business Machines Corporation  , a strained spending environment and Accenture's broad European exposure may temper its growth to some extent.Accenture has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock is VASCO Data Security International Inc.  , which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Despite this poor performance, there were some bright spots in certain sectors, and some stocks still greatly outgained the overall markets. Several of these \"winners\" in 2015 happen to be technology stocks, and with great showing in 2015, it is extremely possible that the following stocks will be able to produce solid gains again in the coming year.Below are 5 stocks that produced substantial positive gains in 2015, and are poised to continue that momentum into the fast approaching New Year.The first of these 2015 winners is Facebook, which saw its stock gain +33.4% year-to-date. FB is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and the company could have another memorable year in 2016.A new partnership with  r, which has the service available through Facebook Messenger, is just another step FB has taken to diversify itself and its abilities. Furthermore, Facebook announced in its  that more than 8 billion video views occur on a daily basis, which is more than the last reported number provided by YouTube.FB user growth also grew 12.6% year-over-year in its most recent quarter, and the company-owned Instagram topped 400 million users this past September, a number continues to grow. Another company acquisition, Oculus Rift, resides in the virtual reality market that was recently projected by recode.net to grow to $70 billion by 2020. Though Oculus Rift is far from scratching the surface of its potential, it could begin to produce FB investor benefits in 2016, especially as FB begins to ramp up its marketing efforts for the VR platform.Technology giant Alphabet, the company formerly known as Google, also had an extremely strong year in 2015, as the company's stock is up around 43% year-to-date. Though a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), the company owns a B for its Growth Style Score from Zacks. In addition to an impressive stock price gain, GOOGL was also able to produce EPS growth of 34.82% in 2015.The future continues to look bright for Alphabet heading into 2016; the company has standout assets like Google Search, Android, Chrome, and YouTube, each of which has over 1 billion users. The company continues to be aggressive with implementing new monetization systems to improve revenue growth. For example, Alphabet recently introduced install ads where the company gets a fee when a user downloads an app as well as the creation of new ad formats. YouTube Red, a $9.99 per month premium service, currently only available in the U.S., is supposed to be rolled out globally over the course of 2016.Adobe Systems is a provider of graphic design, publishing, and imaging software for Web and print production. The company offers top-tier products for major growth areas like its Creative Cloud, which includes apps like Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, and various other apps. It also has a marketing cloud that helps companies improve results on platforms like Alphabet, Facebook, and Twitter  .ADBE has seen its stock rise 25.6% over the course of 2015, and it is extremely possible that that momentum will carry into 2016. The company certainly believes so, as during its latest analyst meeting, ADBE presented a bullish case for long-term growth, forecasting annual earnings growth of 30% on average as well as revenue growth of 20% until fiscal 2018.Over the past few years, Adobe has made bold moves to the cloud that have yielded strong results, and investors could be enjoying more good times ahead as the company continues to improve itself. While currently holding a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a B for its Zacks Growth Style Score from Zacks, investors could see these statistics change for Adobe in the near future.2015 proved to be a good year for another tech giant, Microsoft, as the company's stock has gained nearly 20% year-to-date. Microsoft, like Adobe, has moved a great deal of its focus toward the cloud, and it is paying off. Just in its most recent quarter, Microsoft reported that cloud sales rose 8.8% to $5.9 billion.While 2015 was solid for the Surface Pro-maker, it appears that 2016 could be just as fruitful, if not more so. The company has seen growth that is likely to accelerate in 2016, and the market is quickly catching on. Microsoft is expected to deliver EPS growth of 13.6% in 2016, which will be a 6.6% increase in revenue. Though those numbers may not seem incredibly high, one must keep in mind that growth numbers like that are very solid for an old-line mega cap tech firm that does more than $90 billion in annual sales.As cloud sales continue to accelerate, Microsoft will likely continue to be a solid stock pick. The company is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), though it does also have an A for its Growth Style Score. Another factor that bodes well for the company moving forward is a slower than expected decline in its biggest segment that includes Windows, Xbox, and Surface Tablets. It should also be noted that the results from Windows 10 are expected to make up for those losses felt in Microsoft's other segment, and together with cloud services, the company is capable of producing more growth and earnings beats in the coming year.With a year-to-date return of 25%, 2015 was a very successful year for one of the top providers of IT, consulting, and business process outsourcing services: Cognizant Technology Solutions. The company has been able to outpace several peers in the past couple of years on greater exposure to the fast-growing industries like financial services and healthcare, and investors have felt the positive results.CTSH posted substantial revenue growth of 20.75% in 2015 to go along with EPS growth of 10.91%. In regards to 2016, the company seems poised to continue to deliver solid results, as EPS growth is projected to be around 13.22%; Cognizant Technology is expected to benefit from the strong demand for its high-quality, low-cost technology services. CTSH also is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but it holds a great Growth Style Score of an A.As mentioned earlier, and as all investors know, 2015 will be a forgettable year in the stock market. Even in years of decline, the market will almost always have outperformers, and 2015 was no different. The technology sector produced several companies that were able to outperform the broader market, and the companies listed above were part of that group.What sets these tech stocks apart, though, is that despite solid performances in 2015, each one is capable of producing solid gains in 2016. As the year comes to a close, many investors will reassess their holdings, and with these companies likely enjoying continued success next year, each one should be considered as a potential investment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Kevin Matras shows why stocks with new analyst coverage are stocks you want to have.Given the recent run-up in the market, here's a screen I've been using recently for my own stock picking.First, it focuses on the top Zacks Ranked Sectors and Industries. Then it focuses on the Zacks Rank #1s, #2s and #3s, which are Strong Buys, Buys and Holds, respectively. But then it selects the outperforming stocks with the smallest percentage price change over the last 4 weeks.Why would I do something like that?Here's why.You've probably heard the old adage that roughly half of a stock's price movement can be attributed to the group that it's in. And that's true. In fact, oftentimes, even a mediocre stock in a top group will outperform a top stock in a poor group for this very reason.Now, take a look at any top group. You'll see plenty of fantastic stocks with some impressive price gains in there. But not every stock in every group moves in lockstep at the exact same time. Some will move more than others at any given time.So by focusing on the stocks with the smallest percentage price change with fundamentals that are just as good as those making the biggest price change, you might find yourself getting into the stocks ready to make the biggest potential catch-up move.Here's how to set up that screen:\u2022 We're screening for only those stocks with the best (lowest) average Zacks Rank. With 16 sectors, the best 8 sectors give us the best 50% of sectors.\u2022 Next step is to get only the best Zacks Ranked Industries coming thru. Since there are 264 'X' or expanded industries we look at, the best 132 will give us the best 50% of industries. But note that only the industries that also happen to be in the top sectors will get thru. If an industry is ranked as one of the best but it's outside of the top sector rank, it will not get thru.\u2022 Now the screen gets narrowed down even more by looking at only the Zacks Rank #1s, #2s and #3s. No Sells or Strong Sells (Zacks Rank #4s and #5s) allowed.\u2022 Only stocks over $5 with at least an average of 100,0000 shares traded daily will be considered.\u2022 This means we're screening for only those stocks that have outperformed the market (S&P 500) over the last 4 weeks.\u2022 Then finally we're scanning for the bottom 50 stocks with the lowest percentage price change over the last 4 weeks. So while all of these stocks have outperformed the market, they increased in price less than their peers.So each one of these stocks is in a top Sector and top Industry within that Sector. This alone will tip the odds of success in your favor by a great deal when you consider that the best Zacks Ranked groups outperform the worst ones by a factor of 2 to 1.Then by selecting those stocks with the best Zacks Rank along with the best price performance over the last 4 weeks, you now have only a list of winners from which to choose from.And from that list of winners, we're selecting the ones that have gained less than their peers on that list. Remember, these stocks aren't 'dogs' or unresponsive stocks. Quite the contrary; they have all outperformed the market. It just so happens that they increased less than the others on the list. But because they are a top rated stock in a top rated industry, we've singled these out as the ones that could make the biggest move to 'catch-up' to the others.It's an interesting screen that has generated a lot of great names.Here are 5 from that list:(  ) Amerisafe(  ) Cognizant(  ) Masonite(  ) Korn/Ferry(  ) Eli LillyAll great looking stocks that seem to have lots more upside in store for them.Get the rest of the stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on  and Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: (  ) is a Business Process Services provider-providing business process outsourcing (BPO) and IT services-mainly to financial services and manufacturing industries.Their focus is on analytics, data management, and risk management services. Genpact-which stands for \"generating business impact\"--began as a unit of GE in 1997, was spun-off in 2005 and listed on the NYSE in 2007.Headquartered in New York City, the company now has more than 70, 000 employees worldwide and global operations in 25 countries. With more than 800 clients, including more than 25% of Fortune Global 500, Genpact is one of largest analytics providers in their industry.The company reported its third quarter results on November 4. Total revenue for the quarter came in at $617.8 million, up 5% year over year and up 7% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted income from operations was $97.1 million, up 10% from the same quarter a year ago.Adjusted earnings were $0.33 per share (per Zacks calculations), beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.28 per share. The company has delivered a beat in three out of last four quarters, with an average positive quarterly surprise of 8.4%.During the quarter, they signed three new large deals, including one with Boeing, bringing the total for the year to seven.The management now expects 2015 total revenue to be ~ $2.46 billion and adjusted income from operations margin to be in the range of 15.1% to 15.3%.During the quarter, Genpact repurchased 3.5 million of its common shares for a total of $78 million under its $250 million share repurchase program.According to Genpact  Business Process Services industry is expected to continue to grow in low teens and reach ~$430 billion TAM (total addressable market) by 2019. The market has low penetration currently with no single market leader. They plan to capture high value opportunities through strategic investing in order to grow their market leadership.As a result of continued solid performance, analysts have started raising the estimates for the company after results. Zacks Consensus Estimates for current quarter and year have increased to $0.30 per share and $1.12 per share, up from $0.29 per share and $1.09 per share, before the results. Rising earnings estimates sent the stock back to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).In the current age of increasing regulatory oversight and all-time high shareholder activism, companies need to be nimble to transform and leverage new technology. This has created an excellent opportunity for Genpact to grow their market leadership using their more than 17 years of business domain expertise and experience running complex operations for more than 800 large companies.Further, with a diversified client base of blue chip companies and favorable industry trends, the company seems to be well positioned to reward its investors. The stock was earlier featured as the \"Bull of the day\" on August 20, it is up almost 12% since then and we expect this uptrend to continue in the coming months. :Falling commodity prices and a slowdown in China have created a very challenging environment for mining and energy companies like BHP. However, the latest troubles for the company are emanating from a deadly dam spill in an iron ore mine jointly owned by them with Vale.Headquartered in Melbourne, Australia,  is one of the world's largest producers of major commodities, including iron ore, metallurgical coal, copper and uranium, and has substantial interests in conventional and unconventional oil and gas and energy coal.Iron ore prices recently fell to their lowest level since July on account of fresh worries regarding declining demand from China. The company also expects the pricing picture for  to continue to be weak for some time to come. BHP is one of the world's largest exporters of metallurgical coal.Last week, it was reported that a pair of dams burst in an iron ore mine in Brazil, submerging the surrounding area in water and mineral waste. According to BHP, Samarco, a 50-50 joint venture between BHP Billiton and Vale, was responsible for operations of the mine.Analysts estimated Samarco to account for about  revenue. The mine is expected to remain shut at least until 2019 fiscal year and cost of cleaning is estimated to exceed $1 billion. The spill has already  at least three lives.Due to weak outlook, analysts have revised their estimates for the company sharply downwards. Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current and the next fiscal year $0.89 per share and $1.46 per share, respectively, down from $1.53 per share and $2.10 per share 60 days ago.Mining-Misc industry is currently ranked 222 out of 265 (Bottom 16%) Zacks industries. Further, uncertainty related to financial implications of the Brazil dam spill will continue to weigh on the shares. It is safer to avoid investing in this stock for the time being.I wrote last month the U.S. bull is old, but not dead. Boy was I right! We saw a big +7.5% surge in stocks in October.Maintain a long-term perspective. Fall markets like to rally. 2013 saw +32% returns. Fed QE bond buying was huge. In 2014, U.S. stocks rose +12% on a last pop from U.S. QE. 2015? Low rates via Europe strengthened the USD.Stocks had to see some major profit taking, after 3 years rising on a trend. The Fed? It hikes rates 25 bps in Dec and 25-50 bps in 2016. Remember: In an election year, the Fed likes to stay sidelined.What compels my U.S. optimism? Plentiful U.S. job hiring is first and foremost. The recent rise in indexes sows stock wealth, and it stokes discretionary spending. Structural demand builds in Health Care, Housing and Consumer spaces.How about my pessimism? I see strong dollar issues, and global growth weakness implied by Nov. WTI oil trading around $45 a barrel. Analysts forecast a rise on  to $60 late next year as a base case. Yet overcapacity in Energy, Materials and Industrials means cutbacks now.The net? Flat growth.You missed your broad alpha opportunity last month. This month, be selective. The S&P 500 should be able to finish the year between 2100 and 2200.If you think cyclical sectors are dead fish, think again. They are leading the way.Strength seen in the November Zacks Ranks for Consumer Discretionary hasn't been this clear a signal all year. Not one Discretionary industry is Unattractive. That is saying something about U.S. stocks. Stay bullish on cyclicals! However, November Zacks Ranks also say 'stay away' from Energy and Materials stocks.(1) Consumer Discretionary tops the list. The sector is Very Attractive across the board. Look at the industries of Apparel, Consumer Electronics and Other Consumer Disc. They are very strong. Non-food retail, Publishing, Leisure & Appliances are strong.O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. is a specialty retailer and supplier of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories to both do-it-yourself customers and professional mechanics or service technicians.(2) Health Care falls to Attractive from Very Attractive. The Drugs and Medical Care companies are the big areas to look for stocks.VCA Inc. is a national animal healthcare company operating primarily in the United States and Canada. It owns, operates and manages veterinary hospitals and veterinary-exclusive clinical laboratories in the country, supplies diagnostic imaging equipment and other medical technology products and related services to the veterinary industry, and provides various communication, professional education and marketing solutions to the veterinary community.(3) Info Tech stays Attractive.

Yet the provider of outsourced software engineering and other IT services holds its own -- and often bests the other players -- with a stock price that's up 50% for the year.And the company says that it's not slowing down.\"We are hiring people across all locations,\" Chief Executive Arkadiy Dobkin said Thursday on an  with analysts. \"Over the last 18 months, we have expanded in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as in Latin America. We look at this from a global perspective of how to grow clients.\"Although he has an overweight rating on the stock, JPMorgan analyst Alexei Gogolev is nevertheless bullish on Epam's growth prospects. He cites its \"unique delivery capabilities and rising demand for offshoring as an underpenetrated form of IT delivery.\"But there are roadblocks standing in Epam's way. For one, the company's earnings report this week left a number of questions unanswered as Epam suffered a rare hiccup in an otherwise stellar run of late.Reporting after the close on Wednesday, Epam logged third-quarter adjusted earnings of 70 cents a share. That was up 17% from the prior year and 2 cents above consensus analyst views. However, revenue fell short of estimates, growing 22% to $236 million vs. estimates for $239 million.Part of the problem was currency-exchange headwinds. More than half of Epam's business comes from outside the U.S., which means the strong U.S. dollar can drag on results.The company also does a lot of business in Ukraine, where tensions with Russia have been a challenge. Meanwhile, Epam must deal with rising inflation in the Russia-dominated Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).On the analyst call, Chief Financial Officer Anthony Conte said that currency \"remains a big piece of our story, suppressing our Q3 revenue by about 8%.\" He also said that a \"significant slowdown\" in the Russian banking industry, coupled with the weak ruble, hurt business in Epam's important banking/financial segment.JPMorgan's Gogolev reiterated that point in a Thursday morning note, saying, \"Low-teens growth of the financial services vertical comes on the back of continued weakness of the Russian banking industry.\"Wall Street's reaction was negative. Leading up to the Wednesday report, Epam shares fell 4% for the day. On Thursday, investors initially panicked, sending down shares more than 11% in early trades. But the market thought better of it, and Epam pared its losses to 5% by the close, ending the day at 71.69.Those investors may be noting that even with the revenue miss, Epam's results continued a streak of 12 straight quarters of double-digit per-share earnings and revenue growth. Epam shares touched a record high of 81.95 on Oct. 7.That kind of strong, consistent growth has made Epam one of the top stocks in IBD's Computer-Technology Services group, which ranks No. 3 out of 197 industries tracked. Epam can't match IBM, Accenture, Infosys and Cognizant for billions of dollars in annual revenue. But it's the leader of the pack in the Investor's Business Daily Composite Rating, with a best-possible score of 99.Epam provides outsourced software engineering and other IT services to clients worldwide, though most of its business is in North America and Europe. Its portfolio of services includes product and application development, technology consulting, infrastructure and hosting, application testing, and maintenance and support. End markets include banking and finance -- its biggest -- as well as retail, travel, media and entertainment, software, technology, health care and life sciences.Epam has used a combination of organic growth and acquisitions to more than double its revenue over the past three years and gain more market share.Its latest buyout came in July, when it acquired NavigationArts, a digital consulting and content management firm with clients includingMarriott International (MAR), privately held Ernst & Young andTime Warner Cable (TWC).Epam's biggest client is Swiss financial giantUBS (UBS), which accounts for more than $100 million in annual revenue. That's a pretty big chunk, considering that analysts expect Epam's 2015 revenue to be about $910 million.Its revenue from UBS rose more than 20% during the third quarter, Conte said on the conference call.\"The growth there remains solid and strong. It was pretty much in line with what we expected it to be,\" he said. Conte noted that growth wasn't limited to just UBS, adding, \"We continue to gain traction and grow our business with the top clients.\"The company says that revenue from Epam's top five customers grew about 20% from a year earlier, while revenue from the top 10 grew about 25%.In terms of geographic markets, Conte said, North America \"continues to be our strongest sector,\" helped by the strong U.S. dollar. \"We are seeing growth across all verticals in North America.\"On the downside, Epam has now reported two straight quarters of decelerating revenue growth, which analyst Gogolev said \"may be partially explained by tougher (year-over-year) comps.\"Still, the company continues to expand its operation and payroll. It ended the quarter with around 14,000 information technology professionals.Such expansion should help Epam continue its strong financial gains. It expects year-over-year revenue growth to be \"at least\" 30% this year. The company also said that its full-year EPS should be \"at least\" $2.65. That's below the $2.69 expected from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters but would still represent a 19% gain.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["hink of tech stocks and big names like Facebook (), Alphabet (, ), and Microsoft () immediately come to mind. They're the big movers in the technology space, belonging to the category of fundamentally sound stocks with healthy financials. However, other than these giants, there are many companies that have shown great potential for excellence and have been impressive in terms of growth and performance.As many as 38 companies from the technology world are part of the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector Index, which turns ten in February 2016. The top five performers of Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector Index are companies with market capitalization ranging from $13 billion to a whopping $500 billion! Out of these five stocks, we're taking a look at NVIDIA, Cognizant Technology Solutions, and Citrix Systems, leaving out the well-known Alphabet and Facebook, which rank second and third on the list with 35.40% and 30.70% returns year-to-date.While NVIDIA and Citrix have a market capitalization hovering around $15 billion, Cognizant has a market capitalization of about $41 billion. These stocks have delivered strong returns during 2015 so far. Let\u2019s get to know them better.The shares of NVIDIA Corporation () are up 41.50% year-to-date and by 45.19% over the last one-year period. On year-to-date basis, NVIDIA is the top performing constituent of Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector Index, gaining more than bigger players like Google, Facebook, and Apple. While the stock has rallied spectacularly in the recent past, it\u2019s still below its record high of about $36, hit in the beginning of 2007. NVIDIA has a market capitalization of $15.29 billion.NVIDIA Corporation was founded in 1993 and is headquartered in Santa Clara, California. The company was listed with Nasdaq in 1999, and its product range covers the entire range of visual computing and operates across three major vertical markets: gaming; professional visualization; and high performance computing and data centers. As NVIDIA says, \u201cat the core of our company is the GPU \u2014 the engine of modern visual computing \u2014 which we invented in 1999.\u201d The company has approximately 7,300 patent assets and a workforce of 9,100 employees worldwide.The company has sound financials with its revenue and net income steadily rising over the years. NVIDIA reported $4.68 billion in revenue in FY15, an increase of 13.35% over the previous fiscal. The company\u2019s net income in FY15 was at $630.58 million, an increase of 43.32% over the figure reported in FY14. The earnings during the first and second quarter of FY16 have been mixed with its net income declining by 81% sequentially and 80% year-over-year during the Q2 FY16.This was mainly led by the company\u2019s decision to wind down its Icera modem operations, after NIVIDIA could not find a viable buyer. This increased its non-recurring operating expenses to around $90 million. The company is set to announce its third quarter results soon (it\u2019s expecting revenue of $1.18 billion as per guidance). The results and earnings guidance would be directing the stock\u2019s performance in near-term. Overall, the company has a sound business model which is diversified, innovative and backed by strong sales. Given the soundness of NVIDIA, there is potential for its stock to rise further, although, given its steep climb, it should take a breather sometime soon, which can be a good time for investors to join in.The shares of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation () are up by 29.34% year-to-date in 2015 and by 41.95% over the last one-year. Cognizant is a leading information technology, consulting and business process services provider and is ranked among the top performing and fastest growing companies in the world. The company is headquartered in Teaneck, New Jersey, and has a market capitalization of $41 billion.Cognizant has a sound financial base with its revenue and net income rising steadily over the years. The company\u2019s revenue was up 16.05% to $10.26 billion during fiscal 2014 compared to the previous fiscal while its net income increased by 17.15% to $1.44 billion during fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013. During the current fiscal, FY15, the company has seen sound number being reported during the first and the second quarter.During the second quarter 2015, Cognizant\u2019s revenue was $3.09 billion, up by 6% sequentially and by 22.6% compared to the same period a year ago. The net income was reported at $420.1 million in Q2 FY15 as compared to $382.9 billion during Q1 FY15 and $371.9 million in Q2 FY14. A recent press release quoted Francisco D'Souza, Chief Executive Officer of Cognizant, who said, \"Our second quarter sequential revenue increase in dollar terms was the strongest in our history.\u201dAccording to the guidance provided by Cognizant during the Q2 FY15 earnings release, the Q3 FY15 revenue is expected to be at least $3.14 billion with a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.75 while the full year revenue is expected to be at least $12.33 billion, up at least 20.1% compared to 2014 with a non-GAAP diluted EPS of at least $3.00. The company is set to announce its Q3 FY15 earnings on November 4, 2015.The shares of Citrix Systems, Inc. () have risen 28.68% year-to-date in 2015 and by 27.82% over the last one-year. With a market capitalization of $13.19 billion, Citrix is one of the smaller companies with big returns on the index. Citrix focuses on software solutions, with an emphasis on uniting virtualization, mobility management, networking and software solutions to enable new ways for businesses and people to work better. The solutions by Citrix help business mobility by providing secure, mobile workspaces with instant access to apps, desktops, data and communications on any device, over any network and cloud.Founded in 1989, Citrix reported revenue of $3.14 billion during FY14, an increase of 7.68% over the previous fiscal\u2019s revenue. However, there was a dip of 25% in its net income in FY14 compared to the previous fiscal. During the current year, the numbers reported by Citrix have shown a steady growth.

Like Indian rival  , Cognizant has used a large abroad workforce to reap impressive profits, and coming into its third-quarter financial report Wednesday, Cognizant investors expected to see double-digit percentage growth in revenue and net income. Cognizant delivered on both fronts, and it also believes that the remainder of 2015 will be brighter than it had originally thought. Let's look more closely at what Cognizant said about its most recent quarter and what's next for the IT specialist down the road. Cognizant's third-quarter results represented a nice follow-up to its past performance. Sales rose more than 23% to $3.19 billion, beating the $3.16 billion consensus forecast among those following the stock. Net income rose about 12% to $397.2 million, and after allowing for extraordinary items, adjusted earnings of $0.76 per share exactly matched expectations from investors.Breaking down the numbers by segment, Cognizant continued to get the most growth from healthcare, where sales jumped 43% to $939 million. Financial services remained the big-ticket performer from a revenue standpoint at $1.28 billion, up almost 19% year over year, while the manufacturing, retail, and logistics sector also posted more modest growth of around 14%. Other revenue rose 15% from the third quarter of 2014.Currency impacts once again showed up in Cognizant's geographical figures, with North American sales soaring by 27% to $2.51 billion. Europe's growth was more muted at 7.8%, and another healthy rise of 31% in the Rest of World segment showed how international expansion is becoming more of a priority for Cognizant.Cognizant CEO Francisco D'Souza said he was happy at how well the company did. \"As clients worldwide shift spending toward investments that drive innovation and growth in the digital era,\" D'Souza said, \"our portfolio of services is well-positioned to meet their needs and capture a disproportionate share of the market.\" Executives also see plenty of good things ahead for Cognizant. In the words of company President Gordon Coburn, \"Our third-quarter results and increased guidance for the full year clearly demonstrate that clients are turning to Cognizant to help them transition into digital enterprises while optimizing their traditional investments in technology and business processes.\" He sees Cognizant's investments in innovation as making the company best-suited to meet those needs.As we've seen a couple of times recently, Cognizant followed up with a guidance boost. The company now sees revenue coming in at $12.41 billion, up $80 million from its previous guidance, with a $0.03 per share boost in earnings to $3.03 per share for the full year. Guidance for the fourth quarter included $3.23 billion in revenue and adjusted earnings of $0.77 per share, and both figures were exactly in line with the consensus forecast among those following Cognizant.The big question that Cognizant faces is how it can keep its competition at bay. In its most recent quarterly report, Infosys noted that it sees what CEO Dr. Vishal Sikka called \"a once-in-a-generation opportunity\" for clients to use technology. Infosys enjoyed some large wins in its client base during the quarter, providing technology for the ATP tennis tour, creating a web-based portal for U.S. federal employees, and several major businesses in industries ranging from retail to food service and payment technology. Cognizant has done a good job of winning its fair share of business from Infosys, but both Infosys and Cognizant can expect even fiercer competition in the future.Cognizant investors weren't all that excited about the company merely matching expectations for third-quarter earnings, sending the stock down sharply after the announcement. Cognizant has plenty of potential to rebound, but to do so, it will have to figure out how to find lasting competitive advantages that will hold Infosys and other firms in check well into the future.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Boy was I right! We saw a big +7.5% surge in stocks in October.Maintain a long-term perspective. Fall markets like to rally. 2013 saw +32% returns. Fed QE bond buying was huge. In 2014, U.S. stocks rose +12% on a last pop from U.S. QE. 2015? Low rates via Europe strengthened the USD.Stocks had to see some major profit taking, after 3 years rising on a trend. The Fed? It hikes rates 25 bps in Dec and 25-50 bps in 2016. Remember: In an election year, the Fed likes to stay sidelined.What compels my U.S. optimism? Plentiful U.S. job hiring is first and foremost. The recent rise in indexes sows stock wealth, and it stokes discretionary spending. Structural demand builds in Health Care, Housing and Consumer spaces.How about my pessimism? I see strong dollar issues, and global growth weakness implied by Nov. WTI oil trading around $45 a barrel. Analysts forecast a rise on  to $60 late next year as a base case. Yet overcapacity in Energy, Materials and Industrials means cutbacks now.The net? Flat growth.You missed your broad alpha opportunity last month. This month, be selective. The S&P 500 should be able to finish the year between 2100 and 2200.If you think cyclical sectors are dead fish, think again. They are leading the way.Strength seen in the November Zacks Ranks for Consumer Discretionary hasn't been this clear a signal all year. Not one Discretionary industry is Unattractive. That is saying something about U.S. stocks. Stay bullish on cyclicals! However, November Zacks Ranks also say 'stay away' from Energy and Materials stocks.(1) Consumer Discretionary tops the list. The sector is Very Attractive across the board. Look at the industries of Apparel, Consumer Electronics and Other Consumer Disc. They are very strong. Non-food retail, Publishing, Leisure & Appliances are strong.O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. is a specialty retailer and supplier of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories to both do-it-yourself customers and professional mechanics or service technicians.(2) Health Care falls to Attractive from Very Attractive. The Drugs and Medical Care companies are the big areas to look for stocks.VCA Inc. is a national animal healthcare company operating primarily in the United States and Canada. It owns, operates and manages veterinary hospitals and veterinary-exclusive clinical laboratories in the country, supplies diagnostic imaging equipment and other medical technology products and related services to the veterinary industry, and provides various communication, professional education and marketing solutions to the veterinary community.(3) Info Tech stays Attractive. Look at the Semiconductors first and foremost, followed by Computer-Software Services and Electronics.Cognizant Technology Solutions delivers high-quality, cost-effective, full life cycle solutions to complex software development and maintenance problems that companies face as they transition to e-business. These services are delivered through the use of a seamless on-site and offshore consulting project team.(4) Telco Services gets to Attractive. Cellular use is leading the way.(5) Utilities get to Attractive. The leader among all Zacks Industries is, surprisingly, Utilities-Water Supply. Utilities-Electric Power is also strong.(6) Financials remain a Market Weight. The leader is Real Estate. The Major Banks, Investment Funds, Investment Brokers and Consumer Finance companies hold the sector back.(7) Industrials remain a Market Weight. The leaders are Airlines, Aerospace & Defense and Business Products. Machinery and Electrical Machinery industries lag most.(8) Consumer Staples remain Unattractive. The strong spot, and there is one, is Soaps & Cosmetics. Food/Drug/Retail, Beverages and Agri-business are the big laggards.(9) Materials go to Very Unattractive. The worst areas are Steel, Metals Non-ferrous and Chemicals.(10) Energy looks Very Unattractive. The weakest of all are the Drillers. The integrated Oil & Gas companies look very weak too. The only strength is Energy-Alternatives.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .Selecting stocks is easy when the market is bullish. It is also comparatively easier to find stocks in a bear market (people generally go for defensive plays). However, volatile markets like the one we are currently witnessing are the most difficult to judge and benefit from.The U.S. economy faces several headwinds at the domestic as well as the global level. On the domestic front, real gross domestic product (GDP), adjusted for price changes, slowed to an annual rate of 1.5% in the third quarter of 2015, down from 3.9% growth recorded in the second quarter. The decline reflected a fall in private inventory investment, primarily in wholesale trade and in manufacturing.Also, the Oct 28 release of the U.S. Federal Reserve reaffirmed the interest rate at 0-0.25%, though it acknowledged the increasing economic activity in the U.S. However, uncertainty toward the December rate hike decision continues to weigh on the overall market sentiment.On the global level, slowdown in the Chinese economy remains the focal point. October marked the eighth consecutive month of factory activity contraction for the nation. Moreover, the persistent weakness in crude prices continues to affect companies as well as economies across the globe.Turbulent times like these hold pockets of opportunities for the intelligent investor. One might be tempted by small-cap stocks as they tend to show immense growth even with small market movements.

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he following companies are expected to report earnings prior to market open on 11/04/2015.

' entire business model centers on helping its clients make the most of the technology that's available to them, and over the years, Cognizant's business has grown substantially as the need for up-to-date guidance and support has driven the IT consultant's success.As investors prepare for the company's third-quarter financial report Wednesday, Cognizant is once again hoping it can sustain its healthy pace of expansion well into the future. Let's take an early look at what investors are expecting from Cognizant Technology and whether it is likely to deliver on all of its potential.\n  \nData source: Yahoo! Finance. In recent months, investors have gotten even more excited about Cognizant's earnings growth potential, boosting their third-quarter estimates by a penny per share and sending full-year 2016 projections up by a nickel per share. The stock has continued its upward track, rising more than 10% since late July.Cognizant's second-quarter results in early August demonstrated that the IT specialist still has the ability to give long-term investors some positive surprises. Revenue surged 23%, and although net income grew at a more sedate pace of 13%, Cognizant's earnings per share were more than a nickel better than most investors had expected. Particular strength in the fast-growing healthcare segment as well as the large financial services business helped drive Cognizant forward, and favorable conditions in North America offset somewhat more sluggish performance in Europe. That led to guidance increases from Cognizant, helping to set the stock up for its gains over the quarter.One interesting aspect of the success of the IT services industry is that it has come even at a time when spending on technology has fallen. According to one set of estimates, global IT spending will fall nearly 5% this year before returning to a growth trajectory in 2016 and beyond. Yet neither Cognizant nor rival  has seen headwinds from that anticipated pullback in spending prevent them from sustaining their own growth. Accenture's total sales rose just 1.4% during its most recent quarter, but the strong dollar masked what would have been double-digit percentage growth on a constant currency basis. Cognizant has tended to outperform Accenture with faster growth, and few see that dynamic changing anytime soon.Cognizant has also worked hard to try to develop alliances that can help boost its overall business prospects. For instance, in September, Cognizant announced a partnership with  that will allow joint enterprise clients to receive leading-edge technology solutions more quickly. By using Verizon's innovation centers in San Francisco and just outside Boston, customers will be able to get demonstrations of technology they might be able to use to improve their own productivity. By supporting initiatives like the Internet of Things while helping clients in the widest possible array of different industries, Cognizant hopes to make itself indispensable to a broader range of customers in order to expand its overall business.In the Cognizant Technology Solutions earnings report, investors need to look closely at how well the company has done at integrating its most recent acquisitions into its broader corporate structure. Cognizant has done a good job of growing through acquisitions, and especially in an industry that tends to be fragmented and subject to specialization, a consistent flow of new business purchases can keep Cognizant invigorated and prepared to handle fresh challenges. Even as competition from Accenture and other IT consulting companies becomes fiercer, Cognizant has shown its ability to outdo its rivals in the past and has every chance of doing so again this time around.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Last quarter, it posted a 10.45% positive earnings surprise. The company has beaten estimates in the last four quarters and has an average positive earnings surprise of 5.07%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Cognizant has been benefiting from its healthy exposure to fast-growing verticals like Financial Services and Healthcare. The company has accumulated deep industry expertise and knowledge of these domains through partnerships with top firms. These partnerships have enabled it to deliver more value to clients and capitalize on new opportunities.The company is expected to continue to benefit from strong demand for high quality, lower cost technology services.

Also, given the breakneck pace of evolution in the technology space, the company has to constantly fend off competition from peers like Accenture  , Infosys  and Wipro Ltd.For the third quarter of 2015, the company expects revenues of over $3.14 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be more than 75 cents.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cognizant is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. Earnings ESP for Cognizant is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 69 cents. Cognizant has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here is a stock which you may want to consider as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Facebook, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +5.71% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

However, a mixed bag of events is leaving investors perplexed about the stocks to count on. The markets have been on a roller coaster ride in the recent past - either due to the flagging Chinese economy, the Eurozone debt crisis or the U.S. Federal Reserve's pending decision over the first rate hike that has been put to rest (at least for now). Hence, investors are busy gauging the market mood to pick the right stock for their portfolio.The disappointing jobs report for the month of September has put a big question mark over the health of the U.S. economy that started to look rosy with GDP up 3.9% in the second quarter and consumer confidence improving to 103 in September from the August reading of 101.3. Although the unemployment rate remained constant at 5.1% in September, the economy only added 142,000 jobs compared with analysts' estimates of 205,000. Moreover, the jobs number for August was revised down to 136,000 from 173,000 originally reported.The downbeat picture is enough to unnerve investors as it points toward a slowing economy, which according to industry experts is projected to increase marginally over 1% in the third quarter. The above report shows that the growth questions that prompted the Fed to hold off on raising rates last month aren't restricted to China and the global economy alone - they are equally centered on the domestic economic scenario. Investors also remained worried about persistent weakness in the energy sector and a strengthening dollar.It is quite apparent that the market has witnessed a slew of events and to fetch higher returns in such an investment climate is a difficult task. Well, now there are two choices in front of you; either be a mute spectator and wait for a convincing economic environment, or be a front-runner by identifying stocks that have the potential to outperform even when market conditions are not congenial. So what are the 3 ingredients a stock must have to make an optimum portfolio? Let's find out.The stocks must carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), should have a positive  and possess a Growth Style Score of \"A\" (or \"B\"). A favorable rank indicates positive estimate revisions by analysts who are optimistic on the future performance of companies. Moreover, Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have the best chance of surprising with their next earnings announcement.Zacks has also designed the new  .

Net revenue also came ahead of management's guided range of $7.45 to $7.70 billion, primarily aided by a 4% increase in Consulting revenues ($4.2 billion), which more than offset a 1% decline in Outsourcing revenues ($3.7 billion).Among the operating segments, Communications, Media & Technology revenues were up 4% on a year-over-year basis to $1.64 billion.

This deal reinforces the company's strong business alliance with the federal government.Per the contract, Accenture will help in developing the third and final phase of the Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS). DEAMS facilitates data transfer between the U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS).According to Accenture, \"DEAMS streamlines cost accounting, purchase requests, accounts payable, financial obligations, and collections and customer billing, giving the Air Force more timely, accurate and relevant financial data and helping the service achieve auditability.\" The company will complete the project in the next 30 months.Prior to this, Accenture received two similar contracts from USAF to implement DEAMS at 40 Air Force bases. The system is also being used by many support organizations including Defense Finance and Accounting Service locations at Limestone, ME, and Columbus, OH.Currently, USAF uses the system to manage about $800 million of monthly billings and cash collections as well as processing over 100,000 invoices annually.Once fully implemented, Accenture claims that \"DEAMS will integrate legacy Air Force financial management systems into a single system capable of delivering accurate, reliable, timely and auditable financial management information that complies with directives from the secretary of defense\".Accenture is strengthening its core competencies - technology, consulting and outsourcing - and the string of deal wins, including the recent USAF contract, further attest to the fact.Earlier this month, the company secured a six-year contract from Glencore Queensland Ltd., a subsidiary of Glencore plc.

On culmination of the deal, Centene shareholders will have 71% stake in the combined entity, while Health Net investors will own the remaining 29%. The merger of the two companies should create a diversified multinational healthcare enterprise that will cater to more than ten million members nationwide.Health Net has been witnessing an increase in premiums in its Health Plan Services segment. The improvement has been backed by strong operating performance and participation in both exchanges as well as the California Coordinated Care Initiative and Medicaid expansion from the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Also, the disposal of non-profitable businesses has been helping the company to focus on core operations and improve the bottom line. Moreover, Health Net's strong operational performance is reflected by its robust operating cash flow. The company also scores strongly with credit rating agencies.Additionally, the company's cost-management initiatives have been curbing the rise in expenses to some extent. Although expenses increased in both the first and the second quarters of 2015, it was mainly associated with the transaction with Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation  , which has been suspended post the merger agreement with Centene in July.However, the rate of customer attrition in Health Net's health plans is alarming. Moreover, declining revenues in the government contracts segment might affect overall profitability. Also, change in estimates for the 3Rs related to 2014 led to a reduction in pre-tax income by $9 million in the second quarter of 2015.Also, adverse effects of the ACA are headwinds. Health Net expects uncertainties with the reform. These include the funding of provisions related to health plans and doubts regarding the impact of some federal or state health care and insurance reform measures.Last month, the company reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year on higher memberships and moderate health care costs.Health Net currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ne stock that might be an intriguing choice for investors right now is  (  ).

With more than 1700 ServiceNow projects to its credit, Fruition Partners is a Master tier Solutions Partner of the leading enterprise cloud company, ServiceNow.\"Therefore, the acquisition will help Computer Sciences to fill a key gap in its portfolio. The company can now offer a wider range of cloud-based service management solutions and help clients to improve business results through organizational efficiency and lower operating costs. Additionally, the move has brought in more enterprise customers.Over the past few years, Computer Sciences has been focusing on the cloud computing market and Big Data business to cash in on the growing demand. Companies are increasingly relying on cloud-based services that make IT systems more agile and productive, and save costs considerably.Computer Sciences has also made a few important acquisitions, for instance, the North California-based cloud infrastructure provider, Autonomic Resources, in Feb 2015. The buyout bolstered the company's cloud as well as enterprise digital solution offerings.Furthermore, it is to be noted that the company is in the process of splitting into two separate publicly traded companies. According to the company, one will \"serve commercial and government clients globally\", while the other will \"serve public sector clients in the United States.\" The new businesses will be named CSC Global Commercial and CSC US Public Sector, respectively.Previously, the company had stated that the Fruition Partners acquisition will add value to CSC Global Commercial business. However, we believe that it is too early to determine the actual benefits of the buyout as many other consulting companies are developing ServiceNow practices.Recently, Accenture plc  signed an agreement to take over Cloud Sherpas which launched a ServiceNow practice in 2013.

Over the years, the company has grown into one of the largest independent digital agencies in the country in terms of headcount.Furthermore, it provides digital strategy services that include strategies to improve the brand identity of clients thereby helping them to maximize return on investment (ROI) of their digital programs. The company through its innovative strategies has enabled several multinational and local companies, such as B2W, Electrolux, Accor Hotels, Rossi Telhanorte and Serasa Experian, to boost results.AD.Dialeto will join Accenture Interactive platform, part of the company's digital marketing-services arm, Accenture Digital. Accenture Interactive was formed in 2009 to deliver superior consulting, technology and analytics services to chief marketing officers (CMOs).Competent marketing is the key to success for every organization. Marketing and digital executives of a company are responsible for developing digital marketing campaigns, marketing contents, e-Commerce and marketing operations. Accenture Interactive is a well-integrated platform that enables CMOs to devise marketing strategies and derive higher ROI from it.Since the formation of Accenture Interactive, the company has made significant acquisitions to enhance its digital marketing capabilities. Earlier this year, the management technology outsourcing and consulting service provider completed the acquisition of Reactive Media Pty Ltd., an Australian digital services provider. In June, the company acquired Brightstep, a Swedish digital content and commerce solution provider.Moreover, in July, Accenture strengthened its digital marketing capabilities with the buyout of Chaotic Moon, a creative technology studio in Austin, TX, and Pacific Link, a set of independent digital agencies serving Hong Kong and Greater China.According to the U.S. IT research firm Gartner Inc., companies have spent nearly 10.2% of revenues for marketing in 2014, of which one-fourth was invested in digital marketing. The report also suggests that 51% of these companies are planning to increase their 2015 digital marketing spending by 17% on an average.Considering the growing need for digital marketing, we expect Accenture's investment in digital and marketing capabilities to boost long-term growth. This will also help the company in effectively competing with other digital marketing service providers such as International Business Machines Corp.  , Dell and Deloitte.Although Accenture's strategy of growing through acquisitions is encouraging, we are slightly cautious because of the intensifying competition from the likes of Cognizant Technology Solutions  , and a strained IT spending environment.Currently, Accenture has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Another well-ranked stock in the technology sector is Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

All we had were telephones-and unanswered questions about how some poorly understood computer-trading programs had allowed this to happen.Happily, Cabot readers were prepared! The previous issue of Cabot Market Letter (our only advisory back then) was titled, \"Remain in Your Storm Cellar!\" and advised that readers hold at least 50% of their accounts in cash.Back then, the reasons for that cautious view were threefold. First, our interest rate-sensitive indicator had been telling us since April that rising rates were bad for the market. Second, our new highs-new lows indicator signaled growing selling pressures. And third, the market's advance-decline line looked terrible.So our readers came through the crash in far better shape than many investors. And less than a month later we were issuing a new buy signal, as conditions had improved on many fronts.Since then, I've been through many corrections and crashes, and with every one, I think I've learned a little more. Every one is different, but overall, there are many similarities, and the following are my main thoughts on them.1. Don't get caught up in labels. Correction or crash or bear market, the only thing that matters to you is what happens in your own portfolio.2. Don't worry about what everyone else is worrying about; that's already been discounted by the market. This year, everyone has been aware of the \"fact\" that rising interest rates will be bad for the market, and for many months, pundits have been speculating about when the Fed will raise rates-but all that speculation had no value at all to investors.3. Trouble tends to come from where it's least expected. In 1987, it was the computer programs; this year it was China.4. Just as a bouncing ball experiences progressively smaller fluctuations, so will the market generally experience progressively reduced volatility in the days after a high-volatility crash. Some high-risk investors (particularly hedge funds in the U.S.) and some inexperienced investors (particularly newbies in China) have been crippled-financially and/or psychologically from the recent carnage-and will disappear from the market for a very long time, leaving slightly wiser survivors to carry on.5. You will read a lot about how the government will fix the problem.6. But for quite some time-quite likely through year-end-the actions of people selling losers will depress many stocks.7. At some point, bargain-hunters will take control.8. At that point, anyone still worrying about the conditions that caused the latest troubles will be left behind by a new bull market.9. The key to success, as always, lies not in predicting what will happen but in tuning out the noise, focusing on what matters (the action of key indicators and the action of your own stocks), and using a proven system of investing such as you'll find in all Cabot advisories.---Short-term, the sellers are in control of the market. Whether they're expert value investors like Cabot's own Roy Ward who are selling overvalued stocks, or crippled hedge funds trying to get liquid again or amateur Chinese investors swearing off stocks and going back to real estate, the main pressure on the market remains to the downside, as it has been since May.And that's totally normal, given that it was preceded by a six-year bull market!So my simplest advice is to simply watch the market, and stay defensive until the buyers take control again.And when might that be?Well, predicting is very difficult, but my most valuable rule of thumb is this: the consensus is likely to be wrong.Think back to 2009, when the world was reeling from the economic implosion. Did anyone predict a six-year bull market that would see the S&P 500 double in value and the Nasdaq quadruple? No one-although I did write the following, back at the end of March, 2009:\"Today the market gave us a huge rally, ostensibly because of Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner's plan to remove hundreds of billions of dollars of toxic debt from bank balance sheets. To me, the reason for the market's strength is unimportant. To me, what's important are the charts. With this advance, we now have seven consecutive days in which the number of stocks hitting new lows on the NYSE has been fewer than 40. We also have numerous major indexes whose intermediate-term trends are poised to turn from negative to positive. Coming off a bottom that's brought the lowest consumer confidence numbers in history, this uptrend has the potential to be a big one \u2026 precisely because no one expects it.Let's face it; nobody is greedy today. People are worried about the safety of their banks! And to me that spells opportunity.\"Readers who bought back then, and who've followed our generally bullish advice in the six years since then, have done well.But today fear is nowhere near the level it was back then. Today the U.S. economy is generally fine, and the market's recent troubles-so far-are being blamed on the Chinese market.But I think that attitude is likely to change in the weeks and months ahead, as the economic repercussions from the Chinese meltdown work their way across the Pacific, and Americans gradually learn about all the areas of our economy that aren't as healthy as we believe. I also believe, as I've been saying all along, that the Fed will continue to refrain from raising rates, simply because too many people have been expecting it, and there are too many global forces that are keeping rates low (and even negative in some places).Of course, I could be wrong. Institutions could ramp up buying at these low prices and take old favorites like Netflix (  ) and Google (  ) and Apple (  ) right back to their old highs in a matter of weeks.If they do, we'll jump right back into the market just as we did back in November 1987.But the more likely scenario is that the malaise spreads, expectations are scaled back, and investor bullishness fades. And traditionally, such changes take time.In any case, the key to success is simple. Keep an eye on the market. Stay on the right side of the market. Maintain an ever-changing watch list of stocks that are acting well and that have good growth prospects. And above all, cultivate the stocks in your own portfolio, nurturing those that are behaving well and kicking out those that aren't doing what you hired them to do.==As for new buying, growth investors have a real challenge here. Most charts have been bent, if not broken, and until the market can heal some of those charts and give an indication of who the new leaders will be, it's wise to go slowly.Value investors, on the other hand, suddenly have numerous opportunities to pick up good, high-quality companies cheap!In my mind, there are two ways to do this, and I'm going to present both here.Strategy One is to buy a quality undervalued stock that's just pulled back to a decent support level, like  .Cognizant, in business since 1996, provides technology consulting and outsourcing services to a wide range of companies in financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, retail, and more. With revenues of $11.3 billion in the past year, it grows revenues and earnings every year by double-digit rates. It pays no dividend. And it's now trading at a reasonable PE ratio of 21.Here's the chart, which shows that CTSH has recently pulled back from nearly 70 to the 60 level, where it has support dating all the way back to February. It's now 12% off its high.Strategy Two is to target a stock that's gone of the rails, that's been thrown to the dogs, like  .Schlumberger, in business since 1926, is one of the leading oil service companies in the U.S. With revenues of $44.6 billion in the past year, it's had single-digit revenue growth in recent years, and the past two quarters have actually seen earnings shrink, as the pressure of falling  has worked back to Schlumberger. But the company pays a dividend of 2.8%. And its current PE ratio is a lowly 15.Here's the chart, which reveals that investors in SLB have been abandoning ship in recent days. It's now 42% off its high. No one likes oil stocks. And even the announcement yesterday that Schlumberger would spend $14.8 billion to acquire competitor Cameron (CAM) brought little buying.If you're in a gambling mood, you could jump into SLB here; it's got to bottom somewhere. Or if you're a bit less adventurous, you could buy some CTSH. Odds look good.But what I really recommend is that you become a regular reader of Cabot Benjamin Graham Value Investor, where every month, Roy Ward, Cabot's value expert, provides a complete overview of the market along with assessments of the top 275 value stocks.Both Cognizant and Schlumberger are on this list, and Roy has specific Maximum Buy Prices for each one of them, prices that ensure that you don't overpay for either of these stocks.Roy's system, which he's been refining for 51 years, is rock-solid.Over the 12 years the Roy has been with Cabot, his portfolio is up 250%, compared to increases of 98% for the Dow and 123% for the S&P 500.If your portfolio's performance in recent months has been unsatisfying, Roy's sensible, time-tested system may be exactly what you need.Yours in pursuit of wisdom and wealth,Timothy LuttsChief Analyst, Cabot Stock of the MonthPublisher, Cabot Wealth AdvisoryThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photoC ognizant Technology Solutions (  ) is no stranger to the acquisitions game. The provider of information technology, consulting and business process outsourcing has made 16 buys since 2010. Its acquisition strategy has been to focus on geographic expansion and strengthening its industry knowledge or technological abilities, Cognizant President Gordon Coburn told IBD.Until recently, most buys had been tuck-in acquisitions for $200 million or less. The exception came in November, when Cognizant closed on the $2.7 billion purchase of TriZetto, a privately held provider of health-care IT software that helps payers and providers work more efficiently together.TriZetto could have wound up elsewhere, though few firms could have provided a healthier home. OnlyIBM (  ),Accenture (  ) andInfosys (  ) enjoy larger market caps than Cognizant's $40.9 billion in IBD's Computer-Tech Services industry group, althoughWipro (  ) isn't far behind. But Cognizant is the only member of the industry group to earn the highest possible 99 Composite Rating.At the time of the purchase, TriZetto software managed the health benefits of close to half the insured population of the U.S. and supported about a quarter of all U.S. care providers with more than 350 health plans.TriZetto broadened the offerings of Cognizant's already fast-growing health-care segment, which provides health insurers, drug companies, biotech and other health-related businesses with services that address regulatory requirements, including compliance with the Affordable Care Act. At the time of the buy, Cognizant's health-care segment served more than 200 clients and accounted for about 26% of sales.\"TriZetto further strengthened our position in health care,\" Coburn told IBD. \"TriZetto is the leading platform in health care administration.\"Most important, TriZetto brought us (software) platforms (complementing) technology and business process services\" that Cognizant already offered.Coburn says that with TriZetto in the mix, Cognizant is expanding from being a services provider to a combination of providing both services and platform products.\"That's a key component of our growth for the future in the health-care industry as well as other industries,\" he said, adding that Cognizant's strategy is to \"buy, build and partner,\" using those platforms across various industries.He says there will be \"similar (growth) opportunities\" in financial services and pharmaceuticals due to \"changes in the regulatory environment, cost pressures and changing industry dynamics.\"The financial services segment is Cognizant's biggest business, accounting for 41.8% of revenue in 2014. Its manufacturing, retail and logistics segment accounted for 20.4% of 2014 revenue.An IBD Leaderboard stock, Cognizant has been on a long-running winning streak with 16 straight quarters of double-digit sales and earnings growth.In the second quarter, adjusted earnings rose 20% to 79 cents a share, ahead of views. Revenue climbed 23% to $3.09 billion, also topping forecasts. Cognizant also raised its full-year 2015 earnings and revenue estimates for the second time this year.Cognizant's stock rose 6.4% on Aug. 5, the day it reported second-quarter results. Its stock continues to hover near its all-time closing high of 68.44.\"This is a company where revenue growth is by far the main driver of its valuation,\" said Robert Baird's David Koning. Year-to-year \"revenue growth in Q2 was the strongest in almost two years in both reported and organic and constant currency revenue.\"Koning says the \"backdrop\" to support strong revenue growth is Cognizant's \"good execution and willingness to invest in growth along with an industry backdrop that's still in a secular growth mode.\"The industry's growth mode, he says, is being driven by companies' willingness to spend on offshore IT and certain vertical segments having \"solid underlying growth.\"The health care segment was the quarter's fastest grower, with a 39% rise in revenue.TriZetto contributed about $171.1 million in sales and was one of the \"drivers\" of the big gain, said CEO Francisco D'Souza on the quarter's conference call.Koning calculates that the offshore IT services industry has grown organic revenue on a constant currency basis about 10%-13% annually over the past few years, while Cognizant has grown around the mid-teens to 20%.How has Cognizant kept up such a fast pace?\"When we went public in 1998, we made the decision to keep margins at between 19% and 20%, which was lower than many of our competitors at the time, and use that money to invest for the long term and deliver industry leading revenue growth,\" Coburn said. \"We've continued to successfully execute on this strategy ever since.\"He says Cognizant has invested in having \"strong global delivery capabilities combined with deep industry knowledge and strong client relationships.\"He added: \"Our customers today have a dual mandate. They have to run their businesses better by becoming more efficient and effective. And they have to run their businesses different through digital (transformation) and how they interact with customers, employers and the supply chain. They do this by taking the money they've freed up from running better and investing it in running different.\"\"We're one of only a small number companies that can do both of those things at once,\" he said. \"The core of our strategy is to serve clients on both sides of the dual mandate.\"In the last year or so, he adds, Cognizant has seen \"very strong demand\" from customers in implementing digital transformation within their businesses.\"We've experienced explosive growth in this area,\" he said.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Cognizant's earnings to grow by 17% in 2015 to $3.03 a share. They see a 15% increase in 2016 and a 16% gain in 2017.\"The combination of all the changes related to the Affordable Care Act and the aging of the population creates a nice backdrop for growth in Cognizant's health-care segment, which represents about 30% of the company's revenue,\" said Koning. \"We believe the backdrop is solid, but it's hard to predict when the ebbs and flows come.\"Other highly rated members of IBD's Computer-Tech Services industry group includeEpam Systems (EPAM) andCDW (CDW).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["vertec, Inc.

The company reported non-GAAP earnings of 79 cents a share compared with 66 cents in the year-ago quarter.Revenues of $3.09 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.02 billion and grew 22.6% year over year.The Financial services segment (40.5% of revenues) that includes insurance, banking and transaction processing grew 18.1% year over year to $1,250.1 million. Health care (29.1% of revenues) revenues grew 39% year over year and came in at $897.3 million.

Other revenues, which include sales from service-oriented industries like communications, media and high tech, were $359.4 million, up 20.3% from the year-ago quarter.Region-wise, revenues from North America increased 25.7% year over year and represented 78.6% of revenues. Europe contributed 16.3% to revenues, which increased 7.7% year over year. The remaining 5% came from the Rest of the World as sales jumped 30%.Selling, general & amortization (SG&A) expense, as a percentage of revenues, increased 60 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 19.2%. Depreciation & amortization grew 80 bps to 2.7% of revenues.Non-GAAP operating margin of the company decreased 80 bps year over year to 20.2% due to higher operating expense.Cognizant exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,089.3 million, significantly down from $2,010.1 million as of Dec 31, 2014.For the third quarter of 2015, the company expects revenues of over $3.14 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be more than 75 cents.For 2015, the company expects revenues to be nearly $12.33 billion (up from $12.24 billion provided earlier), representing 20.1% growth over 2014. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be around $3.00 per share (earlier projection was $2.93).Cognizant is expected to benefit from strong demand for high quality, lower cost technology services. Based on its global delivery model and expanding capacity in low-cost areas in India, China, Philippines and Latin America, the company remains well-positioned in the outsourcing market. We believe that growing demand for offshoring services beyond traditional IT outsourcing; namely, BPO (Business Process Outsourcing), KPO (Knowledge Process Outsourcing) and IT infrastructure services bode well for the company over the long term.Furthermore, strength in the company's health care and financial services business in regions like North America is encouraging.In addition, we believe that Cognizant, which competes with the likes of Accenture  , Infosys  and Wipro Ltd.  , remains well diversified in key verticals and emerging markets of social, mobile, analytics and cloud, which will continue to boost its top line.However, the company's financials in the year will be impacted due to the loss of a $2.7 billion services contract owing to the acquisition of Health Net Inc. by Centene Corp.Currently, Cognizant sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

It may sound improbable that the man considered the greatest investor of all time would actively hope that any of his firm's stocks would struggle. But when you consider what Buffett wrote to Berkshire investors in his 2011 year-end letter, and the fact that U.S. Bancorp approved a $3 billion share buyback plan earlier this year, the strange idea starts to make sense: \"The logic is simple,\" Buffett wrote in that letter. \"If you are going to be a net buyer of stocks in the future, either directly with your own money or indirectly (through your ownership of a company that is repurchasing shares), you are hurt when stocks rise. You benefit when stocks swoon.\"As usual, Buffett's logic is sound, and exemplifies the sort of value-minded contrarian thinking that sets him and other highly successful investors apart from the rest. If you hold shares of USB for the long term, you should want the firm to get as good a deal as possible on its shares (so long as its underlying business remains strong). That way, it can buy as many shares as possible for that $3 billion. And the more shares it repurchases, the more valuable the remaining outstanding shares -- your shares -- become.Of course, rooting against a stock that you own is as hard as it for a Red Sox fan to root for the Yankees. Buffett acknowledges that. \"Emotions,\" he says, \"too often complicate the matter: Most people, including those who will be net buyers in the future, take comfort in seeing stock prices advance. These shareholders resemble a commuter who rejoices after the price of gas increases, simply because his tank contains a day's supply.\"For more than a decade, I have been running a computer model that mimics Buffett's approach (as outlined in the book Buffettology, written by Buffett's former daughter-in-law and colleague Mary Buffett). I use the model to choose stocks for the \"Patient Investor\" portfolio I track on my website, and since its late-2003 inception, the 10-stock, monthly rebalanced portfolio has outpaced the broader market, returning 141% (7.8% annualized) vs. the S&P 500's return of 97% (6.0% annualized; all figures through August 14).My Buffett-inspired strategy looks at a number of fundamental and financial criteria, generally seeking solid balance sheets, reasonable valuations, and a long track record of consistent performance. In addition, it offers bonus points for firms that have been buying back their own shares. Given the boom in share buybacks we've seen in recent years, you don't have to look very far for companies that are buying back their own stock, and several stocks that my Buffett-inspired model is high are in the midst of share repurchase plans. Though the very idea probably makes you cringe, these are the types of stocks you might want to buy, and then hope the market sours on them for a while. This Connecticut-based global financial data and analytical applications provider ($7 billion market cap) has increased earnings in every year of the past decade, one reason it gets high marks from my Buffett model. Two more: It has just $35 million in long-term debt vs. $233 million in annual earnings and has averaged a 10-year return on equity of 29.6% -- a sign of the \"durable competitive advantage\" Buffett likes his investments to have. FactSet repurchased $70.2 million worth of its shares during the last quarter, and had $212.7 million still authorized for further repurchases. The Minnesota-based company makes off-road vehicles (including all-terrain and side-by-side vehicles and snowmobiles) and on-road vehicles (including motorcycles and small electric vehicles). The $9-billion-market-cap firm increased its share repurchase program by four million shares earlier this year. Its fundamentals are quite Buffett-like: Polaris has averaged a return on equity of 42.1% over the past decade, part of why it gets strong interest from my Buffett-based model. The approach also likes that it has increased earnings per share in all but two years of the past decade, and has less debt ($399 million) than annual earnings ($464 million). Another Minnesota-based firm, Fastenal ($12 billion market cap) sells an array of industrial products, operating approximately 2,700 stores located primarily in North America with additional locations in Asia, Europe, Central and South America, and Africa. Fastenal has spent approximately $295 million buying back its stock in the last twelve months, saying that the valuation of the shares made it worth using some of its cash that way rather than on paying more dividends.My Buffett-based model sees a lot to like about Fastenal. The firm's EPS have dipped in just one year of the past decade; it has more than twice as much in annual earnings as it does in debt; and it has generated a 22.8% return on equity and a 20.9% return on retained earnings over the past decade. Cognizant is a provider of custom information technology, consulting and business process outsourcing services. The firm ($41 billion market cap) last year increased its stock repurchase program from $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion, and extended the term of the program to December 31, 2015.Cognizant gets high marks from my Buffett-based model. Its EPS have risen in every year of the past decade; it could pay off its $913 million in debt in less than a year, if it wanted to, given its $1.5 billion in annual earnings; and its 10-year average ROE is an impressive 20.8%. This Houston-based firm is a leading manufacturer of highly engineered offshore drilling and production equipment, which is well suited for use in deepwater, harsh environment and severe service applications. Earlier this year, the company announced that it had authorized a $100 million stock repurchase program with no set expiration date.Oil-related stocks have been hit quite hard by the oil price plunge we have seen over the past year, and Dril-Quip is no exception. But the stock has a number of Buffett-type fundamentals, including its lack of any long-term debt, its 15.2% return on retained earnings over the past decade, and its 8.6% earnings yield.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ormula Systems (1985) Ltd.

For years, IT consulting and outsourcing specialist  has made it its mission to help its clients get more out of the technology they use. Coming into its second-quarter financial report Wednesday morning, investors wanted to see signs that Cognizant's impressive past growth would continue, and they were curious as to which parts of the company would produce the best results and contribute the most toward Cognizant's overall success.In the report, Cognizant reported record results, and boosted its future guidance as it sustained an impressive pace of expanding sales. Let's take a closer look at Cognizant, and see whether its latest performance is just the beginning of even better things to come. Cognizant's second-quarter results included some favorable surprises from the IT consulting specialist. Revenue jumped almost 23%, to $3.09 billion, powering ahead at an even faster pace than the 20% rate that most investors had expected to see. Net income of $420 million climbed 13% from the year-ago quarter, and after accounting for stock-based compensation and acquisition-related charges, adjusted earnings of $0.79 per share were $0.06 higher than the consensus forecast among investors.A closer look at Cognizant's business segments reveals that healthcare remained the most powerful force for overall growth. Revenue from healthcare soared 39% from the year-ago period, to $897 million, as it continues to catch-up to the larger financial services area. At $1.25 billion, sales from financial services were up a solid 18% from 2014's second quarter, with the manufacturing, retail, and logistics segment bringing up the rear with 12% year-over-year growth. Other sources of revenue saw a 20% boost.The difference between the performance of Cognizant's North American and European operations once again made itself felt during the quarter. North American sales climbed by more than 25%, to $2.42 billion, but Europe's growth was limited to about 8%. Gains of 30% for Cognizant's rest-of-world segment were impressive, even though the IT consulting specialist gets relatively little revenue outside North America and Europe.Cognizant's executives were impressed by the technology company's performance. CEO Francisco D'Souza said: \"Our second-quarter sequential revenue increase in dollar terms was the strongest in our history. These results validate that our business strategy and our investments position us well to capture the emerging opportunities as clients look to transform into digital businesses.\"President Gordon Coburn noted Cognizant's progress internally toward its overall goals, pointing to efforts \"to optimize our existing services and aggressively invest in new services to enable clients to drive higher levels of operational efficiency.\" As we saw last quarter, Cognizant's strong results were accompanied by an increase in the company's guidance for the full 2015 fiscal year. The tech company boosted its revenue projections by $100 million, to $12.33 billion, and it made a $0.07-per-share increase to its calls for adjusted earnings per share, now expecting an even $3.00 per share for the full year.Moreover, guidance for the third quarter was in line with what most investors expected Cognizant to produce. The company thinks that it will post revenue of at least $3.14 billion, and adjusted earnings should come in around $0.75 per share.Cognizant investors celebrated the company's report, sending the stock up by more than 6% in the first two hours of  after the announcement. Trends in all of its key segments are pushing current and potential clients to look more closely at their technology needs. As long as a favorable economic environment gives those customers the means to make necessary upgrades to their IT systems, Cognizant Technology Solutions should be able to ride their coattails to even better results in future.Bad news for your credit card company.

Last quarter, it posted a 4.76% positive earnings surprise. The company has beaten estimates in the last four quarters and has an average positive earnings surprise of 4.19%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Cognizant reported robust results in the first quarter of 2015 benefiting from increased IT spending in the health care and financial services industry. The company also increased its earnings and revenues guidance for 2015.Cognizant has been benefiting from its healthy exposure to fast-growing verticals like Financial Services and Healthcare. The company has accumulated deep industry expertise and knowledge of these domains through partnerships with top firms. These partnerships have enabled it to deliver more value to clients and capitalize on new opportunities.The company is expected to continue to benefit from strong demand for high quality, lower cost technology services. Based on its global delivery model and expanding capacity in low-cost areas in India, China, Philippines and Latin America, the company remains well-positioned in the outsourcing market. We believe that growing demand for offshore services beyond traditional IT outsourcing; namely, BPO (Business Process Outsourcing), KPO (Knowledge Process Outsourcing) and IT infrastructure services, bode well for the company over the long term.However, the company can be severely impacted by slowdown in regions like North America (78.7% of total revenue last quarter) or unfavorable changes in industries like financial services (40% of total revenue last quarter). Also, given the breakneck pace of evolution in the technology space, the company has to constantly fend off competition from peers like Accenture  , Infosys  and Wipro Ltd.For the second quarter of 2015, the company expects revenues of approximately $3.01 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be more than 72 cents.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cognizant is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. Earnings ESP for Cognizant is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 67 cents. Cognizant has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here is another stock which you may want to consider as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +4.35% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The chart below shows the one year price performance of IYW, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, IYW's low point in its 52 week range is $91.46 per share, with $110.80 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $105.02. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["eidos Holdings, Inc.

In turn,Tyler (  ) saw its growth curbed in 2010 and 2011.As this happened, aging software and management systems -- many of which dated to the late 1990s when governments last made upgrades en masse ahead of Y2K -- grew outdated.Once the economic recovery took hold, analysts say, rejuvenated local governments moved with haste to address pent-up demand for new technology, bolstering Tyler's fortunes.Tyler Chief Financial Officer Brian Miller says the market has settled into a new normal now, one defined by solid demand from a broad customer base. The replacement cycle, coupled with increasing needs for advanced technology and Tyler's ability to sell more of its services to existing customers, creates a long runway for ongoing sales growth, he said in an interview.\"It's a very steady market with strong long-term opportunities,\" Miller said.The company has generated double-digit gains in revenue for 14 straight quarters. Most recently, for the first quarter, it reported revenue of $135 million, up 20% from a year earlier. It posted net income of 59 cents per diluted share, an increase of 38%.For Tyler's second-quarter report on July 22 after the stock market close, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect EPS of 61 cents, up 17%, on revenue of $142 million.For the full year, Tyler has guided for revenue of $568 million to $575 million, with EPS of $2.46 to $2.54.The analyst consensus is for a little under $574 million in revenue and $2.52 EPS.Tyler is a part of IBD's Computer-Tech Services industry group. The biggest names in the group by market cap areIBM (  ),Accenture (  ) andCognizant Technology Solutions (  ), but Tyler is highest-ranked by Composite Rating, with a 98 out of a possible 99 from IBD.Tyler's managerial offerings include enterprise resource planning (ERP) for cities, counties and schools -- everything from electronic records management to payroll processing -- as well as software and systems that automate property assessments.Miller says the company invested in research and development in the aftermath of the recession, pushing for innovation when most competitors pulled back on that front.It has developed faster, more comprehensive and easier-to-integrate systems that are of increasing appeal to local governments that need to replace systems and want to do so with technology that can make them more efficient.Miller says that as Tyler invested in R&D, many of its smaller competitors who \"went the opposite direction\" have since lost relevancy.Miller adds that two-thirds of the local government ERP systems needing to be replaced in the near future were bought from companies that no longer compete with Tyler -- creating fertile ground for new business.Another big advantage for Tyler, analysts say, is that it operates in multiple areas of the local government arena, while smaller players tend to be less diverse.This lets Tyler provide more comprehensive services at competitive rates and sell more of its offerings to each customer.\"They've really become the standout,\" Benchmark Co. analyst Mark Schappel told IBD, adding that smaller competitors are \"less and less meaningful. Tyler is in the driver's seat.\"Miller also credits Tyler's \"evergreen\" program for its software.Under a systems support or subscription agreement with a customer, he says, the client pays small annual maintenance costs, as opposed to dealing with large periodic licensing fees, and in exchange gets regular software updates to stay current.Tyler this year introduced a companion offering, its EverGuide initiative for services and consulting. This should further boost customers' \"upsell likelihood,\" William Blair analyst Jonathan Ho said in a research report.Tyler competes with industry stalwarts such asSAP (  ) andOracle (ORCL). Miller says that Tyler often wins business over its larger rivals because customers appreciate its focus solely on the public sector --local governments in particular.The Tyler staffers responsible for integrating new technology for customers \"know that business backward and forward,\" he said.Miller says that Tyler has been consistently posting overall win rates of 60% or better -- meaning it beats out the competition at least 60% of the time on the business it goes after -- and that is 10% better than prior to the recession. Tyler is generating even higher win rates in certain businesses.The company's courts-and-justice operation is a key example of this, Miller says. Its software helps administrators manage jails, aids police and prosecutors in tracking cases, and connects the three entities to provide efficient case management and records updates.Tyler's Odyssey court-case management system, an electronic filing service, processes fines and generates court documents among other tasks, reducing staffing hours and paper costs for local governments, the company says.Tyler's win rate is \"north of 85%\" in the courts-and-justice business, Miller said. \"We are winning virtually every meaningful deal in that space.\"Business has been particularly robust in California. Miller notes that a drawn-out effort to develop a statewide court system there was ultimately scrapped two years ago.It left counties, which had put their own systems in limbo in anticipation of moving under a state umbrella, to hastily pursue upgrades.\"That created an accelerated demand,\" he said. \"A lot of the counties had very urgent needs to replace systems.\"Of 58 counties in California, 28 have bought new systems, and Tyler has won 25 of those deals, Miller says. \"I think we've won the last 18 in a row. We clearly have been very, very successful in that marketplace,\" he said.Its clients range from the smallest counties all the way up to the largest, Los Angeles County.The L.A. County contract was valued at $32 million, Miller says.\"In our view,\" analyst Ho wrote, \"the courts-and-justice business continues to be a source of significant opportunity for the company.\"Tyler's growth plans could include acquisitions, Miller says, adding that the company is \"very disciplined\" on pricing. With no debt on its balance sheet and strong cash flow, he says, it has its eyes open for attractive opportunities.He points to its acquisition of Brazos Technology in May as a good example. Brazos makes handheld electronic devices for police officers to record traffic tickets and accident information. Brazos had generated annual revenue under $10 million. But by pairing its devices with Tyler's broader offerings and larger client base, Miller says, Tyler can boost those sales.He adds that Tyler in recent years has sought out targets of Brazos' size, largely to fill gaps in its service, and has the wherewithal to do larger deals too. That said, Tyler is so confident in its organic growth prospects that it feels no pressure to move urgently on the deal front.\"We're very patient,\" Miller said.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["CIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION (  ) will begin trading ex-dividend on July 13, 2015.

The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to lower non-operating income and higher operating expenses.Accenture's third-quarter net revenue not only increased 0.4% year over year to $7.77 billion but also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.58 billion. Net revenue also came ahead of management's guided range of $7.35 to $7.60 billion, primarily aided by a 1% increase in Consulting revenues ($4.11 billion). Outsourcing revenues, on the other hand, were flat on a year-over-year basis at $3.66 billion.Among the operating segments, Communications, Media & Technology revenues were up 6% on a year-over-year basis to $1.61 billion.

Consulting bookings and Outsourcing bookings for the quarter amounted to $4.5 billion and $4 billion, respectively.Third-quarter gross margin decreased 30 basis points (bps) year over year to 32.5%, primarily due to higher cost of services.Operating expenses increased 2.5% from the year-ago quarter to $1.39 million, primarily due to pension settlement expenses. As a percentage of net revenue, operating expenses expanded 40 bps to 17.9% from the year-ago quarter. This in turn negatively impacted operating results.Accenture's operating income came in at $1.13 billion or 14.6% of net revenue, which decreased from $1.18 billion or 15.2% of revenues in the year-ago quarter.

Marketing and digital executives of a company are responsible for developing digital marketing campaigns, marketing content, e-commerce and marketing operations. Accenture Interactive is a well-integrated platform enabling CMOs to devise marketing strategies and derive higher ROI (return on investment).Since the formation of Accenture Interactive, the company has made significant acquisitions to enhance its digital marketing capabilities. Earlier this year, the company completed the acquisition of Australian digital services provider, Reactive Media Pty Ltd. In 2013, the company acquired a Hong Kong-based online marketing consultant, Acquity Group Ltd., and U.K.-based design agency, Fjord. In 2012, it acquired digital production services vendor, avVenta Worldwide, to bolster its interactive platform.According to the U.S. IT research firm Gartner Inc., companies have spent nearly 10.2% of revenues for marketing in 2014, of which one-fourth was invested in digital marketing. The report also suggests that 51% of the companies surveyed are planning to increase their 2015 digital marketing spending by 17% on an average.Considering the growing need for digital marketing, we expect Accenture's investment in digital and marketing capabilities to boost its long-term growth.

A strong cash balance ($4.03 billion) and operating cash flow ($1.41 billion in the third quarter of 2015) enable it to pursue frequent acquisitions.Last month, Accenture plc announced the acquisition of Tquila UK - one of the leading independent consulting service providers of salesforce.com Inc.  in Europe. The move was expected to be part of Accenture's strategy of strengthening its position across Europe as a provider of Salesforce services and cloud implementations.We are encouraged by Accenture's strategy of growing through acquisitions.

Investors ignored mixed economic data and rate hike concerns as all benchmarks closed in the green. A spike in bond yields had depressed sentiment for the early half of the month.However, yields declined later, helping to push up gains. GDP numbers underwent a substantial decline while the labor market exhibited strength. At the same time, the FOMC and the Fed Chair remained optimistic about the prospects of a rate hike before the end of the year.For the month, the S&P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq gained 1.1%, 0.9% and 2.6%, respectively. Economic data was mixed, giving no clear indication on the timing of a rate hike. While industrial production, producer price index and consumer sentiment declined, the nonfarm payroll report turned out to be encouraging.Meanwhile, Fed minutes showed officials looked past a June rate hike amid slow economic growth. Additionally, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans recommended that the Fed should hold back from hiking interest rates until 2016. However, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said the central bank may raise interest rates this year as she believes soft economic data will not have a lasting effect on the economy.A drop in global bond yields also helped benchmarks settle in the green. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi's commitment to continue its asset purchasing program to stimulate the Eurozone's economy helped stocks recover while bond yields declined. Separately, the Nasdaq ended in the green helped by gains in biotech stocks.According to the second estimate by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the first quarter output of goods and services decreased at an annual rate of 0.7%. This was less than the consensus estimate of a decrease by 0.8%. The first quarter GDP decline was in contrast to the fourth quarter's growth in real GDP by 2.2%. Growth was hampered by harsh winter weather, cheaper  , a stronger dollar and disruptions in Western Coast ports.Meanwhile, real personal consumption expenditures, which account for almost two-third of the U.S. economy, increased 1.8% in the first quarter. This was significantly less than the 4.4% increase in the fourth quarter. However, federal government spending expanded at 0.1%, which compared favorably to a 7.3% fall in the fourth quarter.The unemployment rate went down to a seven-year low figure of 5.4% in April from 5.5% in March. The unemployment rate came in line with the consensus estimate. The U-6 unemployment rate also slipped to 10.8% in April from 10.9% in March.The U.S. economy created a total of 223,000 jobs in April, short of the consensus estimate of 225,000. However, it was significantly higher than March's revised job number of 85,000. March's figure was revised down from previously reported 126,000.In contrast, private sector job additions were weaker than expected. A total of 169,000 private jobs were added in April, reported Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP). This was less than the 175,000 job additions in March, as well as market expectations. Economists were eyeing an addition of 205,000 jobs.Economic data was mixed in nature. To start with, the ISM Manufacturing Index for April was flat month on month at 51.5%. Construction spending declined while the U.S. trade deficit in March rose to its highest level in nearly six and a half years.Retail sales numbers came in flat. PPI, core PPI and industrial production all experienced declines. Orders for durable goods also decreased. However, core capital-goods orders gained.The housing sector enjoyed significant gains. Housing starts surged while construction on new homes climbed at the fastest pace in April since late 2007. The pace of permits for single-family homes also hit the fastest rate since early 2008. New home sales and pending home sales both increased.Among other positives, US auto sales numbers improved. Factory orders enjoyed their biggest rise in eight months. Data on economic activity in the non-manufacturing sector in April turned out to be better-than-expected. The leading economic index and consumer confidence index both moved upward.An increase in bond yields remained a cause for concern through the month. By the first week of May, the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year note touched its highest level for 2015. An increase in European yields may be one factor responsible for the 10-year Treasury yield touching 2.24%.The situation reversed during the second half of the month. At the end of the second week, U.S. 10-year Treasury note yields declined. This followed a fall in yields of 10-year German government bonds. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi's commitment to continue its asset purchasing program to stimulate the Eurozone's economy helped stocks recover and bond yields decline.At the very beginning of May, the IMF decided to trim its aid to Greece unless the country accepts its debt obligations. At the beginning of the second week, Eurozone finance ministers welcomed Greece's progress in negotiating with its creditors for a cash-for-reform deal. However, they believe more needs to done to bridge the differences in order to make a comprehensive bailout agreement.Ultimately, the euro strengthened after Greece was able to pay its debt of about 750 million euros to the IMF. At the start of the third week, Greece's two-year sovereign bond yields moved north following investor concerns that the country may not be able to repay its debt to the IMF next month. A leaked IMF memo admitted that Greece has less chance of making its debt payment, scheduled on Jun 5.Last week, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde said a lot needs to be done between Greece and its lenders before agreeing on a cash-for-reforms deal. Greece needs to pay 300 million euros to the IMF on Jun 5.Eurogroup members and Greek officials had started preparing a draft to avoid defaulting on the debt payment that Greece is supposed to make within the stipulated time frame. However, a Eurogroup official said that \"We are still working toward an agreement\" and that no consensus was reached.The People's Bank of China trimmed its benchmark lending and deposit rates for the third time in six months. China's central bank stepped up its monetary measures to provide stimulus to China's slow economic growth.The apex bank trimmed both its one-year loan rate and one-year deposit rate by a quarter-percentage point to 5.1% and 2.25%, respectively. It also gave more flexibility to Chinese banks on deciding how much they pay depositors. Banks are allowed to raise one-year deposit rates to a maximum of 3.375%.At the end of the month, Chinese shares dropped sharply. Brokers' moved to tighten margin lending, and this had a negative impact on the broader markets. Brokers took this stance in order to curb risks persisting in the Chinese markets. China's Shanghai Composite index tanked 6.5% last Thursday and also fell on Friday.A handful of upbeat earnings results boosted investor sentiment. Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  , Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation  , Comcast Corporation  , The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Inc.  , The Walt Disney Company  , Tesla Motors, Inc.  and The Priceline Group Inc.  posted better-than-expected first quarter earnings results.Minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) Apr 28-29 meeting stated officials opined that a rate hike in June is \"unlikely\" as they remained concerned about weak economic growth in the first quarter. Federal Reserve officials are unsure about raising short-term interest rates in June. They want to wait to see further improvement in labor market conditions and inflation touching its target rate of 2%.Fed officials believed \"transitory\" factors were affecting the economy. While housing numbers and employment growth picked up in April, industrial production, producer price index, consumer sentiment and retail sales numbers were discouraging.Meanwhile, some long-term factors continue to weigh on Fed officials' decision on the timing of a rate hike. The minutes said: \"A number of participants suggested that the damping effects of the earlier appreciation of the dollar on net exports or of the earlier decline in oil prices on firms' investment spending might be larger and longer-lasting than previously anticipated.\"However, the Fed minutes also stated hiking federal funds rates isn't completely off the table. Some officials believe they had enough confidence to increase interest rates from near zero levels at the June 16-17 meeting.Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen said she expects the Fed to raise short-term interest rates sometime this year. Yellen believes the U.S. economy is well poised to grow despite soft economic data. She said: \"If the economy continues to improve as I expect, I think it will be appropriate at some point this year to take the initial step to raise the federal-funds rate target and begin the process of normalizing monetary policy.\"Yellen added that she needs to see further improvement in labor market conditions and to be \"reasonably confident\" that inflation moves closer to its target rate of 2%, before deciding on when to raise rates.I ran a screen on  for companies with the following parameters:(  ): (See the performance of Zacks' portfolios and strategies here:  ).Here are the top 3 stocks among the 8 that made it through this screen: is engaged in providing commercial real estate financial services in the United States, with a primary focus on multifamily lending.Price gain over the last 4 weeks = 28.6%Expected earnings growth for current year = 35.6%Walker & Dunlop holds a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

However, weaker-than-expected economic data increased expectations that the Federal Reserve won't hike interest rates in the near term, which eventually helped all benchmarks end in the green.This view has been reinforced by a strong contraction in current Q1 GDP estimates. Weakness on the demand side means that the Fed may find it difficult to raise rates in the near future.On the foreign front, Greece has dominated the investor mindscape. This is a trend which is likely to continue until an agreement is reached. A pickup in demand is needed to improve market fundamentals. Until then, investors may have to contend with significant volatility.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, the financial terms of the transaction have not been disclosed. The recent move is expected to be part of Accenture's strategy of strengthening its position across Europe as a provider of Salesforce services and cloud implementations.Founded in 2010 and based in London, Tquila is one of the largest independent partners of Salesforce in Europe which specializes in delivering cloud solutions powered by the Salesforce1 platform. The company currently has over 100 dedicated Salesforce professionals.Post acquisition, Tquila will become part of Accenture's Emerging Platforms business under the Accenture Technology segment. Moreover, by integrating Tquila's dedicated Salesforce professionals, Accenture will become one of the largest Salesforce service providers in the United Kingdom with approximately 185 skilled consultants.With this acquisition, Accenture will be better positioned to leverage the latest technology for its clients, provide enhanced performance and strengthen its position as a global leader in Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) based applications as well as Salesforce services. The acquisition will also help Accenture to improve its customer relationships and expand market share by solving business critical issues.Notably, Accenture is already a global leader in providing Salesforce implementation services and currently has over 5,000 skilled Salesforce consultants of which more than 1,900 are certified consultants. Moreover, as Salesforce is one of the largest providers of cloud-based applications and software, it becomes necessary for Accenture to enhance its capabilities in delivering Salesforce's services.Over the past couple of years, the demand for cloud-based software and applications is on the rise. According to Centaur Partners, the SaaS and cloud-based business applications are likely to grow from $13.5 billion in 2013 to $32.8 billion in 2016, reflecting a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19.5%. Moreover, Computerworld forecasts that 42% of IT decision makers are planning to increase spending on cloud computing in 2015.The exponential growth in the amount of data, complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals compelled several companies to turn to cloud computing vendors. Therefore, considering the growing need for cloud-based applications and software, we expect Accenture's investments in this space to boost long-term growth.Accenture resorts to strategic acquisitions to diversify its offerings and expand operating markets. A strong cash balance ($4.06 billion) and operating cash flow ($301 million in second-quarter fiscal 2015) enable it to pursue frequent acquisitions.Last month, Accenture acquired Axia Limited which provides strategic consulting services and implementation support to help clients manage costs, and gain a competitive advantage. Its consulting services address a number of areas including growth, operational excellence, go-to-market models, performance management and M&A strategies. The Axia buyout will help Accenture expand its presence in the strategy consulting market with the potential to boost its market share.In March this year, Accenture acquired analytics services and solutions provider - Gapso - which focuses on analytical planning systems to solve complex logistics and manufacturing challenges. The buyout is expected to strengthen Accenture's position as a leading analytics solution provider and enable it to deliver products and services quickly and in a cost efficient manner.We are encouraged by Accenture's strategy of growing through acquisitions. However, we remain slightly cautious due to its modest third-quarter fiscal 2015 outlook. Also, increasing competition from Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.  and a sluggish economic recovery may dampen growth.Accenture carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Teradata's international expansion, improved traction from sales force expansion, new products and alliances, market share gains and a growing database analytics market should aid the results in the to-be-reported quarter.We expect growth to come from new strategic partnerships as Teradata has long-standing business relationships with large organizations such as Accenture, Capgemini, Cognizant  , IBM, Wipro Limited, among others in the same niche market.

Meanwhile, investors continued to focus on economic data to gauge the timing of an interest rate hike. An expansion in the Eurozone's manufacturing activity in April also boosted investor sentiment.

However, inventories data decreased 0.2%.Investors are also waiting for the April's jobs report to get further indications about the timing of the rate hike.

Adjusted earnings (excluding stock-based compensation but including other one-time expenses) came in at 64 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents.Revenues of $2.91 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.89 billion and grew 20.2% year over year. The strong year-over-year growth was primarily backed by increased spending in the health care and financial services industry.The Financial services segment (39.9% of revenues) that includes insurance, banking and transaction processing grew 13.4% year over year to $1,161.1 million. Health care (30.2% of revenues) revenues grew 42.7% year over year and came in at $879.1 million. Retail/manufacturing/logistics (18.9% of revenues) continued its growth momentum and jumped 7.2% year over year to $548.9 million. Other revenues, which include sales from service-oriented industries like communications, media and high tech, were $322.3 million, up 19% from the year-ago quarter.Region-wise, revenues from North America increased 24.8% year over year and represented 78.7% of revenues. Europe contributed 16.3% to revenues, which increased 1.2% year over year. The remaining 4.9% came from the Rest of the World as sales jumped 23.7%.Selling, general & amortization (SG&A) expense, as a percentage of revenues, increased 100 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 21%. Depreciation & amortization grew 70 bps to 2.5% of revenues.Non-GAAP operating margin of the company decreased 100 basis points year over year to 19.8% due to higher operating expense.Cognizant exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,271.4 million, significantly down from $2,010.1 million as of Dec 31, 2014.For the second quarter of 2015, the company expects revenues of approximately $3.01 billion.Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be more than 72 cents.For 2015, the company expects revenues to be nearly $12.24 billion (up from $12.21 billion provided earlier), representing 19.3% growth over 2014.Non-GAAP earnings are expected to be around $2.93 per share (earlier projection was $2.91).Cognizant is expected to benefit from strong demand for high quality, lower cost technology services. Based on its global delivery model and expanding capacity in low-cost areas in India, China, Philippines and Latin America, the company remains well-positioned in the outsourcing market. We believe that growing demand for offshoring services beyond the traditional IT outsourcing; namely, BPO (Business Process Outsourcing), KPO (Knowledge Process Outsourcing) and IT infrastructure services bode well for the company over the long term.Furthermore, strength in the company's health care and financial services business in regions like North America is encouraging.In addition, we believe that Cognizant, which competes with the likes of Accenture  , Infosys  and Wipro Ltd.  , remains well diversified in key verticals and emerging markets of social, mobile, analytics and cloud, which will continue to boost its top line.Currently, Cognizant sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The company has beaten estimates in the last four quarters and has an average positive earnings surprise of 4.36%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Cognizant reported robust results in the fourth quarter of 2014 benefiting from increased IT spending across industries. The company had also provided a healthy outlook for 2015.The company is expected to continue to benefit from strong demand for high quality, lower cost technology services.

This will continue to boost its top line going forward.For the first quarter of 2015, the company expects revenues of approximately $2.88 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be approximately 69 centsOur proven model does not conclusively show that Cognizant is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. Earnings ESP for Cognizant is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 63 cents. Cognizant sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Though a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company's ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and #5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are a couple of other companies, which you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Charter Communications, Inc.  with Earnings ESP of +128.57% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Telecom Argentina S.A.  with Earnings ESP of +3.57% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The company, which went public in October 2013, boasts a suite of over 150 products and services.The far-flung offerings available on its platform include domains, website builders, Web hosting, email, security, storage, social media services, mobile device tools and productivity, and e-commerce solutions. Its family of brands include Bluehost, HostGator, iPage, Domain.com, A Small Orange, and ResellerClub, among others.Endurance holds a best-possible IBD Composite Rating of 99.The company has been revving up its business through a number of initiatives, including acquisitions and new product offerings.It made four buys in 2014. The biggest came last January when it paid $109.8 million in a cash and stock deal for the Web presence business of Directi from Directi Web Technologies. Directi provides Web presence solutions to small and medium-size businesses in various countries, including India, the U.S., Turkey, China, Russia and Indonesia.And look for more buys: \"Investing in mergers and acquisitions is a very accretive use of free cash flow and going forward we'll continue to do so,\" Blake Cunneen, Endurance's senior vice president of corporate development, told IBD. \"We don't have any deals we're announcing. But we told the Street to expect M&A growth to continue.\"Endurance capped 2014 with healthy results. Cunneen says \"we saw continued growth and strength in two core metrics: net subscriber growth and growth in average revenue per subscriber.\"Total subscribers increased by 91,000 in the fourth quarter. Average monthly revenue per subscriber rose 12% year over year to $14.78. For all of 2014, the number of subscribers rose 17% to 4.087 million and the average monthly revenue per subscriber increased 11% to $14.48.F ourth quarter adjusted net income, which excludes certain items, soared 88% to 30 cents a share from 16 cents a year earlier.Adjusted revenue rose 28% to $175.2 million.Adjusted EBITDA surged 34% to $62 million. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as adjusted net income plus interest expense, depreciation, and income tax expense (benefit) and certain other exclusions.Including items, the company reported a $2.2 million net loss for the fourth quarter, compared with a net loss of $67.5 million a year earlier.Endurance guided to growth between 14% and 16% in adjusted revenue for 2015 and between 17% and 21% in adjusted EBITDA.\"We like the company and think it is a very well run business without much in the way of direct competition,\" Cowen analyst Gregg Moskowitz told IBD. \"There are a lot of vendors in the space and the barriers to entry are not high. But the ability to run a business of this nature at scale and do it very profitably is another matter entirely, and that's one thing they've excelled at.\"The company has been able to continue to leverage very large data sets of user behavior to improve cross-selling and conversion rates. That's resulted in them amassing a stronger competitive position over the past five to 10 years.\"Among Endurance's competitors is Web-hosting provider and recent hot IPOGoDaddy (  ), which went public on April 1.A key driver of Endurance's growth is the growing demand for its services, says Cunneen.\"When you think about business today, having a strong Web presence is pretty fundamental to having a successful business,\" he said. \"Our core offering is so inherent to small business needs. Where we differentiate ourselves is in providing great customer support. One thing that helps drive word-of-mouth referrals is providing a great user experience to our customers.\"Endurance services its customers with access to 24/7 support. It tries to be \"responsive\" in how it talks to customers, he adds, by trying to understand their businesses and identifying ways to help them grow.Endurance customers sign up for a standard Web-presence package, which includes all the basic tools they need to manage and build a Web presence, such as hosting, site-builder tools, and domain name registration.From there, Endurance is able to boost revenue per subscriber by enhancing that presence with more products, such as site backup, and scanning and marketing tools to help a site get found, Cunneen says.\"Throughout 2014 the amount of subscriber acquisitions was very strong and the company was able in a pretty steady fashion to see (increases in) average monthly revenue per subscriber,\" said Moskowitz, who has an outperform rating on the company.In the fourth quarter, it got \"an additional benefit\" from three recent acquisitions, Moskowitz adds.Last August it acquired Webzai, which provides a simple-to-use website builder and mobile-website-builder product.The next month it closed on the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of NameMedia's BuyDomains business. BuyDomains provides premium domain products.Last October, it closed on the purchase of substantially all of the assets of Arvixe, which is a Web-presence provider.But Directi was very important, says Cunneen.\"It was a great acquisition for us,\" he said. \"It brought a truly international presence for us. And it brought a truly international experience where we have multiple language sites in local currency and providing local language support.\"While we're still very confident in our growth prospects domestically, internationally our prospects are even greater.\"Among recent new products is the Instant AppMachine, unveiled in March. It's the company's first product collaboration with Netherlands-based technology developer AppMachine. Endurance has a 40% ownership stake in AppMachine.AppMachine enables users to create a professional mobile application in minutes from a smartphone, tablet or desktop, with no coding required, according to the company, which notes that AppMachine is available in a beta version and will be widely available to consumers in the summer.\"It's a great opportunity, and we're very excited about it,\" said Cunneen. \"It allows our users to very quickly and efficiently create a mobile application that captures all the elements they need with easy to use functionality.\"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Endurance's 2015 adjusted earnings to rise 27% to $1.37 a share and lift 24% in 2016.\"We feel very good about their competitive positioning,\" said Moskowitz. \"We're not seeing any material change in the competitive landscape that would constrain their ability to grow.\"Endurance is a part of IBD's Computer-Tech Services industry group.

The agreement aims at providing next-generation digital banking products to Moven customers in a smart and innovative way. The alliance will also help banks in improving customer engagement through digital platforms.Under the agreement, Accenture will get the rights to use Moven's mobile-based financial management software. The Moven application helps people in budgeting by providing them instant notifications after every transaction, either made through cards or mobile payment tools. This way users can keep a track of their spending and not stray from their set savings target.With Moven's innovative financial wellness app, strength in offering real-time mobile money management solutions and Accenture's expertise in the banking industry, the alliance will focus on providing end-to-end banking solutions for digital transformation. Besides enhancing operational efficiency, this will help banks to gain customer loyalty and optimize digital sales in a cost-effective manner.The collaboration will assist users in managing their expenditure and staying focused on their personal finance in the most simple and convenient way. Moreover, the bank will get an insight into its customers' spending behavior, which will aid it in offering personalized services.Technology has changed the way people do business and consequently there is scope for increasing efficiencies and lowering costs by automating and streamlining these routine functions. The alliance seeks to do just that by combining Accenture's operations expertise with Moven's leading mobile-centric banking app.This affiliation between Accenture and Moven highlights the fact that banks these days are open to integrating the latest innovative technology in their operations to keep their existing client base satisfied and attract new customers.Accenture's latest step into the digital banking space will prove to be beneficial, given the increasing demand for digital solutions. Moreover, the feature provided by the Moven app will be the first of its kind worldwide. This will give Accenture a competitive edge over its local peers.Though the financial benefits of the partnership are hard to gauge as of now, it no doubt strengthens Accenture's capabilities in the banking vertical.However, we remain slightly cautious due to its modest third-quarter fiscal 2015 outlook.

The financial terms of the buyout, which was announced on Apr 3, remain under wraps.Founded in 1999 and based in Boston, MA, Axia provides strategic consulting services and implementation support to help clients manage costs, and thereby gain a competitive advantage. Its consulting services address a number of areas including growth, operational excellence, go-to-market models, performance management and M&A strategies. The company caters to a diverse client base ranging from life sciences and healthcare to consumer goods sectors.Therefore, Accenture intends to integrate the operations of Axia under its Accenture Strategy business. The acquisition of Axia will help Accenture to expand its presence in the strategy consulting market with the potential to boost its market share.Considering the growing need for strategy consulting, we expect that Accenture's investments in consulting capabilities will boost long-term growth. This will also enable the company to effectively compete with other consulting service providers, such as International Business Machines Corp.  , Dell and Deloitte.Accenture resorts to strategic acquisitions to diversify its offerings and expand its operating markets. A strong cash balance ($4.06 billion) and operating cash flow ($301 million in the second quarter of 2015) enable it to pursue frequent acquisitions.Last month, Accenture acquired analytics services and solutions provider, Gapso. Gapso focuses on analytical planning systems to solve complex logistics and manufacturing challenges. The buyout is expected to strengthen Accenture's position as a leading analytics solution provider and enable it to deliver products and services quickly and in a cost efficient manner.We are encouraged by Accenture's strategy of growing through acquisitions.

The closing price represents a robust one-year return of 19.5% and a year-to-date return of 5.4%.Average volume of shares traded over the last three months is roughly 2,620K. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock looks set to perform well in the future with expected long-term earnings per share (EPS) growth rate of 9.6%.Accenture's stock price has moved up 6.8% since the company announced better-than-expected second-quarter fiscal 2015 results on Mar 26. As the company reported strong year-over-year increase in both earnings and revenues, it managed to surpass expectations. The earnings release helped drive the company's shares to a new 52-week high during the trading session yesterday.The company posted earnings of $1.08 per share for the second quarter, which increased 4.8% from the year-ago quarter figure of $1.03 and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07. The year-over-year increase was attributed to higher revenues, higher non-operating income and lower share count.Accenture's second-quarter net revenue increased 5.1% year over year to $7.49 billion and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.35 billion. Net revenue also came in line with the higher end of management's guided range of $7.25 to $7.50 billion, primarily aided by a 6% increase in Outsourcing revenues ($3.65 billion) and a 4% increase in Consulting revenues ($3.84 billion).Buoyed by better-than-expected second-quarter results, Accenture raised its revenue guidance for fiscal 2015. The company now expects net revenue to grow in the range of 8% to 10% in local currency compared with the previously guided range of 5% to 8%. Furthermore, for the third quarter of fiscal 2015, Accenture expects net revenue between $7.35 billion and $7.60 billion.Accenture continues to reward shareholders with consistent dividends and share repurchases. The company repurchased 6.8 million shares for $601 million during the second quarter. The company declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.02 per share during the quarter.Some of the optimism related to Accenture shares may be attributed to the recently completed acquisition of Agilex Technologies, Inc., a provider of digital solutions. The acquisition aims at enhancing Accenture's digital capabilities in analytics, cloud and mobility for federal government.Nevertheless, we remain slightly cautious about the stock due to increasing competition from Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.  and International Business Machines, and Accenture's broad European exposure, which may impact growth.Other technology companies that surged to their 52-week highs yesterday include Red Hat, Inc.  and HC2 Holdings, Inc.  , reaching $76.70 and $13.28, respectively.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The financial terms of the buyout, which was announced on Feb 25, 2015, remained undisclosed.Located in Brazil, Gapso focuses on analytical planning systems to solve complex logistics and manufacturing challenges. Gapso will now be incorporated under Accenture Analytics, a part of Accenture Digital. Following the acquisition, Accenture will now be able to strengthen its position as a leading provider of analytics solutions. Moreover, the combined strength of the companies will facilitate faster and more efficient delivery of products and services to their customers in a cost effective manner.Accenture already has a broad-based analytics portfolio, which we think will be augmented with Gapso analytics services and solutions. Accenture's analytics-based offerings for fraud management, quality management, pricing optimization and demand forecasting are expected to benefit the most. The improved analytical services will facilitate rapid analysis and customer behavior prediction, driving the decision making capability and profitability of firms.Accenture's Gapso acquisition underscores its expansion efforts in Brazil. Gapso's capabilities will complement Accenture Analytics end-to-end services in this region and will help it to penetrate the market.Going further, a more comprehensive solution could help Accenture to provide Brazilian companies (mostly for companies in the natural resources and agribusiness sectors) with better digital insight-driven decisions, which in turn can develop logistics, reduce risks, and generate a wide array of analytics deals in Brazil.Considering the growing need for digital marketing, we expect Accenture's investments in digital and marketing capabilities to boost its long-term growth. This will also enable the company in effectively competing with other digital marketing service providers such as IBM Corp.  , Dell and Deloitte.We are encouraged by Accenture's strategy of growing through acquisitions. However, we remain slightly cautious about the stock due to its tepid first-quarter fiscal 2015 outlook. Increasing competition from Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.  and a sluggish economic recovery may also have an impact on its growth.Accenture carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Because I believe in adhering to a business perspective on investing in common stocks, I am not one of those people. To investors like me, the stock market is simply the store that we shop at in order to buy (invest in) great businesses. Consequently, I have trained myself to be stock market-agnostic. Since I do not like to gamble with my money, the big casino, short-term oriented, active-trading mentality does not appeal to me.Although I cannot say with absolute certainty, anecdotal evidence suggests that long-term \"invest in the business and hold\" investors may be in the minority. My minority status thesis certainly seems to be supported by what is most commonly offered on most financial media outlets such as CNBC. The financial press, especially on television, is clearly focused on reporting and discussing short-term price volatility.Every day we hear how the markets are up or the markets are down today X percent, but there is very little discussion or coverage about intrinsic value. As I previously admitted, I may be wrong about that, but it sure seems to me that the financial media tends to pander to the active, shorter-term focused trader mentality. As a result, it appears, to me at least, that the conservative long-term investor is somewhat neglected. Since the media is primarily rewarded based on ratings, it seems logical to conclude short-term market players are where the action must be.Frankly, I find this disturbing, because I believe that it supports and even promotes a more speculative approach over a more prudent and conservative long-term approach to investing. The reason I am disturbed is because much of my writing is oriented towards investors in or near retirement, and I believe that the more prudent and conservative long-term approach to investing is most appropriate to those kinds of investors.Therefore, I was quite gratified when a reader of one of my most recent articles  posted a comment with a link to an article in Business Insider by renowned financial blogger Henry Blodget, co-founder, CEO and Editor-In-Chief,  , that challenged some of the drivel that is commonly propagated in the financial media. The article was titled \"16 Meaningless Market Phrases That Will Make You Sound Smart On CNBC.\"I loved the article, and I am in total agreement with 15 of the 16 meaningless market phrases that Mr. Blodget exposed. Actually, I am in agreement with all 16 of the phrases that were exposed, if they are applied to the short-term mentality that I discussed above. Like Mr. Blodget, I feel these phrases are meaningless, because they are typically vain attempts to sidestep ignorance on the part of those that love to spout them.The truth is, when they all relate to short-term market price movement, they are profoundly misleading. Since I strongly believe that no one can predict the short-term price movements of the market, or individual stocks for that matter, I believe these catchphrases are thrown out as attempts to cover up the reality that those stating them simply, in reality, have no clue.Additionally, and apparently like Mr. Blodget, I believe that all of the meaningless phrases he was exposing universally relate to the short-term trading mentality, except one. To be clear, I am saying that there is only 1 of the 16 meaningless phrases that can be appropriately utilized and applied by the prudent long-term investor.And frankly, when it is properly applied from a long-term business investing perspective, I believe it is one of the most meaningful and vitally important concepts that the prudent long-term investor can have. So much so, that I believe that every prudent long-term investor should start out every investing day by chanting this long-term investing and quite meaningful phrase, as I personally do.The phrase \"It's not a stock market. It's a market of stocks\" is extraordinarily meaningful, and I argue, quite profound for the long-term business perspective investor. It's important because it empowers the prudent investor to take their focus off of short-term stock market volatility, which is unpredictable and therefore unknowable, and instead, place their focus on the merits, benefits and future potential of the individual businesses that they personally are partnering with.In the long run, the stock market has very little to do with the results that a shareholder of a great business will earn. In the long run, the successful operating results of the individual business invested in will drive shareholder returns. Consequently, prudent long-term investors should not be worried about what the market may or may not do in the short run, but they should be very concerned about the future operating performance of the businesses they are invested in. Common sense would indicate that their future returns will be a function of the success of the business they are owners of, and independent of the overall stock market.Here is the excerpt from Henry Blodget's article where he talked about: \"It's not a stock market. It's a market of stocks.\" This is one of my favorite and meaningful phrases for the long-term oriented investor. But clearly, Mr. Blodget was critically citing this phrase from a short-term perspective, which is clear if you read his statement carefully.\"It's not a stock market. It's a market of stocks.\" Anytime. It sounds deeply profound - the sort of wisdom that can only be achieved through decades of hard work and experience. It suggests the speaker understands the market in a way that the average schmo doesn't. It suggests that the speaker, who gets that the stock market is actually a \"market of stocks,\" will coin money while the average schmo loses his or her shirt. Because it's a statement of the obvious.  it's \"a market of stocks.\" But it's also a \"stock market.\" And viewing the stock market as a \"market of stocks\" doesn't help you in any way, other than reminding you that all stocks don't move up and down the same amount.However, when this phrase is more appropriately referenced from a long-term perspective, it provides an extremely meaningful and important principle and perspective. It's not just about whether or not a stock might move up or down relative to the market; instead, this phrase is really about understanding the many important and numerous differences between the companies that make up the overall market.My primary point being that there are common stocks of companies within the market that dramatically outperform the market over time, some that underperform the market over time, and everything in between. Some of these performance differences are so extraordinary that it should become obvious that it is not the stock market that truly drives long-term returns.Undoubtedly, over the short run, stocks will move up and down in relative concert with what the market is doing. However, longer-term, the truly great businesses separate themselves from the pack in extraordinary ways. Conversely, the same is true with very poor or weak businesses. They also separate themselves from the pack, but usually in the wrong direction.In order to more clearly illustrate my point, I offer the following examples of companies great to bad and in between, that generated long-term performance results that were dramatically different than the market. In each case, you will see a clear correlation between each company's operating results and its stock performance over time.Additionally, although I am only offering a few examples, the reader should be aware that thousands could have been presented. Moreover, as the reader examines each of these performance reports, I suggest that they ask the following simple question: Admittedly, in each case, I am presenting extreme examples in order to make my point. But as you study the performance, especially the performance of the extraordinary companies, it should become crystal clear that the stock market had little or nothing to do with the returns that the long-term owners/shareholders of these companies received. Which brings me to another one of my favorite clich\u00e9s, and I submit, meaningful investment phrases: The stock market really has nothing to do with investing - in the long run. Consequently, it logically follows that the obsession with the stock market that many people have is misguided.In order to establish a baseline or benchmark to compare against, I offer the following earnings and price-correlated  , followed by its long-term performance history on the S&P 500 index. As an aside, anyone interested in accessing a live F.A.S.T. Graphs\u2122 on the S&P 500 can find it in my recent article that highlighted Emerson Electric (  )  .The following examples of companies that have dramatically outperformed the S&P 500 over various time frames are offered as clear evidence that it is not the market that generates long-term returns. With each of these examples, we see long-term earnings growth rates that are several times greater than the S&P 500. This clearly illustrates how and why the businesses you invest in are significantly more important than what the overall market or averages are doing.Admittedly, the following names are rare, and clearly not normal or average. However, the point of this exercise is to illustrate why the phrase \"It is a market of stocks and not a stock market\" is extremely meaningful. What these extreme examples unmistakably show is that there is no correlation or relationship between how their shareholders were rewarded in comparison to the S&P 500 index.Extreme underperformers versus the S&P 500 illustrates the true meaning of the phrase \"It's a market of stocks, not a stock market\" just as well as the extreme outperformers did. When you examine their performance, you find a group of companies with dismal performance in a rather good market time frame. Once again proving that it is not the market that drives returns, it is the business results of the individual companies.I am a firm believer and ardent supporter of sound and prudent investment management. To me, that implies making investment decisions based on relevant fact-based principles. Consequently, I don't believe that opinion, hunches or emotion are appropriate, especially when dealing with important money. With this said, I found Henry Blodget's expos\u00e9 of meaningless market phrases excellent, and even important work. He placed an important spotlight of reason on most of the meaningless phrases he highlighted.Furthermore, when looked at from the perspective of short-term market timing, I think his critique of what is one of my favorite phrases was also spot-on. However, when looked at from the perspective of the prudent long-term investor, the phrase \"It's a market of stocks, not a stock market\" possesses profound meaning and important investing insights.In my opinion and experience, people tend to be too focused on what the stock market might or might not do in the near future. Nobody can know for sure, and this focus on the market can be problematic in several ways. It can encourage people to be afraid to invest, and therefore lose out on good opportunities, or encourage them to be too aggressive and take on too much risk. Therefore, I favor basing investment decisions on the specific investments in question. In other words, I believe in focusing on the merits of the individual companies that I am interested in investing in.Stated more plainly, I am interested in each individual company's current valuation in relation to a rational expectation of future operating results. Whether the overall market is overvalued or undervalued is nowhere near as important to me as to the valuation and prospects of the individual company or companies I am focused on. From what I presented above, it should be clear that performance results come from business results, and not from what the stock market is doing or has done.The meaningful phrase \"It's a market of stocks, not a stock market\" stands as a continuous reminder to me to focus on what's important, while ignoring what's not. Since I do not invest in the entire market, I spend no time worrying about it. Instead, I spent all my time and effort evaluating the specific investments that I am actually invested in.

Recently, insurance company Coverys selected Accenture's Duck Creek Policy software suite to accelerate its product development processes and enhance customer services. Financial terms of the deal were kept under wraps.Per the contract, Accenture will offer its Duck Creek Policy software solutions to Coverys for its general insurance business in the U.S. The solution would improvise its property and casualty insurance product developments as well as client's billing and claims. Notably, Duck Creek Policy runs on a new trading platform named ZTrade that offers new products, pricing and self-service all from a single place.Coverys is one of the top 10 U.S. medical professional liability insurers. The company offers medical professional liability insurance and related services to hospitals, physicians/surgeons, dentists and allied healthcare professionals through its subsidiaries. To properly manage its nationwide insurance operations, the company has had to adopt efficient software solutions. Accenture's expertise in providing various insurance solutions justifies Coverys' decision to select its insurance suite.Accenture's Duck Creek Policy suite will enable Coverys to settle property and casualty claims as and when a loss is incurred, thereby maintaining its market position and increasing the goodwill.Accenture has been serving the insurance vertical for years. Continuous insurance deal wins underscore the efficacy and popularity of its services. With the Duck Creek acquisition (in Jul 2011), Accenture enhanced its insurance platform.

Information-technology consulting and outsourcing specialist  has tapped into the trend toward technological innovation, helping its clients to benefit from the latest advances to become more profitable. Coming into its first-quarter financial report Monday morning, investors had high hopes that Cognizant would continue to grow at the same healthy pace it has enjoyed recently, and the IT specialist delivered good news on multiple fronts. Let's look at how Cognizant's did last quarter and why it thinks the rest of 2015 could be even brighter. Cognizant's first-quarter results were even more positive than optimistic investors had expected. Revenue climbed more than 20% to $2.91 billion, surpassing the 19% consensus growth rate forecast among those following the stock. Similarly, net income came in at $382.9 million, a solid gain of almost 10%, and after allowing for some one-time items, adjusted earnings of $0.71 per share were a penny better than investors had expected.Cognizant saw strength across the board among its various business segments, but the healthcare area once again provided the biggest boost. The financial services segment remains Cognizant's largest, with revenue climbing 13% to $1.16 billion, but healthcare soared almost 43% and now makes up nearly a third of the company's overall sales. Gains in Cognizant's manufacturing, retail, and logistics segment were the weakest but still rose 7% year over year, while other sources of revenue climbed by 19%.The strength of the North American economy continued to drive Cognizant higher, with nearly four-fifths of its sales coming from its home territory. North American revenue climbed 25%, but Cognizant's revenue gained just 1% in Europe. Cognizant has successfully grown in other areas of the world, but its Rest of World business makes up less than 5% of overall company revenue.Image: Cognizant Technology.Cognizant's leaders expressed satisfaction in the company's growth prospects. As CEO Francisco D'Souza explained in a press release, \"The investments we have made in digital, automation, utility-based delivery models, consulting and industry-specific expertise are clearly paying off.\" President Gordon Coburn agreed, saying \"businesses are being forced to manage growth, innovation, and scale while simultaneously managing costs. The shift to a digital enterprise is demanding greater demand for our traditional services and solutions as clients find the need to keep pace with the speed and scale of innovation.\" Cognizant showed its optimism for the future by boosting its previous earnings projections for the full year. The forecast for adjusted earnings per share of $2.93 for the 2015 was $0.02 better than its guidance last quarter, and revenue of $12.23 billion was up by $20 million. In addition, second-quarter projections for adjusted earnings of $0.72 per share on revenue of at least $3.01 billion pointed to sustained growth going forward.Clearly, healthcare has been the standout for Cognizant lately, with its purchase of TriZetto driving growth in the segment. At the time of the acquisition, TriZetto provided software services to almost a quarter-million doctors and other healthcare providers, and it also had about 350 healthcare plan clients. With the two companies having shared many clients, the integration has seemed relatively smooth, and with the healthcare industry having largely weathered the storms of massive reform and regulation in recent years, Cognizant appears to have made the move at an ideal time.Investors were quite happy with Cognizant's results, sending shares up 4% in  in the first hour after the announcement. With all indications suggesting Cognizant will keep growing at its current pace, shares could push back toward their all-time high in short order.Apple forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering Apple's brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The year-over-year growth reflects increased focus on the Outsourcing business and new bookings. Additionally, another encouraging factor was the revenue increase in the Consulting business.Accenture's solid performance across insurance, banking and healthcare segments reflects strong demand for its services, boosting long-term growth prospects. The company has been steadily gaining traction in its Outsourcing business. The success is primarily attributed to the increase in demand for technology that can improve operating efficiencies and save costs.The upward trend continued during the first quarter of fiscal 2015, with Outsourcing revenues growing 11% on a year-over-year basis. The improvement mainly resulted from the rising demand for Accenture's outsourcing solutions driven by most of its operating industry groups across all geographic regions.Furthermore, considering the growing need for digital marketing, we are encouraged by Accenture's efforts toward enhancing its digital marketing capabilities through acquisitions. According to the U.S. IT research firm Gartner, companies have spent nearly 10.2% of revenues for marketing in 2014, of which one-fourth was invested in digital marketing. The report also suggests that 51% of the companies are planning to increase the digital marketing spending by 17% in 2015 on an average.Accenture made several acquisitions last year to expand its product and service offerings as well as client base, including Reactive Media Pty Ltd., an Australian digital services provider; Hytracc Consulting, a specialist in providing hydrocarbon and revenue accounting services to oil and gas Companies; Enkitec, an Oracle Platinum partner and a worldwide leader in Oracle Exadata implementations and Oracle database administration and development; and i4C Analystics, an Italian advanced analytics software platform provider.These acquisitions have enabled Accenture to enter newer markets, diversify and broaden its product portfolio and maintain the leading position. We believe that the company's continued acquisitions are expected to boost its revenue stream.However, we remain cautious as Accenture cut the fiscal 2015 earnings forecasts to account for the negative impact from foreign exchange rates. Furthermore, the operating margin is expected to stay range-bound in fiscal 2015, which led management to reiterate its earlier guidance range of 14.4% to 14.6%, marginally higher than the fiscal 2014 level of 14.3%.Moreover, increasing competition from Cognizant Technology Solutions (  ) and IBM (  ) and a strained spending environment remain other challenges.Currently, Accenture carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The chart below shows the one year price performance of IYW, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, IYW's low point in its 52 week range is $87.16 per share, with $109.06 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $109.03. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["op Technology Stocks:MSFT: -0.24%AAPL: -0.24%IBM: flatCSCO: flatGOOG: -0.05%Technology shares were lower in pre-market trade Wednesday along with the broader stock market.Level 3 Communications (  ) reported Q4 results that beat the Street on EPS but fell short on total revenues despite a year-over-year increase.The company reported Q4 adjusted EPS of $0.35, up from $0.06 in the same period a year ago and beating analyst estimates of $0.29.

On a year-over-year basis, earnings increased 4.8% from $1.03 per share. The year-over-year increase was attributed to higher revenues, higher non-operating income and lower share count.Accenture's second-quarter net revenue not only increased 5.1% year over year to $7.49 billion but also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.35 billion. Net revenue also came in line with the higher end of management's guided range of $7.25 to $7.50 billion, primarily aided by a 6% increase in Outsourcing revenues ($3.65 billion) and a 4% increase in Consulting revenues ($3.84 billion).Among the operating segments, Communications, Media & Technology revenues were up 8% on a year over year basis to $1.52 billion. Revenues from Health & Public Services increased 12% to $1.32 billion year over year. Revenues from Financial Services and Products increased 2% and 6% on a year over year basis to reach $1.59 billion and $1.85 billion, respectively.

Consulting bookings and Outsourcing bookings for the quarter amounted to $4.2 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively.Second-quarter gross margin decreased 140 basis points (bps) year over year to 29.9%, primarily due to higher cost of services.Operating expenses decreased 4.6% from the year-ago quarter to $1.22 million, primarily due to lower selling, general & administrative expenses. As a percentage of net revenue, operating expenses contracted 160 bps to 16.3% from the year-ago quarter. This in turn positively impacted operating results.Accenture's operating income came in at $1.02 billion or 13.6% of net revenue, which increased from $951.3 million or 13.3% of revenues in the year-ago quarter. Accenture reported $731.8 million in net income or $1.08 per share.Accenture exited the quarter with total cash balance of $4.06 billion compared with $4.47 billion in the preceding quarter.

The company declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.02 per share during the quarter.For the third quarter of fiscal 2015, Accenture expects net revenue between $7.35 billion and $7.60 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $7.62 billion. The company did not provide any earnings per share guidance.Accenture raised its revenue guidance for fiscal 2015. The company expects net revenue to grow in the range of 8% to 10% in local currency (previously 5% to 8%). Accenture expects earnings per share in the range of $4.66-$4.76 (previously $4.66-$4.80).

Moreover, both earnings and revenues increased on a year-over-year basis, reflecting an increased focus on the Outsourcing business, new bookings and continuous return of shareholders' value. However, the company provided tepid third quarter 2015 revenue guidance.Accenture's solid performance across insurance, banking and health care segments reflects strong demand for its services, thereby boosting long-term growth prospects. However, increasing competition from Cognizant Technology Solutions  and IBM  , a strained spending environment and Accenture's broad European exposure may temper its growth prospects to some extent.Accenture has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Last quarter, it posted a 1.69% positive earnings surprise. The company has posted positive earnings surprise in last four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 4.47%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Our proven model shows that Cognizant is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key components. , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +1.70%. This is a very meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. Cognizant currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with Zacks Rank #1, 2 and 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. Meanwhile, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Cognizant's Zacks Rank #2 and +1.70% ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat this quarter.We believe that Cognizant, which competes with the likes of Accenture (  ), Infosys and Wipro Ltd., remains well diversified in key verticals and emerging markets of social, mobile, analytics and cloud, which will be reflected in the fourth-quarter top-line results.Moreover, the company recently acquired the digital marketing service provider Cadient Group, which, in turn, will expand its digital marketing capabilities in the healthcare and life sciences business segment.Additionally, Cognizant's customer deal wins, which are expected to deliver incremental revenues in 2015, is a significant positive. Further, the expanded share buyback program reflects strong liquidity, which will further boost investors' confidence in the near term.Here are a couple of other companies, which you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Demandware, Inc.

Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 6.9%. Moreover, it is worth noting that Arrow has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the four preceding quarters with an average positive surprise of 3.2%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Arrow posted better-than-expected third-quarter of 2014 results. Year-over-year comparisons were also favorable and the company had a better book-to-bill ratio. Moreover, positive commentary about enhanced productivity and continued higher contributions from Europe are encouraging.Arrow recently declared the acquisition of RDC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Computacenter UK Ltd. The acquisition appears to be quite profitable for Arrow as it will diversify and broaden the company's product portfolio. Also, the acquisition will solidify the company's foothold in the European market.Furthermore, incremental sales from strategic acquisitions, such as Computerlinks, are also expected to boost Arrow's top line, going forward. However, uncertain economic conditions, high debt burden and competition from Avnet and Ingram Micro are concerns, going forward.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Arrow is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below. Earnings ESP for Symantec is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at $1.82 per share. Arrow carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) which when combined with an ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (  ) with an Earnings ESP of +1.70% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Twitter, Inc.

Many of those companies needed to turn to outside providers in order to take advantage of the tech boom, and has been quite successful in providing IT consulting and outsourcing services to its business clients.Data management has become increasingly important in IT. The boom in technology during the past 25 years has been dizzying, both to the billions of people across the globe and the companies that try to serve them as customers. Many of those companies needed to turn to outside providers in order to take advantage of the tech boom, and  has been quite successful in providing IT consulting and outsourcing services to its business clients.With the company reporting its fourth-quarter financial results Wednesday morning, investors were hoping that Cognizant would sustain its impressive growth rate, and the IT specialist's financials gave its shareholders much of what they wanted to see. Let's take a closer look at Cognizant's fourth quarter and how the company plans to keep moving forward in 2015 and beyond. Cognizant's headline numbers gave investors even more than they had bargained for in the growth department. Revenue for the fourth quarter rose to $2.74 billion, up more than 16% from the previous year's fourth quarter. Some of those gains came from Cognizant's acquisition of TriZetto, but even taking out the positive impact of that deal, Cognizant's organic growth came in at 13% year over year.Cognizant's bottom line also benefited from good conditions, with net income gaining 12% from a year ago, and adjusted earnings coming in at $0.67 per share, topping consensus estimates by $0.02. For the full year, Cognizant had similarly strong growth, with revenue and earnings per share both jumping 16%.Source: Cognizant.Looking deeper at its results, Cognizant's various segments did well nearly across the board. For the fourth quarter, health care was the best-performing segment, with sales growth of 26%. Financial services also grew at a double-digit percentage rate, while even the lagging manufacturing, retail, and logistics segment posted 9% growth. Health care has continued to become an increasingly important business for Cognizant, with health-care-related sales making up well over a quarter of the company's total revenue.Geographically, Cognizant remains reliant on North America for more than three-quarters of its sales. That was a strong place to be, with revenue climbing more than 17% within the region. The strong dollar held back gains elsewhere, particularly in Europe, but even with those currency headwinds, European revenue climbed almost 11%, and the rest of the world grew at an even faster pace than Cognizant's core North American region.Cognizant's management was pleased with the company's results. \"Business leaders globally are facing dramatically compressed innovation cycles,\" said CEO Francisco D'Souza. \"They are turning to us as a partner that can help them reimagine their businesses for the digital era.\" President Gordon Coburn agreed, noting that, \"we are in a unique position in the market to address a wide range of opportunities fueled by digital transformations.\"Cloud-based products are essential to Cognizant's growth.  Cognizant gave investors guidance for 2015 that signals continued growth, albeit not quite at the pace that some had hoped. Cognizant expects sales of $2.88 billion in the first quarter, with adjusted earnings per share of $0.69, slightly less than the consensus expectations among investors prior to the announcement. Similarly, adjusted EPS of $2.91 for the full 2015 year on revenue of $12.21 billion fell slightly short of what those following the stock wanted to see. Nevertheless, with full-year guidance equating to 19% sales growth and 12% higher earnings per share, Cognizant doesn't expect any sort of marked slowdown.Perhaps the biggest question Cognizant shareholders face is how well the company will do in integrating TriZetto. The company has high hopes from the $2.8 billion acquisition, with TriZetto software helping its customers manage the health benefits of almost half of all Americans who have health insurance.After the merger, Cognizant now counts 16 of the top 20 U.S. health plans among its customers, along with four of the top five pharmacy benefit management companies. As D'Souza said when the transaction closed, \"As a fully integrated health care technology and operations provider, we look forward to enabling our clients to deliver improved quality of care and superior health outcomes.\" Now, Cognizant will have to execute well to take full advantage of the TriZetto opportunity.Investors celebrated Cognizant's results, with shares gaining about 1.5% in pre-market trading right after the announcement. If Cognizant can sustain its growth throughout 2015 and beyond, then shareholders could easily see much more significant gains in the long run.Apple forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering Apple's brand-new gadgets.

Earnings not only beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 7 cents but were also up 3.5% sequentially and 175% on a year-over-year basis.In the third quarter, revenues of $73.9 million were up 9.8% sequentially and 9.3% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $73.0 million. The sequential increase in the bottom line was primarily driven by increased revenues aided by higher demand and improving execution. The sequential increase was limited to the System on Chip (SoC) and DRAM segments. However, the NAND Flash segment declined. Region-wise, Japan was the strongest sequentially, but the increase in the Asia/Pacific and North America was also significant.The company expects results in the soon-to-be-reported quarter to be lifted by unseasonably strong broad-based demand in the SoC and DRAM product segments backed by product design cycles, technology node transitions and new memory communication interface standards.Normally, the first and fourth quarters are seasonally slower but stronger demand across markets is leading to a variance this year.We believe that FormFactor is moving into the next phase of growth on the back of a revamped product portfolio and a cost structure that are better aligned to market opportunity.Based on the current revenue run rate, an unseasonably strong outlook for the fourth quarter, and products and customer partnerships developed over the past few years, the company is very optimistic about its future.Our proven model does not conclusively show that FormFactor is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter as it does not have the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. : Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 2 cents.

Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Tableau Software, in the last reported quarter, had witnessed strong growth in earnings and revenues driven by its diversified and innovative product offerings.Given a rapid growth in demand for business analytics tools, we believe Tableau Software's long-term growth prospects remain encouraging.In Nov 2014, Tableau Software announced that its growth in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region remains strong having secured over 5,000 customer accounts and revenue growth of 100% on a year over year basis.

Moreover, it is worth noting that Symantec has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the four preceding quarters with an average positive surprise of 15.2%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Symantec delivered mixed second quarter results, with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. Both earnings and revenues compared unfavorably year over year.We believe that strong demand for Symantec's cyber security solutions and its adoption of new products should act as catalysts, going forward. Nonetheless, continued investments to launch new and innovative products could also impact margins in the near term.However, investing in growth areas such as Enterprise backup, Storage Management and Security businesses are expected to drive the company's long-term prospects. Moreover, Symantec's restructuring initiatives and share buyback plans are expected to support its bottom line.Most recently, Symantec entered into an agreement with The Boeing Company (BA). Per the agreement, Symantec will purchase technology rights from Boeing's cybersecurity business unit, Narus Inc. As part of the deal, Symantec will also hire 65 engineers and data scientists from Narus' security division.Separately, Symantec had also confirmed the separation of its information management business from its consumer and enterprise software security businesses into two publicly listed companies. The entire process is expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2015.In fact, the separation comes at an opportune moment for Symantec as the initiative aims at streamlining its operations and maximizing shareholder's value. This strategic move is also expected to help the company in reviving operational performance.However, smaller companies like Kaspersky are consistently launching comparable products. These along with competition from Intel and Microsoft remain headwinds. The uncertainty over PC sales further adds to the woes.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Symantec is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

In the last reported quarter, Amazon recorded a negative earnings surprise of 30.14%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Last quarter, Amazon announced a loss of 95 cents per share on revenues of $20.58 billion, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 73 cents and revenues of $20.86 billion. This marked the third negative earnings surprise in the past four quarters.Growing the company over the long term has been Amazon's target and the quarterly results are largely considered irrelevant. But Amazon guided lower sales for the fourth quarter in the range of $27.3 billion - $30.3 billion, significantly short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $30.98 billion.This is big news. Investors have for a long time been looking past disappointments in the bottom line for +20% top-line growth each quarter, which Amazon has provided for the past five quarters now. But guiding lower for the all-important 2014 holiday season is a red flag.Huge demand for electronics and general merchandise coupled with growth in the Amazon Web Services business will probably be the driving factors for fourth quarter results.Three estimates for the soon-to-be-reported quarter were revised downward in the last 7 days while there were no upward revisions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter declined from 23 cents to 22 cents per share over the same time frame. For the current year, one estimate moved south over the last one week.Furthermore, our proven model does not conclusively show that Amazon is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not have the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, currently stands at -4.17%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 23 cents is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 24 cents. Amazon currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which when combined with a negative ESP, makes surprise difficult. We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and #5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks worth considering in the technology sector that have both a positive earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are:Ellie Mae, Inc. (  ) with an Earnings ESP of +40.00% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (  ) with an Earnings ESP of +1.69% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Hutchinson Technology Inc.

In the last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 100%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.LinkedIn remains a leader in the emerging online professional networking segment with increasing worldwide popularity and steady growth in the recent past. LinkedIn reported encouraging results in the third quarter. The company also saw 28% addition in its cumulative members.We believe that LinkedIn's traction in the mobile segment is particularly encouraging primarily due to its application launches for Apple's iPhones and Android-based smartphones. Synergies from acquisitions are also expected to aid results over the long run. The acquisitions of Newsle and Bizo will not only enhance user experience but also garner additional dollars through targeted marketing strategies. We also remain encouraged by the 40%-50% top-line growth recorded in the past few quarters.Notably, LinkedIn's initiatives to increase advertising revenues through product launches and partnership programs are praiseworthy. Advertisers are also taking a note of the company's growing user base, in our view.Our proven model does not conclusively show that LinkedIn is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

It is worth noting that Check Point has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the four preceding quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 1.5%. Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Check Point delivered better-than-expected third-quarter results. Also, both earnings and revenues compared favorably on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to an increase in revenues from Products & Software Blades and improvement in Software Updates and maintenance revenues.Check Point also witnessed higher adoption of its Application Control, Anti-Bot and URL Filtering blades coupled with higher demand for its data center and high-end appliances. Another factor that contributed to the overall growth was the increasing number of large deal signings.Furthermore, the rapid adoption of Check Point's data center appliances and the continuous enhancements in data center product lines are expected to provide adequate support to revenue growth.Moreover, Check Point's settlement with the Israeli tax authorities is a long-term positive. The company's continuous share buybacks bode well for investors.However, competition from Cisco Systems Inc., Juniper Networks Inc. and Fortinet Inc.; an uncertain economic environment, competitive pressure, currency headwinds and Check Point's significant European exposure are concerns.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Check Point will beat earnings estimates this quarter.

This is very meaningful and a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for shares. Note that stocks with Zacks Rank of #1, #2 and #3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. The sell rated stocks (#4 and #5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Western Digital's Zacks Rank #3 and +1.43% ESP makes us very confident in looking for a positive earnings beat on Jan 27.Shift toward non-PC applications, secular growth of digital data, modest growth in TAM and higher demand for storage are expected to lead to a positive earnings surprise in the soon to be reported quarter. Additionally, its growing exposure to the small and medium business space and synergies from acquisitions remain growth drivers.We remain encouraged by the company's launch of a string of storage devices under the mobile and cloud segment. With such launches and product innovations, we expect Western Digital to strengthen its market position against the likes of Seagate Technology.Also, Western Digital's entry into the wireless devices market comes at a time when storage services related to smartphones and tablets are witnessing large-scale adoption. These factors are expected to be the growth catalysts, going forward.Moreover, it is noteworthy that Western Digital has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the past four quarters with an average surprise of 4.4%.Western Digital is not the only firm looking up this earnings season.

(Symbol: CTSH) shares, but tentative about paying the going market price of $55.28/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2016 put at the $43.75 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.85. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 4.2% return against the $43.75 commitment, or a 4.3% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to CTSH's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $43.75 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. sees its shares fall 20.7% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $41.90 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.85 from $43.75), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.3% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., and highlighting in green where the $43.75 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2016 put at the $43.75 strike for the 4.3% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $55.28) to be 27%.

Moreover, it is also worth noting that Rambus has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the four preceding quarters with an average positive surprise of 770%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Rambus reported mixed third-quarter results as the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate while the top line missed the same.  Also, the year-over-year comparisons were unfavorable primarily due to lower royalty revenues from Samsung and NVIDIA.Nonetheless, with energy-efficient lighting, LED products finding a place in the latest architectural, retail, commercial and residential lighting fixtures, we believe Rambus is in a favorable position to capitalize on this opportunity.Rambus is going through a restructuring phase and we expect it to yield favorable results in the coming quarters. The company has resolved several of its legal disputes, which lowered litigation expenses and positively impacted operating results. Additionally, licensing agreements - the results of successful monetization of its patents - remain a recurring revenue source for Rambus.However, competition from Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices and customer concentration remain headwinds for the company. The company's investments in the CryptoManager platform and certain memory and interface technologies can also impact margins in the near term.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Rambus will beat earnings this quarter.

The move is part of Accenture's efforts to bolster its digital marketing capabilities. However, the company has not disclosed the terms of the deal.Headquartered in Melbourne, Reactive Media was formed in 1997. With its offices in Sydney, New York, London and Auckland, the company is one of the largest digital agencies in Australia.Reactive Media provides brand e-Commerce and digital marketing services. Apart from this, its portfolio includes technology development, and design and usability services. Furthermore, it provides digital strategy services that include strategies to improve the brand identity of its clients on the digital platform and enhance their online presence.Reactive Media will join Accenture Interactive platform, part of the company's digital marketing-services arm, Accenture Digital. Accenture Interactive was formed in 2009 to deliver superior consulting, technology and analytics services to chief marketing officers (CMOs).Competent marketing is the key to success for every organization. Marketing and digital executives of a company are responsible for developing digital marketing campaigns, marketing contents, e-commerce and marketing operations. Accenture Interactive is a well-integrated platform enabling CMOs to devise marketing strategies and derive higher ROI (return on investment) from it.Since the formation of Accenture Interactive, the company has made significant acquisitions to enhance its digital marketing capabilities. In 2013, the company acquired a Hong Kong-based online marketing consultant, Acquity Group Ltd., and U.K.-based design agency, Fjord. In 2012, it acquired digital production services vendor, avVenta Worldwide, to bolster its interactive platform.According to the U.S. IT research firm Gartner Inc., companies have spent nearly 10.2% of revenues for marketing in 2014, of which one-fourth was invested in digital marketing. The report also suggests that 51% of the companies are planning to increase their 2015 digital marketing spending by 17% on an average.Considering the growing need for digital marketing, we expect Accenture's investment in digital and marketing capabilities to boost its long-term growth. This will also facilitate the company in effectively competing with other digital marketing service providers such as International Business machines Corp. (  ), Dell and Deloitte.We are encouraged by Accenture's strategy of growing through acquisitions. However, we remain slightly cautious about the stock due to its tepid first-quarter fiscal 2015 outlook. Increasing competition from Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (  ) and FTI Consulting, Inc. (  ) and a sluggish economic recovery may also have an impact on its growth.Currently, Accenture carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).

However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2015 stands higher than the company's guided figure at $3.25 per share.Including an estimated impact of expenses associated with Health Net's master services agreement with Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.

This is largely attributable to the high volume and low administrative expenses, attributable to the Cognizant deal.The overall general and administrative (G&A) expense ratio is projected for a 10 bps rise to 10.9% in 2015, mainly on account of increased health insurer fee (HIF) and premium taxes with respect to 2014.On the share repurchase front, on Dec 16, 2014, Health Net approved a $258 million increase in its existing buyback authorization under which the company is left with $142 million worth of shares.

Its portfolio of services includes product and application development, technology consulting, infrastructure and hosting, application testing, and maintenance and support.Epam (  ) has used a combination of buyouts and organic growth to nearly quadruple its annual revenue over the past four years.On the organic side, the company's strategy has been to get a foot in the door with customers by starting out small and then growing the relationship over time. But since its  in 2012, Epam has upped its sales and marketing efforts to land bigger deals.\"We are now going in trying to win bigger engagements, and we are doing that by differentiating ourselves from others in the PDO (product development organization) market,\" said Chief Financial Officer Anthony Conte.After Epam came out of its 2012 IPO, the company was \"kind of bucketed in with general outsourcers,\" Conte told IBD. \"But the reality is, we are very different. We have been building products for software vendors for over 20 years now. What we offer is much higher value, but nobody was seeing that. That was the motivation for more sales and marketing.\"It's not easy competing for bigger contracts, considering that Epam's rivals include much larger companies such asInfosys (  ) andCognizant Technology Solutions (  ).But Epam has made some pretty impressive strides. In August, it announced that it was on the short list of companies competing to implement a major data project, called the Consolidated Audit Trail (  ), undertaken by the Securities and Exchange Commission.According to an Epam press release, the CAT is \"one of the biggest undertakings\" in the history of the securities industry. It involves recording 21 petabytes of securities transaction data within the next five years, the release said, and is \"second only to the NSA data warehouse in scale.\"Others on the short list include SunGard Data Systems as well as a consortium that includesHewlett-Packard (  ).The decision on which company gets the contract will come next year, Conte says. \"No matter what happens, it's a real feather in our cap making it into the final selection.\"Epam serves numerous industries, including financial services, health care, retail and business information. Much of its workforce is based in Central and Eastern Europe and provides an alternative to offshore IT firms that do most of their work in India or China.The company has made a bigger play into the application maintenance and infrastructure outsourcing markets in recent quarters, notes Citigroup analyst Ashwin Shirvaikar. These markets \"are cumulatively larger and grow faster than the software development end market,\" he said.Even when Epam wins smaller deals with customers, it doesn't take the company long to grow its relationships.As an example, Epam's relationship with its biggest customer, Swiss financial giantUBS (UBS), began in 2008 with a small mobile application project worth less than $100,000 in revenue.Today, Epam provides services in \"many different areas\" for UBS, Conte said, and UBS now accounts for about $90 million to $100 million in annual revenue for Epam.A similar relationship evolved with Canadian Tire, which operates nearly 1,700 retail and gasoline outlets in Canada.\"They brought us in to do one small e-commerce app and we have since grown that into a variety of different projects across many of their portfolio companies,\" Conte said.In less than two years, Epam's revenue from Canadian Tire grew from nothing to around $20 million a year.UBS and British financial services firmBarclays (BCS) are Epam's two biggest customers, accounting for second-quarter revenue of $23.2 million and $13.5 million, respectively. They are the only two customers that accounted for at least 10% of overall sales.Total revenue during the second quarter came in at $174.7 million, up 31% from the prior year and above consensus estimates. That continued a years-long run in which quarterly revenue has risen by at least 26%. Earnings for the quarter gained 33% to 53 cents a share, also above views.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Epam to report Q3 earnings of 54 cents a share, a gain of 26% year-over-year. Full-year profit is seen rising 25% in 2014 and another 15% in 2015. Its stock as of Wednesday traded near 47.There were concerns earlier this year about how Epam would be affected by the military and political conflicts that erupted in Ukraine, where the company operates several offices and delivery centers. However, those concerns have died down as Epam has worked to convince customers and investors that it faces little risk from the turmoil.\"At this stage it has not had any impact on our business,\" Conte said. \"The primary fighting in that region was several hundred kilometers from our nearest facility. We continue to go to work there and perform as necessary, and there has been no disruption at all.\"Meanwhile, Epam has also gotten attention for its aggressive acquisition strategy this year. The company made three buyouts during the first half of 2014.In March it acquired Netsoft USA, a strategic technology and design firm that specializes in health care and health insurance.That deal was followed by Epam's April acquisition of Joint Technology Development -- a provider of technology services to investment banking and wealth and asset management firms -- and its June purchase of GGA Software Services, a provider of scientific informatics services to companies in global pharmaceuticals and other industries.The GGA and Netsoft deals brought aboard \"a good list of health care clients that have mobile commerce/digitization needs and can be further penetrated,\" analyst Shirvaikar noted.Expect Epam to keep scouting deals in the coming quarters.\"We have a pretty deep pipeline of acquisitions we are looking at,\" Conte said. \"The main focus that we have when looking at acquisitions is new regions and geographies as we move to become more of a global player.\"The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["rowth stocks can be some of the most exciting picks in the market, as these high-flyers can captivate investors' attention, and produce big gains as well.

This firm, which is in the Business Software Services/ BPO industry, saw EPS growth of 18.9% last year, and is looking great for this year too.In fact, the current growth estimate for this year calls for earnings-per-share growth of 16.4%. Furthermore, the long-term growth rate is currently an impressive 17.4%, suggesting pretty good prospects for the long haul.And if this wasn't enough, the stock has actually seen estimates rise over the past month for the current fiscal year by about 1.2%.

However, figuring out which companies are built to yield market-smashing returns over the long haul isn't easy.One intangible asset helps demystify strong corporate foundations: culture. It's a powerful competitive advantage that can provide a significant edge over the competition.In a way, though, it's difficult to grasp what culture even means. Many definitions will start with the most important factor: how managements and employees interact with one another. There's also another element, which is stakeholder-friendliness. Companies that treat their stakeholders well and try to make the world better often make employees feel great about their daily endeavors.Factors that are difficult to quantify can be easy to dismiss. Culture can't be broken out in financial statements. It's more of an art than a science, but ignoring its role in the bigger equation is one of the biggest mistakes investors can make.Increasing numbers of investors consult resources like Glassdoor or  's annual Best Places to Work rankings for investing ideas. These help investors feel out how jazzed people are about their employers -- and happiness often transcends time clocks and large paychecks.One thing to remember is that intangible factors aren't unknown in investing. Take goodwill accounting, which values intangible assets on balance sheets. And while theoreticians have argued over how to treat intangible assets for about 100 years, they haven't been dismissed.Brand impacts and cultural policies are more closely tied to investment theses these days, as more consumers recognize socially responsible aspects in purchasing decisions. Goodwill strengthens companies' brands over their rivals'.Unfortunately, many investors continue to believe that companies that take exceedingly good care of employees, suppliers, customers, and the environment are doomed to rack up costs instead of benefits -- and therefore underperform. That's not the case at all, but it's not easy to prove otherwise.So let's look at a set of companies that have proven that a progressive culture pays.Raj Sisodia's  is a major resource about cultural philosophy in business. It extols the virtues of Conscious Capitalism, which entails commonsense stakeholder-friendly practices.By definition, Firms of Endearment, or FoEs, focus on far more than the traditional bottom line. They are within the vanguard of the companies that show that \"profit\" and \"purpose\" go hand in hand. They treat their employees well, which leads to a dedicated workforce that not only believes in their employer but will take great care of customers. These companies tend to have \"servant leadership\" -- founders and CEOs who care about the entire organization more than their own pocketbooks. FoEs tend to use their businesses to benefit even more stakeholders, including suppliers, communities, the environment, and the world.When  was first published, the 22 publicly traded Firms of Endearment companies in the U.S. had already generated market-beating returns. When the second edition of the book hit last year, it turned out that over 15 years' time, those companies had gone gangbusters.Here's a breakout of the returns over different time frames, showing the staggering results.\n  \nSource: firmsofendearment.com.The FoE companies aren't obscure; many investors, regardless of investment philosophy, wish they had snapped up cheap shares way back when.Companies like  ,  ,  , and  are all publicly traded companies on the list.Some FOE companies don't even spring to mind among consumers and investors, though. These include  ,  ,  , and  .The policies that make these companies \"Firms of Endearment\" are difficult to measure and emulate -- and that makes them real competitive advantages. And these companies have survived and thrived over the long haul.Granted, culture isn't the end-all, be-all factor in outperformance. A company may have a marvelous culture, but if management mishandles strategy, innovation, market share growth, debt load, and all kinds of other factors, culture alone won't save the company.Regardless, any investment philosophy should take the risk of bad corporate culture into consideration. Intangible risks -- for example, how customers feel about companies -- have real effects on business results. Tarnished brands and negative cultures stealthily show up in performance eventually. While we investors obsess over sales, margins, and other balance-sheet highlights, spending in areas like employee happiness goes unnoticed, though it can decide a company's fate.Circuit City is a perfect example of how an entire corporate structure can crumble due in part to internal forces. Its depressed workforce was just one more nail in its coffin as it implemented desperate strategies, such as switching to a commission-based workforce in 2003 and, toward the end of its run, laying off thousands of seasoned workers in favor of \"cheaper\" ones. Circuit City's lack of happy, motivated employees who could provide exemplary customer service left the company with no edge over its many rivals -- particularly the disruptive online competition.Melding the art and the science of investing is an extremely defensive and often successful way to invest. The art is just as important as the science when you're pursuing high long-term returns. Focusing on culture is by no means a waste of time: It helps build strong corporate foundations and winning stocks. Warren Buffett implements quantitative and qualitative aspects to his investing.

Last quarter, it posted a 6.90% positive surprise. The company has posted an average positive earnings surprise of 5.05% over the past four quarters.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.We believe that Cognizant, which competes with the likes of Accenture (  ), Infosys and Wipro Ltd., remains well diversified in key verticals and emerging markets of social, mobile, analytics and cloud, which will continue to boost its top line.Moreover, the company recently acquired digital marketing service provider Cadient Group, which, in turn will help Cognizant to expand it's digital marketing capabilities in the healthcare and life sciences business segment. Cognizant's partnership with Vorweck Group in the quarter is also expected to be fetch positive results for the company going forward.Additionally, Cognizant's customer deal wins, which are expected to deliver approximately $200 million incremental revenues in 2015, is a significant positive. Further, the expanded share buyback program reflects strong liquidity, which will further boost investors' confidence in the near term.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cognizant is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.

The U.S. Navy Sea System Command contract is worth up to $16.3 million and requires Accenture to provide mobile maintenance support to the Naval Sea Systems Division.The deal has a one-year base period and carries two one-year renewal options. Government contracts have emerged as a strength for the company over the years.As per the terms of the contract, Accenture Federal Services will support the Navy's electronic Technical Work Documents (eTWD) system solutions and improve the overall enterprise performance. eTWD system solution reduces the resources and time required to compile, issue, execute and certify work, thereby supporting continuous operations.The deal, which ensures increased efficiencies as well as quantity, will boost the U.S. Navy's ability to streamline operations across various departments efficiently, improve enterprise performance and promote mission-critical IT solutions. Notably, Accenture's mobile solutions are customer-friendly and help reduce costs while improving performance. This will help the Navy's public shipyards to plan, achieve and sustain audit readiness.Accenture has won a series of government deals in the past. Recently, it was awarded contracts by the U.S. Army at an aggregate value of $53.1 million to support General Fund Enterprise Business System's (GFEBS) maintenance and daily operations. The continuous deal wins for the company ensure incremental cash flows.However, these contracts generally have lower margins, which could be a concern.Moreover, Accenture continues to face competition from companies like Cognizant Technology Solutions (  ) and International Business Machines (  ). Additionally, a strained spending environment as well as significant exposure to Europe may temper growth to some extent.Nevertheless, improved bookings growth, coupled with good performances in insurance, banking and healthcare sectors reflect a strong demand for Accenture's services, which in turn are boosting its long-term growth prospects.Currently, Accenture has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Meanwhile, investors could consider a better-ranked stock in the same industry like Rambus Inc.

It will help the company to cash in on the future prospects of the health care industry, which currently accounts for near about 17% of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP).Further, we believe that Trizetto will be easier to integratesince both the companies have many healthcare clients in common. However, Cognizant has been exposed to severe criticism as many believe the deal to be overpriced.We believe that Cognizant, which competes with the likes of Accenture (  ), Infosys (  ) and Wipro Ltd. (  ), remains well diversified in key verticals and emerging markets of social, mobile, analytics and cloud, which will continue to boost its top line. Moreover, its expanded share buyback program reflects strong liquidity, which will further boost investor confidence in the near term.Currently, Cognizant has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The company delivers value to its clients by leveraging its industry knowledge, global delivery capability and technological expertise. Accenture has been steadily gaining traction in its outsourcing business. The success is primarily attributed to the increase in demand for technology that can improve operating efficiencies and save costs.Accenture's solid performance across insurance, banking and healthcare segments reflects strong demand for its services, boosting long-term growth prospects. Nonetheless, revenue decline in Accenture's Consulting business remains a concern. Although the company's consulting revenues recorded a modest increase in the last-reported quarter, we could get more constructive if this phenomenon continues in the forthcoming quarters as well.Moreover, Accenture's market share and revenues necessarily depend on client relationships and the number of contracts it secures. This, along with the limited scope for product differentiation, makes the renegotiation of large contracts extremely important.

With respect to earnings trend, this healthcare services provider has delivered positive earnings surprises in two out of the last four quarters with an average beat of 7.9%.In fact, shares of Health Net rose nearly 4.5% over the last few trading sessions to close at $45.59, since the company reported second-quarter earnings results on Aug 6, 2014. Furthermore, the one-year return on the stock is 54.1%, much above the S&P 500's return of 20.2% as well as that of other players in the healthcare services space like Aetna Inc. (  ) and WellPoint Inc. (  ) that generated returns of 23.8% and 32.4% respectively, over the same period.In the reported quarter, Health Net's bottom line not only surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but also improved year over year on improved revenues. Total revenues were driven by an increase in health plan services premium revenues. Health Net succeeded in enhancing its membership base, evident from the year-over-year increase in enrollment in the Western Region Operations segment.Health Net had a strong financial position at the end of second-quarter 2014, with higher cash and investments, a rebound in cash flow and increased assets. The company also witnessed an improvement in its debt-to-capital ratio, reflecting lower financial leverage. Although the company did not repurchase any shares in the reported quarter, it intends to engage in buybacks from the third quarter of 2014. We expect this endeavor to boost investors' return and be accretive to earnings per share (EPS).Based on the performance in the second quarter as well as expansion of health plans, management of Health Net raised its membership guidance, which is quite encouraging. The outlook regarding other parameters like net income, revenues, and G&A expense ratio were reiterated. The reported net income guidance was reaffirmed at $3.00 per share while the operating net income is expected to be a minimum of $2.22 per share.Another positive tiding at the company that contributed to the 52-week high was the alliance with technology giant, Cognizant Technology Solutions, (  ). After completion, this deal will likely benefit the company by generating $150-$200 million of savings annually in general, administrative and depreciation expenses by 2017.Moreover, in Aug 2014, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) expanded its Patient Centered Community Care (PC3) contract, entailing primary care services to the veterans. For this purpose, VA has chosen Health Net to aid the expansion. We believe that securing this deal will help Health Net to enhance its membership base, thereby driving revenues going forward.Riding on these positives, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2014 and 2015 witnessed estimate revisions. It currently stands at $2.30 per share for 2014, reflecting year-over-year growth of 6.5%. For 2015, the same is pegged at $3.23 per share, translating into a year-over-year improvement of 40.3%.Currently, Health Net carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

We believe that strong expense management initiatives, increased health service premiums and a solid cash position should drive growth.Earlier, Health Net reported second-quarter 2014 results that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved year over year on higher revenues. However, decline in Small and Large Group enrolment and the adverse effects of Health Care Reform are setbacks.Health Net has a healthy capital and liquidity position that enables it to undertake strategic initiatives and efficient capital management activities. Health Net continues to enhance shareholders' value through continued share repurchases. Although the company did not buy back any shares in the first half of 2014, management stated that it intends to resume repurchases again in the third quarter of 2014. Given its strong financial position, we expect Health Net to indulge in more buybacks going forward, thereby sharing more profits with shareholders.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has been strengthening its operating leverage through noticeable expense management over the past couple of years. This has also increased margins significantly. Additionally, the deal with Cognizant Technology Solutions (  ) this month, which is awaiting approval, will likely generate $150-$200 million of annual savings in general, administrative and depreciation expenses by 2017, boosting margins further.Health Plan Services premiums have witnessed improvement over the past few years and the first half of 2014 was no exception. With the increase in memberships in Medicaid and dual eligibles, we expect premiums to rise further going forward.On the flip side, the rate of customer attrition in Health Net's health plans raises caution. Given the present state of the global economy and challenging market conditions with high levels of unemployment, low consumer confidence and volatility in both the U.S. and international markets, we remain skeptical about a significant increase in enrollments.Revenues from the government contracts segment of Health Net have been declining over the past few years. Although government contracts segment revenues increased slightly in the first half of 2014, a rise in government contacts costs limited the desired margin expansion in the segment. Moreover, provisions of the Health Care Reform like establishment of minimum medical loss ratios and restriction on charging higher premiums from patients with pre-existing medical conditions will likely increase expenses going forward.Health Net incurred reinsurance recoverable, risk corridor receivable and a payable for the risk adjustment charge related to the premium stabilization provisions in the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Settlement charges like these are likely to weigh on company's cash flows going forward.Better-ranked stocks in the healthcare services space include Gentiva Health Services Inc.

Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 4.13%. Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Accenture delivered better-than-expected third-quarter results. Revenues also increased on a year-over-year basis, reflecting an increased focus on the Outsourcing business, new bookings and continuous return of shareholders value. Another encouraging factor was the revenue increase in its Consulting business.Additionally, Accenture's deal wins across different sectors, especially insurance, during the quarter reflects strong demand for its services. Strategic alliances are also expected to boost Accenture's growth prospects.We believe that Accenture's solid performance across insurance, banking and healthcare segments reflects strong demand for its services, boosting long-term growth prospects. However, increasing competition from Cognizant Technology Solutions (  ) and International Business Machines, a strained spending environment and Accenture's broad European exposure may temper its growth prospects to some extent.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Accenture will beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a $1.09. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Accenture carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents and year-ago earnings of 52 cents per share.Including severance costs and tax benefit from a loss on the stock of subsidiary, Health Net recorded net income of $1.49 cents per share, much higher than 42 cents in the prior-year quarter.Improved revenues offset higher expenses and led to the improvement.The company's total revenue increased 24.9% year over year to approximately $3.4 billion, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Health plan services premium revenues of Health Net were $3.3 billion, up 26.5% from the second quarter of 2013. Meanwhile, total health plan service expenses increased 26.1% to $2.8 billion. The company's total expenses increased 23.7% year over year to $3.3 billion. This segment of Health Net posted revenues of $3.3 billion in the quarter, up almost 27% year over year. Net investment income declined about 30% year over year to $12 million.

Commercial MCR improved 260 basis points to 82.3% from 85.9% in the prior-year quarter. This was driven by an improvement in cost trends, better business mix and higher premiums. Medicare Advantage MCR deteriorated to 90.9% from 89.9% a year ago. Medicaid MCR amounted to 83.6% compared with 79.5% in the year-ago quarter.

After all, to be that successful, an investor has to be correct the vast majority of the time, right?Nope. While they likely make good calls more often than bad calls, the truth is that even great investors lose money on a lot of their stock picks. When you are dealing with a financial machine that has as many moving parts as the stock market, expecting to be right on 100% of your picks (or 90%, 80% or even 70% of your picks) just isn't realistic.It's also not necessary -- and, in fact, it can be quite dangerous.One of the gurus I follow who stressed this point is Martin Zweig. During the 15 years it was monitored, Zweig's stock-picking newsletter was ranked number one according to risk-adjusted returns by Hulbert Financial Digest, averaging gains of 15.9% per year. But Zweig wasn't perfect. He didn't try to be.Zweig chose stocks using what he termed a \"shotgun\" method, which involves screening thousands of stocks against specific quantitative investment criteria to find those that make the grade. This was in contrast to what he called the \"rifle\" method, which involves analyzing a small number of stocks very thoroughly, looking not only at fundamentals but also at non-quantitative aspects.When you're screening through thousands of stocks, you're going to end up buying some that turn out to be busts, and Zweig found that his approach had a built-in error rate of about three-eighths over the long term. \"That is, out of eight stocks that I pick, three, or 38%, will underperform the market,\" he wrote in his book, Winning On Wall Street. Of course, it would be great if you knew ahead of time which stocks fell into that 38%. But no one can do that -- and Zweig showed that you don't have to. Beating the market 62% of the time netted him huge profits.Other great investors (Buffett comes to mind) use something of a rifle approach -- and they make plenty of mistakes, too. In fact, Buffett often discusses his mistakes quite candidly in his annual letters.But Zweig said the shotgun approach is probably more suitable for most people. I agree. Most investors don't have the time to perform in-depth research on numerous different companies. Plus, a shotgun approach helps keep dangerous emotion out of your decisions, since you're sticking to the numbers -- a stock's financials and fundamentals.Zweig isn't the only guru I follow who used a shotgun method. Top hedge fund manager Joel Greenblatt does, too. His strategy targets stocks that are often beaten down but have strong fundamentals -- though they could have non-quantitative factors that are driving them lower. \"That's why you really have to buy a basket of 20 or 30, because I'm not sure anyone really knows the answer to each individual one of these companies,\" he once said. \"On average they'll do quite well over a period of time, but I wouldn't want to select one or two individual stocks from that group.\"Both Zweig and Greenblatt thus knew no stock-picker is perfect -- they succeeded instead by tilting the odds of success, based on historical data, in their favor. That's what I do with my Guru Strategies, each of which is based on the approach of a different investment great, and my experiences with these shotgun-type methods have been in line with what Zweig and Greenblatt say. For example, since I started tracking it over 11 years ago, my 10-stock Zweig-inspired portfolio has averaged gains of about 9.7% per year, while the S&P 500 has gained just 6.1% per year. But the portfolio's accuracy (the%age of picks it makes money on) is 56.9% -- far from perfect.Similarly, my Greenblatt-based portfolio, which I started tracking in late 2005, has gained 10.3% per year vs. just 5.0% for the S&P 500, but it's been right on just over half (53.8%) of its picks.The bottom line is that you're going to make plenty of losing stock picks. If you try or expect to be perfect, you're much more likely to get rattled by those mistakes, making it more likely that your emotions will cause you to ditch a good strategy at just the wrong time.But while you can't be perfect, \"you can, however, be right more than you are wrong,\" Zweig wrote. \"If you are right 60% of the time, ride your profits, and rein in your losses, you'll find that when you're right you're very right, and when you're wrong you're only moderately wrong. In the long run, a 60% success rate translates into huge gains, a 50% rate into solid gains, and even a 40% rate can beat the market.\"These are the types of stocks my Zweig- and Greenblatt-inspired models are high on right now. I know that not all of them will be winners, but by investing in a basket of such stocks I put the odds in my favor.

Revenues also improved on a year-over-year basis reflecting an increased focus on the Outsourcing business, new bookings and continuous return of shareholders value. Moreover, the company provided a modest guidance.Accenture's solid performance across insurance, banking and healthcare segments reflects strong demand for its services, boosting long-term growth prospects. Accenture has been steadily gaining traction in its Outsourcing business. The success is primarily attributed to the increase in demand for technology that can improve operating efficiencies and save costs. The upward trend continued during the first nine months of fiscal 2014, with outsourcing revenues growing 6% on a year-over-year basis. The improvement was mainly due to the growing demand for Accenture's outsourcing solutions driven by most of its operating industry groups across all geographic regions.Over the past couple of years, Accenture has made several acquisitions to expand its product and service offerings and cater to a diverse clientele. During fiscal 2013, Acquity Group Ltd. - a digital marketing and technical services provider - was acquired along with other smaller companies that complement and synergize with Accenture's current operations. Acquisitions are likely to enable Accenture to enter new markets, diversify and broaden its product portfolio and maintain its leading position. Moreover, the company's continued acquisitions are expected to be a good contributor to its revenue stream.Also, Accenture has a strong balance sheet. As of May 31, 2014, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $4.05 billion and long-term debt of $26.5 million, bringing the net cash position to $4.02 billion, higher than $3.65 billion (net cash) in the previous quarter. This enables the company to look for strategic acquisitions and invest in growth initiatives. Strong operating cash flow has helped Accenture to return cash through regular quarterly dividend payment and share repurchases.Nonetheless, revenue decline in Accenture's Consulting business remains a concern. In fiscal 2013, consulting revenues decreased 1% on a year-over-year basis due to lower revenues across its five operating groups as clients continue to defer or reduce investments in consulting services. Although the company's consulting revenues recorded a modest increase in the last reported quarter, we will be more constructive if this phenomenon continues in the forthcoming quarters as well.Moreover, Accenture's market share and revenues necessarily depend on client relationships and the number of contracts it secures. This, along with the limited scope for product differentiation, makes the renegotiation of large contracts extremely important. As a result, competition from major players like Genpact Limited (  ), Cognizant Technology Solutions (  ) and Infosys (  ) is a constant pressure.Currently, Accenture has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Moreover, it is worth noting that NVIDIA has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the four preceding quarters with an average positive surprise of 38.2%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.The strength in gaming and high-end notebook GPUs helped NVIDIA to report better-than-expected first quarter results. Moreover, both the top and bottom lines increased on a year-over- year basis, primarily due to lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenues and higher growth in GeForce, GTX, desktop and notebook GPU sales.Recently, Google selected NVIDIA's Tegra K1 processor to power its Project Tango tablet development kit, which will help developers build applications featuring 3-D mapping and sensing capabilities.

Moreover, increased traction in the mobile business is an added positive for the company.For the second quarter of 2014, Groupon forecasts revenues in the range of $725.0 million to $775.0 million. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $761.0 million, which is on the higher end of management's guided range.However, stiff competition, combined with a volatile macroeconomic environment, remains the major headwind. We believe that continued investments aimed at enlarging merchant base will hurt profitability in the near term.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Groupon is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Groupon has a -50.00% ESP. That is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at a loss of 6 cents per share while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is lower at a loss of 4 cents. Groupon's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) when combined with a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Cognizant Technology Solutions (  ), with an Earnings ESP of +5.08% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Super Micro Computer (  ), with an Earnings ESP of +2.78% and a Zacks Rank #1.Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.

Moreover, it is worth noting that Symantec has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the four preceding quarters with an average positive surprise of 19.2%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.In the last reported quarter, Symantec delivered modest results. Revenues across all its segments declined due to lower-than-expected demand. However, restructuring benefits aided operating margins, which in turn supported net income.Continued investments to launch new and innovative products could also impact margins in the near term. Nonetheless, investments in growth areas such as Enterprise backup, Storage Management and Security businesses are expected to drive the company's long-term prospective. Moreover, Symantec's restructuring initiatives and share buyback plans are expected to support the company's bottom line.Nonetheless, competition from other enterprise security providers and the uncertainty over PC sales remain the headwinds.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Symantec will beat earnings this quarter.

In the first quarter, Monthly Average Users (MAUs) increased 25.0% from the year-ago quarter to 255 million. User interaction in the form of favorites and reTweets improved more than 26.0% year over year in the last quarter.We believe that the acquisitions of Cover, Gnip, TapCommerce and Namo Media will expand Twitter's product portfolio and monetization capability. The Omnicom partnership deal will boosts its status as an advertising platform and the integration with MoPub will drive top line in the near term.Twitter's recent foray into e-Commerce by testing the 'Buy Now' button and the acquisition of CardSpring is a significant positive, in our view.

PureApps' EPM solutions are based on  's (  ) Hyperion Enterprise Performance Management and Business Analytics products. PureApps' clientele includes Bacardi - Martini Ltd., British American Tobacco and Carpetright plc. With this acquisition, Accenture will gain a foothold in the U.K. EPM market and expand its capabilities in other European countries as well.EPM solutions are in demand today because of the need to increase operational efficiencies. They are also used to forecast business results. These features help the companies to strategize and implement critical business decisions to cope with rapidly evolving markets.Incidentally, Accenture's last acquisition of Enkitec on May 15 expanded its expertise in Oracle engineered systems. Enkitec was an Oracle Platinum partner and specialized in delivering Oracle database technologies and engineering systems to its clients.Thus, the PureApps acquisition will enable the company to build its expertise leveraging Oracle's systems. Accenture is also building its client base, which has helped it to record strong bookings and witness robust growth across insurance, banking and healthcare segments.It is worth noting that Accenture resorts to strategic acquisitions to diversify its offerings and expand its operating markets. A strong cash balance ($3.63 billion) and operating cash flow ($292.4 million in second-quarter 2014) enable the company to engage in frequent acquisitions.

(Symbol: CTSH) has taken over the #144 spot from Travelers Companies Inc (Symbol: TRV), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true \"apples-to-apples\" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (Symbol: CTSH), the market cap is now $30.24 billion, versus Travelers Companies Inc (Symbol: TRV) at $30.15 billion.Below is a chart of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. versus Travelers Companies Inc plotting their respective size rank within the S&P 500 over time (CTSH plotted in blue; TRV plotted in green):    Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of CTSH vs. TRV:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and \"tosses out\" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller \"up-and-comers\" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at  find value to putting together these rankings daily.At the closing bell, CTSH is up about 1.8%, while TRV is up about 1% on the day Wednesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" is set to report first-quarter 2014 results on May 7.

Accenture has been steadily gaining traction in its Outsourcing business backed by the increased demand for technology that can improve operating efficiencies and lower costs.The improvement was mainly due to the growing demand for its outsourcing solutions in Europe. Enterprises from Europe are increasingly offshoring jobs to cut costs, improve operational efficiency and reduce headcount. This bodes well for the company as deal wins will translate into higher revenues.Moreover, Accenture's strong balance sheet enables the company to look for strategic acquisitions and invest in growth initiatives. As of Feb 28, 2014, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $3.68 billion and long-term debt of $26.3 million, bringing the net cash position to $3.65 billion. Additionally, Accenture's strong operating cash flow has helped it to return cash through regular quarterly dividend and share repurchases.Nonetheless, Accenture's market share and revenues necessarily depend on client relationships and the number of contracts it secures. This, along with the limited scope for product differentiation makes the renegotiation of large contracts extremely important.As a result, competition from strong companies like  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) is a constant pressure.Additionally, dismal performance by Accenture's consulting business remains a concern. Revenues from the consulting business comprise more than 50% of the total revenue.

In addition, the company had a sound and flexible balance sheet with ample liquidity to capitalize on potential acquisition opportunities and fuel its top-line growth. Infosys has a pristine balance sheet, with more than $4.0 billion in cash & cash equivalents and no debt.Driven by the strong top-line growth in the second quarter, management increased its revenue guidance for fiscal 2014. Revenues are expected to increase in the range of 9% to 10% versus 6% to 10% anticipated earlier.Recently, Infosys under its Infosys McCamish Systems LLC wing has launched an innovative customer service platform named VPAS Customer Service Work Desk (CSWD) to leverage its BPO business by enhancing operational excellence and customer experience.Furthermore, its co-founder Narayana Murthy, who rejoined in Jun 2013, outlined some strategies to bring the company back on its profit-making track. The initiatives set by Murthy primarily focus on winning large deals while maintaining market share through a cost-optimization strategy. In addition, Murthy has also emphasized on improving employee morale through efficient rewards to retain human capital.Over the last 7 days, earnings estimates for Infosys did not show any upward or downward revision for 2013. Although there is a lacuna of estimate revisions, we envision an uptrend for the stock backed by its strong growth potential.Some other favorably-ranked stocks operating in the industry include  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ). All three stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["onsulting and outsourcing services provider,  (  ), is slated to release fiscal first-quarter 2014 results on Dec 19, 2013, before market opens. Last quarter, it posted a positive earnings surprise of 1.00%. Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Increasing focus on the outsourcing business, operating cost optimization, new bookings and continued return to shareholders are expected to remain the quarter's positives. Moreover, Accenture's strategic acquisitions will definitely diversify its service and product offerings and expand its operating markets. Accenture is regularly enhancing its client base, which has helped it to record strong bookings and witness robust growth across insurance, banking and healthcare segments.However, the challenging macroeconomic environment and constricted spending from clients could pose headwinds for Accenture. Moreover, competition from  (  ) and  (  ) are expected to remain the headwinds, going forward.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Accenture will beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at $1.09. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement.Another company that you may want to consider as our model shows that it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the imminent future is: (  ), with Earnings ESP of +10.26% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photoThere are two keys to Frank Caruso's investment strategy.First, the lead manager of $2 billion AllianceBernstein Large Cap Growth directs his team to seek what he calls dynamic gaps.Those gaps are big differences between how fast Caruso's team expects a stock's earnings to grow and Wall Street's consensus expectation.The second key is where Caruso has his team look for that gap: four to five years out.Caruso is adamant about avoiding a focus on the near term.This approach had the fund up 32.46% this year through Nov. 30. That topped 78% of its large-cap growth peers, which averaged 29.96%. The S&P 500 was up 29.12%.Over the past three years the fund's average annual gain is 18.14% vs. 15.70% for its peer group and 17.73% for the big-cap bogey.Caruso, age 57, discussed his investment process with IBD from his office in Manhattan. How does your search for leading stocks differ from other growth investors'? We think of equities generally (in terms of) a combination of growth and capital returns in the form of dividends and share buybacks, which support the valuations of equities over a long period.And we take a long-duration approach to investment opportunities. But most growth investors are dangerously focused on the moment, growth in the short term. We try to exploit this phenomenon where not a lot of analytical work is being done four to five years out. Give me some examples that show how your tack works, please. In the spring of 2012,Chipotle Mexican Grill (  ) missed a couple of months of sales estimates and the stock was crushed. It went from about 440 to 230 a share. But our research let us be marginal buyers in that lurch. We were confident in the caliber of management. We bought a distressed stock in a great long-term franchise (between May and July 2012 between 380 and 400). Later, they began to execute and sales improved. (We added to our position) through the beginning of October 2012 at prices between 284 and 330. IsCognizant Technology Solutions (  ) another example? You added a big chunk to your stake a few quarters ago. They have a great core competency in technologies that are increasingly desired by clients: in the cloud and in mobility. It's been growing in the high teens and low 20s for years. It has no debt, and it has excess cash.After putting up a strong quarter, they got caught up in the immigration debate. They rely on a lot of foreign visas to conduct their business. The stock went down about 25% in a heartbeat.That was an opportunity for us to reload. In the spring of 2012 we started initiating. The stock broke down into the high 50s (from 78). We met with Cognizant managers for three or four hours, and we left convinced they still had a great business and plan. The stock moved higher. The immigration debate percolated, and we bought in the 60s. Now it's in the 90s. Are you looking for investment opportunities created by the prospect of the Federal Reserve tapering its bond buys? We don't try to overthink the macro environment. So our marching orders to our analysts are to focus on company fundamentals.But when (Fed Chairman Ben) Bernanke started the tapering discussion, after having underperformed the broad market and value in particular the prior 12 to 15 months, growth securities started to do well. So the market response to tapering seems to have catalyzed a shift on the margin to growth stocks. Is that because growth stocks tend to have more foreign exposure? Yes, growth stocks generally have a little more exposure to foreign earnings growth. And U.S. value stocks have more exposure to, let's say, earnings that are fueled by Federal Reserve stimulus steps. This is speculation on my part, but the discussion regarding tapering might auger well for future growth stock performance. Computer services, software and systems are your largest category of holdings at 12.36% of assets. Why do you expect good things from them? Cognizant is one, with close to a 4% weighting. The portfolio is built around companies like that andGoogle (  ). We think ofPriceline (  ) as a service company. Some people think of it as a technology company.Ansys (  ) is an engineering simulation software company. People think of this as a company that benefits from innovation.In the old days, you had a team of engineers design a new product, build mockups, then software would run calculations that tested stress characteristics. It was on the tail end of the innovation. And it might take weeks to run those simulations.Today you can run millions of simulations before you even get to the real engineering side of things. Biotech is your second-largest industry group, with 5.45% of assets. Why are you focused there? Biotech came out of a very long, severe stock price underperformance. Now we're seeing far greater pipeline productivity emerging from a couple of leaders. We've centered our investments onCelgene (CELG),Biogen (BIIB) andGilead (GILD). Each is in a different area of disease management.Biogen has been mostly a multiple sclerosis story. They've come to market with a new oral medicine called Tecfidera, which has experienced one of the most unbelievably successful product launches in pharmacology history. But (investors) have been so focused on MS that they haven't paid attention to some of the products that are in development.There is a hemophilia product (Eloctate) that we expect to launch in mid-next year. It has the opportunity to take share fromBaxter (BAX) and drive growth. And there's upside left for Tecfidera for a long time to come.Gilead is basically an HIV and hepatitis C story. It has new product launches on the horizon. We expect Gilead to remain dominant in HIV in the near- to midterm. Their hepatitis C portfolio is starting to contribute meaningfully to corporate growth.Celgene is a multiple myeloma story, a cancer story. We see expanding use of the marketplace.All of these companies were coming off of pretty conservative valuations for the kind of growth we envision them experiencing for the next couple of years. Why did you trim yourFacebook (FB) stake recently? You could not have foreseen the pullback that began in mid-October. The stock had an amazing run after reporting Q2 earnings. They demonstrated great acceleration in their mobility business, which people got excited about. The stock doubled in a short time.We made a meaningful reduction in exposure in that euphoria. It had become close to 3% of the portfolio. So we cut our position roughly in half. It is roughly 1.5% today.Their 20% fall? The stock had gone up the day they reported earnings. Then management talked about the need to spend more on investing in people and their product. A lot of highly valued, high-growth companies have seen similar price corrections.I'm comfortable owning the stock. At the right price, we're getting back in. Michael Kors (KORS) is relatively new for you. Are you concerned that earnings-per-share growth has sharply decelerated in recent quarters? We're always concerned about decelerating growth rates. But Kors' decline is to a less-than-extraordinary level. That's still better than a lot of companies. The stock is reasonably valued for the kind of growth we envision. They have opportunities in Europe and elsewhere overseas. Kors is seen as differentiated here and overseas. Any surprise toStarbucks' (SBUX) accelerating EPS growth?Caruso: No. They're just an unbelievable company. They're one of the few that has been able to consistently reinvent themselves. They've done a brilliant job of expanding their product offerings in small footprint stores, in being first to market in using new technologies to connect to their customers and their rewards programs are best in their class. Precision Castparts (PCP) is up this year, but you've done some trimming. What are your concerns? They are persistent in acquiring businesses that let them leverage their own infrastructure. And they're an important supplier toBoeing (BA) on the 787. They generate about $10 million of content on every 787 that Boeing ships. Part of our reduction is that we own both companies. If we sell, it probably will be out of Boeing. Precision has lagged Boeing, so Precision has more upside. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is way down this year. Yet you've added to your position in some recent quarters. Are you still optimistic?Caruso: This has been the most disappointing stock in the portfolio in 2013. The interest we had was centered on the uniqueness of their business. There are no competitors at their scale. Robotic surgery is here to stay and will continue to grow.Procedure growth continues to expand at a midteen clip year over year. The issue with execution relates to installation sales, which has slowed, especially in the U.S.We expect a couple more tough quarters. Procedure growth will continue in the 16% area. There's no competition. Unbelievably high margins, big share buyback, no debt. Hopefully, it will be a contrary growth stock that recovers. Are you concerned thatLinkedIn's (LNKD) EPS growth has slowed for two quarters? They've brought a new (advertising product for mobile devices) to market. It will help their growth rate re-accelerate into next year. Like we did with Facebook, we made decent sales in the summer on the market euphoria around this stock. We're more interested in finding a price to re-engage LinkedIn than Facebook.We think of it as a core holding, a business that's tough to replicate due to their network effect and LinkedIn managers who think of this as a business and want it to be profitable. It's a good business that is richly valued. It will grow into that. So getting the entry and trim points right is important. Noble Energy's (NBL) EPS growth has soared the past two quarters. But tumbling crude oil prices have doused energy producer stocks' spark lately. This stock has pulled back about 10% since Oct. 30. Why stick with it? Noble is one of the best-positioned energy companies by way of its fracking inventory. Overseas -- in Israel and Africa -- they have unbelievable reserves. And they are really good operators, really focused on creating value.Energy firms are more volatile than what we typically engage, but this company's assets are special.We've seen a reduction in underlying commodity prices, so we would welcome an opportunity to buy some of this back, make it larger in the portfolio. It's not quite at a point where we would start buying it back. What's the biggest change you've made since taking this fund's helm in February 2012? Basically, our perception of growth is linked to a company's ability to create long-term value. So our focus is further forward than many other investors' focus is. It's more on the economics of business and profitability than on the hunt for earnings growth, which is sometimes very episodic. We're still looking for opportunities in large-cap growth. But we're focused on the longer term. What was the fund's prior time horizon?Caruso: I can't say, but it was probably more consistent with most growth managers'. Annual turnover in growth portfolios is often 100% to 150%. We're trying to do closer to 50%. We want great franchises that have the ability to win over a very long time. I tell my analysts I want them to understand how companies are competitively differentiated. I don't want them spending their time trying to anticipate when a bad business is a good stock.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) has been selected as the lead contractor for the development of the Obamacare enrollment website. Accenture will replace CGI Federal, a subsidiary of  (  ), which previously developed healthcare.gov for The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The initial phase of the contract is valued at approximately $45.0 millionThe decision to discontinue CGI's services was primarily due to error messages and slow speeds, which marred the website in its initial days. Moreover, the disruption hampered the process of completing applications online. As a result, insurance sign-ups were delayed in 36 U.S. states, which created a political crisis.The federal government has reportedly not renewed the CGI contract, which is set to expire on Feb 28, 2014 and had an option to extend work for another 18 months.Accenture's services will help the federal government to gear up for the second open enrollment period due in Oct 2014. Its technical expertise will be utilized to offer extensive support for the marketplace application, enrollment and eligibility functions, and various other processes related to enrollment.Accenture will also develop large scale public websites to offer improved healthcare.gov services and deliver critical health information to a larger number of healthcare providers in a cost-effective manner.Accenture's rich industry expertise is expected to enable it to manage the grand scale of the Obamacare program. Of late, the company has also been able to improve its customer base, bookings and performance in the insurance, banking and healthcare sectors. This also reflects strong demand for Accenture's services, which is in turn favorable for its long-term growth prospects.However, increasing competition from companies like  (  ) and  (  ), a strained spending environment and exposure to Europe remain concerns.Currently, Accenture has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["t seems IT bellwether  (  ) is up from its deep slumber after a streak of disappointing results over the last couple of years. In third quarter fiscal 2014, earnings were up 8% year over year and a solid 21% on a sequential basis. Investors' confidence is also getting back on track as reflected by a steady uptrend in share price.Thanks to Executive Chairman of the Board Narayana Murthy, who came out of his retirement to take charge of the stranded ship amid declining top and bottom lines, lower margins, high attrition and loss of businesses to competitors such as  . (  ),  (  ) and Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys have regained its lost Midas touch.In Jun 2011, Narayana Murthy formally resigned from the executive position when Infosys was at its peak. With his exit, the company seemed to loose its focus and in a span of six to eight quarters, Infosys witnessed drop in revenues. Low employee morale, a confused 3.0 strategy and flawed PSPD (predictability, sustainability, profitability, de-risking) model further made matters worse.Infosys suffered badly due to leadership issues as it could not frame a proper succession plan after Murthy. The company looked divided and locked in the trap of  , whereby it lost ground to rivals on pricing.When other companies resorted to aggressive reduction in budgets to reduce costs, Infosys was stuck in the pre-recession period. This had a domino effect on the company's contract wins, leading to lower top and bottom line, ultimately resulting in lower profits. Infosys even began to offer revenue guidance in the range of 6% to 10% which was way below the industry growth projection of 12% to 14%. issues were also hurting Infosys dearly. The new CEO after Murthy's exit failed to recreate the magic and Infosys was missing the focus, clarity and decisiveness in policy making. Within a span of less than two years, Infosys was forced to bring the founder back to the helm to retain the shareholders' and investors' confidence.Just to give an excerpt of waning investor confidence, share prices of the company fell by approximately 29.7% from Jun 1, 2011 to Jun 1, 2013.With Murthy back on board, share prices had an immediate jump of almost 9%, leading to a two month-high. Murthy himself has given a time-frame of three years to revive the fortunes of the company with a more decisive and focused approach - all this for virtually no monetary compensation!After reassuming office, Murthy focused on winning large deals while maintaining the market share. Secondly, he addressed the high operating costs of the company through a cost-optimization strategy and decided to retrench non-performing highly paid employees who were perceived to add no significant value. At the same time, Murthy emphasized on improving employee morale through efficient rewards for avid performers.Murthy's path is not that easy to tread on. The challenges confronting this dynamic leader include a fast revival of sagging sales, maintaining market share with competitive pricing, boosting employee morale amid high attritions. In addition, the recent  passed by the U.S. government on restriction on the number of visas it can apply for employees is another major challenge. This could increase the operating expense of the company, as a significant number of employees working in the U.S. will burden its already-stretched coffers.Despite all these issues, Murthy has maintained his composure and has emphasized that Infosys will continue to grow on its traditional path by focusing on plain vanilla services which are increasingly being commoditized. Furthermore, he intends to strategically utilize the dry powder of the company for healthy organic and inorganic growth.Meanwhile, companies like  (  ), Cognizant and  (  ) have strengthened their presence in India. These have intensified competition in the domestic market as well. Infosys, therefore, will have to provide a viable advantage to potential employees to attract lucrative human capital.Murthy's comeback has created a positive vibe for Infosys that was staring down the barrel. The company now looks more focused and has revived in the last 9 months giving a share price return of 49.6%. The second time around, Murthy is all set to take his company to the zenith of the IT industry.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) reported first-quarter fiscal 2014 earnings per share of $1.15, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.09. Earnings increased 8.6% from the year-ago quarter attributable to higher revenues, operating income, lower share count and favorable tax rate.Accenture's first-quarter net revenues increased 1.9% on a year-over-year basis to $7.36 billion and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.23 billion. Net revenue also was at the high end of management's guided range of $7.0 billion to $7.3 billion, primarily aided by higher-than-expected Outsourcing revenues (up 5.0% on a year-over-year basis to $3.42 billion), which more than offset Accenture's Consulting revenues, down 1% year over year to $3.94 billion.Among the operating segments, Health & Public Services revenues increased 5.0% from the year-ago quarter to $1.23 billion while revenues from Financial Services were up 2.0% from the year-ago quarter to $1.60 billion.Accenture's revenues from Products of $1.80 billion increased 6.0% while revenues from Resources remained flat on a year-over-year basis at $1.32 billion.

Consulting bookings and Outsourcing bookings for the quarter were $4.3 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively.First-quarter gross margins increased 50 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 33.3%, primarily due to higher revenue base.Operating expenses increased 3.1% from the year-ago quarter due to a 6.9% increase in sales and marketing expenses. The company accounted reorganization benefits of $18.1 million. As a percentage of net revenue, operating expenses expanded 30 bps to 18.5% from the year-ago quarter.Accenture's operating income increased 4.0% from the year-ago quarter to $1.09 billion, while margins expanded 30 bps to 14.8%. Accenture reported net income of $800.9 million or $1.15 per share which increased from $757.8 million or $1.06 per share.Accenture exited the quarter with total cash balance of $4.53 billion versus $5.63 billion in the preceding quarter. Accenture's long-term debt balance at the end of the first quarter was $25.9 million.Operating cash flow was $181 million in the reported quarter compared with $1.50 billion in the prior quarter while free cash flow for the quarter was $122.0 million.Consistent with Accenture's policy of returning cash to its shareholders, the company repurchased 9.7 million shares for a total value of $722.0 million during the first quarter. The activity included 8 million shares repurchased in the open market. Accenture paid dividends worth $630.0 million.For the second quarter of 2014, Accenture expects net revenues between $6.95 billion and $7.25 billion. The company did not provide any update on fourth-quarter earnings per share.The company modified its guidance for fiscal 2014. Although, Accenture expects net revenue to grow in the range of 2.0% to 6.0% in local currency, the company has upped its earnings per share outlook from the range of $4.42-$4.54 to $4.44-$4.56. The company expects new bookings in the range of $32 billion-$35 billion.During fiscal 2014, the company expects its operating margins to range between 14.3% and 14.5%. In fiscal 2014, the company expects operating cash flow in the range of $3.6 billion-$3.9 billion while free cash flow in the range of $3.2 billion-$3.5 billion.Accenture's first-quarter results reflect its increasing focus on the Outsourcing business, operating cost optimization, new bookings and continuous return of shareholders' value. However, its consulting business was a bit of a disappointment.Improved bookings growth and solid performance across insurance, banking and healthcare segments reflects strong demand for Accenture's services, boosting long-term growth prospects.

Extended-Hours Dollar Volume: $380,528,594Earnings Sensitivity (up or down): 4.4%Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (  ) is due to issue its quarterly earnings report before market open today. Given its history, traders can expect very active trading in the upcoming Premarket session immediately following the company's release of its quarterly earnings. An analysis of historical premarket and after-hours trading activity and liquidity conditions in CTSH following an earnings release indicates that the price change in the extended hours is likely to be of significant value in forecasting additional price movement in the following regular session.Analysts at MT Newswires have tracked how CTSH's stock price has reacted to quarterly earnings events the past both in the after-hours and following regular session. The result of that study is below.Over the last year, when shares of CTSH rose in the extended-hours session in reaction to its earnings announcement, history shows that 25% of the time (1 out of the last 4 quarters) the stock posted additional gains in the following regular session by an average of 1.40%.Over the last year, when shares of CTSH dropped in the extended-hours in reaction to its earnings announcement, there is limited evidence to suggest a follow-through in the same direction the next day.Our analysis of over a decade of company specific earnings related news and price data on over 5,000 US companies demonstrates that earnings event related trading opportunities can exist for those trading in the after-hours and premarket sessions. Certain stocks demonstrate a historical tendency to either underprice or overreact to earnings news in the extended-hours (the time when companies typically release earnings) relative to the following regular session close.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n a bid to expand its capabilities in Europe,  (  ) is set to acquire ClientHouse, a provider of cloud-based services.

It makes sense. Value stocks tend to be more risky -- that's why their valuations tend to be much lower than those of high-growth stocks. So in bear markets, when fear and pessimism reign, those perceived riskier plays tend to get hit harder. Then, when the fears subside, they are the first to bounce back.When you get deeper into a bull market, the low-hanging, beaten-down value plays have rebounded, and investors tend to look more at fundamentals and quality. It's no surprise then that, with the bull market now more than four years old, my Martin Zweig-based Guru Strategy -- which runs a stock through a variety of strict earnings growth tests -- has been one of my best performers in 2013. But what has been a bit of a surprise is the magnitude of its gains. While the S&P 500 is up about 23% year -to-date, my 10-stock Zweig-based portfolio has gained about 62%.Zweig, who passed away earlier this year, was a legend in the investing world. He made his mark in a number of ways, from predicting the 1987 market crash just days before it occurred, to pioneering the put/calls ratio, to coining the phrase \"Don't fight the Fed\", to owning what at one time was the most expensive apartment in New York City (a $70 million penthouse).While I never met Zweig, he impacted me personally through his book Winning on Wall Street. In it, Zweig laid out his strategy for picking growth stock winners, a strategy that formed the basis for my \"Growth Investor\" model. The approach looks at numerous criteria, most of which focus on earnings. They include: Earnings per share should be growing by at least 15% over the long term (I use an average of the three-, four-, and five-year EPS growth rates to determine a long-term rate); a growth rate over 30% is exceptional. EPS growth for the current quarter (vs. the same quarter last year) should be greater than the average growth for the previous three quarters (vs. the respective three quarters from a year ago). EPS growth in the current quarter also should be greater than the long-term growth rate. These criteria made sure that Zweig wasn't getting in late on a stock that had great long-term growth numbers, but which was coming to the end of its growth run. Earnings per share should have increased in each year of the past five-year period; EPS should also have grown in each of the past four quarters (vs. the respective year-ago quarters). Zweig wanted earnings growth to be sustainable. That meant it was driven by revenue growth, not cost-cutting or other non-sales measures. It also meant that it wasn't driven by large amounts of debt. My Zweig model requires a firm's long-term revenue growth to be at least 85% of EPS growth (or at least 30% a year, since that is still a very strong revenue growth rate), and it wants sales growth for the most recent quarter (vs. the year-ago quarter) to be greater than the previous quarter's sales growth rate (vs. the year-ago quarter). It also targets stocks whose debt/equity ratios are lower than their industry average.Be aware that Zweig was willing to pay a premium for strong growth, but only to a point. The model I base on his writings requires a firm's P/E ratio to be no greater than three times the market average (currently about 16), and never greater than 43 (no matter what the market average).Zweig also relied a good amount on technical factors to adjust how much of his portfolio he put into stocks. But over the years, I've found that using only the quantitative, fundamental-based criteria Zweig outlined in his book can produce very strong results. My Zweig-inspired 10-stock portfolio has returned 208.8%, or 11.6% per year, since its July 2003 inception, while the S&P 500 has gained just 75.1%, or 5.6% per year (through Oct. 24).If you believe, like me, that the bull market has more room to run, then the Zweig-based approach could be a good one to continue to focus on, given where we are in the bull run. Here are a handful of stocks that it's currently high on. As always, you should invest in stocks like these as part of a broader, diversified portfolio. This New Jersey-based IT and business process outsourcing company ($26 billion market cap) has been growing EPS at an impressive 24.4% rate over the long term, and that's been supported by strong revenue growth of 28.5%. The firm also has no long-term debt and trades for a reasonable (given its growth) 23 times earnings. Who says the Great Recession meant the death of the consumer? This trendy clothing designer/retailer ($16 billion market cap) is proof it didn't, as it has grown EPS at a 110% pace over the long term. Sales growth hasn't been quite as strong but it's still been impressive, at 54%. The firm has upped EPS in each year of the past half-decade, and also has no long-term debt. This San Diego-based tech firm introduced CDMA technology back in the late 1980s. Today, its technology is used in cell phones around the world, and recent growth has been strong. Its long-term growth rate of 21.2% accelerated to an average of 25.9% in the three quarters before last quarter, and then jumped to 30.4% last quarter. Sales growth also accelerated last quarter, rising to 35% (from 24%). And the firm had no long-term debt. All of that for a price -- 17.8 times EPS -- not much higher than the market average. This Pennsylvania-based sports and fitness retailer has been expanding and now has nearly 550 Dick's stores and more than 80 Golf Galaxy stores across the United States. The firm ($6.5 billion market cap) has grown earnings at a 19.1% pace over the long-term. That accelerated to 55.8% last quarter. Dick's also has a debt/equity ratio of less than 1% ( versus the specialty retail industry average of more than 70%), and at less than 20 times earnings, its price is quite reasonable. Founded as a workers' compensation insurance firm, this New York City-based company has expanded into a multi-national property and casualty insurer. It specializes in coverage for small businesses.Amtrust's long-term growth is just shy of the Zweig-based model's target, at 14.4%. But that growth has been accelerating -- it was 54.5% in the three quarters before last, and then jumped again to more than 96% last quarter --and it had been supported by strong revenue growth. In fact, while financial firms often engineer strong earnings out of mediocre revenues, AFSI 's long-term revenue growth (32%) more than doubles its EPS growth, and that accelerated to more than 65% last quarter.

The company experienced solid growth in the Americas, but sales were weaker than expected in Europe and Asia Pacific.Stock-based compensation expense rose 56% year-over-year to $8.6 million. If you exclude this, EPS actually came in ahead of consensus, but this was due in part to a large tax benefit.Analysts revised their estimates significantly lower for both 2013 and 2014 after QlikTech's weak Q3 results. This sent the stock to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).You can see the big drop in consensus estimates in the 'Price & Consensus' chart:The 2013 Zacks Consensus Estimate is now $0.01, down from $0.17 before the Q3 report.

The company acquired a French financial services consulting company, Equinox to enhance its consulting services, followed by the acquisition of a unit of ValueSource NV.Founded in 2004, Equinox provides service to investment banking, retail banking, insurance and asset management. Equinox's expertise in regulatory consulting that spans Basel III, Solvency II, EMIR/Dodd-Frank, FATCA and MiFID will boost Cognizant's consulting portfolio. Moreover, Equinox's strength in strategy consulting, organization and operations management, change management, and HR consulting will also improve the company's competitive position going forward.Lately, Cognizant has been scouting for companies with deep consulting experience.We believe that the acquisition of Equinox will fulfill that requirement. Cognizant management expects approximately $40 million of annualized revenues from this acquisition. Post acquisition, around 160 consulting professionals from Equinox will join Cognizant.Meanwhile, Cognizant also announced that it will acquire a subsidiary of Belgium-based integrated bank insurance group ValueSource NV as part of a five-year contract with the group.Acquisitions have been a key growth catalyst for Cognizant over the years. The company has made seven acquisitions since 2010, which includes three consulting firms.In the past few years, Cognizant outpaced its Tier-1 peers such as TCS  (  ) and  (  ) on the back of its exposure to fast-growing verticals, like Financial Services and Healthcare.A key strategy of Cognizant is to align its business with vertical industries, such as financial services, healthcare & life sciences, retail, manufacturing and logistics. The company has gained deep industry expertise and knowledge of the domain by acquiring and partnering some leading companies across the globe.This is a good strategy for the firm to grow over the long run. Additionally, we believe that Cognizant, which competes with the likes of  (  ) and Wipro, remains well diversified in key verticals and emerging markets of social, mobile, analytics, consulting and cloud, which will continue to boost its top line.However, the increasing cost of acquisition will take some time to recover. Moreover, increasing headcount may hurt profitability in the near-term. Additionally, the uncertainty surrounding the new immigration reform bill is expected to remain a major overhang on Cognizant going forward.Currently, Cognizant has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Not all investors are the same. Therefore, not all investors share the same goals and objectives. Consequently, there are numerous strategies and investing methods available to choose from. Moreover, it also goes without saying that the investment strategy that's right for me may not be right for you. For that reason, it's imperative that each individual looks for the strategy that is right for their own individual goals, objectives, risk tolerances and status. By status, I'm referring to how many years you have left before retirement.Additionally, the time the individual investor has left in front of them prior to retirement may be one of the most important considerations regarding what type of approach or strategy they should embrace. Although many advisers like to offer tidy rules-of-thumb about how this decision should be made, I believe that common sense and personal preference should be the driving forces. With investing, one size rarely fits all.For example, common sense would dictate it is logical that younger investors with more time available could justify taking on more risk. Therefore, high-growth stocks might be appropriate investments during their accumulation phase because achieving the highest total return possible might make the most sense. However, achieving higher returns usually comes with taking on higher risk. Consequently, a very conservative investor even with lots of time in front of them may not possess the risk tolerance to go for total return exclusive of dividends.In my most recent article titled  I introduced the notion that portfolios should be built to meet the specific needs of the individual investor building it. In that article, I utilized an example of a dividend growth portfolio that generated a 3% yield that would meet a hypothetical retiree's specific income needs. In other words, I focused on income over total return. With this article, I will change that focus to investing for the highest total return possible during the accumulation phase.I typically write about dividend growth investing because personally I believe it is the most appropriate strategy for investors of my age and status. However, I didn't always see it that way, especially when I was younger. My early investing career started out with a hunger for maximum total return or growth. In those days, I was willing to take on more risk, but I never allowed myself to be reckless. Throughout my career, I've always believed that you can pay too much for even the best of companies, and that view included investing in fast-growing businesses. Because then and now, I believe you make your money on the buy side. Moreover, that principle applies to conservative and aggressive investments alike.Nevertheless, even though my temperament for taking risk has diminished, I must admit that even today I appreciate the power and performance of a high-growth stock. Years of study and analysis have shown me that investing for high-growth offers rewards that can be orders of magnitude beyond what a blue-chip dividend paying stalwart could ever provide. Yes, there is more risk, but if approached properly the total returns from investing in high-growth stocks can be incredible. Therefore, I believe I owe it to regular readers to at least introduce them to just how profitable investing for growth can be.Although there may be many definitions of what a growth stock is, my own definition is rather simple and straightforward. For me to consider a company a growth stock, or even a great growth stock, I focus on above-average earnings growth. When investing for growth, my minimum threshold for earnings growth is 15% per annum or better. On the other hand, when looking for growth I will often search for a minimum of 20% per annum earnings growth, because the faster - the better - to my way of thinking.My position is based on the principle that earnings represent the ultimate driver of future return. Moreover, this applies equally to dividend paying stocks as it does to growth stocks. After all, the primary source of dividends is clearly earnings. On the other hand, assuming the investor invests at a reasonable valuation, earnings growth is also the primary source of capital appreciation in the long run.At this point, many readers may be thinking that earnings growth of 20% or better might be unrealistic or even unattainable. Admittedly, companies that grow earnings at 20% or better are rare, but frankly, not as rare as many might think. Growth of this nature is usually found with younger and even smaller companies, but not always. However, as a general rule, younger smaller companies are where the fastest growth is usually found. Furthermore, investors must understand and realize that achieving high-growth rates over a sustained period of time is quite difficult.I will discuss the risks associated with investing in high-growth stocks in more detail later in the article. However, at this point I would like to share some observations about investing in high growth stocks that I feel are both interesting and important. As regular readers of mine know, I am a stickler for fair valuation. Personally, I like to refrain from ever investing in any type of company at prices or valuations that I believe exceed what a company is truly worth.On the other hand, one of the great benefits of investing in high-growth stocks is that as long as they are in a high-growth phase, you can pay more than they are worth and still make money. Of course, if you find them at or below True Worth\u2122 value then you can make more money while simultaneously taking on less risk. Lower risk and higher return is certainly a desirable objective. However, my point here is that as long as they are growing fast, there is no price or valuation, within reason, that you could pay and not make some money.In order to illustrate my last point regarding how you can even overpay for a great growth stock and still make money I offer the following eight examples of powerful growth stocks that have achieved my historical 20% per annum threshold. However, I would simultaneously like to also provide an admittedly rather melodramatic illustration of just how powerfully rewarding investing in growth stocks can be.To be clear, I ask the reader to participate with me in an exaggerated hypothetical scenario in order to fully experience the power and performance of investing in growth stocks. With each of the following examples I am assuming that an individual investor had $1 million available to invest into a single stock (business) approximately 15 years ago. My purpose in making this rather preposterous assumption is to create a scenario that is analogous with how the majority of the richest people in the world had accumulated their great wealth.Billionaires such as Bill Gates, Larry Ellison, Mark Zuckerberg, Larry Page, Sergei Brin and numerous others all accumulated their great wealth by founding and owning a single business. Therefore, just for the fun and shock value of it, my scenario pretends that an individual, through either luck or smarts, invested the majority of their available wealth ($1 million) into one of the eight single businesses that follow. Of course, I don't recommend this, but the results are rather staggering and illustrative of the power and performance available from investing in growth stocks.The following 15 calendar year  on Starbucks Corp. illustrates how you can overpay for a great growth stock and could still make money. The reader should note that Starbucks's stock price has a legacy of premium valuation (price consistently above the orange earnings justified valuation line). However, due to its fast historical earnings growth rate of 21.8% per annum, even if you purchased Starbucks's stock at its peak price and valuation in 2006 at $40 per share, today's price of $79.05 per share represents a doubling of your money.However, even though that is true, the cost of overpaying for Starbucks would have meant several years of underperformance with some of it severe. By late 2008 the stock price would have fallen to just over $7 a share representing more than an 80% drop from the high. Obviously, few investors could tolerate that level of risk and volatility. On the other hand, those investors that were investing in the business over just buying the stock, and that did have the patience to wait, would have recovered reasonably well. Importantly, I am not advocating that it's okay to overpay for a great business. Instead, I'm simply illustrating that even if you do, you can still make money as long as the business continues to grow long term. This example is simply offered to illustrate the power of a company with a very high rate of earnings growth. In other words, a high rate of earnings growth can even overcome a bad investment decision mistake.The reader might also find it interesting to note by looking at the horizontal change per year (Chg/Yr) column at the bottom of the graph that Starbucks's earnings growth rate accelerated from 21% per annum on average to almost 26% per annum as it came off of the low recessionary earnings base. Also, note that Starbucks initiated a dividend in fiscal year 2010 (the light blue shaded area on top of the orange line).The initiation of the dividend brings me to another interesting aspect of investing for growth when you have plenty of time in front of you before retirement. This is one of many examples of fast-growing companies that eventually begin paying a dividend as their businesses mature. Therefore, this can lead to a natural transition from pure growth to an income-producing investment. In other words, it is possible that growth stocks could provide income when needed as an investor enters retirement years without having to harvest shares.The following 15-year performance results associated with the above graph clearly illustrate the performance power of investing in a fast-growing stock during the accumulation phase. Also take notice of the dividend income stream that kicked in starting in calendar year 2000. Remember, the original investment was $1 million.What follows are seven additional examples of companies that have provided long-term shareholders extraordinary total returns. They are presented in order of lowest to highest total return. My objective in presenting all of these historical examples is not to imply that I invested in all or any of them 15 years ago, although I wish I had. All this exercise is designed to illustrate is simply how powerful the results can be through investing in companies that are growing earnings at very high rates. In other words, these are examples to provide the reader awareness of what a growth stock potentially can offer.Coach represents another example of a high growth stock that is morphing into a dividend payer. However, earnings growth since it went public in 2000 has been exceptional at more than 30% per annum and generated extraordinary shareholder returns in spite of today's low valuation.Even though Coach has only been paying dividends in recent years, it would currently be producing over $400,000 in annual dividends. Moreover, the original $1,000,000 investment is worth over $17,000,000 today.You might not think a store selling agriculture products would be a great growth stock, but Tractor Supply Co. certainly is. However, it's only fair to point out the uncharacteristically high valuation its stock commands today.A $1,000,000 investment 15 years ago would be worth over $50,000,000 today. As another growth stock that morphed into a dividend payer, I think a retiree could live off of its more than substantial current dividend.Depending on how its stock price is acting, Apple Inc. goes from being perhaps the most revered to the most reviled company. However, it is undeniable that this company represents one of the fastest-growing and most powerful growth stocks of modern times. Remember, this is a look at what a hypothetical $1 million investment in Apple 15 years ago would have achieved. What might happen going forward is yet to be determined, but not the subject of this scenario.The shock value that I'm going after with this example is quite extraordinary. Since the beginning of calendar year 1999 Apple Inc. has grown earnings at the extraordinary compound annual rate of 32.2% per annum. Earnings growth of that magnitude is capable of providing extraordinary performance to long-term shareholders of the business.It's important with this example, and the other high-growth stock examples that I will later present, that the focus is on being a shareholder of the business over being a trader of the stock. After all, my hypothetical exercise is derived from the model of people becoming extremely rich by creating and/or owning a single stock.Imagine investing your $1 million nest egg into Apple 15 years ago. Today your investment based on capital appreciation alone would be worth over $50 million. Moreover, as we saw a similar transition to a dividend paying stock with Starbucks earlier, in calendar year 2013 your dividend income would be over $1 million, and possibly growing. Albeit the risks were high, and few investors would have invested their entire nest egg into Apple's stock. However, I daresay there are several Apple shareholders working within the company that have enjoyed similar results.Cognizant Technology Solutions has grown earnings at approximately 39% per annum. Perhaps the most impressive characteristic of this company is not just fast growth, but also how consistently it has increased earnings year after year.Even though Cognizant Technology Solutions has never paid a dividend, a $1,000,000 investment 15 years ago would now be worth over $68,000,000. Just a little bit of harvesting could provide enough cash to live off of for life.You might not think that selling restaurant supplies would be so profitable. However, Middleby Corp. has grown earnings at over 32% per year for the past 15 years with only a minor hiccup in 2009.As incredible as it may seem, a $1,000,000 investment in Middleby 15 years ago is worth over $126,000,000 today. Although the company currently does not pay a dividend, the few dividends it did pay in years past were substantial.Monster Beverage Corp. grew earnings at almost 35% per annum since calendar year 1998. As you will soon see, the results of investing $1 million in this company are even more shocking than what we saw with Apple. However, this is pure unadulterated total return as Monster Beverage does not pay a dividend.If you had invested $1 million in Monster Beverage Corp. on December 31, 1998, today that investment would be worth over $170 million. Again, this company has not, and does not, pay a dividend. However, I believe I could figure out a way to get an adequate amount of income out of a $170 million nest egg.People love their coffee, and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters has exploited this desire on a monumental degree. Earnings growth has averaged over 57% per annum since 1999. Recent price action has been volatile, which could alarm the less than courageous investor.However, for those with the fortitude to have stayed the course, their long-term return would have been staggering. A $1,000,000 investment 15 years ago is worth over $300,000,000 today. With returns like that, a person might forgive a lack of dividends.In order to contrast how powerful the above results are I provide the following on a couple of my favorite blue-chip dividend paying stalwarts. High-growth stocks might not be appropriate choices for conservative investors. However, I believe it would be a huge mistake to not at least consider the potential that high-growth can offer. Frankly, I sleep better at night owning blue-chip dividend paying stocks. On the other hand, an awareness of what other classes of stocks can offer should be a component of every stock investor's knowledge base, at least in my opinion.As an aside, both of the above blue-chip dividend paying stalwarts rather dramatically outperformed the S&P 500. But more importantly, although capital appreciation was stronger with both, I contend it is the attractive income component that is most beneficial to investors in retirement.During a recent conversation about investing strategies with a young colleague of mine, who incidentally favors  over growth stocks, he expressed his primary reason why. My young colleague is concerned that you cannot identify great growth stocks early enough to reap the rewards they offer. Frankly, I believe he is partially, but not totally, correct with his concern. On the other hand, I argued that you don't have to be too early to reap significant rewards from investing in growth stocks, just early enough.Next I went on to share my own personal criteria that I utilized over my career to identify exciting fast-growing companies that I could feel comfortable investing in. My criteria are rather simple and straightforward. Since I do not want to invest too early, I look for companies that have achieved a minimum of 5 years (preferably 10 years) of historical 20% earnings-per-share growth or better. Moreover, I favor consistent earnings growth over cyclical.Furthermore, although I am willing to occasionally examine smaller companies, I gravitate towards companies with a market cap of at least one half billion dollars. Stated more simply, I want companies that have already achieved a reasonable level of success in whatever business they operate in.  ,  In other words, I use these criteria to identify companies that I would be willing to make the effort to research more comprehensively prior to investing in them.As an interesting aside, and to illustrate that you don't have to be too early, there have been many great growth stocks that maintained earnings growth rates of 20% or better for several decades. Well-known large-cap names such as McDonald's (MCD) and Microsoft (MSFT) achieved earnings growth of 30% or better for several decades in a row. Of course, they achieved this phenomenal growth when they were younger and smaller enterprises. But the point I'm making here is that high-growth rates can persist long enough to provide shareholders, willing to take some risk, with extraordinary long-term total returns.To continue with my \"it's risky to invest too early\" theme, I offer the following post-IPO record of Stamps.com Inc. I placed the red circle around the first approximately two years of this company's publicly-traded existence. Clearly, investing in this company at its IPO would have provided very exciting returns over the next six months or so. However, since there were no real earnings to support the stock, price performance during calendar year 2000 presented what might be called an exhilarating collapse. Of course that's assuming you consider a massive loss of money exhilarating.From calendar year 2001 to 2005, the stock presented a decent recovery, but nowhere close to its 1999 and 2000 peaks. The company did pay a substantial special dividend of $3.50 per share in 2004 and again a $2 special dividend in 2010. Finally, the company did begin to show some profit in 2005. However, although Stamps.com Inc. remained profitable for the time frame 2006-2009, earnings did shrink from the company's highest level of profitability in 2006. But then from 2009 to current, business results began to reflect the initial hype originally expected on its IPO debut.Clearly, investing in Stamps.com too early produced average but rather disappointing results considering the initial hype. Long-term owners of this business didn't lose money, but I would believe that initially they all expected much stronger results.On the other hand, investors who waited for profitability to manifest fared much better. From calendar year 2009 to current time, operating earnings grew by over 39% per annum. This was more like it.Consequently, owning the stock during its profitable earnings growth phase was much more rewarding. Even though the S&P 500 has produced remarkably strong results coming out of the Great Recession, the very fast earnings growth of Stamps.com Inc. allowed it to do significantly better. Growth stocks can be very rewarding, but it doesn't always pay to invest too early.With my first 8 high growth stock examples, I reviewed their 15-year historical track records. After such high rates of earnings growth over such an extended period of time, I caution the readers to realize those extraordinary growth rates may be behind them. Most of these companies are still expected to continue growing at above-average rates, but nowhere near what they did in the past. However, not all of them can be bought at attractive valuations today, although a few of them can.Therefore, the key to even the possibility of duplicating similar types of future performance would require finding companies that have the ability to grow earnings very fast in the future. I screened the universe available through the F.A.S.T. Graphs\u2122 screening tool looking for companies that were forecast to grow earnings at a minimum of 15%. However, my primary objective was to identify companies that might be able to grow even faster than that.Moreover, I looked for companies that have produced a high rate of earnings growth for at least the past 5 years. Then I screened my list down to 15 candidates that appear worthy of the necessary comprehensive research effort required before I would ever invest. To be clear, I have not completed that research effort at this time, and only offer the following list as potential high future growth candidates. First I have listed them in order of highest potential future return (based on earnings growth) to lowest as follows.Next, I created a portfolio review based on cap-size and earnings growth rate. As expected, most of these candidates, but not all of them, are small and mid-cap companies.Then, since I do believe in diversification, I created a portfolio review by sector. I was pleased to discover that these 15 potential high growth candidates were spread over 6 different sectors. .\"Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it ... he who doesn't ... pays it.\" Albert EinsteinThe incredible performance results that I shared with my historical examples above were produced by the power of compounding. As investors, we must recognize and realize that when we buy a common stock we are really buying its earnings power. The compounding power of a faster growth rate over a slower growth rate produces geometric rather than arithmetic results.The following compounding table showing growth rates from 5% to 30% over 10 years illustrates how powerful compounding is. The yellow highlights on the table contrast 10% growth versus 20% growth. This illustrates how double the growth rate produces more than double the returns even in as short a time period as 10 years. A little time studying the table should enable you to understand compounding as Albert Einstein suggests above.The following table illustrates what I call the power and protection of diversification. Achieving a 20% annual compound rate of return is an extremely difficult task and achievement. However, throughout this article I have presented a sampling of companies that have achieved that level of growth historically. Moreover, I provided 15 companies where the majority is expected to grow earnings by 20% in the future. I think it would be na\u00efve to expect all 15 of them to achieve the goal.The following table shows that even if 80% of the companies were so wrong that they went to zero (very unlikely) and only 20% achieved the goal, the total portfolio would still be profitable. Furthermore, if only 50% achieved the goal, thanks to the power of compounding, the annualized return would still exceed 12%. Of course, this is all hypothetical and I only offer it for perspective. There is great power in compounding.Investing in high growth stocks is certainly not for everyone. The risks are high, but the rewards can be extraordinary when you are right. The two keys are forecasting earnings within a reasonable degree of accuracy, and having the fortitude to stay the course as long as business remains strong. Price volatility should be expected.Admittedly, few investors possess that kind of staying power. Consequently, achieving the incredible returns highlighted in this article might be unrealistic to expect. However, the math is real. My purpose in presenting this information was simply to illustrate what could be possible from investing in strong businesses with fast growth. Perhaps even the most conservative dividend growth investor could use a little turbo charging in their portfolios. As I previously said, I admire the power and performance of a great growth stock.Disclosure: Long AAPL, CTSH, MIDD, GMCR, JNJ and CL at the time of writing.

The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by a robust top line.Revenues jumped 21.9% year over year to $2.31 billion, well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The strong year-over-year growth was primarily driven by solid performance across all the segments.The Financial services (41.4% of revenues) segment that includes insurance, banking, and transaction processing grew 21.0% year over year to $954.4 million. Healthcare (26.0% of revenues) reported year-over-year growth of 24.2% to reach $599.9 million in the quarter.Retail/manufacturing/logistics (21.3% of revenues) continued to post strong growth in the quarter.

The sector has been the biggest drag on earnings growth in Q2 driven by the sluggish performances from the top players. Total earnings for the sector were down 10.1% on 0.4% revenue growth.This trend was brought about by weak overseas demand, a reduction in global information technology spending, and a strong dollar (read:  ).Moving into this coming earnings season, which is only a few days away, this trend is rebounding on improving global economic conditions. As per  , the technology sector is expected to post earnings and revenue growth of 0.2% and 1.8%, respectively.The U.S. economy is picking up at a faster pace while a slowdown in China, seen in nine of the past 10 quarters, is seemingly bottoming out. Further, the European economy is also on the verge of recovery on the back of upbeat data, less concerns on debt levels, and a firmer currency.These improving fundamentals from across the globe would fuel growth in many tech stocks, leading to a surge in many ETFs tracking these companies. Moreover, the tech stocks seem well-positioned going forward as cloud computing and mobility segments are gaining importance and offering new avenues for growth.Investors seeking to tap the growing technology sector with lower risk should focus on top ranked ETFs in the sector. One way to find a top ranked ETF in the tech space is by using the Zacks ETF Ranking system (read:  ).A look at the top ranked tech ETFs can be done by using the Zacks ETF Rank. This technique provides a recommendation for the ETF in the context of our outlook of the underlying industry, sector, style box or asset class. Our proprietary methodology also takes into account the risk preferences of investors.The aim of our model is to select the best ETFs within each risk category. We assign each ETF one of five ranks within each risk bucket. Thus, the Zacks ETF Rank reflects the expected return of an ETF relative to other ETFs with a similar level of risk.Using this strategy, we have found one ETF -  - in the space that has a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 or 'Buy' rating with a 'Medium' risk outlook. The details of this interesting fund are highlighted below (read: all the  ):This overlooked product offers broad exposure to the tech sector of the U.S. equity market by tracking the performance of the NASDAQ-100 Technology Sector Index. The fund holds a small basket of 42 securities in equal weights (read:  ).The best thing about the equal weight approach is that performance is not heavily dependent on the returns in a particular stock or group of securities. Further, with quarterly rebalancing, equal-weighted funds tend to cash out on the overvalued segments and reinvest in the underperforming ones, potentially allowing for a more balanced approach.The top three holdings include Facebook (  ), Baidu (  ) and Cognizant Technology (  ) and none of the securities in the basket accounts for more than 3.9% of total assets. The product has a certain tilt towards the large cap and growth stocks as about three-fourths of the portfolio falls in the large cap category while about 56% is classified as growth.From a sector look, more than one-third share is allocated to semiconductors while software and Internet take decent allocations of 25.62% and 14.32% in the portfolio (read:  ).While the ETF will have to go a long way in reducing overall risk, it charges a higher expense ratio of 60 bps compared to the fundamentally/capitalization weighted counterpart. The fund has so far managed $146.1 million in its asset base and trades in a small volume of roughly 25,000 shares per day. This suggests that bid/ask spreads are somewhat wide and that total costs may be higher than the stated expense ratio.In terms of performance, this fund has participated in the broad market rally despite the disappointing performance of the sector so far this year. QTEC added nearly 21.4% year-to-date, easily crushing the broad tech fund (  ) and U.S. market fund (  ) by wide margins (see more in the  ).Further, the ETF is up nearly 28% over the trailing one-year period and 47% over the past three years.This ETF has been overlooked by investors in the tech space, though it has delivered strong returns this year amid the broad weakness in the sector. However, the fund is a bit costly while volume isn't great, but neither should be a big problem considering its performance history (see:  ).The product has the potential to deliver outsized returns further in the months ahead as global conditions are improving and spending on IT is on the rise. This makes QTEC an ideal choice for investors seeking higher returns from the coming Q3 earnings season, and especially so in the technology segment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Consulting bookings and Outsourcing bookings for the quarter were $3.8 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively. During the quarter, bookings related to Consulting translated into revenues at a faster pace than management's expectations which helped the top line.Fourth-quarter gross margins increased 26 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter to 33.2%, primarily due to higher revenue base.Operating expenses increased 4.4% from the year-ago quarter due to a 6.4% increase in sales and marketing expenses, 11.8% increase in reorganization costs and 0.8% increase in general and administrative costs. Reorganization costs remained negligible on a per share basis. As a percentage of net revenue, operating expenses expanded 14 bps to 19.3% from the year-ago quarter.Accenture's operating expenses increased 4.6% from the year-ago quarter to $983.5 million while margins expanded 10 bps to 13.9%. Accenture reported net income of $727.3 million up from $636.2 million.Accenture exited the quarter with total cash balance of $5.63 billion versus $5.94 billion in the preceding quarter. Accenture's long-term debt balance at the end of the fourth quarter was $25.6 million.Operating cash flow was $1.27 billion in the reported quarter compared with $1.50 billion in the prior quarter while free cash flow for the quarter was $1.2 billion.Consistent with Accenture's policy of returning cash to its shareholders, the company repurchased 14.5 million of its common outstanding shares for a total value of $1.10 billion during the fourth quarter. The activity includes 13.3 million shares repurchased in the open market.

This investment lesson was so deeply ingrained into the mind of Ben Graham's most famous student, Warren Buffett, that he created his two most important rules of sound investing. Rule number one: Never lose money. Rule number two: Never forget rule number one. Clearly, both of these renowned sages understood the importance of minimizing risk, especially when investing in equities. The following quote from Ben's famous book The Intelligent Investor corroborates and summarizes my point:Investors at all levels of skill and experience will intuitively accept and embrace the margin of safety concept. However, not all investors will dutifully follow it, but few could argue against its validity. Moreover, those that would reject the concept will often rationalize their not following of this simple, yet profoundly important rule based on another widely-held notion that in order to get higher returns, you must simultaneously be willing to take on more risk.One of my primary objectives with writing this article is to turn this last notion on its head. I intend to demonstrate that one of the most salient features of Ben Graham's motto, MARGIN OF SAFETY, is that it not only reduces downside risk when investing in equities, but how it also simultaneously enhances future returns. Lowering risk, while concurrently increasing return, is a fundamental tenet, and automatic benefit, of investing in a common stock when it provides the investor a large margin of safety. Yes, investing in a stock when it offers a margin of safety undeniably lowers risk and presents the opportunity for enhanced long-term return.In order to understand how this works, it's implicit that we also understand exactly what a margin of safety is and means. Simply stated, a common stock offers a margin of safety when it can be purchased at a valuation that is lower than its intrinsic value. Moreover, the wider the gap between current value and intrinsic value, the greater will be the margin of safety. Regarding investing in a stock when it offers a large margin of safety, some may find this next reality ironic. This also means that the safer the stock is, the greater the potential for higher future rewards it offers. Achieving a higher return, while taking less risk, is nirvana for common stock investors.At this point, some clarity is in order. The margin of safety principle relates to investing in the same individual stock at different levels of valuation. In other words, I am addressing the risk-reward ratio of investing in a single or particular company, at different levels of valuation. Consequently, it must be understood that the company possesses the same attributes of fundamental quality, and growth potential regardless of valuation.Consequently, the higher the valuation, the greater will be the risk, and the lower the return that investment in the company provides. Conversely, at low valuations, the risk of owning the company is lower, but the potential future return higher. Although this defies the principle that you must take higher risk in order to get a higher return, when investing in common stocks it represents an indisputable truth.At this point, it is important to state that margin of safety is a value investor's concept. Moreover, it defies the conventional definition or concept of risk as defined by Modern Portfolio Theory ((  )). I wrote extensively on the subject of risk in my previous two articles  and  .Practitioners of MPT rely heavily on the concept of beta to define risk. The following Warren Buffett quote on beta summarizes both of our views on beta:Since a picture is worth a thousand words, I will provide a few examples utilizing the  Fundamentals Analyzer Software Tool to illustrate the value investor's concept of margin of safety, and how it simultaneously reduces risk and enhances return. The reader should further note, that what follows are simply offered as examples of how the margin of safety concept works. Additionally, I will provide two examples of classic dividend growth stocks, and two examples of aggressive pure growth stocks to illustrate how this concept universally applies.As an interesting sidebar, all of the following examples will illustrate what I believe to be a great irony of investing. In reality, based on the entire historical precedent throughout all market history, the very best time to buy common stocks is when people dislike them the most. And of course, I am referring to recessions which represent periods when people not only dislike stocks, they also flee them. Once again I turn to Ben Graham's The Intelligent Investor to provide insight into the fallacy behind this thinking. The following is found in the footnotes of Chapter 20 on Pages 521 and 522:My first example looks at what happened to Aflac's stock price (the black line) as we entered the Great Recession of 2008-2009. Notice how earnings, the orange line on the graph, held up much better than the stock price. More plainly stated, the price fell far more than fundamentals justified that it should. Therefore, once Aflac's stock price fell below the orange earnings justified value line (intrinsic value) a clear margin of safety was created. Moreover, the farther it fell, the safer it became while simultaneously the reward for investing in Aflac also was enhanced.Additionally, notice that for all the years prior to that, including the recession of 2001, Aflac's price had never fallen below its intrinsic value (the orange line). And perhaps even more importantly, notice that Aflac raised their dividend every year (the pink line on the graph plots dividends). Also, the reader should further realize that at Aflac's low price of $10.83 in the spring of 2009, it provided the astute investor approximately a 10% current dividend yield.Therefore, at exactly the same time that Aflac's stock provided the highest margin of safety, it also provided the highest current yield of 10.34%, and the highest future capital gain potential than at any other time. In other words, Aflac offered investors both its highest capital gain potential, and an extremely high current yield, at precisely the safest time you could have invested in it in modern history.A deeper look into Aflac's fundamentals provides additional evidence as to just how safe investing in Aflac was when its margin of safety was the highest. The following FUN Graph (fundamental underlying numbers) plots Aflac's cash per share (cashps) and more importantly as it relates to dividends, free cash flow per share (fcsflps). FUN Graphs calculates free cash flow after dividends have been paid. Therefore, even during the throes of the Great Recession, Aflac's finances were healthy and strong.Although some could argue that since Aflac is in the Financial Sector, risk, or at least the perception of risk, would be higher than my rhetoric implies. 3M on the other hand is widely considered one of the bluest of all blue chips. Therefore, as the following Earnings and Price Correlated graph depicts, the margin of safety principle is clearly evident.Just like we saw with Aflac, 3M offered its highest yield and simultaneously its greatest capital gain potential at precisely the time when its margin of safety was strongest. Stated more plainly, 3M offered investors its best returns when the risk with investing in it was at its lowest level.With my 3M example, I provide the following FUN Graph which plots assets per share (atps) and common equity per share (ceqps) also known as book value. Once again, we see an example of a company that was and remained fundamentally healthy prior to and right through our last two recessions. Consequently, 3M's price collapse in 2008 created a great margin of safety and an incredible opportunity to invest in their shares.Before I leave my dividend growth examples and move on to pure growth, I feel it's appropriate to add that the growing dividends provided by both of these Dividend Champions provide a type of margin of safety in their own right. Even though the prices of these Dividend Champions may have temporarily fallen, the dividend income that their shareholders received continued to grow.The reader should also recognize that every time a dividend is paid, their capital at risk is technically reduced. This provides one more level of risk mitigation that a margin of safety provides. This coincides with the famous Will Rogers quote:  Consequently, astute investors focused on yield over price volatility, are additionally provided the emotional support needed to fight emotional risk.By their very nature, high-growth stocks are rightfully considered riskier than blue-chip dividend paying stocks. Not only do they not provide the safety net that dividends offer, they are also exposed to the difficult challenge of needing to continue growing at high rates in order to reward their shareholders. Consequently, anything that reduces the risk of investing in high-growth stocks is a real plus.Moreover, in order to participate in the potential high returns provided by a high-growth stock, implies that you must also typically be willing to buy them at higher than average valuations. Where most stocks (average companies) are at fair value when their P/E hovers around a plus or minus 15, very fast-growing companies often command normal P/Es that approximate their earnings growth rates. Both of my following growth stock examples will illustrate this point.For those not familiar with this incredibly consistent high-growth stock, I offer the following excerpt business description courtesy of Capital IQ:My primary purpose behind providing this example is to point out that during the throes of the Great Recession LKQ's P/E ratio had fallen to 15 (Note: I have added a 15 P/E overlay-the magenta line). Therefore, this considerably above-average growth stock could then have been purchased at the valuation of an average growing business. Moreover, notice that only price was weak during this time while earnings continued to strongly advance. Astute growth investors are always on the lookout for this kind of opportunity. (Note that LKQ does not offer a margin of safety at today's high valuation).For those not familiar with this incredibly consistent high-growth stock, I offer the following excerpt business description courtesy of Capital IQ:With Cognizant, we once again see an example of earnings continuing to strongly advance, while only fear drove stock price down. Consequently, as we've seen with all of the examples cited in this article, recessions can be as much about opportunity as they are about risk. At the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009, this powerful growth stock could be purchased at a P/E of only 12 (Note: I have added a 12 P/E overlay-the magenta line).The following Earnings and Price Correlated Graph since the beginning of 2009 provides an additional perspective on the margin of safety concept. Notice that Cognizant's earnings growth rate did slow down from 35.7% to 23.7%. Nevertheless, the margin of safety provided by its lower-than-average valuation, mitigated the risk of slower growth.The following performance results associated with the above Earnings and Price Correlated graph illustrate the profit opportunity afforded by investing in a high-growth stock, even when earnings growth slowed a bit. Simply stated, buying Cognizant at a low valuation reduced risk while generating a compounded annual rate of return of 36.8% per annum that exceeded its earnings growth rate by a wide margin.At this point, I would like to address what I believe to be a very important misconception held by many investors. Instead of predicating their stock investing decisions based on their view of the relative merits of individual companies, investors will often allow their biased view of the overall market deter them. The refrain goes something like - after such a strong run, the stock market is now too high for me to invest in stocks.My experience has taught me that the fallacy behind this line of thinking is that it is not a stock market; instead it is a market of stocks. Moreover, whether we are in a bull market or a bear market, there will always be examples of overvalued, fairly valued or undervalued individual selections to be found. Accordingly, I believe portfolios should be built one company at a time, based on the specific merits of each individual company under consideration.Consequently, I present Deere & Co. (DE), as a current example of a quality common stock that provides a high margin of safety even in today's supposedly overheated market. Deere & Company is a dividend contender on David Fish's CCC lists  with a streak of ten consecutive years of dividend increases. Its current single-digit P/E ratio and above-market dividend yield provides a long-term opportunity with a strong margin of safety, in my opinion.I also offer two additional examples, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA), and Chevron (CVX), two companies whose current low valuations also provide a strong long-term margin of safety. Note that both of these companies can be bought at single-digit P/E ratios, which I believe mitigates any potential future weaker earnings growth.The margin of safety idea conceived by Ben Graham is a concept dealing with sound investing. Value investing, and other prudent investing strategies, must be understood in contrast to speculating. At its heart, identifying a margin of safety in a common stock is first about identifying the company's intrinsic business value. Although margin of safety relates to, and with a low stock price, it is not the price per se but the valuation that it represents that is most important. Once again, I will turn to Ben Graham's teachings from The Intelligent Investor with two important excerpts that summarize my points.Investing in common stocks is fraught with danger, complexity and confusion. Therefore, anything that can reduce the risks associated with successfully building and executing a stock portfolio is of great benefit. Personally, I do believe that Ben Graham's margin of safety motto is one of the most important investing principles to keep in the forefront of our minds. Finding stocks with great margins of safety does require some work and digging. However, I believe the rewards are more than worth the effort.Finally, it's important to recognize and understand that finding stocks when they offer a margin of safety is a long-term strategy. For whatever reason, when a stock offers a margin of safety, it is unpopular. Therefore, logic would dictate that it may not provide immediate gratification. However, over the long-term, which I define as at a minimum business cycle of three to five years, a stock providing a margin of safety will lower risk and increase long-term returns. This is especially important for retired investors or those near retirement. Long AFL, LKQ, CTSH, DE, TEVA, CVX at the time of writing.

I was on  and the results for that day aren't in yet, but I'm not holding my breath. Still, the positive news to all of this is I find it incredibly bullish.We are in the midst of a huge bull market yet no one seems to care. The whole thing is just \"rigged\" and we're only up because Ben Bernanke is printing money. Never mind the record earnings, low inflation, and low multiples. The masses want nothing to do with stocks, and that is a good sign.I just was getting started in the market back during the tech bubble in 1999. But I've heard stories. Everyone loved CNBC, everyone loved the anchors, and everyone loved stocks. Guests were rock stars and it was like  - everyone knew your name. Well, that isn't the case so much anymore.I actually touched on low ratings  and surmised it was a good sign. The  (INDEXSP:.INX) is up 15% over the past 12 months, so something must be working.According to the  CNBC ratings are at a 20-year low, attracting just 37,000 viewers aged 25-54 over a 24-hour period. Here's what they found:Particularly hard-hit programs were  and  - each of which saw all-time lows in total viewers this month.Larry Kudlow's 7 p.m. show fell the most, recording just 20,000 viewers in the key advertiser demographic, a 53% decline.Similarly, Jim Cramer's  was off 38%, to 25,000 viewers, in the key demo.  was the only show to retain its audience.Rival Fox Business Network drew an average of 10,000 viewers an hour in the same key demo. It also saw viewership declines.No doubt that is ugly. At the same time, the CNN evening news audience has been cut in half the past 20 years. People use Twitter or the Internet now for their news. Backing this up, CNBC.com traffic was up 25%, while its TV ratings suffered.The overall low sentiment doesn't stop there. Consumer confidence came in at just 81.5 in August. This is well beneath the 145 peak in 2000 and 115 peak in 2007.To sum it all up, for the SPX to be close to all-time highs and see confidence and TV ratings this low, it is another sign this bull market could have a long way to go.Below, find some more great content from Schaeffer's : ) Gets CollaredTwitter: The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["eading IT services provider  reported second quarter 2013 earnings of $1.00 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents and jumped 22.4% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings include stock-based compensation (after-tax) expense of 7 cents per share but exclude an acquisition charge of 1 cent. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by a robust top line.Revenues jumped 20.4% year over year to $2.16 billion, slightly above the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The strong year-over-year growth was primarily driven by solid performance across all the segments.The Financial services (42.1% of revenues) segment that includes insurance, banking, and transaction processing grew 23.6% year over year to $910.7 million. Healthcare (25.1% of revenues) reported year-over-year growth of 11.8% to reach $541.6 million in the quarter.Retail/manufacturing/logistics (21.4% of revenues) continued to post strong growth in the quarter.

Although the numbers are not huge, they are significant enough, and indicate an evolving trend in one of the most hotly-debated topics in the country, Insourcing.As the U.S. labor market improves with more productivity at lesser wages, several companies have begun wondering whether to continue with their outsourcing strategy for cost advantages or whether they should revert to insourcing. Let's dig a little deeper for the answer.Despite continued softness in most European markets, the U.S. economy has shown resilience with 175,000 new jobs added in May. The average increase in new jobs in the last 12-months aggregate 172,000, which if compared with other developed economies would rank as one among the highest. A healthy rebound in the housing market (See:  ) and a continuous uptrend in stock prices across most indices have been the primary growth drivers for the economy.The unemployment rate has increased marginally in May to 7.6% from 7.5% in Apr, as the labor participation rate inched higher to 63.4% with the influx of 420,000 job-seekers in the labor force. These are encouraging signs for the economy and signify higher hopes for new job prospects. However, the labor participation rate has still got a long way to go to reach its zenith of 67.3%, attained in 2000 when the baby boomer generation was an integral part of the labor force.The dramatic change in the labor market has unruffled the ergonomics and tilted the equilibrium against outsourcing. As most of Americans have learned the hard way of survival through the pangs of a prolonged recession, wages have declined and productivity has increased as a percentage of total product or service costs.On the other hand, as wages in emerging markets have been steadily rising largely due to increased global demand, new labor laws and greater worker voice, the profit perspective has failed to justify the cause of shifting the manufacturing operations outside.In addition, technological advancements and eroding geographical barriers have been encouraging most companies to modify their supply-chain mechanism and often co-locate some of the vital operations such as research and development, design and marketing and assembly closer to the markets served. This is also serving the purpose of better aligning their products with faster innovation in tune with changes in consumer behavior.Consequently, de-verticalization of manufacturing operations have been gradually getting replaced with re-verticalization, making companies skewed towards insourcing.In order to further propel the rising tide of insourcing of jobs, the Senate is currently working on the 'Senate Immigration Bill,' under which foreign outsourcing firms will need to pay more to avail the services of temporary foreign workers on H-1B visas, thereby discouraging its use and offering a larger pool of domestic workers to these companies.The bill also pledges to stop issuing new H-1B visas after 2014 for those companies that employ over 75% of their workforce in the U.S. on temporary visas, and the threshold is further expected to be scaled down to 50% by 2016.To make matters favorable for domestic workers, even foreign workers who work at the offices of their customers, typically known as 'outplacements,' will be prohibited to work on temporary visas, forcing companies to look for local talent. Even while scouring the local job market, the bill imposes strict guidelines for advertising jobs to further deter foreign recruits.All these measures are likely to have some adverse effects on companies like  (  ),  (  ),  (  ), and  (  ), as they have a significant chunk of their jobs outsourced.So although a silver lining does appear on the horizon, outsourcing has ingrained the economy as a key element for exploiting cost advantages. Consequently, it might take considerable effort to dethrone outsourcing from its current position and establish the insourcing of jobs as the next big thing in the economy.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["\u2022 Philip Morris International Inc.

For example, many believe that growth stocks are, by definition, riskier than dividend paying stocks. Although there is some truth to this, I believe this concept is overblown.One commonly measured metric for measuring risk is beta. At its core, beta is a measure of volatility which is also referred to as systematic risk. More simply stated, it is a measurement designed to reflect whether or not a given stock is more volatile than the general market. A baseline beta of one reflects the market. Therefore, a stock with a beta less than one indicates that it is less volatile than the market, and a stock with a beta greater than one would indicate that it is more volatile than the market.More volatility is assumed to be synonymous with more risk, and many investors are led to believe that growth stocks have higher betas than dividend paying stocks. In truth, there are many growth stocks that have betas lower than the general market and, conversely, some that have betas higher than the general market. I will list the betas of each of the 10 examples that I will be presenting in this article next to their title. The results may surprise many readers.There is another myth, or at least a great over-generalization, that dividend paying stocks outperform non-dividend paying stocks. Once again, the true answer is that it really depends on the individual stocks. Some non-dividend companies (stocks) are really terrible businesses, which is why they don't pay dividends in the first place.On the other hand, there are many true growth stocks that don't pay a dividend but are excellent businesses, and therefore, excellent investments as well. I will be reviewing 10 excellent true growth non-dividend paying stocks in this article. To put it bluntly, a true growth stock will generally create a significantly higher total return than most dividend paying stocks, even if dividends are reinvested. Of course, the true growth stock has to be purchased at a reasonable valuation for this to happen. However, it is quite common that true growth stocks will be priced far above their earnings justified valuations by the market. Therefore, investors need to be careful to avoid the hype and focus on true value instead.This leads me to a few words about another myth relating to growth stocks. Many investors believe that high-growth stocks simultaneously carry high P/Es, and again, higher risk. This particular myth does have some truth based on the fact that companies that are growing at rates that are much faster than the market, are logically worth more than the average company due to the power of compounding. This is why I believe that the P/E equal to the growth rate formula for valuing growth stocks (companies with above 15% earnings growth) is an appropriate gauge for fair value.Consequently, a P/E ratio that is equal to the company's earnings growth rate would indicate fair value, even though it may be higher than the market multiple. This higher valuation is due to the fact that companies that are growing earnings at rates that are multiples of the rates that the general market is growing at will generate significantly more future earnings than the average company, again, thanks to the power of compounding. Therefore, in the long run, wise investors who are investing in these high-growth stocks are often buying future earnings much cheaper than the future earnings of average companies with lower entry-level PEs.This article will review 10 established above-average growing businesses that I believe are also fairly valued today, or very close to becoming fairly valued, if there were any correction in the market at all. None of these stocks pay dividends, however, they all have achieved significantly above-average historical growth, and most importantly, they are all expected to produce significantly above-average future growth, at least over the next five years. Consequently, investors interested in earning above-average long-term returns might want to dig deeper into these selections.In order to make my top 10 list of high-growth stocks, each candidate had to meet several logical criteria. First and foremost, I searched for companies with historical earnings growth rates that were exceeding 15% to 20% per annum. In addition to the velocity of the company's earnings growth, I also looked for a high degree of consistency, and the ability to continue growing regardless of the economic environment, including during recessions. I was willing to accept some minor weakness during recessionary times, but not complete earnings collapses.\n  \nAs usual I will rely on F.A.S.T. Graphs?, the fundamentals analyzer software tool, to provide \"essential fundamentals at a glance\" on each of my top 10 selections. Please keep in mind that each of these selections are offered as candidates for a more comprehensive research and due diligence process. However, I will provide brief commentary on each, based solely on what their respective F.A.S.T. Graph? reveals. Also, as I previously stated, I have presented the beta on each selection along with their introduction (all beta figures taken from Google Finance).AutoZone has produced a very consistent record of earnings growth averaging over 21% per annum. Nevertheless, it is also a fact revealed by the earnings and price correlated graph below, that the market has historically valued this company at a discount to its earnings growth. The reader should also note that the company carries a lot of debt, but does generate substantial cash flows to mitigate this risk.Even though AutoZone has been historically priced at a discount to its earnings growth rate, its total annualized rate of return of 19.4% per annum closely correlates to its earnings growth. Consequently, this business, with its powerful record of consistent growth, has substantially outperformed the S&P 500.The consensus of 22 analysts reporting to Standard & Poor's Capital IQ, expect AutoZone to grow earnings at 14.8% per annum over the next five years.Remarkably, even though Catamaran Corp has produced a powerful record of earnings growth averaging over 40% per annum, the company's beta is only .54. Catamaran Corp did experience a drop in earnings during the great recession; however, the company did remain highly profitable. Furthermore, post recession earnings growth has been nothing short of spectacular as it accelerated to over 60% per annum growth since fiscal 2009. Nevertheless, the company's current P/E ratio at 42.3 is in alignment with their historical earnings growth.Since going public at the end of June 2006, Catamaran shareholders have enjoyed an annualized rate of return of 52.2%, which correlates to the company's earnings growth rate enhanced by modest undervaluation existing when the company first went public.The consensus of 22 analysts reporting to Standard & Poor's Capital IQ forecast Catamaran to grow earnings at 25% per annum over the next five years. Consequently, even though the company is reasonably priced based on its historical earnings growth, it would appear to be moderately overvalued based on expected future growth. However, due to the power of compounding, the 25% per annum future growth rate would still offer prospective investors a strong annualized rate of return.On the other hand, over the shorter run, there is the risk of a temporary price drop. Even if that were to occur, if you apply a growth rate multiple of 25 to the consensus $1.86 for fiscal 2013 earnings per share, you would get a fair value of $46.50. This is only moderately below the company's current quotation. My point being that fair valuation can be more generously thought of when dealing with very fast-growing companies.Cognizant Technology Solutions has one of the most consistent long-term records of earnings growth of any company you would ever find. Moreover, the company has no debt and appears to be significantly undervalued based on its long-term historical record of earnings growth.Thanks to operating earnings growth exceeding 38% per annum, long-term shareholders in Cognizant have been rewarded with an annualized rate of return of 31.5%. It's important to recognize that this long-term rate of return has little or nothing to do with either the return of the stock market during this time, nor the economic growth of the United States and/or the rest of the world. Perhaps this is a clue as to why  and others encourage us to ignore political and economic forecasts.Since the F.A.S.T. Graphs? research tool is a dynamic tool, I thought it would be revealing to look at Cognizant since calendar year 2008 (the great recession). Earnings growth, although still significantly above-average, has slowed to just over 22% per annum. This explains why the company appears so undervalued when looked at on the earnings and price correlated graph going back to 1999. Based on more recent history, Cognizant still appears to be undervalued, but nowhere near as much as it does on the longer-term graph.To further illustrate, and perhaps more greatly appreciate the power of earnings growth, shareholder returns since the beginning of calendar year 2008 for Cognizant have still been superior to the overall market.The consensus of 13 analysts reporting to Standard & Poor's Capital IQ forecast Cognizant to grow earnings at 18% per annum. Although I consider this forecast to be conservative, it nevertheless justifies today's current valuation.Express Scripts Holding Co., among other things, is a pharmacy benefit management company, with a long record of above-average earnings growth exceeding 30% per annum. The drop in earnings for fiscal 2012 is attributed to a one-time $0.67 nonrecurring charge. Excluding the one-time charge, operating earnings growth would have been approximately 12%. Also, operating cash flow was very strong in fiscal 2012.Express Scripts Holdings Co represents another example of a company with powerful growth that produced returns for shareholders that far exceeded either economic growth and/or the returns on the average stock as represented by the S&P 500. In other words, the level of the stock market has had little to nothing to do with investing in Express Scripts Holding Company.The consensus of 23 analysts reporting to Standard & Poor's Capital IQ forecast Express Scripts' five-year earnings growth rate at 15% per annum. However, based on their historical record and the powerful demographics underpinning their core businesses, I believe these estimates could prove to be very conservative. However, if they were proven to be true, then this company would be moderately overvalued today. On the other hand, thanks to the power of compounding long-term potential returns could still be substantial. Once again, it may prove beneficial to be somewhat liberal with valuation on a company with significantly above-average prospects for growth.Fossil Inc. has generated a very strong long-term record of earnings growth averaging 18.9% per annum. However, due to the nature of their business, an occasional cyclicality with their earnings does manifest. On the other hand, there are some very interesting lessons in valuation that I believe this company's price history reflects. You can see a strong negative reaction during the great recession which caused the price to drop significantly below its earnings justified valuation (the orange line). However, we also see how it quickly recovered.But perhaps the most interesting aspects of their price history are the large spikes of overvaluation that occurred in 2011 and 2012. In both cases, price quickly reverted back to earnings justified levels, providing clear evidence of market inefficiency on both occasions.However, in spite of some pretty scary bouts of price volatility, long-term shareholders in Fossil Inc. were rewarded in almost perfect correlation with the company's long-term record of earnings growth. Another piece of evidence that earnings determine market price in the long run.The consensus estimates of 14 analysts reporting to Standard & Poor's Capital IQ expect more of the same for Fossil Inc. with a five-year estimated earnings growth rate estimated at 17.5% per annum. This number is consistent with the company's historical results, and justifies today's current valuation, if proven to be true.Hibbett Sports Inc. represents a quintessential example of a long-term earnings and price relationship. Monthly closing stock prices (the black line on the graph), have clearly tracked the company's earnings growth over time. During the few cases where the price disconnected either above or below the earnings justified valuation (the orange line), it quickly moves back into alignment.Once again, we see that operating earnings growth and shareholder returns are highly correlated. But as we've also seen with our other examples, there is very little correlation between Hibbett Sports Inc. shareholder returns relative to the overall market returns, as represented by the S&P 500, over the same timeframe.The consensus of 13 analysts reporting to Standard & Poor's Capital IQ forecast Hibbett Sports to grow at 16% per annum. Consequently, the stock appears to be moderately overpriced on that basis. However, due to the high rate of expected growth, Hibbett Sports would still be a good investment at these levels. On the other hand, it might be prudent to wait for a better entry level.Laboratory Corp of America is currently trading at a below-market P/E ratio, yet it possesses above-market historical earnings growth averaging over 19% per annum. However, if I were to present a six-year graph as I did with CTSH above, LH would appear fairly valued.In spite of Laboratory Corp's current low valuation, long-term shareholders were richly rewarded with a total annual return of 25.9% versus 3.1% for the S&P 500. Once again, we see the power of above-average earnings growth generating significantly above-average returns.Laborabory Corp of America is the only example in this group with forecast earnigns growth below 15% per annum (AZO is forecast at 14.8% rounded to 15%). However, I do believe that these estimates could be consertative.LKQ Corp represents a quiessental example of what I look for in a growth stock. Notice how earnings continued to advance prior to, during and after the great recession. Also, notice how over the long-term stock price has tracked the company's long-term eanrings record.As a result of LKQ Corp's consistent and strong record of earnings growth, long-term shareholders were rewarded orders of magnitude better than shareholders in a passive index fund would have been. This is a classic example of how a powerful, fast-growing, non-dividend paying stock will greatly outperform even the best dividend growth stock and the general market at large.The consensus of 12 analysts reporting to Standard & Poor's Capital IQ forecast LKQ to grow earnings at 20% per annum over the next five years. Consequently, the shares appear moderately overvalued based on current forecasts. However, considering their impeccable long-term record, the consensus forecast may prove conservative.Middleby Corp has produced a solid record of historical earnings growth averaging over 31% per annum since 1999. Although the company did have a modest hiccup during the great recession, earnings recovery since has been back on its normal track.Long-term shareholders in Middleby Corp were rewarded with an annualized rate of return that highly correlated to the company's long-term record of earnings growth. Once again we see an example of a fast-growing business rewarding shareholders far in excess of economic growth or stock market averages.The consensus of 7 analysts reporting to Standard & Poor's Capital IQ forecast Middleby to grow earnings in excess of 19% over the next five years. Consequently, Middleby shares appear within the fair value corridor defined by the five orange lines on the graph.The long-term earrings and price correlated graph on Priceline provides an interesting insight into the dangers of investing too early in a hyped IPO. As you should see from the monthly closing stock price line (the black line on the graph) Priceline's price spiked initially after their IPO release before collapsing over the next year and a half back to its earnings justified level. This further validates my belief in waiting nine months to a year or more before investing in a hot IPO no matter how much I believe in the company's long-term future.Here is a classic example of how overpaying for even the best of companies can destroy potential returns. Even though Priceline grew earnings in excess of 63% per annum, the massive overvaluation during the initial IPO reduced returns to mere average numbers.This next graph reviews Priceline after its initial overvalaution moved into better alignment with the company's operating potential. The operating earnings growth rate on this company remained the same as we saw with the 15-year graph; however, as we will soon see, the effect of better valuation on long-term returns is extrodinary.By simply waiting for Priceline shares to move into better alignment with the company's earnings potential, long-term shareholder returns went from average to extraordinary. However, it should also be interesting to note that Priceline did not generate any real earnings until 2002. Consequently, even in calendar years 2001 and 2002, Priceline was actually overvalued, however, due to the incredible power of compounding, long-term shareholders would have achieved an annualized return of 44.8% per annum.The consensus of 28 analysts reporting to Standard & Poor's Capital IQ forecast Priceline to grow earnings at 20% per annum over the next five years. Consequently, Priceline appears reasonably valued at today's levels.When reviewing very fast-growing companies, the rules of fair valuation still apply. However, due to the power of compounding, very fast-growing businesses will generate significantly higher levels of future earnings than slower-growth businesses. As a consequence, investors can actually pay slightly more than earnings justify for a very fast-growing company and still generate an attractive long-term rate of return. The reason this is important, is because it is difficult to find very fast-growing companies that can be bought at the strictest definitions of fair value.It should also be pointed out that as companies get bigger; their earnings growth rates are likely to slow down a bit. Therefore, the reader should have noticed that most forecasts for this group of stocks were lower than the company's historical achievements. Future purchases should be based with a greater emphasis placed on the future than on the past. However, I believe a lot of credit should be given to a company with a long history of above-average earnings growth. Therefore, I believe there is room for high-quality fast-growing companies to be included in portfolios designed to fund retirement during the accumulation phase.Nevertheless, there are limits to how much overvaluation a prudent prospective investor should be willing to take. Of the 10 sample companies reviewed in this article, three or four of them could be, under the strictest definitions of fair value, considered moderately overvalued. However, none of the samples in this article are what I would consider dangerously overvalued. However, this does present a dilemma of sorts. Do you take the risk of waiting for a better valuation to manifest, only to be left out of the upside? Or do you go ahead and purchase them now, with a commitment to buy more if the price does happen to fall short term?I believe these are questions that only each individual investor can answer for themselves. On the other hand, I believe that very fast growth is a rare and precious attribute, and therefore, worthy of some moderate overvaluation. But again, there are limits. In the next and final part three of this series on growth stocks, I will present examples where I believe dangerous overvaluation is manifest. In honor of my Mother, after all, last Sunday was Mother's Day, I always try to honor her rule of not saying anything if I can't say something nice. However, since I am so adamantly averse to overvaluation, I feel it is my responsibility to provide insight into its dangers to my readers.Disclosure: Long CTSH, ESRX and LKQ at the time of writing.Read More: About GuruFocus: GuruFocus.com tracks the stocks picks and portfolio holdings of the world's best investors.

The decline in margin was primarily attributable to the company's liberal pricing strategy to improve volumes and sales going forward.Net profit after tax was $444 million for the quarter, which was down 4.1% year over year. Higher operating expenses impacted profit during the quarter.Infosys maintains a strong liquidity position and has cash & cash equivalents of $4.02 billion as of Mar 31, 2013 compared with $4.05 billion as of March 31, 2012.Concurrent with the earnings release, management provided a brief outlook for fiscal 2014.

A lot of that work remains basic software coding and testing, which can be done by Indian software engineers for about half the cost as in the U.S., where most of its customers are based.But Cognizant is not a one-trick pony. It has increasingly been performing higher value work that's not sent to India at all, such as consulting and business-process services.For example, in a mid-year deal with retirement and insurance firm ING, Cognizant agreed to take over ING's U.S.-based business-process facilities in Iowa and North Dakota and hire more than 1,000 ING employees working in them.\"ING didn't say, 'Take these jobs and relocate them to India,'\" said Citigroup analyst Ashwin Shirvaikar. \"They required Cognizant to build up their U.S. presence. It's outsourcing in the U.S., but Cognizant can bring best practices to the table and make it more efficient.\"In a way, outsourcing has come full circle as Cognizant and its peers have expanded in size and scope, Shirvaikar says.\"When outsourcing first started, you did it in the U.S., but you did it cheaper. Then things started going to India,\" he said. \"Now clients are savvier. Sometimes, they send some types of work to India and now they say it might be cheaper to do (other work) in Iowa compared to New York, the West Coast or Chicago.\"A Morningstar analyst says Cognizant hires more locals in \"client facing\" involvements outside India than its peers, who more typically bring people in from India.\"They follow a hybrid model of onsite and offshore,\" said the analyst Swami Shanmugasundaram.Unlike other outsourcers with largely India-based operations, such asInfosys (  ),Wipro (  ) and HCL, Cognizant isn't even based in India. It's headquartered in Teaneck, N.J., closer to many of its customers in financial services, health care and other verticals.Almost 80% of its revenue is generated in North America, which saw a 20% jump in sales in Q3 over the prior year, with financial services accounting for the biggest slice of the pie.Total revenue grew 18.2% over the earlier year to $1.8 billion while earnings rose 25% to 91 cents a share.Cognizant's second largest region is Europe, which accounts for 16% of revenue. Cognizant was late to Europe and has a smaller presence than other outsourcers, the Morningstar analyst says.But Cognizant's revenue in Europe has been growing in mid-to-high single digits as customers dealing with the region's economic problems turn more to outsourcers such as Cognizant to save money.And a lot of Cognizant's work, such as consulting, is staying in Europe. In late July, Dutch-basedRoyal Philips Electronics (  ) hired Cognizant to provide a range of consulting and application services to help consolidate and enhance its global information-technology footprint.\"Cognizant has to first provide consulting to change the processes that Philips uses for some of its businesses,\" Shirvaikar said. Then it will help implement and run them, he adds.Though financial terms weren't disclosed, Shirvaikar estimates the contract could mean more than $50 million to Cognizant over three years. It could be a lot more if the contract is extended.Citigroup's recent quarterly surveys with chief information officers of some 260 companies indicates that companies that do business with Cognizant generally want to spend more money with it in the future, Shirvaikar says.\"Cognizant easily has the best record,\" he said.Cognizant intentionally keeps margins lower than peers, at 19% or 20%, to keep prices flexible and low to win business and market share. One result: it's been growing faster than its peers.But as it's gotten bigger, growth has been slowing due to what analysts call \"the law of large numbers.\" An uncertain economic climate has also caused Cognizant and its peers to tamp down their growth forecasts.Cognizant's revenue forecast for 2012 went from 23% early in the year to 20% later.Last year, revenue rose 33% following a 40% gain in 2010 and 16% in 2009, the height of the economic downturn.Many investors base their following year's revenue expectation on an 8-K filing setting out future management compensation based on certain performance milestones.In a recent filing, the growth range for 2013 equated to 12% on the low end to 25% at the high end. That compares to 18% to 32% for 2012 and 19% to 34% for 2011.Citi's Shirvaikar pointed out to clients that 2013's \"implied deceleration\" is similar to the 2010 level of 12% to 24%, which was set in 2009. He thinks it reflects a higher revenue base (the law of large numbers) but also uncertainty.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect both revenue and profit growth of 20% this year and 17% next year.Though that's a slowdown, it's still industry leading growth.\"The overall IT services industry is expected to be flat in 2013,\" Shanmugasundaram said. \"The offshore IT services industry is expected to grow around 10% next year.\"The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he 'offshoring' movement had a profound deleterious effect on the U.S. job market. Entire industries such as electronics, textiles, toys and shoes shifted to China. Consequently, traditional blue collar manufacturing jobs dramatically shrank in number.

C1 specializes primarily in SAP implementations. However, the company did not disclose the financial terms of the agreement.The six companies namely btconsult GmbH, C:1 Solutions GmbH, psc Management Consulting GmbH, C:1 SetCon GmbH, Enterprise Services AG and C:1 Holding GmbH mainly serve manufacturing & logistics, energy & utilities and financial services industries. As per the agreement, more than 500 professionals associated with these companies will join Cognizant post merger, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2013.Cognizant continues to earn majority of its revenue from North America (78.5% in fiscal 2011) followed by Europe (17.9% in fiscal 2011). Others, which include Asia, Pacific and Latin America, contributed approximately 3.6% in fiscal 2011. However, at the end of fiscal 2011, year-over-year revenue growth in Europe slowed down to 28.3% from 41% year-over-year growth at the end of fiscal 2010. In contrast, revenue growth in North America was 34% at the end of fiscal 2011, a slight decline from 38.1% reported at the end of 2010.In the first nine months of 2012, revenue growth in Europe was lowest, up 5.6% from the comparable prior-year period. At the same time, revenue growth in Others was 44.2% while North American revenue growth was 23.7%. We believe that sluggish European growth not only reflects overall volatile macro-economic condition in the region but also the fact that Cognizant has less penetration in the region compared to its peers such as  and  .Among all the three regions, Cognizant has least number of development & delivery facilities in Europe. The company has 3 in Amsterdam, Budapest and London compared with 12 in Asia-Pacific (expanded over 53 locations), 8 in North America and 3 in Latin America. The current deal will expand Cognizant's presence in Germany (Europe's strongest economy) and Switzerland (important financial hub), which will further boost its penetration going forward.We believe that Europe is a significant growth market for Cognizant due to the fact that the businesses in the region are looking for outsourcing partners in order to save cost. The acquisition will help Cognizant to expand its operations in Europe. We believe that the deal will help it to attract new customers as well as serve its existing customers better over the long term.Over the years, acquisitions have been an integral part of Cognizant's growth story. Cognizant acquired nine companies in the last three years and has spent approximately $82.8 million (fiscal 2011), $33.9 million (fiscal 2010) and $68.6 million (fiscal 2009) for them.We believe that Cognizant will continue to pursue strategic acquisitions in order to expand its operational market as well as eliminate competitors. This will not only boost its top line and profitability but will also provide it a competitive edge going forward.We maintain our Neutral recommendation over the long term (6-12 months). Currently, Cognizant has a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he 'offshoring' movement had a profound deleterious effect on the U.S. job market.

Its large product and service base has also led the company to climb to the top spot in the technology consulting market.The overall competence in every segment has helped the company win numerous deals over the years one of the recent and most notable ones being the contract from the insurance company Crum & Forster.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) awarded a $3 million contract to Accenture to improve the biosurveillance operations of the Office of Health Affairs (OHA).Moreover, Germany's largest transmission system operator, Amprion Ltd. has selected Accenture to optimize its material procurement function. Accenture will help the latter to enjoy a competitive advantage in a rapidly changing market. This will add to the company's revenue stream over the next 5 years.We believe that continued technical innovation will ensure continued deal wins in the near future.Although Accenture is well positioned for growth, we feel that competition is expected to grow rapidly as the consulting, outsourcing and technology fields are being constantly invaded by new as well as established brands.Capgemini,  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) pose considerable challenges for the company. Moreover,  (  ) is direct competition for the company when it comes to system integration.

During 2012, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 7%, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose 13%, and the Nasdaq climbed an impressive 16%.If your stock performance varied widely from stock to stock, you're not alone. Stocks in the Home Construction Industry soared 84% but Coal stocks dropped 32%. Apple (  ) started the year at 405, rocketed to 705 on September 21, then fell to close out 2012 at 532.But that's old news. What will happen in 2013? Which stocks will make big moves?Whoa! I forgot one thing. Did you have some serious losses in 2012? If so, figure out where you went wrong and try your best not to make the same mistakes in 2013. Investing is a constant learning experience. We all need to review our past performance, and adjust or tighten up our methodologies to do better in 2013 and beyond.What about 2013? The year is already starting off with a lot of uncertainty, and stock investors don't buy stocks when uncertainty prevails. It seems like all of the usual factors that affect the stock market, including politics, the economy and corporate profits, are especially hard to predict for the coming year. Therefore, I think we can expect a so-so year for stocks.The 2013 U.S. stock market will have plenty of ups and downs, but I don't believe a severe drop will occur despite some analysts' predictions. Even though the many political problems will continue, there will always be hope that solutions will be found, eventually. Stock market values are built on the outlook for sales, earnings and dividends rather than political banter, bickering and grandstanding.Based upon my quantitative fundamental analysis, the low for the Dow Jones Industrial Average will be 11,440 in 2013, and the high will be 13,871. The Dow will end 2013 at 12,655, in the middle of my forecast range and slightly below the current reading of 13,104.A lot could happen in 2013 that would force me to revise my forecast. If the quagmires in Washington and Europe can be resolved with some real long-term solutions, the U.S. stock market could rise considerably higher than 13,879. But if big banks start to fail in Europe, the Dow will drop.---In a recent issue of my Cabot Benjamin Graham Value Letter, I suggested buying 18 stocks. Included in the list were  and  . Rather than buy these three stocks at the current price, I strongly urged my subscribers to buy only if the stock prices declined to their Maximum Buy Prices (targets) of 71.54, 64.33 and 32.96 respectively.CELG, CTSH and MR declined to my computer generated targets briefly and have since produced profits of 10%, 15%, and -1% in less than two months while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 1%. CELG and CTSH, as expected, are well on their way to producing more profits for my happy group of subscribers. MR will follow soon.These examples illustrate what my Cabot Benjamin Graham Value Letter is all about: Buy at the suggested Buy Price, then Hold, until the stock reaches my suggested Sell Price. No, the system doesn't work perfectly every time, but the results indicate that this is the most profitable system with the least amount of risk anywhere!For my faithful subscribers, I publish Maximum Buy and Minimum Sell Prices for CELG, CTSH MR and 247 other stocks.

As the Editor of the Cabot Benjamin Graham Value Letter, I follow value stocks closely. For the past several decades, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks consistently, but during the past 15 months, growth stocks have outperformed value stocks.During the past three months, though, value stocks have begun to outshine growth stocks. I believe 2013 will be an exceptional year for value stocks. Top-notch companies in leading industries are clearly undervalued and look very attractive.I scanned my database to find five stocks with the right credentials to perform very well in 2013. My five picks are the stocks of U.S. companies with exceptional prospects for 2013. All of my stock choices pay dividends, and all are selling at bargain prices. The Gold ETF does not pay a dividend but is selling at a bargain price.My first recommendation is  . BLK is the largest publicly traded investment management company in the world, with assets under management totaling $3.7 trillion. The company offers a variety of investment and advisory products and services to institutional and individual investors. The 2009 acquisition of Barclays Global Investors, manager of all iShare  , doubled BlackRock's revenues and added significant profits.Black Rock is best known for its expertise in fixed income asset management. The company has benefited from the globalization of capital markets and the growing demand for more sophisticated risk management tools and solutions. The firm has been gaining market share, aided by its size and untarnished reputation in the marketplace.Sales and earnings growth slowed during the past 12 months, but a rebound is under way. Sales will likely rise 9% and EPS will increase 11% in 2013. New business from banks and governments seeking help to manage asset risk and to help unload troubled assets could push sales and earnings higher than expected. BLK is Low Risk, share price volatility is below average, and the dividend yield is attractive at 2.9%. Buy now. , founded in 1883 in Cincinnati, is one of the largest U.S. grocers, with 2,422 supermarkets in 31 states. The company also operates 790 convenience stores, 344 jewelry stores and 1,141 supermarket fuel centers. Kroger's typical format includes food and drug stores containing bakeries, delis, seafood, meat and floral shops, pet centers and high-quality fresh items such as organic produce.Management recently introduced an ambitious program to boost the number of new stores. Kroger will also expand its business by launching discount stores and restaurants. Management is committed to improve sales and earnings growth considerably during the next couple of years and beyond.Recent quarterly financial results have been impressive. Kroger's \"Customer 1st Strategy\" continues to raise customer loyalty, boost same supermarket sales and increase market share. Management lifted its earnings guidance for the current quarter and forecast accelerating sales and earnings for 2013. Kroger is taking market share despite formidable competitors such as Wal-mart.At 11.3 times current EPS and with a dividend yield of 2.3%, KR shares are undervalued. The balance sheet is solid, and Kroger shares are less volatile than the shares of most companies. Buy now and sell at my Minimum Sell Price of 35.35. , the world's largest software company, develops, manufactures and licenses software products and services for different types of computing devices. Computer software includes the Windows operating system, the Office application suite and cloud computing services. The company also designs and sells hardware, including entertainment products, digital music devices and personal computer products.MSFT's new Windows 8 operating system designed for computers and tablets is enjoying strong demand from users. In addition, Microsoft's new tablet computer, called the Surface, has won high praise for its innovative features. The company's Xbox consoles and Kinect move games continue to gain market share. MSFT's Skype voice over Internet protocol service (VoIP), acquired in May 2011, is providing rapid growth.I forecast 11% sales growth and 10% EPS growth in 2013. The company could beat my forecast if new products, such as the Surface, exceed expectations. At 9.1 times my 2013 forecast EPS of 2.89, MSFT shares are undervalued. MSFT shares will likely advance to my Minimum Sell Price within one to two years. MSFT is very low risk. is an Exchange Traded Fund (  ) that seeks to replicate the performance of the price of gold bullion. The fund physically holds gold bullion and no other assets. The fund, created in 2004, maintains a low management fee of 0.40%.Gold mining companies, such as Barrick Gold and GoldCorp, are experiencing declining mine production while incurring higher mining costs and higher labor costs. The uncertain near-term future of gold mining companies can be avoided by buying a gold ETF. And SPDR Gold Shares are a lot less volatile than most gold mining company stocks.I believe the price of gold has hit bottom and will rise in 2013, which will benefit SPDR Gold Shares. Gold production has risen only 0.6% annually during the past 12 years despite a rapid rise in the price of gold.The threat of debt defaults, both domestic and foreign, increases the appeal of gold as a safe haven. In addition, the new Federal Reserve bond buying program is expected to cause gold prices to rise during the next several months. The recent drop in gold prices provides an excellent buying opportunity. GLD does not pay a dividend and is low risk. , founded in 1901, is the largest drug store retailer based on sales. In addition to 8,200 drug stores, the company operates 700 health clinics within existing stores and on employer work sites. Walgreen's clinics offer primary and acute care, pharmacy and disease management services, and health and fitness programming.Sales decreased in 2012 due to the loss of Express Scripts' prescription business from January 1 until September 15. In addition, Walgreen will no longer be included in the Defense Department's Tricare health plan network.Walgreen is headed in a new direction. The company purchased a 45% stake in Alliance Boots GmbH for $6.7 billion in cash and stock. Boots is a leading drugstore and wholesale pharmaceutical operator in Europe. Based in Switzerland, the company operates 3,330 health and beauty retail drug stores in the U.K., Norway, Ireland, the Netherlands, Lithuania and Thailand. Boots' pharmaceutical wholesale business supplies medicines and healthcare products to more than 170,000 pharmacies, doctors, health centers and hospitals from 370 distribution centers in 21 countries.Sales and earnings at Boots are growing at a 10 to 15% pace, which will greatly enhance Walgreen's growth in the future. WAG is expected to purchase the remaining 55% ownership within three years. Together, the two companies will operate over 11,000 pharmacies in 26 countries. The opportunity for Walgreen to expand globally is exciting, but I expect earnings to lag during a 12 to 18 month \"transition\" period before accelerating rapidly in future years.Walgreen shares are undervalued at 13.0 times my 2013 EPS estimate of 2.84. The recently increased dividend now yields an attractive 3.0%. WAG's stock performance has lagged the stock market during the past five years, but the current price presents an excellent opportunity to buy a blue-chip company with improving growth prospects. I believe WAG shares will reach my Min Sell Price within two to three years. WAG is very low risk.I will continue to follow BlackRock, Gold, Kroger, Microsoft, Walgreen and other blue-chip, high-quality investments in my Cabot Benjamin Graham Value Letter.

This year, my wife and I will be traveling to Port Orange, Florida, to camp out for a few days in our trusty two-person tent. I've never been to Port Orange, so I look forward to seeing another new place.In years gone by, I can recall going to my grandparents' house in Lynnfield, Massachusetts. Joining Grandpa and Grandma for Thanksgiving dinner was always special. Great food (I still love turkey), fun and games, and a long walk made for an idyllic day. I have spent Thanksgiving in many different places with various friends and family, but few compare with those old Thanksgivings in Lynnfield.I hope that you will have a great feast and a memorable day with friends and family!---Switching gears, let's talk about making money.Sometimes I get frustrated when investors don't understand my intended role in the investment world. After many years, ok, decades, I have found that the best way to make money in the stock market for me is to invest in conservative stocks for long-term holding. No market timing, no charts-just buy blue-chip companies at low prices and wait patiently until the stock price becomes overvalued. I simply want to take advantage of the natural ebb and flow of the stock market.If you are thinking my profits are minuscule because of my conservative style, then I offer this evidence. For the 12 months through the end of September, my Modern Value Model stocks are up 44% compared to a gain of 24% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average! That's significantly better than most mutual funds, most investment letters and even hedge funds. During the past decade, the Model has increased 130% compared to the 78% increase by the Dow. When you invest in stocks with very little downside risk, good things happen!---In the November issue of my Cabot Benjamin Graham Value Letter, I suggested buying 18 stocks. Included in the list were Celgene (  ), Cognizant Technology (  ) and Mindray Medical (  ). Rather than buy these three stocks at the current price, I strongly urged my faithful subscribers to buy only if the stock prices declined to their Maximum Buy Prices (targets) of 71.54, 64.33 and 32.96 respectively.CELG, CTSH and MR briefly declined to my computer-generated buy price targets, and have since produced profits of 7%, 1% and 1% in just three weeks, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index has dropped 2%. The three stocks, as expected, are on their way to producing more profits for my happy subscribers.These examples are very good illustrations of what the Cabot Benjamin Graham Value Letter is all about: buy at the suggested Buy Price, Hold, and Sell at the suggested Sell Price. No, the system doesn't work perfectly every time, but the results over the past several months and years indicate that this is the most profitable system with the least amount of risk anywhere!I also publish Minimum Sell Prices for CELG, CTSH and MR, plus 247 other stocks. One of our recommendations is very close to its Minimum Sell Price after gaining 101% during the past 29 months. To find out how you can increase your profits and dividends using a safe, sensible system,  .---In keeping with the season, I offer two companies that likely sold thousands of turkeys before Thanksgiving Day. Both companies sell at a very reasonable price and pay solid dividends. (IMKTA: current price 15.92) is a leading supermarket chain with operations in six southeastern states. Founded 47 years ago in Asheville, North Carolina, the company operates 203 supermarkets located typically in smaller towns and cities. In addition, the family-run business owns and operates 71 neighborhood shopping centers, 59 of which contain an Ingles supermarket. Ingles also operates 74 in-store pharmacies and 70 on-site gas stations.Ingles opened a newly built distribution and warehouse center in Asheville to replace its outdated (and only) facility. The new center will increase efficiency and add to profitability.The company is expanding its selection of private label items under the Laura Lynn name. Private label goods are clearly more profitable. The company is enjoying a surge in demand from consumers who are opting to buy groceries and cook at home rather than spend extra money to dine at restaurants.The transition to the new distribution facility and higher food costs will hold back earnings growth during the next quarter or two, but I expect 5% sales and 15% EPS (earnings per share) growth during the next 12 months. Cash flow of more than $5.00 per share is more than enough to expand Ingles' store count, and at the same time, pay down its high debt load and reduce interest expense.At 8.2 times my EPS estimate of 1.95 for the next 12 months ending 9/30/13, IMKTA shares are a bargain. Ingles has been paying quarterly dividends since 1987, and the current yield of 4.1% adds substantial value and stability. I recommend buying IMKTA below 16.85. . (KR: Current Price 24.53), founded in 1883 in Cincinnati, is one of the largest U.S. grocers with 2,476 supermarkets in 31 states. The company also operates 779 convenience stores, 393 jewelry stores, and 737 supermarket fuel centers. It also operates 41 food processing plants providing 15% of total grocery sales.Kroger's typical format includes food and drug stores containing bakeries, delis, seafood, meat and floral shops, pet centers and high quality fresh items such as organic produce. Supermarket fuel centers are also located at many locations. The company's \"Customer First\" strategy emphasizes consumer service.Management recently introduced a new program to boost the number of new stores significantly. Kroger's will also expand its business to include discount stores and restaurants. Management is committed to improve sales and earnings growth considerably during the next couple of years.During the past 12 months ended 8/31/12, sales increased 6%, and EPS rose 14%. In the most recent quarter same-store sales climbed 3.6%, which is noticeably better than previous quarters. Kroger is taking market share despite formidable competitors such as Walmart.At 9.8 times my one-year forward EPS estimate of 2.50, KR shares are undervalued. Stronger same-store sales and multiple new store openings will lead to sales and earnings gains of 7% and 12% during the next 12 months ending 8/31/13. Kroger shares are less volatile than the shares of most companies. The dividend yield of 2.4% is generous. The company has been paying a dividend since 2006 and has increased it every year since. I recommend buying KR below 26.02.I will continue to follow Ingles and Kroger, as well as many other blue-chip, high-quality companies in my Cabot Benjamin Graham Value Letter. My next issue, coming soon, will focus on undervalued stocks with low P/E to growth (  ) ratios.

In this same vein we argued that it's a market of stocks, not a stock market. For those who missed it, here's  . To put this into context, we are simply suggesting that the discerning investor can always find bargains if they are willing to look and do their homework. However, we should also add that bargains can come from many different types of equities.Therefore, this and the following articles in this series will look at bargains that can be found within various equity classes. In this part two, we will look for bargains in high-growth stocks. Although this may be the riskiest equity asset class of all, it is also the most profitable, as long as sound and prudent investing principles are adhered to.One of my favorite quips is about Tennessee Ernie Ford leading his church's choir when he allegedly said: \"  Therefore, as it relates to this article, in order for us all to be on the same page, we need to share a common definition of growth stocks, before a fair and impartial analysis can be conducted.Consequently, for purposes of this article, we define growth stocks as follows: In order to be considered a growth stock, the company must have a history of growing their earnings in excess of 15% per annum, while simultaneously possessing a forecast expected future growth rate of at least 15% or better. For companies that possess these levels of past and future growth, we will utilize a PEG (PE equals growth rate) formula to calculate fair value. The valuation theory being applied states that companies possessing these significantly above-average growth rates deserve a premium valuation over slower growing peers.The premium valuation concept presented above represents one aspect of why growth stocks, under our definition, possess higher risk than blue chips. First of all, achieving these high levels of growth are not only rare, but also extremely difficult to accomplish. Consequently, it is a challenge for companies to maintain high rates of growth, and this challenge is amplified the bigger the company gets. Therefore, we offer this very important caveat. Regarding growth stocks, it is even more imperative to focus on future growth over historical growth, than it is for any other equity class.There is a second factor related to the above caution and that is the importance of valuation. Typically, Mr. Market will ask the prospective investor to pay a higher valuation (PE ratio) to buy a growth stock than most other equity categories. Having to pay a higher valuation for above-average growth is usually not only necessary, but also rational to a point. In fact, due to the high rates of potential growth, coupled with the power of compounding, means that above-average rates of return can be achieved with growth stocks, even if you pay a little more to buy one than you should. In other words, the compounding power of rapid earnings growth can bail you out from an aggressive purchase over time.On the other hand, one of the most common mistakes investors make with high-growth stocks is overpaying for them. This usually occurs because of the hype that often leads to hysteria which tweaks the greed response. Companies with extremely high rates of growth can for a time attract significant investor interest leading to incredible short-term momentum. Consequently, a rapidly rising stock price can excite investor greed to the point of irrational behavior. One place where this psychological response is often seen is with hot IPOs. Later in this article we will present a vivid example of how dangerous this can be.This series of articles is oriented to dealing with the wide diversity of equity classes that make up the S&P 500. Therefore, we are only going to concern ourselves with high-growth stocks that are constituents of the S&P 500. Of course, this also means that there are many very high-growth stocks that will be excluded from this discussion. Consequently, what follows is by no means presented as a comprehensive list of high-growth stocks.Moreover, and most importantly, the following tables comprised of high-growth stocks in the S&P 500 also had to meet the hurdle of reasonable valuation. As a result, there were several S&P 500 growth stocks that did not make the cut. In other words, the following tables look at S&P 500 high-growth stocks that appear to be at or near fair value based on expected future rates of growth. S&P 500 growth stocks that we believe are overvalued were not included.We have listed 17 S&P 500 high-growth stocks that met our criteria and we have organized them based on capitalization and earnings growth rate. Interestingly, all of the S&P 500 high-growth stocks that made our list are large-cap companies. Our first table reports on seven companies with earnings growth rates exceeding 20% per annum (The reader should note that both the 15-year historical EPS growth rate and the estimated 5-year EPS growth rate are both in excess of 20% in table 1). Our second table covers 10 additional S&P 500 growth stocks with historical and estimated growth rates in excess of 15% per annum.Both of the following tables provide a summary of important fundamental measurements. The first two columns list historical earnings growth, followed by forecast EPS growth rates. The next two columns are focused on valuation by showing the historical normal PE followed by the current market PE. Then we provide debt levels and sector, followed by annualized historical performance, and finally, an estimate of future potential compounded annual rates of return. (It is important to note that the reader should understand that any companies on the list with poor historical returns (highlighted in red) can be assumed attributed to beginning overvaluation).Next we're going to evaluate several examples from our list of S&P 500 high-growth stocks in value, utilizing the  fundamentals analyzer software tool. This exercise will serve the dual purpose of allowing us to analyze the fundamental value of each company and to illustrate and elaborate on several of the points previously presented in this article. Furthermore, although we believe that the following analysis provides a comprehensive evaluation of the fundamentals underpinning each of these examples, additional due diligence is recommended.Cognizant Technology Solutions is a leading provider of custom information technology, consulting and business process outsourcing services. The following earnings and price correlated graph on this quality company depicts a quintessential example of a true growth stock. Not only has earnings growth averaged 38% per annum, the consistency of the growth has also been extraordinary. This rate of growth is very rare, as few companies are capable of growing this consistently fast.Furthermore, notice how stock price (the black line on the graph) has closely tracked earnings (the orange line on the graph) up through calendar year 2007, but has since deviated (see red circle). This long-term picture of the earnings and price relationship clearly alerts us that something has changed since 2008. The first reaction of course would be that the great recession of 2008 made an impact. However, upon further review we discover that the recession did impact stock price for sure, but we also see that earnings growth continued to advance nicely, thereby suggesting that this company was clearly recession resistant.On the other hand, a glance at the bottom of the graph (see yellow highlights) shows that the earnings growth rate, although continuing to be strongly above average, had slowed down. However, thanks to the dynamic nature of the F.A.S.T. Graphs \u2122 research tool, we can run a graph since 2008 (the recession), and analyze this inflection in earnings growth and the impact it had on price and valuation. However, before we do, let's take a look at performance since calendar year 1999 in order to illustrate just how powerful a return generator that a high-growth stock can be.When we calculate the performance that Cognizant Technologies has produced for its shareholders since calendar year 1999, we see a stunning example of the incredible power of compounding, and the incredible economic benefit it can provide. A simple $1000 investment in Cognizant's stock on December 31, 1998, and held till now would have turned a $1000 initial investment into over $54,000 today. Comparing this more than 33% per annum compounded rate of return from this S&P 500 constituent to the S&P 500 itself, clearly illustrates just how powerful the return that this growth stock has produced.A quick glance back at the historical earnings and price correlated graphic above shows that the company was reasonably priced with a PE ratio of just under 40, or only slightly above its 38% per annum earnings growth rate on December 31, 1998. Remember, the formula used to value high growth stocks is the PEG (PE equals growth rate) formula. Consequently, even though the company appears undervalued during the later years based on its historical growth which averaged 38% per annum, the compounded rate of return it provided shareholders is highly correlated to its long-term earnings growth.Next, and as promised, let's use the dynamic feature of F.A.S.T. Graphs \u2122 and look at Cognizant Technologies since the beginning of calendar year 2008 (the great recession). Here we discover that our research tool has recalculated the company's earnings growth rate and simultaneously provides a more recent iteration of fair valuation. Since calendar year 2008, Cognizant's earnings growth rate has fallen from averaging 38% per annum to averaging 22% per annum.Nevertheless, although this is still significantly above-average earnings growth, it does imply a valuation adjustment. Consequently, by applying the PEG ratio valuation because earnings growth is over 15%, we see that the market has been rationally valuing the company at its adjusted growth rate since 2008. Therefore, although it is useful to see how powerful this growth stock has been since 1999, it is also both imperative and useful to evaluate it based on its more recent history. This explains why the price was not tracking its long-term earnings growth rate during the latter years on the long-term earnings and price correlated graphic above.When we review the performance of Cognizant since calendar year\n2008, and consider that it was moderately overvalued with a PE\nratio above 25 relative to an earnings growth rate of 22%, we\ncontinue to see evidence of the strong returns that a high growth\nstock can provide. Furthermore, this also illustrates that\nyou can moderately overpay for a high-growth stock, and still\ngenerate a significant long-term rate of return.When we review the performance of Cognizant since calendar year 2008, and consider that it was moderately overvalued with a PE ratio above 25 relative to an earnings growth rate of 22%, we continue to see evidence of the strong returns that a high growth stock can provide. Furthermore, this also illustrates that you can moderately overpay for a high-growth stock, and still generate a significant long-term rate of return.Astute investors who purchased Cognizant on December 31, 2007, would have more than doubled their money, averaging approximately a 15.7% per annum return. When you compare this to investing in the S&P 500 Index, the value of owning a high-growth stock bought at a reasonable valuation is vividly revealed. Remember, that even though Cognizant was moderately overvalued, the power of compounding earnings growth during and through the great recession, allowed the company to provide its shareholders very attractive and highly above-average returns.When we turn our attention to the future, we discover that expectations are high that Cognizant Technologies can continue to grow earnings at a very high rate of growth. The consensus of 21 analysts expect the company to continue growing at approximately 20% per annum, and therefore, the current PE ratio of 21 would imply that the company is reasonably priced based on its expected high future growth. However, the reader should remember the caveats mentioned above regarding the difficulty of achieving such a high rate of growth. Here the concept of risk versus reward comes into play.The long-term graphic on Priceline.com provides a lot of lessons on investing in general, but most importantly, on investing in growth stocks specifically. Additionally, the importance of investing at sensible valuations is clearly articulated. Furthermore, we can use this example to reflect on lessons to be learned when investing in IPOs, as promised earlier in this article.Priceline.com went public on April Fools' Day 1999; however, investing in its initial public offering was no joking matter. From the graph below we can see that for the first month after its IPO, Priceline.com's stock price almost doubled in value. However, for the next 20 months or so following its price peaking, the stock fell from a high of over $974 per share to a low of $6.38 per share. Furthermore, it should be pointed out that there were no earnings being generated by the company at this time to support its high price.When you calculate Priceline.com's performance since its IPO to current time, we discover how devastating overvaluation can be to long-term performance. Even though the company eventually began earning money (its first earnings occurred in 2002), and even though its long-term rate of earnings growth has been extraordinary, long-term shareholder performance has been rather anemic. This week performance is attributed solely to its stock price being irrationally priced by the market at its IPO. With no earnings to buoy the stock price, a fundamental collapse was inevitable.One of the valuable attributes of the F.A.S.T. Graphs \u2122 research tool is the ability to go back in time and focus on historical periods in order to learn from the past. The following graphic looks at Priceline over the historical timeframe 1999 to 2003. This time period covers the company from its IPO to its first years of generating a profit. From this perspective, the collapse in stock price following the first three years or so after its IPO are easily understood and justified. In other words, hype and hysteria eventually gave out to sound fundamental value.When you measure the company's price performance from its IPO in\n1999 to year-end 2003, we see just how devastating overvaluation\ncan be. A $1000 investment in Priceline at its IPO would have\ngenerated a compounded 50% per annum loss on its shareholders\nbehalf, thereby turning the original $1000 investment into a mere\n$35.98.When you measure the company's price performance from its IPO in 1999 to year-end 2003, we see just how devastating overvaluation can be. A $1000 investment in Priceline at its IPO would have generated a compounded 50% per annum loss on its shareholders behalf, thereby turning the original $1000 investment into a mere $35.98.The moral of this story is to not invest in IPOs no matter how enticing (think Facebook) unless the company's initial earnings support the stock price. Since the company is going to trade for a long time, the patient investor would more often than not find a more attractive and rational entry point than they typically find at the IPO. With our next look at Priceline we will show how profitable this kind of patience can be.Next, let's take a look at Priceline after they became a profitable business in 2003. Here we find that earnings growth has averaged over 60% per annum, and has been extremely consistent since calendar year 2005. There are two additional things to take notice of. Number one, Mr. Market has historically priced Priceline at a premium PE in excess of 30, however, this valuation is only half its actual earnings growth rate (the blue line = normal PE). Second, we see that the company has achieved this remarkable growth without needing to take on any long-term debt.In contrast to investing in Priceline at its IPO, let's take a quick look at Priceline and the returns they generated for shareholders after they became a profitable enterprise in calendar year 2003. The same $1000 investment on December 31, 2002 would have grown to $64,803, which translates into an exceptional compounded annual rate of return of almost 54% per annum. Furthermore, notice how this extraordinary record was achieved by shareholders without receiving even one penny in dividends.As a final statement on Priceline, we must remember that as investors we can only buy the future and not the past. Consequently, based on the fact that the consensus of 24 analysts reporting to Capital IQ expects the company to continue growing at 20% per annum, indicates that the company may be fairly priced today. However, this also means that future expectations for profit, although appearing quite attractive, will not come close to their historical average.Our final example looks at F5 Networks Inc., a leading provider of application delivery networking technology. There are several lessons regarding investing in growth stocks that we believe this fast-growing technology enabler can teach us. First of all, we see another example of the extraordinary benefit provided from investing into a company with a powerful earnings record. Additionally, this company also teaches us a thing or two about valuation, and finally provides lessons on intelligently dealing with volatility.From the earnings and price correlated graphic below we see that F5 Networks has generated earnings growth averaging 29.8% since calendar year 2005. Furthermore, we can clearly see that the company's stock price, although generally tracking earnings, has experienced extreme bouts of high volatility on more than one occasion.But even more importantly, we see the importance of trusting fundamentals over stock price movement, because every time stock price deviated from fair value over or under, inevitably it returns to fair value. We believe this validates our thesis that price volatility will only hurt you when you overreact to it while simultaneously refusing to acknowledge intrinsic value based on fundamentals. We believe there are two performance measurements for every stock. The first is price volatility, which can't be trusted, and the second is fundamental value, which in truth matters most. Unfortunately, most investors ignore fundamental value as they are fixated on fickle price.When you look at the performance that this high growth company\nhas generated for shareholders, we once again see a high\ncorrelation between return and earnings growth, adjusted for\nvaluation. In other words, it is only because the company is\ncurrently trading at a discount to its historical earnings\njustified valuation that has caused its 20.8% compounded annual\nreturn to be less than its 29.8% earnings growth achievement.When you look at the performance that this high growth company has generated for shareholders, we once again see a high correlation between return and earnings growth, adjusted for valuation. In other words, it is only because the company is currently trading at a discount to its historical earnings justified valuation that has caused its 20.8% compounded annual return to be less than its 29.8% earnings growth achievement.Our primary objective with this series of articles is to illustrate the truth that there is a lot of value in this market. With this part 2, we focused on high-growth stocks that were constituents of the S&P 500 that are currently trading at fair value based on their earnings potential. Although many of the stocks on our master list of 17 are currently trading at above-market PE ratios, we think the valuations are justified based on the earnings power of these extraordinary growers. This teaches us a lesson that valuation is a relative concept. In other words, a company with an extraordinary potential for growth is worth more than a company with a lower potential for growth.The companies that we have featured in this article appear to be attractive high-growth candidates for the aggressive investor seeking maximum capital appreciation. However, this statement is based on a combination of the company's historical operating history, coupled with consensus estimates for future growth. Furthermore, because these numbers are significantly higher than average, the notion of greater risk should be kept firmly in mind. On the other hand, the old adages that no risk, no return, also come into play. The bottom line is that although we feel this is an excellent list of S&P 500 constituents with high growth potential, additional due diligence is highly recommended.

Yet, that statement sent the S&P 500 roaring up +3.56% over July 26 and 27.Doubts over the capabilities of either leader to act crept in last Monday, as the market was off a very small amount. It got worse on Tuesday, July 31 (-0.43%), as everyone waited for action from the Fed, the ECB or both. Instead, Bernanke spoke in platitudes on Wednesday, August 1, and the market fell another -0.29%. When the ECB merely chatted about gross generalities and no certainties on Thursday, August 2, the markets fell globally with the S&P 500 down nearly -2% by 10:00 a.m., following horrible markets in Asia and Europe. The realization that nothing was really happening caused investors to exit \"en masse,\" sending the market down 20 points.To make matters worse, the Knight Capital (  ) trading debacle on Wednesday, which cost the company more than $400M, threatened its very survival, as its stock price was down 75% by Friday morning. There's nothing like a rogue trading algorithm to zap investors' confidence in electronic trading.Inexplicably, around noon Thursday, retail stores, on the heels of sordid forward guidance from Abercrombie & Fitch (  ) (whose shares fell nearly 15%), announced a surprising +4.3% gain in July. This figure was nearly triple the expected number. Combined with Wednesday's positive ADP Employment Report of 163K new jobs in July, exceeding the consensus of 125K, the tide seemed to turn. Maybe investors should focus on the reasonable valuations and ignore the Fed and ECB, assuming that they will eventually do what they promised.Optimism continued to abound Friday on better-than-expected numbers from the monthly employment report (a gain in non-farm payrolls from the private and public sectors of 335K versus an estimated 205K), and the market rolled forward to close at 1390. Unabated by weekend news and political turmoil, the market climbed very, very close to 1400 before profit-taking sent prices down to a close of 1394, up yet another 3 points.So, from a low on July 25 of 1337, the market was propelled by promises and platitudes to close at 1385 on July 27. The market then fell back to 1357 on failed promises but gained it all back, plus an extra 3 points today. Moral of the story: listen to facts and not promises.Market Stats: The leader in last week's wild behavior was Large-cap Growth, up +0.34%, while the loser was Small-cap Growth, down -1.38%. Large-cap Growth and Large-cap Value have now led the past week, month, 3-month, 6-month, and year periods. The loser has been Small-cap Growth for most of the past year.Another moral of the story is in turbulent uncertain times, stick with the larger caps. From a sector viewpoint, Technology, Energy, and Consumer Cyclicals seem to offer the best combination of value and growth. Finance certainly has bargain prices, but the faint of heart will likely remember JPMorgan 's (  ) Whale trade, Barclays' (  ) dally with LIBOR, and Knight Capital's wild computer algorithm for quite some time.About 80% of the S&P 500 companies have reported earnings, and about 66% of those companies beat earnings, while more than 50% missed revenues. Valuations in general remain quite reasonable, but if revenues continue to slip, it could be cause for concern. Not much in the way of economic data this week. Consumer Credit is tomorrow; Initial Jobless Claims are on Thursday along with the Trade Balance and Wholesale Inventories; and finally, Import and Export Prices Friday along with the Treasury Budget.

Then April was a bit choppy with a close of about the same as it started. So far May has shown an 8% drop.If you are strictly a stock investor, your investment strategy has now turned to shorting stocks. Of course, when shorting a stock you have to deal with the disadvantage of a short position - unlimited risk. However, if you trade options, you will find that there are several strategies which will profit from a declining stock price but have a defined maximum risk.A Bear Put Spread is one of those option strategies that will give you a defined maximum risk in return for a defined maximum gain.When a Put is traded, there is a potential gain that is in direct proportion to the drop in value of the underlying stock. However, the potential loss could be the entire premium that was paid for the Put. A Bear Put Spread is a refinement of the standard purchase of a Put. It will decrease the amount of premium that is at risk.With a Bear Put Spread, the amount of the potential loss is decreased but the tradeoff is that the potential gain will be limited. It is constructed by buying a Put which will profit from a decline in the underlying stock and, at the same time, selling a Put with the same expiration date but with a lower strike price. The short Put will offset some of the cost of the long Put. This trade will require a net cash outlay (a debit trade) since the amount received from the sale of the Put will be less than the amount paid for the long Put.The typical Bear Put Spread is created when you buy in-the-money Puts and sell out-of the-money Puts.As an example, I am analyzing  (  ), which is trading at $59.63. If my analysis indicates that the stock could continue to drop but is not likely to drop lower than $55, I can open a Bear Put Spread by buying the $60 Jun Put for $2.75 and selling the $55 Jun Put for $0.95, giving a net cost of $1.80 per share. The calculations for one contract are:Sell Jun $55 Put: +$95.00Net Cost: $180.00The $60 Put is bought because I believe the stock will continue to go down. The $55 Put is sold because I think the stock will not go below this price. So, for each contract, the cost is $180 instead of the $275 that would have been paid for only the long Put.To make the optimum trade using a Bear Put Spread, a trader will estimate how low the stock price might go and decide how long it might take to drop to that price. In the above example, if I expected the CTSH to drop significantly lower than $55, I could sell a lower priced Put. But, at some point the lower premium that is received will make the credit from the sale of the option unprofitable. If I expected a significant drop in the stock's price (further than $55), a better strategy would be to trade only the long option.The gain on a Bear Put Spread is defined by the strike prices that were selected. The maximum gain occurs when the stock price is at, or lower than, the short Put position - in this example $55. The maximum profit is calculated by the differences between the two strike prices less the premium and costs of initiating the trade. In the example this would be calculated as $60 minus $55, and then less the net premium of $1.80 for a total of $3.20 or $320 per contract.This calculation assumes that the option position is eventually closed. One could, of course, exercise the long Put and be assigned the short Put, thus buying stock at a lower price and selling it at a higher price. However, it is usually best to just close the option positions.The maximum loss is limited. It occurs when the stock price is above the long Put at expiration - in this example $60. In this case, both options decay to $0.00 and expire worthless. This means a loss of $180 for a single contract.Of course, this assumes that there were no adjustments made to the trade after it was initiated. A savvy investor would not allow a losing trade to go to expiration. At some point between when the trade was initiated and the expiration, the trade could be closed out with a loss of less than the potential loss of $180 per contract.Take special precautions if the position is held until expiration date. If the underlying stock is close to the strike price, it is not known for sure if the short position will be assigned until the following Monday. So, either close out the trade early or be prepared for having the assignment occur or not occur on Monday.Early assignment is possible, but generally only when the options are deeply in the money. Even though there is a long position to cover the short position, if an assignment occurs there will be a necessity of financing the long position for one day. An ex-dividend date or other type of special event could upset expectations for profits. It is usually a good strategy to avoid most option strategies when the expiration goes beyond an ex-dividend date.The effects of decay with a short position and a long position may offset each other. However, it will not totally offset the decay and the passage of time will affect the profitability to some extent, especially in the last week before expiration.The use of a Bear Put Spread can be profitable when you expect a stock price to decline in the short term, but not to a great extent. This strategy involves buying a Put. But, because the stock is not expected to drop a great amount, the cost of the trade is lowered by selling a Put at a lower strike price. The tradeoff for having a lower amount at risk will be a reduction in the maximum profit.A close evaluation of the placement of the two different strike prices will show a significant difference in the potential return and risk of a Bear Put Spread.You can learn more about different option strategies by downloading our free options booklet: 3 Smart Ways to Make Money with Options (Two of Which You Probably Never Heard About).

I thought I'd bring some cold hard facts and figures to the table in trying to address it, by using my Buffett-inspired \"Guru Strategy\" computer model to scour the market for stocks that currently appear to be \"Buffett-esque\".My Buffet inspired model is based on the book Buffettology, written by Buffett's former daughter-in-law, Mary Buffett, and David Clark, both of whom worked closely with the Oracle of Omaha. It looks for companies that have a decade-long history of persistently increasing annual earnings per share; manageable debt; and a 10-year average return on equity of at least 15% (that's a sign of the \"durable competitive advantage\" Buffett is known to seek in companies). It also looks for firms that are generating a positive free cash flow, and whose management has proven it can generate a high return on retained earnings (that is, the earnings that are not paid out as dividends). And, of course, given Buffett's value tilt, the strategy looks for companies with high enough earnings yields that they appear to be trading at a good price.For this exercise, I looked for stocks that my Buffett-based model rates highly and which have market capitalizations between $15 billion and $30 billion, given that Berkshire was recently looking at that unnamed $22 billion company. Now, I'm not saying that one of these companies is the one that Berkshire was in talks with, or that Buffett will scoop up these stocks sometime soon. But what I am saying is that they are the types of companies that Buffett targeted while building his empire -- and that makes their shares the type of stocks that you should give a long, hard look. Buffett isn't known as a tech guy, but his recent foray into IBM stock shows he's not averse to investing in tech firms if the business is a solid, proven one. This New Jersey-based IT and business process outsourcing company fits the bill. Cognizant ($18 billion market cap) has upped EPS in every year of the past decade, has no long-term debt, and has averaged a 20.9% ROE over the past ten years. Its shares took a major tumble early this week when it announced disappointing guidance, but it's still on track to increase EPS in 2012. My Buffett-based model thinks the price decline has made a good stock even more attractive, as the stock now trades at an earnings yield of about 5%, more than double the yield on a 10-year Treasury. Berkshire has dipped its toe into the medical technology industry in recent years, investing in businesses like Becton, Dickinson and Company. My Buffett model is high on this Michigan-based medical technology firm ($21 billion market cap), which offers products used in the reconstructive, medical and surgical, and neurotechnology and spine arenas. The strategy likes that Stryker has upped EPS in all but one year of the past decade -- and the lone time it didn't was a $0.01 decline three years ago -- and that it has averaged an ROE of 18.4% over that period. Stryker's debt ($1.75 billion) is also reasonable given its $1.4 billion in annual earnings, and the firm is generating $2.38 in free cash flow per share. Its shares also trade at a very reasonable earnings yield of about 6.6%. Financial stocks are still living under a cloud of fear thanks to the 2008-09 crisis. But fear and emotion matter to Buffett only in the sense that they can make a good stock cheap. He's more concerned with numbers and facts, and Baltimore-based Price's numbers look quite good. My Buffett-based model likes that it has upped EPS in all but two years of the past decade (2008 and 2009, and it has bounced back strong since then), and that it has averaged a 19.1% ROE over the past 10 years.For financials, the Buffett model also looks at return on assets over the past 10 years, targeting firms with an average ROA of at least 1% over that period; Price ($15 billion market cap) blows that away, at 16.8%. Its shares aren't dirt cheap, trading at an earnings yield of about 4.9%, but given the quality of Price's fundamentals, the model thinks it's worth a good look. This New Jersey-based home goods and furnishings retailer ($16 billion market cap) has more than 1,000 stores in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and has taken in about $9.5 billion in sales in the past 12 months. It has upped EPS in all but one year of the past decade, has no long-term debt, and has averaged an ROE of more than 20% over the past 10 years. It's also producing more than $4 in free cash flow per share, and trades at a 6% earnings yield -- a solid price for a well-financed, very consistent firm. Buffett has a well-known penchant for insurance companies, and my Buffett-based model likes this Georgia-based health and life insurer ($20 billion market cap). Aflac's EPS have dipped three times in the past decade, including last year. But after the first two dips it bounced back strong, and my Buffett model sees the most recent dip as a buying opportunity. The company has averaged a 16.6% ROE and a 2.0% return on assets over the past decade, and it's generating more than $3 in free cash flow per share.

Cognizant trimmed its outlook for 2012 primarily due to a slower-than-anticipated acceleration in demand.For full-year 2012, management expects revenues to rise at least 20% annually to $7.34 billion, down from its previous forecast of $7.53 billion. Earnings per share are likely to be $3.36, down from the previous estimate of $3.43. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, earnings per share are forecasted at $3.62, down from its earlier projection of $3.69.Consequently, seventeen out of the nineteen analysts covering the stock decreased their estimates for 2012, leading to a $0.10 decline in estimates.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2012 is $3.37, down from $3.45 in the last thirty days. Earnings estimates for 2013 declined by $0.15 to $3.95 in the last thirty days.The company anticipated somewhat soft and volatile European business in February but North America was expected to be normal. However, business was slower than expected in North America at the end of April. In particular, banking portion of the financial services segment and the pharmaceuticals portion of the healthcare segment were weaker than usual.The pharmaceutical industry continues to experience a significant transformation due to the large number of drugs coming off-patent. This patent cliff has resulted in curtailment of discretionary spend, which in turn has impacted the growth rate.The banking sector was weak due to softness among large North American clients, where there remains a heightened focus on cost optimization due to macroeconomic and regulatory pressures, which are driving fundamental changes in their business models.Consequently, IT spend has been adversely impacted. Also, ramp in discretionary projects has been slower than expected among these larger clients.Nevertheless, we believe Cognizant remains well diversified among key verticals, such as financial services, health care & life sciences, retail, manufacturing and logistics, which will in turn, facilitate it to retain its top line.We continue to maintain a Neutral recommendation on Cognizant in the long-run.

Lowe's isn't alone. Home Depot, their chief competitor, announced a $1 Billion share buyback in late March.Buybacks, or share repurchases, are when a company starts to purchase its own stock, taking it off the market. Doing so lessens the number of outstanding shares held by the public. The buying pressure tends to increase the value of the shares, as does the fact that there are now fewer shares outstanding.Another side effect: Given the decreased number of shares, earnings per share will increase if profits remain unchanged.Lowe's stock has fallen 23% this year and buybacks are expected to. $5 billion in buybacks currently represents about a fifth of the market share. If Lowe's shares are currently undervalued, a rally in company profits will mean strong return on investments for the firm.Lastly, buying up stocks reduces the cash lying around the company. Having cash tied up in equities can look more attractive on a company's balance sheet and make it less attractive of a takeover target. (Free cash transfers to the acquiring company. This essentially lowers the actual cost of acquisition.)It should be noted that companies are no better than the average investors at repurchasing their own stocks with the \"buy low, sell high\" mentality.Interested in analyzing the buyback scene?We list below some of the big companies that recently announced buybacks.

The decision was taken with the sole intent of business expansion in one of the wealthiest countries of the world.The center was inaugurated by two eminent personalities: the Assistant Managing Director of the Singapore Economic Development Board, Yeoh Keat Chuan and the Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy in Singapore, Louis Mazel.The development center spreading across 30,000 square feet, is at a prime location, the Changi Business Park. Nearly 370 people will form the work force for Cognizant at this center who will use the Cognizant 2.0 web-based platform to communicate with other branches globally and provide cost-effective and technologically advanced services to its customers.Singapore is a leading Southeast Asian economy today having one of the highest per capita GDP (  ) in the world. This burgeoning economy has been party to Cognizant's transformational services in several of its niche industries which include insurance, banking, manufacturing, retail and many more. Hence, Cognizant is highly exuberant about proliferating its hold even more on this vast economy through this new development center.Cognizant reported its fourth quarter financial results of 2011 on February 8, 2012, whereby a whopping growth was observed. Revenues for the year rose around 33% annually to reach $6.12 billion, which marginally surpassed management's expectations too.Treading on the same path, management currently targets an annual revenue growth rate of 23% rise for 2012. It is lucid from its current advances that it has chalked out a clear path and is quite 'cognizant' about how to reach that goal which is highly laudatory considering the currently volatile fiscal scenario pervading across industries.The company appears to be in quite a formidable position to battle its competitors which include  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).

Volume was below open interest, which indicates an existing position was sold. Roughly 5,200 August 65 puts were purchased at the same time for $1.40 to $1.50, according to our Depth Charge tracking system.The activity probably resulted from an investor rolling a position in the 67.50 contracts to the lower strike and increasing its size.

We get a day in the market like Monday, August 8 and \"Chicken Little\" shows up everywhere: Radio, television, newspapers, magazines and the Internet. Yet somehow, we survive it all. But no matter how often our so-called experts get it wrong, they remain steadfast in their desire to forecast our doom with their gloom.It's been more than 40 years ago when I first entered the investment business that many friends and family admonished me to reconsider my career path. Their reasoning was simple. There is simply no possible way that the US economy could survive and prosper under the weight of our enormous national debt. In 1970, the year I entered the business, our national debt sat somewhere between $370 and $380 billion. Of course, today our national debt hovers somewhere around $13 trillion and growing.Before I go further, I want to clarify one important matter. Nothing I've already written or am about to write is meant to trivialize our serious national debt issue. The amount of debt that our government has piled up in the last 40-plus years is egregious and needs to be addressed. On the other hand, a great motivating factor for writing this is to attempt to separate government and the economy. From my perspective, I clearly see government as a major expense item on our economic profit and loss statement. However, I reject the notion that the government either runs the economy or is responsible for its health. Would it not be true, that if our government ran our economy, that we would be at best a socialistic state, or at worst a communistic state. But in truth, we are a democracy, and our economy is one built on free enterprise and consequently is market-driven.Therefore, our free-market based economy is run and driven by the economic forces of supply and demand. On this basis what matters most is the attitude of the businesses, consumers and other important components of our economic decision-making processes.  , how we feel about our economy has a great deal to do with how we behave, which has a large impact on our economic growth and health.  , if we all believe our economy is weak it can easily turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy. On the other hand, when our confidence is high our economy tends to be healthier.Therefore, it's really important to understand what drives our economy and what doesn't. I believe that the overall level of productivity is a major contributing factor to the continuation of economic growth. Essential in this regard would be the primary factors of production, which are land labor and capital. Additional important factors would include research and development and other paths to innovation that promise to increase productivity. But most importantly, government is not a factor of production, as previously stated - it's an expense.In the Berkshire Hathaway ([[BRK.A]],[[BRK.B]]) 1994 annual report, Warren Buffett wrote something that had a major impact on me at the time and has continued to contribute to my general thinking about investing to this day. Consequently, I consider it one of my favorite Buffett quotes, as well as one of the most important lessons he ever offered the general investing public. I'm going to present the entire quote; however, I am going to break it down into shorter snippets in order to elaborate its important message. But before I do that, I offer this lament: How can people ignore the following aphorism to the point of not even considering its important lesson?The first sentence of this important Warren Buffett quote establishes its message: \"We will continue to ignore political and economic forecasts which are an expensive distraction for many investors and businessmen.\" With his first sentence, Buffett is telling us that he considers politics and economic forecasts an expensive distraction.  , he is in effect imploring us, as will become more evident later, to focus precisely on what we own, rather than generalities that may or may not impact us in the long run.The point I am attempting to make here is a simple one. Routinely, I talk to many people who can tell me in precise detail not only what the politicians in the United States are arguing about, but also what's going on in politics in other nations all over the world. They get this information from the daily bombarding of negative and scary headlines offered by the mass media. Yet ironically, if I asked them questions about their precise holdings they cannot answer them. For example, if I asked them whether the companies they own had a good quarterly earnings report, or how many of their companies raised their dividends or announced stock buybacks et cetera, they usually have no clue.In other words, I believe investors obsess about things that although scary, do not have a direct long-term impact on their specific portfolios, but only their short-term attitudes about them. The next line in the Buffett quote speaks to my point:What these important words tell us is that with investing, there is always something to worry about, keep in mind these words were written in 1994.However, perhaps the most important lesson that this, my favorite Buffett quote, can teach us is found in the next phrase as follows:Here Buffett is telling us that the prospects and rewards of owning good businesses are often independent of the general political and economic environment we find ourselves in. He is also speaking to the importance of investing in good businesses at sound valuations. Finally, we believe he is telling us that it's more important for us to focus precisely on what we own, because this is where our true long-term rewards or losses will come from.The final three sentences in this profound Buffett advice are most relevant to the purpose of this article:Once again, I believe Buffett is advising us to focus on our precise holdings and their unique fundamental strengths, and worry less about what's going on in more general terms. An old Wall Street adage summarizes my point: \"Wall Street climbs a wall of worry.\" Of course the most important lesson here is not to let fear overcome reason. As promised, what follows is the Buffett quote in its entirety:What comes next are four real-life examples looked at through the lens of our  research tool. Admittedly these four selections are hand-picked, because the theme of this article relates to focusing on precisely what you own and carefully researching them before you buy them. Our first two examples will look at what we consider to be pure unadulterated growth stocks. Our third and fourth example will look at two blue-chip dividend growth stocks.Our first example is Cognizant Technology Solutions (  ). \"Headquartered in Teaneck, New Jersey, Cognizant is a leading provider of information technology, consulting, and business process outsourcing services, dedicated to helping the world's leading companies build stronger businesses ...\"The focal point of the following graph is the plotting of each year's earnings since calendar year 2004 as represented by the orange line with white triangles. Notice how during the great recession this well-managed company, with no debt on the balance sheet, generated powerful earnings advances in spite of the economic crisis. Furthermore, also consider that the significant drop in stock price from 2007 to 2008 of approximately $48 per share to a low of approximately $14 a share was unjustified based on operating results. Perhaps even more importantly, notice how the stock price had recovered to a high of over $80 a share by spring of 2011. Finally, we need to ask ourselves if the current price drop based on the recent level of panic in the marketplace is also warranted.The performance results associated with the above graph illustrate how powerful the rewards can be when the focus is on the specific business results of the company instead of on general economic conditions. The total annualized rate of return for this non-dividend paying growth stock was in excess of 25% per annum at a time when the general market produced very weak results.Our second example looks at one of today's most highly recognized growth stocks, Apple Inc. Thanks to the significant innovations that this company has developed in recent years, its earnings growth has been nothing short of spectacular. Nevertheless, even with this outstanding operating performance, Apple's stock price was more than cut in half during the great recession. Of course, the subsequent recovery in the stock price has also been nothing short of outstanding.The associated performance results for AAPL since calendar year 2004 are truly remarkable. And, as this article is designed to point out, the more than 59% compounded rate of return that Apple generated for shareholders was achieved independent of the economic or political environment that prevailed during this time.McDonald's Corp. (  )When looking at dividend growth stocks like our first example, McDonald's Corp., the focus on the orange earnings line is still very important. However, the light blue shaded area on the following graph depicts dividends paid out of earnings. What is clear from the graph is how McDonald's stock price tracked its consistent earnings growth record of over 17% per annum. The dividend growth investor can still face day-to-day stock price volatility, but the advantage of carefully selected dividend growth stocks is the consistent reward from the increasing dividend.At the bottom of the McDonald's chart, we can see that the dividend increased from $0.55 per share to an estimated $2.49 per share for calendar year 2011. Since dividend growth investors tend to be long-term owners focused on dividends, they were rewarded even during the great recession of 2008 by the growing dividend representing an annual increase in pay.With the performance results associated with the above graph, we find that McDonald's was an exceptional investment prior to and during the great recession of 2008. As stated above, the most important attribute to focus on here is the rapidly growing dividend record of this recession resistant company.Our fourth and final example looks at Johnson & Johnson (  ), a company whose AAA credit rating is currently even higher than the US government's, at least according to one rating agency. Once again we see an example of a very consistent earnings growth rate through the recession. However, the recession did cause its earnings growth rate to slow, but not fall. This graph also shows that JNJ has typically commanded a premium price earnings ratio relative to its earnings growth. However, since the great recession of 2008 this extremely high-quality company now trades at a discount to its earnings justified valuation (the orange line).As was the case with McDonald's, when looking at the associated performance results with the above  , we once again see an example in JNJ where it was able to raise the dividend every year since calendar year 2004. Although the growth rate was not as fast as we saw with McDonald's, the current yield approaching 4%, thanks to its current low valuation, represents an intriguing purchase opportunity. Possibly for the first time ever, Johnson & Johnson offers investors a starting dividend yield that is more than they can earn on a 30-year treasury bond. It's also important to mention that a high starting valuation was the major contributing factor to Johnson & Johnson's modest returns.This article is about casting a light of reason on the longer-term perspective in contrast to what is typically an emotionally charged attitude about short-term volatility. It is understandably human nature to judge the performance of our portfolios based primarily on their closing stock price for any given day, week, month, or even quarter. The point we're trying to make here is that it is not the most important factor, unless you were actually planning to sell on the day you measure it. Otherwise, the intrinsic value derived from the operating results that your companies generate is, beyond a shadow of a doubt, more important than price volatility.Part of the problem lies in the complexity that most investors face when attempting to evaluate their specific portfolios beyond price alone. The media only speaks to generalities about the stock market, the economy or politics. Therefore, the everyday investor can only judge their holdings, outside of stock price, against the backdrop of what is generally happening. On the other hand, there are ways that investors could organize the information they receive to focus more on their actual specific holdings. By doing this, they could keep track of their earnings and dividend records, as well as other important news relating specifically to their portfolio holdings.Buffett's timeless quote, along with the four examples cited in this article, provide prima facie evidence that supports our thesis. Leave the broader economic issues to all the pundits who relish the opportunity to predict the unpredictable. Regarding your own financial futures, place your attention on what you actually own and focus specifically on the performances of the businesses behind your investments. There is no place in investing for allowing emotions to interfere with sound judgments. If others are selling because they're afraid, you can ignore that on the basis of the confidence you have in what you actually own.

Heavy options volume on the tape appears to be part of a put spread from one moderately bearish investor.CTSH shares are relatively in-line with the broader market strength. The stock has gained more than 1%, or 73 cents, to $55.29 during afternoon trading. CTSH is due to announce earnings figures on Aug. 3 before the market opens. Analysts estimate earnings of 52 cents per share. The October 47.5 puts and October 52.5 puts were active during Monday's trading session thanks to an investor who expects at least 14% of downside during the next three months.At 1:31 p.m. EDT, roughly 4,500 October 47.5-52.5 put spreads crossed the tape for a net premium of $1.30 per spread. The lower-strike puts changed hands for 80 cents per contract while the higher-strike puts traded for $2.10 per contract. Current open interest in the October 47.5 puts and 52.5 puts is 323 contracts and 1,700 contracts, respectively. This options action suggests the investor is willing to limit risk and reward by opening this bear put spread position.The maximum gain on this bearish spread is $3.70, or the width of the spread minus the premium paid. The premium paid represents the maximum loss on this put spread. Maximum loss occurs if CTSH shares are trading higher than the long put strike at expiration. The investor makes money if the stock is trading below the short put strike at October options expiration. If the stock is trading between the long put strike and the breakeven price of $51.20, the investor takes back some of the debit.Implied volatility of the October 47.5 puts is 37% while the 52.5-strike puts are trading with an implied volatility of 33%. It looks like at least one investor could be wagering that volatility will increase enough to put pressure on the stock to warrant purchasing this bear put spread.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["()Strategy: If a stock is down more than 3% since yesterday's close, buy it, and sell it on the close 10 trading sessions later.But which stocks seeing losses today might be good candidates for this strategy?To help you get ideas, we started with a universe of about 200 stocks that have declined by more than 3% since yesterday's close (i.e. strategy candidates).We went back in time, and evaluated how many times these stocks rebounded from similar losses over the last quarter.For each backtested rebound strategy, we'll also report the average return made on the investment (ignoring transaction costs).Recent history suggests that these stocks are resilient, and may rebound from today's sell-off.

While it's true companies may not be hiring more workers just yet, they are indeed spending their cash on ways to improve efficiency and profits such as upgrading IT systems or reducing tech support costs. That makes tech stocks in India a great investment right now.During the tech boom of the '90s, the Indian software industry grew from a mere $150 million business at the dawn of the decade to a staggering $5.7 billion (including over $4 billion worth of software exports) in 2000. And now? The software industry exports mover $50 billion a year and is one of the tech centers of the world. Though agriculture and basic industry are larger portions of India's GDP, no other group of businesses have performed so well in the last few decades as the nation's tech sector.What's more, the growth shows no sign of slowing. India's software and service exports in 2009 grew by more than 15% even in a tough economic climate. With an average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% for the past two decades, the Indian economy is among the fastest growing in the world and continues to provide great conditions for tech stocks.To help you capitalize on this growth of tech in India, here are my top 3 Indian tech stocks:India's  (  ) provides IT outsourcing services to companies worldwide.

Specifically, CTSH earned $144 million, or 47 cents per share on the quarter. That's up 28% from $112.3 million or 38 cents per share a year earlier. Revenue also jumped 20 percent to $902.7 million. CTSH is a great buy below $55.India's  (  ) is one of the leading providers of system integration and help desk services in the world. It also provides outsourced research and development, infrastructure outsourcing and business consulting services to companies in the West. Wipro clients come from a range of industries including energy and utilities, retail, financial services, the media and healthcare. In its latest quarter, the company's sales rose 5.9% to $1.51 billion compared with $1.43 billion in the same quarter a year ago. During the same period, Wipro's net earnings rose 19% to $261.1 million compared with $219.42 million. These earnings were 20% better than analysts' consensus estimates. For its current quarter, I expect 19.7% sales growth and 41.7% earnings growth. The stock has a strong earnings surprise history and is a great buy below $25.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ognizant Technology Solutions is starting to roll over after hitting an all-time high, and one investor is looking for a pullback. optionMONSTER's Depth Charge tracking system detected the purchase of more than 3,000 November 62.50 puts, most of which priced for $2.40, against open interest of just 211 contracts. Puts account for a bearish 89 percent of the activity in the IT outsourcing company so far today.CTSH is down 0.16 percent to $64.53 in midday trading.

During midday trading, one investor rolled out long positions in the stock, but not without a caveat.Around 11:42 a.m. EST, the investor sold to close 13,000 January 37.5 calls for 12.30 per contract, and bought to open 4,700 January 2012 47.5 calls for $9.50 per contract. Current open interest of the January 37.5 calls is 13,000 contracts, which is why the investor likely closed this long position. The January 2012 47 calls are home to current open interest of 16 contracts, indicating the investor bought these calls to open.Why the volume discrepancy? This investor is maintaining exposure in CTSH, but could arguably be taking a less aggressive bullish stance on the company by taking some chips off the table. But keep in mind that the investor also rolled up to the 47.5-strike, maintaining the bet that CTSH shares could climb.One reason for this could be that CTSH share have climbed 20% since November. The stock is currently down four cents so far today to $48.12, up near its 52-week high of $48.95. So, this investor rolled out long call positions expecting further upside, but isn't willing to have as much capital at risk.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ver the past two years, the stock market has been driven largely by macroeconomic factors. That's not surprising, given just how powerful the economic winds have been. In late 2008 and early 2009, we experienced one of the worst financial crises in the country's history as the credit and housing bubbles burst. Then, the U.S. and other governments around the world sent an unprecedented wave of stimulus around the globe, helping to stabilize and jumpstart the stalled economy.Given the extreme emotions such major economic events cause, it's easy to see why hordes of investors have moved in near-lock-step in and out of the market amid the events of these past two turbulent years. The crisis of 2008 caused widespread fear that rippled through the markets, and investors fled from stocks; the stimulus efforts and economic rebound that began several months later then led to a huge sense of relief, and investors jumped back into stocks.Today, there are still big macroeconomic factors in play -- the skyrocketing levels of debt at the federal and state levels is a good example. But as we move further from the epicenter of the crisis, it seems likely that we'll start to see less correlation among stocks. As is usually the case in the markets, earnings results will separate the winners from the losers. And, with many fearing a period of slower-than-usual growth, firms producing strong earnings growth figure to be particularly prized by investors.If you're looking for companies likely to generating strong growth, you'd be wise to consider the writings of Martin Zweig. Zweig's stock recommendation newsletter was ranked number one based on risk-adjusted returns by Hulbert Financial Digest during the 15 years Hulbert monitored it, and the growth-rich strategy Zweig laid out in his Winning on Wall Street forms the basis for one of my more successful \"Guru Strategy\" computer models. In the seven-plus years I've been tracking it, a 10-stock portfolio picked with this strategy has gained 54.3%, or 6.3% per year. Over the same period, the S&P 500 has gained just 12.0%, or 1.6% per year.While many investors rely on simple earnings growth metrics like the five-year or trailing 12-month earnings per share growth rates, the approach Zweig lays out in his writings is far more thorough. My Zweig-inspired model dissects earnings in a number of different ways, looking not only for strong long-term growth of at least 15% (I use an average of the three-, four-, and five-year EPS growth to determine a long-term rate), but also for accelerating growth. It targets firms whose EPS growth for the current quarter (vs. the same quarter last year) is greater than the average growth for the previous three quarters (vs. the respective three year-ago quarters), and greater than the long-term growth rate. By using criteria like these, Zweig made sure he wasn't getting in late on a stock that was coming to the end of a strong growth run.In addition, Zweig was concerned not only with magnitude of growth, but also with the type of growth a firm was producing. He didn't want strong earnings growth figures to be propped up by one-time windfalls or cost-cutting measures that weren't sustainable over the long haul. He thus looked for firms that were also producing strong revenue growth, since sales are the main driver of sustainable long-term earnings growth. My Zweig-inspired model requires a firm's long-term revenue growth to be at least 85 percent of EPS growth. (An exception is if a stock fails that test, but is still growing revenues at a 30% or higher clip per year, since that is still a very strong revenue growth rate.)Zweig also didn't want earnings to be propped up by excessive leverage that would come back to hurt the firm's bottom line later on. He thus looked at the debt/equity ratio, but he didn't use an absolute number for his target; he recognized that companies in different industries carry different levels of debt, so my Zweig-based model requires that a firm's D/E ratio be lower than its industry average.One last thing about Zweig's approach to growth: He was willing to pay a premium for it -- to a point. The model I base on his writings requires a firm to have a price/earnings ratio no greater than three times the market average, and never more than 43. It also requires that a firm not have too low a P/E ratio (under 5). Zweig found that very low P/Es were indications that a firm was a dog, and that everyone knew it was a dog.As you can see, the Zweig method's earnings assessment is quite rigorous, and usually there aren't a whole lot of stocks that pass all its tests. Here are a few that currently do have what it takes to make the grade. My Zweig model just upgraded this tech giant and earnings juggernaut last week. It likes the $239-billion-market-cap firm's strong long-term earnings growth rate (68.8%) and long-term revenue growth rate (33.9%, based on an average of the three-, four-, and five-year revenue growth figures), and the fact that earnings growth accelerated to 74.6% in the most recent quarter. In addition, Apple has no long-term debt, and its shares sell for about 19.7 times trailing 12-month earnings. That's higher than the market average, but quite reasonable when you consider the growth the company is producing. This Missouri-based bakery/cafe chain operates close to 1,400 stores in 40 states and Canada under the Panera Bread, Saint Louis Bread Co. and Paradise Bakery & Cafe names. The $2.5-billion-market-cap firm gets a perfect 100% score from my Zweig-based model. A few reasons: Its strong, accelerating earnings growth (30.8% in the most recent quarter, up from 28% in the three previous quarters, which is up from 16.2% over the long haul); its 20.4% long-term revenue growth rate; and its lack of any long-term debt. The stock also trades for about 24 times trailing 12-month earnings, not bad considering its strong growth history. Based in New Jersey, this I/T firm provides an array of technology and business services, and has clients across five different continents. It recently reported strong second-quarter earnings, and that's one of the reasons my Zweig-based model is high on it. Cognizant ($18 billion market cap) grew EPS at a 29% rate in the second quarter, up from an average of 25.2% in the previous three quarters. It's been growing revenues at a strong 37.2% clip over the long haul, and has no long-term debt, two more reasons the Zweig-based model likes the stock. This $2.9-billion-market-cap auto part firm is the largest nationwide provider of recycled light vehicle OEM products and related services, and the largest provider of aftermarket collision replacement products. Based in Chicago, it has a history of stellar earnings growth, upping EPS at a 29.8% rate over the long haul, and an even-better 30.0% rate in the most recent quarter. It's also been growing revenues at a 37.7% clip over the long haul, and sells for a reasonable 18.7 times trailing 12-month earnings. The lone flaw my Zweig-based model sees with LKQ is that its debt/equity ratio is higher than its industry average. The difference isn't particularly troublesome, however -- LKQ's D/E is 46.1%, while its industry average is 42.7%.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Financial stocks took a broadside yesterday that not only drove down the sector, but also caused the Dow Jones Industrial Average (  ) to close under 10,000 for the first time since Nov. 4.Bank of America (  ), off 3.5%, with the biggest price decline in the Dow, and the other Dow financial stocks, were the prime cause of the triple-digit-down day.Financials also make up a significant portion of Nasdaq (  ), and it, too, had big losses. The S&P 500 also fell as a result of heavy selling in the financials, but all of its other sectors were lower, as well.American Express (  ) fell 2.8%, Travelers (  ) fell 2.5 %, and JPMorgan Chase (  ) fell 1.6%.But there were a few winners yesterday: Rubbermaid (  ) rose 1.7% after Morgan Stanley (  ) raised its rating on the stock. And Home Depot (  ) jumped 2.2% for the same reason. Hasbro (  ) popped 12.7% after the toy company reported a big earnings increase, and CVS Caremark (  ) jumped 5.3% following news of an 11% increase in net profit.The U.S. dollar weakened versus both the euro and the yen.At the close, the Dow was off 104 points at 9,908, the S&P 500 was even at 1,066, and the Nasdaq got hammered for more than 15 points at 2,126.The NYSE traded just over 1 billion shares with advancers trailing decliners by a ratio of 8-to-5. The Nasdaq traded 643 million shares with decliners ahead by 9-to-5.March crude oil rose 70 cents to $71.89 a barrel, and the Energy Select Sector SPDR (  ) fell 50 cents to $53.74.April gold rose $13.40 to $1,066 an ounce. The PHLX Gold/Silver Sector Index (  ) fell $4.91 to $149.34.Friday's set of reversals were not only dramatic, coming on high volume and late in the day, but they temporarily averted an intermediate breakdown of each of the major indices. But yesterday's triple-digit Dow loss places investors back on the defensive, putting the indices very close to some major technical break points.The current outlook depends on the ability of the indices to hold above Friday's intraday reversal lows. A failure to hold above Friday's reversal low at S&P 1,041 could trigger a quick test of the bottom of the current range, which is 1,020. And just before the bottom of the range is the 200-day moving average at 1,022, which, if decisively penetrated, could change the long-term trend.Applying those ranges to the Dow and Nasdaq gives us the following support numbers:As an astute trader and investor, you should know the importance of these support numbers, and at each stage have an investment plan that includes stocks that you want to buy at prices you are willing to pay and stop-loss points that will automatically protect you against unacceptable losses.Planning today may not only avoid tomorrow's disaster, but provide structure and discipline with a procedure that could reap untold future rewards.

I, for one, couldn't imagine getting anything done without my trusty  (  ) iPhone and laptop with me 24/7.But this bullishness on the entire tech sector can be confusing for investors. Some technology stocks are getting a lot of hype that's deserved, but others are simply being lifted by a rising tide for technology firms right now.How can you tell the difference? Simple: Follow the fundamentals. My proprietary Portfolio Grader stock-ranking tool runs a fundamental analysis on the top 5,000 Wall Street companies every week. My team of analysts and I sift through the latest earnings forecasts, sales numbers, margin expansion percentages and a host of other figures. Our results are screened based on what's working best on Wall Street right now, and then Portfolio Grader outputs a rating for each company reflected as a simple letter grade, with A being \"strong buy\" and F being \"strong sell.\" .

With all due respect to Mr. Smith, and all the other doomsayers out there, I frankly just don't get it. In my opinion, fear is a negative emotion that causes more harm than good. My favorite acronym for FEAR is: False Evidence Appearing Real.People who are worried about whether the stock market will crash or not are worried about a generality. In contrast, the world's most successful investors are known to deal solely with specifics. Investing giants like Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch are on record as ignorers of the general stock market. Instead, they are only interested in the specific companies they own.Regarding the stock market, there is also a lot of talk about the so-called \"Lost Decade\". I will use the S&P 500 since calendar year 2000 as my proxy for the \"Stock Market\", and its dreadful decade in this article. However, my contention is that unless you have all your liquid assets invested in the S&P 500 or some other passive index fund, the general market should be of little concern.In Figure 1 below, we show the S&P 500 correlated to its earnings since 12/31/1999 to include performance. There are three key factors that are obvious from this graph:In his runaway national bestselling book \"One Up on Wall Street\", Peter Lynch devoted Chapter 5 to the thesis of my article titled \"  ?  .\" Mr. Lynch clearly and eloquently expressed his disdain for attempting to forecast the stock market. The following snippets from Chapter 5 illustrate the point:Finally Mr. Lynch added:In the long run, earnings determine market price, and valuation plays a prominent role. Utilizing our Fundamentals-at-a-Glance research tool, I offer the following examples that validate the thesis and premises of this article. I will illustrate some stalwart like, solid growing businesses, and will sprinkle in a few powerhouse fast growers. Then I will add two examples of how overvaluation impacted returns even when earnings growth was strong.I start with Nike (  ), Figure 2. Note that Nike's stock price (black line) starts out slightly above the earnings line (green line with white triangles) implying modest overvaluation. However, earnings growth of 13.4% translates into annual 10% appreciation (excluding dividends) compared to a minus 2.9% annual loss for the S&P 500, or the stock market.In Figure 3 we feature Cognizant Technologies Solutions (  ) a fast-growing outsourcer that has no debt and an earnings growth rate of almost 40% (39.8%). Clearly, the stock market had absolutely nothing to do with the returns that Cognizant shareholders enjoyed. Figure 4 features TEVA Pharmaceutical Industries (  ), an Israel based ADR, the largest generic drug developer in the world. With earnings growth over 29% per year, TEVA shareholders enjoyed annual appreciation of almost 20% even though their stock price (black line) is currently at a discount to earnings (green line with white triangle). Once again, the stock market didn't matter to TEVA Shareholders.Figure 5 features ITT Educational Services, Inc. (  ). Strong earnings right through the recession rewarded shareholders far in excess of the general stock market.Figure 6 features Coach Inc. (  ) where 30% growth of earnings translates into a similar shareholder return, regardless of the bad market. Note that both Coach and the S&P 500 are measured only from October of 2000 because Coach was not a public company in 1999.Figure 7 features Google, Inc. (  ) and only has a track record since going public in 2004. However, once again, there is no correlation or relationship to Google shareholder results and the stock market (S&P 500).Figures 8 and 9 are offered to illustrate the importance of valuation. Both Procter & Gamble Co. (  ), a Peter Lynch stalwart, and Oracle (  ), a faster-growing technology company suffered from overvaluation at the beginning of the period. Both of these companies generated returns that were closer to the general stock market. However, it was overvaluation and not the market that affected their respective results.These are but a few examples of many that could be offered. Remember the stock market is about averages, and as Warren Buffett also said \"Who wants to be average?\" It is better to focus on what you own and not worry about things you don't. I believe you will find this to be more peaceful and profitable, in the long run.We, like Peter Lynch and Warren Buffett, believe that all the fuss about what the stock markets in general may or may not do is unwarranted, assuming - of course - that valuation is in line with cash flows. At the end of the day, we feel that all it does is take the investor's eye off the critical ball of what they actually are invested in. Wall Street may climb a wall of worry, but good businesses climb a wall of business success, more commonly known as earnings. Therefore, what the stock market may or may not do really shouldn't matter to the serious long-term fundamental investor.See also  on seekingalpha.comThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."]], "Title": ["Google Cancels Job Offers to More Than 2,000 Workers", ["Google Cancels Job Offers to More Than 2,000 Workers"], ["Wall Street jumps as historic job losses better than feared"], ["BUZZ-U.S. STOCKS ON THE MOVE-Banks, Uber, Roku, Sorrento Therapeutics"], ["Nasdaq 100 Movers: UAL, ZM"], ["Nasdaq 100 Movers: CTSH, UAL"], ["BUZZ-U.S. STOCKS ON THE MOVE-Roku, Spirit Airlines, Uber, Shopify"], ["Friday Sector Laggards: Healthcare, Technology & Communications"], ["Interesting CTSH Put And Call Options For July 10th"], ["BUZZ-U.S. STOCKS ON THE MOVE-Banks, Boeing, Uber, Disney"], ["Implied TDIV Analyst Target Price: $44"], ["FOCUS-Tech firms sweeten deals for U.S. banks cutting costs in crisis"], ["Ex-Dividend Reminder: Assured Guaranty, Cognizant Technology Solutions and Equinix "], ["Wall Street rises on better-than-feared jobs report, easing Sino-U.S. tension"], ["Wall Street rises on better-than-feared jobs report, easing Sino-U.S. tension"], ["Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.
