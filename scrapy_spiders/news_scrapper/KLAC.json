Huawei Technologies Co Ltd  for its part denounced the U.S. allegations and called the new measures \"arbitrary and pernicious.\" Established in 2004, HiSilicon develops chips mostly for Huawei, and for most of its existence has been an afterthought in a global chip business dominated by U.S., Korean and Japanese companies. Like most electronics firms, Huawei relied on others for the chips that powered its equipment.But heavy investment in research and development helped drive rapid progress at HiSilicon, and in recent years the 7,000-employee unit has been central to Huawei's rise as a dominant player in the global smartphone business and the emerging 5G telecom networking business.HiSilicon's Kirin smartphone processor is now considered to be on par with those created by Apple Inc  and Qualcomm Inc  --a rare example of an advanced Chinese semiconductor product that competes globally.HiSilicon is also central to Huawei's leadership in 5G, stepping into the breach when the United States cut off access to some U.S. chips last year. In March, Huawei revealed that 8% of the 50,000 5G base stations it sold in 2019 came with no U.S. technology, using HiSilicon chipsets instead.But the U.S. export control rule, first reported by Reuters last week, aims to block HiSilicon's access to two crucial tools: chip design software from U.S. firms including Cadence Design Systems Inc  and Synopsys Inc , and the manufacturing prowess of \"foundries,\" led by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd , that build chips for many of the world's top semiconductor firms. With the new restrictions\uff0cHiSilicon \"will be in a situation where they\u2019re not able to manufacture chips at all, or if they do, then they\u2019re not leading edge anymore,\" says Stewart Randall, who tracks China's chip industry at Shanghai-based consultancy Intralink.Without its own processors, Huawei will lose its edge over domestic smartphone rivals, analysts said. International sales had already been gutted by a ban on the use of key Google software.Industry sources say Huawei has stockpiled chips, and the new U.S. rule will not go into full force for 120 days. U.S. officials also note that licenses could be granted for some technologies. HiSilicon can also keep using design software it has already acquired.Still, analysts agree HiSilicon is in a tough spot. Nearly all chip factories globally -- including China's leading foundry, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp  -- buy gear from the same equipment makers, led by U.S. firms Applied Materials Inc , Lam Research Corp  and KLA Corp .The new U.S. rule requires licenses for companies using U.S. machinery to build Huawei-designed chips and delivered to the Chinese firm. To be sure, the new rule will not catch items shipped to a third party, allowing HiSilicon's fabricators like TSMC the ability to ship chips to HiSilicon\u2019s device manufacturers who can send them directly to a customer.While there are alternatives to American machines - Japan's Tokyo Electron Ltd , for example, makes gear that competes with Applied Materials - replacing U.S. technology is not as simple as swapping out a machine.\u201cYou almost have to think about it like a heart transplant,\" said VLSI Research Chief Executive Dan Hutcheson, noting that chip production lines are finely calibrated systems where everything has to work well together.Doug Fuller of the Chinese University of Hong Kong said Huawei had a few options. It could slip around the rule by having suppliers ship directly to Huawei customers, though the U.S. officials said they would be vigilant about such workarounds.Huawei and the Chinese government could re-double efforts to build production capabilities that did not require U.S. tools, by investing in nascent Chinese competitors and buying from Japanese and Korean firms, even if that required quality sacrifices.Or Huawei could turn away from HiSilicon and revert to buying from overseas suppliers--just not American ones. \"There\u2019s talk of Huawei just turning to Samsung processors,\" for its smartphone, said Fuller.U.S. regulators open door to possible tightening of Huawei chip curbHuawei calls U.S. move to curb chips supply 'arbitrary', expects business impactU.S. moves to cut Huawei off from global chip suppliers as China eyes retaliationEXCLUSIVE-U.S. weighs new regulations to further restrict Huawei suppliers - sourcesEXCLUSIVE-U.S. prepares crackdown on Huawei's global chip supply -sources(Reporting by Josh Horwitz in Shanghai; Additional reporting by David Kirton in Shenzhen and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Lisa Shumaker)((; +86 21 20830007;))The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Looking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at , one standout is the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (Symbol: SOXX) where we have detected an approximate $173.1 million dollar inflow -- that's a 6.5% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 10,700,000 to 11,400,000).

We\u2019ll let CEO Jim Cannon explain. \u201cAs the COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented challenges around the globe, we are extremely proud that FLIR products and technology are playing a critical role in helping combat the spread of this virus,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a result, we continue to experience increased demand for our thermal cameras for use in Elevated Skin Temperature-or EST-screening\u201d\n                DaVita (DVA) has gained 4.3% after reporting a profit of $1.83 a share, beating forecasts for $1.47 a share. \u201cWhile COVID-19 creates some uncertainty (e.g. mix), we view DVA as well positioned given the company\u2019s scale, sophistication and the non-discretionary nature of dialysis treatments,\u201d writes SunTrust analyst David MacDonald. \u201cIn addition, financial flexibility/liquidity is attractive, further aiding strategic positioning, and we see areas of opportunity.\u201d\n                Prudential Financial (PRU) has slumped 7.8% after reporting earnings of $2.32 a share, well below the consensus estimate of $2.77 a share. \u201cPRU\u2019s results were not as poor as they appear at first glance, but were weak nonetheless,\u201d writes JPMorgan analyst Jimmy Bhullar. \u201cDownside to EPS remains a risk for the stock in the near term.\u201d He has an Overweight rating on the stock. \n                KLA Corp. (KLAC) has risen 5.3% after reporting a profit of $2.47 a share, beating analyst forecasts for $2.28 a share. \u201cWe...expect stock to outperform memory exposed peers on lower exposure to memory capex where we expect more cuts,\u201d writes Citi analyst Atif Malik. \u201cMoreover, we like multiple new products (Gen 5, X-ray, E-beam) firing this year.\u201d\n                L Brands (LB) stock continues to slide after its sale of a majority stake in Victoria\u2019s Secret to Sycamore Partners was called off.

The department said its \"announcement cuts off Huawei\u2019s efforts to undermine U.S. export controls.\"The rule change is a blow to Huawei, the world's no. 2 smartphone maker, as well as to Taiwan's Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd , a major producer of chips for Huawei's HiSilicon unit as well as mobile phone rivals Apple and Qualcomm. TMSC announced late Thursday it would build a $12 billion chip factory in Arizona. Huawei, which needs semiconductors for its widely used smartphones and telecoms equipment, is at the heart of a battle for global technological dominance between the United States and China.Huawei, which has warned that the Chinese government would retaliate if the rule went into effect, did not immediately comment on Friday. U.S. stock market futures turned negative on the Reuters report.\"The Chinese government will not just stand by and watch Huawei be slaughtered on the chopping board,\" Huawei Chairman Eric Xu told reporters on March 31.The United States is trying to convince allies to exclude Huawei gear from next generation 5G networks on grounds its equipment could be used by China for spying. Huawei has repeatedly denied the claim.Huawei has continued to use U.S. software and technology to design semiconductors, the Commerce Department said, despite being placed on a U.S. economic blacklist in May 2019.Under the rule change, foreign companies that use U.S. chipmaking equipment will be required to obtain a U.S. license before supplying certain chips to Huawei, or an affiliate like HiSilicon. TIn order for Huawei to continue to receive some chipsets or use some semiconductor designs tied to certain U.S. software and technology, it would need to receive licenses from the Commerce Department.NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNSCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox Business \"there has been a very highly technical loophole through which Huawei has been in able, in effect, to use U.S. technology with foreign fab producers.\" Ross called the rule change a \"highly tailored thing to try to correct that loophole.\"Ross said in a written statement Huawei had \"stepped-up efforts to undermine these national security-based restrictions.\"The Commerce Department said the rule will allow wafers already in production to be shipped to Huawei as long as the shipments are complete within 120 days from Friday. Chipsets would need to be in production by Friday or they would be  ineligible under the rule.The United States placed Huawei and 114 affiliates on its economic blacklist citing national security concerns. That forced some U.S. and foreign companies to seek special licenses from the Commerce Department to sell to it, but China hawks in the U.S. government have been frustrated by the vast number of supply chains beyond their reach.Separately, the Commerce Department extended a temporary license that was set to expire Friday to allow U.S. companies, many of which operate wireless networks in rural America, to continue doing business with Huawei through Aug. 13. It warned it expected this would be the final extension.Reuters first reported the administration was considering changes to the Foreign Direct Product Rule, which subjects some foreign-made goods based on U.S. technology or software to U.S. regulations, in November. Most chip manufacturers rely on equipment produced by U.S. companies like KLA , Lam Research  and Applied Materials , according to a report last year from China's Everbright Securities.The Trump administration has taken a series of steps aimed at Chinese telecom firms in recent weeks.The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) last month began the process of shutting down the U.S. operations of three state-controlled Chinese telecommunications companies, citing national security risks. The FCC also in April approved Alphabet Inc unit Google\u2019s  request to use part of an 8,000-mile  undersea telecommunications cable between the United States and Taiwan, but not Hong Kong, after U.S. agencies raised national security concerns.This week, President Donald Trump extended for another year a May 2019 executive order barring U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by companies deemed to pose a national security risk, a move seen aimed at Huawei and peer ZTE Corp.

[Operator Instructions]I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations with KLA Corporation. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead. -- Thank you, Charlie, and welcome to KLA's  to discuss the results of the March 2020 quarter and the outlook for the June quarter.

Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today are also subject to those risks and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.I'd like to now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wallace. -- Thank you all for joining us today in these extraordinary times. I hope you and your families are safe and healthy. KLA delivered strong results in the March 2020 quarter. Revenue finished at the midpoint of our guidance and non-GAAP EPS was above the midpoint of the guidance range, demonstrating strong demand from our customers and exceptional execution across our global KLA operations. KLA's performance in the March quarter highlights how the company's operating model and long-term strategic objectives provide a strong and resilient framework to guide our execution and consistently deliver on our commitments even during unprecedented challenges.In our prepared remarks today, we will discuss how KLA's unique and sustainable competitive advantages helped us consistently deliver strong relative results, while showcasing the enduring strength of the KLA investment thesis. We will also discuss how KLA is positioned to confidently navigate through these periods of uncertainty.To lead off, I want to highlight KLA's priorities and actions in addressing the COVID-19 crisis. Please turn to Slide 4. First and foremost, we are prioritizing the health and safety of our employees, their families and our partners. We began taking proactive measures for our teams as soon as we saw the outbreak began in China, including immediately eliminating non-essential travel, canceling our annual sales conference, our global engineering conference as well as the KLA lithography users form at SPIE.A large percentage of our workforce is in China and the Pacific region, and we initiated a global crisis management team to ensure we had insight into needs and activities at the local levels to provide assistance as needed. As information and shelter in place orders began to rollout across the globe, we prioritized rapid Communications to our employees and we immediately instituted guidelines and policies to ensure that our essential workforce could operate in a safe conditions and we remain focused on that daily.Specifically, as our teams worldwide have largely had to shift to working from home, we worked hard to maintain our ability to support our customers in this unique scenario. At our manufacturing facilities, we have focused on creating a significantly reduced employee footprint. We have rigorous social distancing and cleaning guidelines and health checks to allow our teams to be safe, while staying on track with shipping, installing and delivering the essential services we provide to our customers.I'd like to personally commend our global team for their resourcefulness and commitment to executing under these challenging circumstances. Our customer feedback has been outstanding and our business is healthy and performing well under unprecedented conditions. I'm really proud of the way we as a company have responded to these challenges. And really reflects the extraordinary strength of our teams guided by the KLA core values of perseverance, drive to be better, high performing teams and indispensability.For our global employee base, we recognize that this crisis also extends well beyond the disruption to their work life, and we're focusing on continuing to ensure that we can support them in any way that we can. I'd also like to note that we took action to support our communities by creating a KLA Foundation Global Relief Fund where we committed $2 million in global relief efforts to benefit local non-profit organizations which are working in areas identified as having a high number of affected individuals and with those who are with high-risk populations in Asia, Europe, Israel and the United States. Above all, we remained advocates for the holistic health and safety of our employees as well as the communities they work and live in.Turn now to Slide 5 for some comments on the industry demand environment. Though we were encouraged to see many of our customers in China return to full production late in the quarter, COVID-19 has already impacted global economic growth. The question remains whether it will result in a short-term push out in global demand supported by substantial levels of monetary and fiscal stimulus from governments or whether it leads to long-term demand decline followed by an elongated recovery.Many economic prognosticators now expect the global recession as the effects of business disruption, rising unemployment and reduction in consumer spending our felt across the global economy. So at KLA, we're not predicting the depth or duration of this impact until we have more evidence about the evolution of the crisis, but if there's one thing we do know it's the situation is rapidly evolving. And at this stage, the full impact of COVID-19 on consumer demand and the global economy remains unclear. But from our point of view, although the semiconductor equipment industry is currently supply constrained, customer demand remains strong in the first half of 2020. And to underscore that point, KLA delivered record shipments of our semiconductor process control systems during the quarter, and total backlog finished at record levels exiting March.It's also important to point out that KLA is most levered to our customers' strategic R&D investments and their product roadmaps for leading-edge technologies across foundry, logic and memory. Our customers view these investments as critical to their long-term growth strategies and their competitive positioning, and therefore, they tend to be more resilient. Now in the near-term and medium-term, we see increased semiconductor device demands for enterprise and cloud applications in response to the surge in work from home and a pickup in gaming. Now this is somewhat offset by a decline in some consumer-facing end markets.We also see strong results in our specialty semiconductor markets with demand driven by 5G infrastructure investment, particularly in China. We're fulfilling urgent request to supply products essential and MEMS manufacturing and power technologies focused on medical applications such as smart thermometers and ventilators, which are directly addressing the crisis.It's clear, healthcare will be one of the many industries which will be profoundly impacted with the acceleration of technology implementation, virtual capabilities and automation. We know that KLA is not immune to the impact this crisis may have on customers' capital investment plans over the next several months. However, we do draw some confidence from the historical evidence that our customers tend to maintain their investment in next generation development in times of semiconductor industry contraction and uncertainty, which makes KLA's revenue more resilient in times like this.As an example, I'd point out that in 2019, according to the recent Gartner market share analysis, total WFE investment was estimated to have declined about 6%, but KLA's semiconductor process control business grew at 1%. Taking a step back even further, it's worth highlighting that KLA's business has always declined less than the industry in periods of general contraction. Also, KLA's service business, which accounts for roughly one quarter of our total revenues today and has strong and growing profitability, also tends to demonstrate exceptional resilience throughout the business cycle, given the unique nature of our service model with 70% to 75% of the revenue being subscription like contracts.Given the continued focus on innovation and execution combined with our market leadership and strong balance sheet, KLA is in a very strong position to navigate this period of uncertainty and to capitalize on opportunities to drive long-term growth for our industry once the conditions eventually normalize. Even though we couldn't have anticipated what we're experiencing today, we believe that secular factors driving the industry demand and our 2023 revenue and EPS targets remains largely intact and they'll drive diversified growth with operating leverage over the long-term.Finally, in many ways, the global response to COVID-19 is accelerating secular drivers of the industry growth that we outlined in our 2019 Investor Day, and that gives us strong optimism that we and our industry will emerge from this crisis stronger than before. We always knew we had compelling secular growth trends a year ago, but if anything, these trends will be stronger and more important going forward. Whether it's the move to Industry 4.0 or factory automation, the rising semiconductor content in automobiles, remote medical diagnostics and care, 5G, ubiquitous connectivity, supported by continued data center build-outs or new more capable handset offerings, the new work from home reality or the overall acceleration of digitization and move to the data era, everything will depend on advancing semiconductor technology that KLA helps to make possible.Please turn to Slide 6 and 7 for a review of the KLA operating model and our strategic objectives. As in prior industry downturns, one thing that remains a constant serving as our guide as we manage through this uncertainty is the KLA operating model. This codifies our corporate values and management principles and defines the critical core competencies that drive our performance and represents a solid and enduring framework for the execution of our long-term strategic objectives.The KLA operating model is essential to aligning the company on a consistent strategy that ties accountability to results, ensures product development execution and facilitates continuous improvement, while ensuring the company always operates with strong financial discipline, while driving long-term performance and profitability objectives.As we indicated during our September 2019 Investor Day, we're also leveraging the KLA operating model to strengthen the performance of new businesses. We have recently reorganized the former Orbotech units under the leadership of long-term KLA Executive Vice President, Oreste Donzella, creating the new Electronics Packaging and Components or EPC group. This new organizational will help drive synergies and growth across a broad electronics value chain, including specialty semiconductors packaging, printed circuit boards and flat panel display.Guided by this and with our global teams' experience navigating through various industry cycles and downturns over the years, we have the benefit of history and the processes in place to maintain a high level of investment, which is critical to our market leadership and our customers' technology roadmap, while at the same time protecting and preserving operating margins.Please turn to Slide 8 for the March quarter 2020 business highlights. In closing, I'd like to mention four highlights that stood out this quarter. First, as I mentioned at the outset, KLA achieved record companywide shipments driven by record shipments in our semiconductor process control segment and we ended March with record backlog. This illustrates the overall momentum we are having in the marketplace across various product platforms with particular strength in mask inspection, pattern optical inspection and films metrology, and it further shores up our confidence in the long-term future growth position for the company.Secondly, we're really pleased to see KLA's customer success being further validated by third-party market share analysis from Gartner. KLA's market leadership is the result of ongoing successful execution of the company's customer-focused strategy, which is based on investing a high level of R&D to drive differentiated products and a portfolio of products and solutions that address the most critical process control market challenges. And we're pleased once again to see the success of our strategy being validated by our customers' purchasing decisions.The report shows that process control grew as a percent of overall WFE and KLA strengthened its process control market leadership by gaining 2.5 points of market share. The past year marked a record or a new record demand in KLA's core franchises such as optical wafer inspection, overlay metrology and mask inspection. This data also shows KLA's first meaningful revenue and e-beam inspection since 2015. We expect the process control intensity will continue to stay at a similar level in calendar 2020 or better and that KLA will maintain our market leadership driven by an expanding EUV investment environment as well as advanced technology development in memory and continued semiconductor industry expansion in China.Third, we saw continued strength in both foundry and logic. Foundry and logic revenue grew sequentially as customers accelerated the ramp of both 7-nanometer and 5-nanometer nodes and continue to prioritize their leading-edge technology roadmaps. And finally, our services business continues to perform well and remains on track for growth and steady free cash flow in calendar 2020 despite all the uncertainty. Total KLA service revenue rose to $373 million, thanks to the continued growth of our semiconductor process control installed base as well as the expanding service businesses from recent acquisitions.Please turn to Slide 9 for my concluding thoughts. To summarize before I turn the call over to Bren, we're in extraordinary times. And in that, we're facing both unprecedented uncertainties as well as opportunities. But amid this background, one thing that's not changing is KLA's strong fundamentals. And we're confident that our strategies and the actions we're taking today will continue to lead us in the right direction and position us to emerge even stronger and more resilient.KLA's March quarter indicates the soundness and strength of our ongoing strategy. We expect to be able to continue to meet customer needs and expand our market leadership, while protecting operating profits, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our capital return strategies. As I stated earlier, we will remain laser-focused on continuing to preserve the health and safety of our employees and their families. We believe that this is a new reality, and we're going to be in this for some time, but we're confident we can work together to get through it and continue to deliver in the way we know how.I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Bren, to discuss our financial results and guidance. Bren? -- Thank you, Rick. Please turn to Slide 11 for quarterly financial highlights. KLA delivered a solid quarter in March with revenue at the midpoint and non-GAAP EPS finishing at the upper-end of the company's guidance ranges. Total revenue was $1,424 million, non-GAAP gross margin was 61% at the upper-end of the guided range for the quarter of 59.5% to 61.5% driven by a richer product mix that was modeled at the beginning of the quarter.Non-GAAP operating margin was 34.6%. GAAP EPS was $0.50 and non-GAAP EPS was $2.47. At the guided tax planning rate of 13%, EPS would have been $2.52. The reconciliation between the GAAP and non-GAAP EPS includes an impairment of goodwill of $257 million and a $22.5 million loss related to the extinguishment of our November 21 notes that we refinanced in a new bond offering in February.Let me briefly provide more context on the goodwill impairment. During the March quarter and consistent with our policy, KLA conducted its annual goodwill impairment assessment based on the discounted cash flows for each reporting unit. Given the uncertainty of the current environment and the associated unknown long run trajectory of economic growth, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $257 million in the third quarter to writedown a portion of the carrying value of the goodwill associated with the Orbotech acquisition.Before going into further detail on quarterly results, I want to echo Rick's comments and say that while the COVID-19 situation is unprecedented and presents new challenges to running our business, one thing remains clear. KLA has a resilient business model, underpinned by a rock-solid investment-grade balance sheet. We will continue to be agile in the marketplace and actively manage and responsibly navigate our way through this crisis.Additionally, we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings. And our recent bond offering and refinancing means that we are in a great position and don't have any bond maturities until late 2024. To further expand on that point, I want to highlight that in February, KLA issued $750 million and 3.3% 30-year bonds to redeem $500 million in aggregate principal amount 4.125% senior notes due in November of 2021 and S&P upgraded our credit rating one notch earlier in the quarter to BBB+.Given our solid balance sheet and consistently robust free cash flow that our business generates, we believe KLA has enough cash and liquidity to respond to any operating condition, while still being able to execute our long-term strategies, invest at a high level in new capabilities across our product portfolio and maintain our well-articulated capital returns approach, which includes our current $3.40 annual per share dividend.Regarding capital management and deployment, as you would expect, we will review -- we are reviewing all operating expenses and capital expenditure plans to prioritize and optimize them given the current business conditions and the economic environment. One thing is certain, we remain committed to returning 70% or more free cash flow to shareholders over the long-term, balance between dividend payments and share repurchases.In March, we were consistent with our long-standing capital return framework, returning 113% of quarterly free cash flow to investors, consisting of $133 million in quarterly dividend distributions and $316 million in repurchases of common stock. KLA currently has approximately $1 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization.Please turn to Slides 12 and 13 for the breakdown of revenue by segments, end markets, products and regions. Revenue for the semiconductor process control segment, which includes associated service business was healthy at $1.18 billion. Foundry was once again very strong in March at approximately 55% of semi process control revenue, up from 52% last quarter. Memory was 31% in March, down from 40%. Logic was 14% versus 8% last quarter. Revenue for the specialty semiconductor process segment was $85 million, up 13% sequentially driven by strength in RF, MEMS and advanced packaging. PCB, display and component inspection revenue was $160 million, down 14% sequentially and slightly below our internal plans as these businesses which are closer to consumer markets, softened somewhat as we move through the quarter.Now for the breakdown of revenue by major products and regions, starting with the distribution of revenue by major product category. Wafer inspection was 38%. Patterning, which includes reticle inspection was 21%. Wafer inspection and patterning are part of the semiconductor process control segment. Specialty semiconductor process was 5%. PCB, display and component inspection revenue was 7%. Service was 26% of revenue in the quarter and other was 3%. The regional split of revenue was as follows. China was 25%. Taiwan was 24%. Korea was 21%. The U.S. and Japan were 11% each. Europe, including Israel, was 5%. And the rest of Asia was 3%.Please turn to Slide 14 for other income statement highlights. Total operating expenses were $378 million, including $215 million of R&D expense. Operating expenses were modestly below our targets for the quarter, with the largest delta to plan coming from lower travel and entertainment expenses and a slower hiring pace than was originally planned.Operating margin was 34.6%. Other income and expense in the March quarter was $38 million. The non-GAAP tax rate was 14.6% and above the company's long-term tax planning rate of 13% due to negative capital market impact on expense deductions in the company's employee deferred compensation program. Going forward, based on the company's expectations for geographic distribution of profit, you should continue to use 13% as a long-term tax planning rate. Non-GAAP net income was $389 million and the company had approximately 157 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding.Turning now to review of our balance sheet and free cash flow on Slides 15 and 16. KLA ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash, total debt of $3.4 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by investment-grade ratings from all three agencies. KLA has a history of consistent free cash flow generation and high free cash flow conversion. Our innovation and differentiation in the marketplace are what drives our industry-leading growth in operating margins, and ultimately, our free cash flow conversion.Cash from operations and free cash flow are both strong, coming in at $442 million and $399 million respectively. Free cash flow margin was 28% and the annualized free cash flow yield was above 6%. For a frame of reference, over the last 10 years, KLA's free cash flow margin averaged 25%. KLA's business model generates strong free cash flow and it's very resilient across the various phases of the business cycle and economic conditions. Over the past five years, the company has averaged 98% free cash flow conversion.Please turn to Slide 17 for a snapshot of our capital return activities. KLA continues to execute on its commitment to return capital to shareholders in the form of both dividends and share repurchases. The dividend payout has increased at a CAGR of approximately 15% since inception 13 years ago. Share repurchases have also increased over the years, with the average price paid to repurchase shares being roughly $73 with approximately $4.1 billion deployed for repurchases since 2010.Now for our June 2020 guidance on Slide 18. I will start by saying we have mitigated the supply chain issues related to COVID-19 arose over the past quarter, but fluidity related to this situation makes it a daily challenge to manage as countries around the world handle their respective coronavirus responses. The uncertainties and added complexity associated with global social distancing policies such as travel restrictions and mandated quarantine periods continue to pose challenges to our ability to install and support KLA systems.Accordingly, we have taken extra measures to maintain flexibility and continuity of supply for critical components in our supply chain. Somewhat unique to KLA's business model are longer material lead times and volume hedging strategies to enable flexibility with key components in our products, which slows inventory velocity, but allows us to weather short-term disruptions in supply. For short lead time parts, we maintained dual supplier strategies, mostly with suppliers in different countries to optimize capital commitments and ensure we can shift supply to maintain flexibility to meet fluid customer delivery schedules.In addition, our customers rely on KLA to enable their long-term technology development programs, which tend to be sustained and protected in periods of short-term demand uncertainty and disruption such as we are currently experiencing. We continue to maintain close ongoing communication with our suppliers to ensure continuity and identify supply chain pressure points. And we remain confident today in our ability to meet our demand and to be able to continue to service and support our customers in the field. KLA is managing the situation with both determination and connectivity. We have fully mobilized our teams and are taking action to minimize disruption in our operations, meet essential customer needs and maintain the resilience of our supply chain to limit the overall impact of COVID-19 across our business.Given the scale of our worldwide service and support infrastructure, we are supporting our customers with local resources and are executing well. However, it is taking longer in some cases to complete rigorous acceptance criteria for certain products without the support of our factory-centric teams. In all cases, we've done our best to contemplate these factors in our guidance, including the broader range of guidance in our June quarter outlook, which is as follows.Total revenue for the June quarter is expected to be in a range of $1.26 billion to $1.54 billion. Foundry is forecasted to be about 51% of semi process control system revenue, depicting the strength we continue to see among our foundry customer base. Memory is expected to be approximately 39%. Logic is expected to be about 10% of semiconductor process control system revenue. We forecast gross margin to be in a range of 59% to 61% as product mix is modestly less favorable and slightly higher costs are expected in our service business and in the March quarter.Other model assumptions include; operating expense of approximately $380 million, interest and other expense of approximately $40 million and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 13%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in a range of $1.58 to $2.64 and non-GAAP diluted EPS in a range of $1.81 to $2.87. The EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 156 million shares.For my financial conclusion, please turn to Slide 19. I'd like to share our perspective on the demand environment for the balance of the year 2020. First, I'd like to address the new export rules published by the U.S. Department of Commerce on April 28, which will go into effect on June 29, 2020. Those rules will expand export license requirements for U.S. companies to sell certain items to companies in China that have operations that could support military end uses even if the items sold by the U.S. companies are used for civilian purposes only.On this issue, I would note that the new rules do not impact the majority of our business as most of our products are manufactured and assembled outside of the United States. I would also like to point out that we routinely ensure that our products are not used for prohibited military end uses in China. However, the question remains today whether these new rules, when enacted, would make it more difficult to ship to certain customers in China that might be deemed military end users under the new rules as a result of their potential activities supporting military end uses.We are still assessing the new rules and working with trade associations and others to obtain additional guidance from the U.S. government regarding the scope and practical application of these new rules. Once we have clarity on how these rules will be implemented, we can better determine the impact on our business, if any, in the second half of the calendar year.Notwithstanding this recent trade issue, our outlook for customer demand in the semiconductor process control business is virtually unchanged today from what we expected in February. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to drive our supply chain in our factories to meet current customer expectations for deliveries. However, we do expect that the overall macroeconomic environment will put pressure at some point on some of our customers' demand for products in certain segments, and ultimately could affect their capacity investment plans, both in magnitude and timing.Obviously, the depth and duration of this impact is unknown today, so we will continue to run our business to maintain the flexibility to respond to any demand scenario. We do expect our customers to continue to progress their technology roadmaps across all segments, and KLA products are critical to those transitions. We expect investments to continue in this area at a normalized pace independent of the macro environment. For our more consumer-centric businesses, we have seen some weakness over the course of the March quarter. And while we are well positioned, we would expect some impact to these businesses compared to what we thought in early February.Finally, collaboration across global teams and partners on large scale product development programs without direct in-person engagement is creating some execution challenges. And while early, could put pressure on release dates for new products expected over the next 12 months. To summarize, as we look ahead to the balance of the year, KLA continues to be well positioned to navigate the uncharted territory we find ourselves in.We derive our strength from our strong balance sheet and liquidity and comfort from not having any bond maturities until late in 2024. Our strong operating performance helps us prioritize critical investments across our technology portfolio and protects our margins, while simultaneously generating strong and consistent free cash flow. Our market position has never been stronger. Despite the usual competitive noise, our share gain and improving process control intensity serve as validation that our products -- our portfolio of products and solutions are adding critical value to our customers' technology roadmap differentiation and their ability to yield these new technologies at production volumes.How we allocate capital has never been more important. You can be assured, we will continue to make smart capital allocation decisions, continue to invest in the important R&D to support our customers and new product launches, fuel our long-term growth strategy, maintain our ongoing dividend strategy and preserve our ability to be opportunistic at buyback program to fully deploy the free cash flow of the company.Lastly, predictability and business model resiliency matter more now than ever. Our growing diversification, significant exposure to our customers' critical process technology transitions, our subscription like service revenue stream and our focus on driving operating leverage are key attributes of our business model. We are confident we can continue to excel and manage in these areas and position KLA for a brighter future.Before we begin the Q&A, just a reminder that KLA will participate in many virtual investor webcasted conferences this quarter. Please keep an eye out for notice of future events scheduling, and we look forward to seeing some of you virtually later in the quarter.With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin Kessel to begin the Q&A. -- Thank you, Bren. Once again, we would ask that everyone limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question in order to get in as many questions as possible. Okay, Charlie, we're ready for the first question.Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. -- Good afternoon, guys, and solid job on the quarterly execution. On the increased revenue guidance range for June, $280 million range versus $200 million for last quarter, you called out the COVID-19-related impacts. It sounds like it's still more operational, logistics, personnel support, but wondered if there is some part of that that is demand-related, potential pushing out of the business by customers either in your process control or Orbotech businesses on the potential for maybe some second half macro demand weakness? I'm just trying to figure out where the bias is skewed toward the larger range? -- Hey Harlan, it's Bren. Hope you're doing well. So the bias is more around just the operational constraints. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are having to support the tools with our local teams, particularly around installations and that can take a little bit longer. And as a result of that and the ability to handle escalations faster and so on, we've essentially put in some incremental risk or tried to account for some incremental risk in our overall execution.Clearly, the environment is very fluid by country. And so we have to be sensitive to navigate through that. There is a component of supply chain, but as I said in the prepared remarks, we feel very good about our supply chain positioning. So it's mostly more about the general uncertainty and what we're having to do operationally to deal with it. -- Okay, great. Thanks for the insights there. And then, congrats on the 200 basis points of share gain in process control last year. I think now you're about five times larger than your nearest competitor. Your commentary on the sustainability of process control intensity for this year, where are you seeing the biggest sustainable increases of this intensity? Is it China and NAND or is it just across all of the sectors given rising complexity? And then it also looks like your large logic customer is executing and finally getting back to sort of this two year, two and a half year cadence on node migrations after a long pause and much reuse, how does this also change your longer term view on intensity for the team? -- Yeah. Great questions, Harlan. I think that the biggest difference we see right now I think in the process control intensity is the realization that EUV and those in support of it really need more capability. And specifically, we've talked about Gen5 in the past being used for print check and that's definitely driving adoption. In addition, we believe the sustainability is there based on new products that we introduced that we outlined in our Investor Day. And so it's really not one particular customer. It's really now we have Gen5 is really humming at every major customer and is growing in adoption. And maybe in the last couple of years, we went from being in the development phase to people actually expanding their footprint with that. But we also saw strength in laser scanning.And so I think even in optical metrology, we mentioned in there, it's really pretty broad-based across the portfolio. And I do think in times like this, even if customers are going to back off capacity, which could happen later in the year, they're going to continue to invest in capabilities to allow them to bring out new technologies, which is always favorable for process control. -- Yeah. Thanks for the insights. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. -- Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Glad to hear that everyone is doing well. Thanks for letting me ask the question. I guess, Bren, I want to go back to just the COVID-19 impact and whether or not you have a number that quantifies the March quarter impact? And was it an impact to shipments and rev rec or just rev rec? And I guess, is the broader range for June just a realization that you're expecting the impact to be larger in the June quarter than the March quarter? -- So John, on March, when we go back to when we gave guidance, we certainly felt that there would be some potential risk, a push-out related to tools that we're going into the affected areas in China, particularly in Hubei province. And so we tried to account for that in our guidance and expected that independent of the COVID effect that our guidance would have been higher.As the quarter went along, our issues were more -- we were able to ship a little bit into that area, which was positive for us. And we had some other puts and takes across the business. The challenge we had is with quarantine period and travel restrictions, it is taking us some time to mine up resources. And if you don't have the resources for installations, customers will want to readjust some of those delivery dates. So we did have some of those issues in the quarter. And it was more shipment-based than it was revenue.So as we look at the June quarter, though, I mean, it's a pretty challenging situation out there. And as I said, on the demand or in the prepared remarks, I mean, demand from customers has been pretty consistent. We think that carries forward in June. And so we widened the risk to be prudent or the range to be prudent just given the circumstances we think we're now facing. But we did the same exercise tool by tool and we feel pretty comfortable with the guidance. But just overall, we're learning things every day about what's going on. And so we wanted to account for some of this uncertainty that's out there. -- And then just as my follow-up. Despite the wider range for June, I think we all appreciate the fact that you're trying to give us a guidance number out there with all the puts and takes, even more so, Bren, your commentary about the full year. But I'm kind of curious, I think 90 days ago, you would have characterized calendar year '20 as sort of an above trend year for growth for you guys, trend being sort of the 7% to 9% that underpins your 2023 target model. Relative to the puts and takes you talked about in your prepared comments, should we think about 2020 as being more of a trend growth year or is there not enough visibility to even say that? -- I think the visibility question is challenging. We have peer companies that couldn't even guide the quarter given some of the challenges. So when we look at it, I think it's hard to believe that we wouldn't see some impact in the second half from the environment we're now operating in. We do expect, based on our current view that it will be a growth year for the company. But as I look at it today, again, a lot of moving parts. But I would say that it will probably likely be below that trend line. Not much below, but I think it would be below.Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. -- Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. First one, either or Bren or Rick, can you give a little bit color on the sales into China that you saw in March? What is the split between domestic and multinational and split between foundry and memory? And any kind of color into the June quarter on geography would be helpful? Then I have a follow-up. -- Yeah. Chris, I don't think I have it by broken down that way. As we said, revenue mix for China was 25%. I don't -- you know it's something we'll have to get back to you at this point for the March quarter. -- Got it. Got it. That's fine. And then the second question I had was, when I looked into your June guidance, when you look at the numbers, it looks like foundry is probably slowing a bit and memory is coming back. I understand, no one has a crystal ball at this point. But would you expect the trend to continue into the calendar second half or is it more a function of just customer capex spending in Q2? -- Yeah. I mean I think our base assumption is that we'll see stronger memory environment in the second half. Obviously, that's part that might be -- part of the business that might be more impacted by what happens in the overall economy. But our base assumption is that we would see memory recover in the second half or will be stronger in the second half. Now foundry seems to -- foundry and logic seems to be pretty consistent over the course of the year, at least at this point. So I wouldn't say it's weighted to one half or the other right now.Your next question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Evercore. Your line is now open. -- Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I guess first question, Bren, to go back to John's earlier question on COVID and the impact there. Can you share with us what kind of, I guess, impact to revenues you're embedding in the guide or should we take the midpoint as indicative of what you would do with or without indicating no supply chain issues? And then as part of the challenges around supply chain management in logistics, can you share with us what impact that might have on your cost structure as well? -- So CJ, at some point it becomes a little challenging to be -- to speculate on with and without given the environment we're operating in today and the adjustments we've had to make. If I just go back a few months, I mean, I would think that our revenue would be $100 million higher at the midpoint from a guidance perspective for the quarter in a normalized environment. Now we're far from a normalized environment and don't know when we'll get back there. So most of our adjustments are related to just our ability to cadence our resources to be able to support customers.As we said in the prepared remarks, for the year, demand is virtually unchanged. We have seen some impact in some of the -- with customers that are closer to some consumer markets. But generally our customers, particularly our largest customers are still very focused on executing their plans and we're maintaining the flexibility to be as flexible as we can to respond to them.So I don't feel like I have significant supply issues to be able to make that happen, and we're running the factories to be able to respond to that. So they want to be in the right position to respond to their customers. And so we're managing our supply chain and our factory resources to have the flexibility to do that. If it -- if the business were to fall off in a meaningful way, of course we're carrying a lot more resources than the -- that business level would suggest. And so there would be some adjustment required in terms of just the overall cost impact of that. But right now, that's how we're running the business and we'll adjust as we go. We've done this before. -- Very helpful. If I could follow-up. Regarding the Department of Commerce ruling, and I know it's still very early, and I'm sure you're awaiting clarity on how broader now the rules will be pursued. But if you think about what's been written to date, the major ruling is for manufacturing in the U.S. and considering you do make tools and assemble tools offshore, is your first interpretation that you will not be impacted in terms of shipping into China based on kind of what you read today? Thank you. -- Sure, CJ. I think that's -- to your point, it's relatively new and we're still unpacking it. And as we said, we're working to gain clarity. But our understanding at this point is, this will impact the tools that are manufactured in the U.S., which are manufactured for us in California. We have three major manufacturing sites; Israel, Singapore and here. So there is a potential impact depending on the customer. And our final understanding of the ruling that will impact tools that come out of California. But even that based on the words we had in the -- the comments we made, it's still unclear and we're getting guidance on that and actually working through it. So we haven't been able to come up with more than that at this point. But we still, as we looked at the year, we feel, as Bren said, we understand that risk and potential risk and we feel good about the year.Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Your line is now open. -- Thanks for taking my question. So sticking with this China export control, and again, I appreciate that, it's somewhat earlier in the process. But I think you mentioned you already restrict shipments for military end use. So I'm curious what else do you need to do to satisfy these new requirements, whether or not you ship the end product from the U.S. or from overseas. If according to you, you are not shipping something for military end use, what more do you need to do, like what is the mechanical process, I mean, going and asking for a license if you are not shipping anything for the military end use already? -- So there is a couple of aspects of this as we understand it, but one of them is a rigorous process we're going through to make sure we understand the intent and the -- how to execute on this rule, and we're working with outside counsel inside council to do that. And as we said, we already have some of the constraints. This was a broad policy not simply about semiconductor equipment and semiconductor equipment just happens to be included in this.So we will work through that process, but that is why we say that we've already -- we already take steps to handle some of the questions that are being put forward and we will continue to work through it. When we have more clarity, and frankly, the rule is still -- there is still a period where further definition is happening until the end of June. So once we have more clarity, of course we're going to share that. -- All right. And for my follow-up, I'm curious what have you seen from a demand perspective and just from any supply chain issues in the first few weeks of the quarter, because just from the outside looking at it, it seems as if, right, their expectations that second half would get better, that macro conditions could improve, that people are slowly starting to get back. That's why I'm curious that, is it fair to say that June is the trough for the year? Just what -- how would you characterize what you have seen for the first few weeks of the quarter from a demand and supply perspective? Thank you. -- So I think, Bren -- this is Rick. Bren talked about the demand, but I'll give some color to it. I've had a number of conversations with customers, and I would say that everyone is continuing with their plan. The notable exception, as Bren mentioned, consumer-facing and anybody that's dealing directly for example with automobile, I think that's an area where there has been constrained. But it's been compensated for by some of our other customers who actually see increased demand driven by some of the work from home trends.So I think that in balance, we're seeing that. The supply chain actually got better in terms of some of the supply that we had in Asia, specifically China, where coming out of Chinese New Year, part of what we weren't sure about was the supply chain that we had in China, how effective they were going to be and how efficient. That's fully recovered, and we're back actually above the level of supply for some of those parts. And we've pretty definitely moved through the different opportunities for supply and we feel very good about our ability to navigate that. As Bren said, it's not easy, but we're confident of our ability to do it.So we don't really see a reason to change it. So then what we're backing up to is what are the macro implications of the economic downturn and subsequent recovery. And since we don't have a way to really understand that long-term because I don't think anybody really knows, we just model different scenarios for what that might look like. But we have no leading indicators right now of any real change in behavior. -- Yeah. Just an additional point here is, the internal forecast would suggest that the second half is stronger. I think the challenge we have, to Rick's point is, what ultimately happens with our customers' demand profile and what that means to supply. Now there are lead times and so on and those issues are things that customers have to contemplate as they think about how they're managing their capacity, but that's essentially where we're at. So we'll have to see how that plays out, what that ultimately means to them and then ultimately what that means to their demand for our products.We do have a certain amount of investment that happens in supporting technology roadmaps. Those are continuing on a normalized pace. And so we would expect that for products that are particularly focused on enabling technology transitions that those products would be more resilient than more capacity-centric products depending on what environment. But I'm not ready to call a trough here in the June quarter until we get better visibility about what ultimately things -- how things will look in the September quarter is I think one of the challenges that we're facing here.We don't talk about it very much, but I think that the way we manage the supply chain is a competitive advantage for KLA. We have -- we talked about our operating model and a lot of that has to do with how we manage supply chains, how we run our factories. We work with suppliers that provide very high-end capability for us and we engage very closely with them, we buy parts earlier, we commit earlier. So we're able to navigate through certainly for key components, potential disruptions and working with them to make sure they are in a place to be able to support us in whatever environment we might end up in.We have the service business. It's very contract-based. The products live a long time. So having the extra parts from time to time is the least of my concerns generally as a CFO running this company. So I think that that situation works for us. And with the extension of demand in terms of how it's affecting, how long products are living, we tend to work our way through the parts that we do have. So it slows down inventory turns, but it is fundamental to the operating model of the company, and I think the margin profile reflects that.Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open. -- Thanks a lot. Bren, I also wanted to ask on the commerce changes. It certainly looks like you have some cover on the direct product rule for the stuff being made outside the U.S. when you sort of look through the CCL list and at the ECC and categorizations. But the language around end user seems to be very ambiguous, and I guess, we obviously hope to get clear interpretation from commerce before June 29. But the experts that I've talked to indicate that it's sort of purposely ambiguous. So I guess the question is, if you have to apply when in doubt, would you agree that the risk might be more on the foundry logic side and less on the memory side? -- Tim, I think it's too early to speculate. I mean -- yeah, it's too early to speculate. -- Okay. And then Bren, I guess a follow-up on the impairment. So 15% of the acquired goodwill was written down. So can you just quantify, did that has any impact on the sort of long-term growth prospects for the Orbotech businesses or you think that even though that was written down that the long-term numbers that were put into the model at Analyst Day still hold? -- Yeah. Tim, as you know, these are asset light businesses. And so there is a fair amount of purchase consideration that shows up in goodwill. And what that reflects really is when you do valuations, as we all know, and you do a discounted cash flow that as cash flows push out and what discount rates you use have an effect on ultimate value. Certainly, in the near-term and some of those businesses, if you look at the specialty semiconductor business being impacted by trade last year and some of the automotive dynamics into this year that did affect some of our near-term forecast.So over the long run -- and then I think the second part is around flat panel where we saw -- we expected to see more recovery in flat panel capex into '20 and we're not seeing that. So there were some modest adjustments related to COVID and some of these issues that I mentioned. And then just a general uncertainty in terms of how that affects an ultimate discount rate that you use. But to be clear, we do feel very comfortable with the growth rate trajectory that we presented at Investor Day back in September, and it's really a function of the things I talked about, just given the uncertainty of the current environment that we're operating in.Your next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Your line is now open. -- Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. And Bren, just wanted to ask on the gross margin. You guided 59% to 61%, wondering if there is any impact from spacing requirements and social distancing on the manufacturing capacity or your cycle times within your own facilities? -- Yeah. That's a good question. I mean, in our facilities, most of our builds are bay builds. And so we're able to comply with some of the social distancing challenges there pretty effectively. So it's not really related to that. I think from a cycle time point of view, we're executing generally in line with our plans. Quarter-to-quarter it's really more around just some of the mix of products that we expect to see this quarter versus last quarter. And the service profitability levels were particularly strong last quarter I think as with some of the delays and just activity out there, and so how that affected our cost structure. So I would expect some of those costs to come back as we move into this quarter.So overall, it was a little bit richer than we expected in the March quarter and we're seeing some adjustments into the June quarter. But the long-term view is it's a current sort of expected revenue levels is to see gross margins between 60% and 61% with the biggest factor being mostly around the mix of products. -- Great. And the follow-up question. You mentioned the three main manufacturing sites; Israel, Singapore and U.S., wondering if you have redundant capacity to build the same tool at multiple sites? And if you don't have that capacity today, does the export control action and does the COVID outbreak make you rethink whether having a redundant manufacturing capacity would be part of a long-term three year to five year plan? -- Yeah. It's a great question. We have definitely the ability -- the similarity in what we do in these different sites allows some flexibility, which overtime has caused us actually to transition more to the sites out of the U.S. in both the case of Israel and also in Singapore. So that's something that we're always evaluating in terms of our ability and flexibility to manufacture different products in different locations based on customer needs, supply chain and our staffing. So of course, that's a lever and an option that we have as we look out and think about where the best place to be positioned is. -- Operator, we have time for one more question, please.Sure sir. Your next question comes from the line of Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. -- Yeah. Thanks for squeezing me in. Let's say you're thinking about a nice sequential increase in implied memory revenue for the June quarter, I was wondering, can you help us understand the drivers of that? Is it more of a market recovery or are there also some kind of embedded assumptions around new product shipments that you've launched recently? -- You know it's funny. I went back and I looked it. If you look to the March quarter revenue levels for memory, it's probably our lowest since about 2016. So in some ways, there was a bit of a trough there in terms of just the overall business level for memory. So we do see a pick-up. And the pickup is pretty balanced across the -- it's about 50-50 overall of what we expect in the quarter from flash and DRAM. So I wouldn't say it's related to anything in particular other than just we're seeing a stronger revenue profile this quarter versus a very low one last quarter. -- Okay. And then just on the record backlog, when we think about your comments around the long-term target for growth rate for 2020, how do we think about the backlog covering that relative to prior years? -- Well, we have record backlog today. So we had a very strong order quarter and record backlog this quarter. So that certainly gives us some comfort. I mean, customer demand is there. We have the backlog. We have the parts. So as I said, we're in a position where we can deliver to any scenario. So we feel pretty confident about that. But we really just have to see where our customers are ultimately and what they do. But certainly, the backlog does give us confidence really across the businesses with a certain expectation. But again, depending on what happens with their business then sometimes they do push days and things like that. But given the lead time for our products, the backlog gives us some comfort about what we see in front of us over the next six months or so. -- I think, Joe, if you think about the longer term, the 2023 plan, the biggest variable in that from our standpoint is really what happens in the macro economy, because when we look at all the trends that we said, the new products, the market share, the secular dynamics, everything is really working the way we had envisioned and we're executing and we feel really great about that.What we can't forecast at this point is how deep and how long any kind of economic disruption is. So that's the thing that will really ultimately determine the pace of the overall industry. I do think that there are aspects of the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industry that are actually going to do quite well. So unlike general recessions we've had or the '08, '09, there's aspects of what we do that are enabling people to actually continue to function through this time period. But ultimately, if there is macroeconomic shock that's going to -- depending on how long it goes, it will alter through those plans in terms of the length of the time it will take to come out of this. And that's the thing we're in no position to forecast.Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our Q&A session for today. I'll now turn the call back to the presenters. -- Thank you very much. And we appreciate everybody tuning in today. We look forward to chatting with you going forward.

At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the KLAC options chain for the new May 29th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $150.00 strike price has a current bid of $10.00.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $150.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $140.00 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of KLAC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $153.10/share today.\n\nBecause the $150.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .

If an investor was to purchase shares of KLAC stock at the current price level of $153.10/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $155.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.32% if the stock gets called away at the May 29th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if KLAC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for KLA Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing KLAC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $155.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $155.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the KLAC options chain for the new May 1st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $130.00 strike price has a current bid of $10.50.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $130.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $119.50 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of KLAC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $131.46/share today.\n\nBecause the $130.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 100%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 8.08% return on the cash commitment, or 60.16% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for KLA Corp, and highlighting in green where the $130.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $133.00 strike price has a current bid of $11.10.  If an investor was to purchase shares of KLAC stock at the current price level of $131.46/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $133.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.62% if the stock gets called away at the May 1st expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if KLAC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for KLA Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing KLAC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $133.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $133.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 51%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 8.44% boost of extra return to the investor, or 62.90% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the call contract example above is 75%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $131.46) to be 38%.

[Operator Instructions]I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations for KLA Corporation. Please go ahead, sir. -- Thank you, Charlie, and welcome to KLA's  to discuss the results of the December 2019 quarter and the outlook for the March 2020 quarter. Joining me today is Rick Wallace, our Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. During today's conference call, we will discuss quarterly results for the period ended December 31, 2019 that we released today after the market close, and is currently posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.kla.com. Today's discussion of our financial results and outlook is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is in today's earnings press release and the earnings slides presentation posted on the KLA Investor Relations website.Our IR website also contains a calendar of future investor events and presentations, including those from our September 2019 Investor Day and corporate governance information, including our quiet period policy as well as links to KLA's SEC filings, including our recent annual report and quarterly reports on forms 10-K and 10-Q. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factors disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those that we make on the call today are subject to those risks and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.I'd like to now turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Wallace. Rick? -- Thank you, Kevin, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm going to begin with a high level of strategic overview, aimed at what drives KLA's long-term business success and differentiation before I cover the near-term December quarter of business highlights. Please turn to slide four. KLA continues to benefit from multiple secular growth drivers we discussed in-depth at our September 2019 Investor Day. Our performance this quarter and our strategies for diversified growth, technology leadership and operational excellence are playing out according to our plans. By numerous measures, the December 2019 quarter was strong for KLA. Revenue in both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS finished at the upper end of the range of guidance, a result of strong demand and exceptional execution. This performance was particularly satisfying, given it was set against the backdrop of still lackluster memory demand.As the global leader in process control and supplier of critical process enabling solutions for the data era, KLA remains at the forefront of the most important industry trends and technology inflections in the electronics industry. Our deep collaborative customer relationships, broad IP portfolio and differentiated solutions that address our customers' most complex challenges are the essential ingredients and the recipe that sustains our market leadership. Our business also continues to benefit from increasing complexity in advanced semiconductor device design and manufacturing processes as well as mega trends driving demand across multiple product generations and in numerous key industries. Please turn to slide five. Underpinning our success and consistent outperformance is the KLA operating model. Many of you are becoming more familiar with this model, given that we spent a fair amount of time at our Investor Day discussing it. And while it's not new to KLA, we understand talking about it may be, which is why we decided to codify it the way that we did.Expect to continue to hear us refer to it as it does the best job of simplifying how we run the company. It also helps reinforce the critical core componencies that we believe can enhance the long-term performance and profitability of acquired businesses such as Orbotech. Most importantly, the KLA operating model is critical to align the company on a consistent strategy and execution, heightened accountability and facilitate continuous improvement, while ensuring we always operate with strong financial discipline and rigor. Please turn to slide six. Strategically, we have four objectives that serve as our guide and drive our sustainable high-performance culture. I find it's always worth reinforcing objectives when speaking with investors and analysts as they provide a helpful window into our strategy going forward. These four objectives are: market leadership, product differentiation, operational excellence and attracting and developing talent. We run all our businesses and integrate newly acquired companies with a focus on these four key objectives. Today's results point to our alignment and achievement of all four of these. Please turn to slide seven for the December quarter business highlights. Before I cover the business highlights for the quarter, I'd like to provide some high-level perspective on the current industry environment.I'll begin by addressing the coronavirus situation. First and foremost, our primary concern is with the health and well-being of all affected by the situation. We are taking the recommended precautions and have implemented appropriate measures within our global business operations, including widening the range of guidance for the March 2020 quarter to reflect the uncertainty we see in the marketplace. Bren will provide further color on this. We are closely monitoring the situation and will update investors as material new developments arise. Nonwithstanding this, hopefully, short term issue, the long-term growth opportunity for the semiconductor market remains very compelling, driven by the proliferation of electronics across more diversified end markets, the introduction of new advanced technologies supporting the development and rollout of 5G, growing semiconductor investment in China and continued device and performance innovation to develop superior performance and return on investment. KLA's strong results are primarily driven by our industry-leading positions across various markets and the demand momentum that has continued for both technology development and capacity growth in advanced logic nodes.The demand to support advanced logic nodes is expected to remain healthy through 2020 and in 2021, driven by accelerating investment in EUV, competitive dynamics and new capacity additions. 2020 is setting up to be our fifth consecutive year of year-over-year growth for KLA with top line growth currently expected to be in the high single to low double-digit range, tracking ahead of our long-term revenue growth of 7% to 9% that underpins our 2023 target model. In terms of our outlook for the WFE wafer demand environment in 2020, given the recent news of increased capex investment from leading foundry and logic customers and the improving business conditions in memory, we are aligned with the consensus expectations for 2020 to be a growth year for WFE, coming off a stronger-than-anticipated finish to 2019. Now let me cover some of the product highlights from the quarter. KLA's market leadership is the product of successful execution of our portfolio strategy focused on differentiation to address our customers' most critical challenges.We are confident in our product positioning and the validation from strong customer acceptance across our portfolio. We continue to see accelerated growth of our flagship Gen5 optical inspection platform, deployed for both technology development and production monitoring at the advanced nodes. Our customers are now using the Gen5 platform to identify and solve yield limiting issues at the 7-nanometer node and beyond. We're also encouraged by the growing adoption of patterned wafer print check applications to qualify reticles for EUV. Gen5 offers the best solution to make sure EUV mask are defect free and optimized to achieve process window requirements. Boosted in part by this expanded use case, Gen5 shipments nearly tripled in 2019, and adoption is expected to grow in 2020. Also, at our recent Investor Day, we announced our first new e-beam inspection platform in multiple years, and we continue to receive very positive feedback from initial customer evaluations, and we're starting to receive purchase orders. KLA's e-beam inspection platform works seamlessly with our Gen5 optical inspection platform through built-in connectivity, offering customers the best inspection performance combination at the lowest overall cost of ownership. This combination is a unique differentiator in the marketplace today, and we can identify and detect critical yield limiting defects at the most advanced nodes.After proving the value of the technology and initial customer evaluations, we delivered the industry's first production-ready version of the X-ray metrology platform to customers in the December quarter. Introduced initially at our September Investor Day, the AXION platform is a small angle X-ray scattering technology for in line metrology applications to monitor the high aspect ratio features in advanced 3D and DRAM device architectures. This platform provides a lower cost of ownership and improve cycle times when compared with existing destructive metrology techniques. We're now focused on establishing new use cases with all leading memory customers. Last, but certainly not least, KLA's service business continues to deliver excellent revenue growth performance, while simultaneously generating strong free cash flow. Semi-process control service revenue reached $1.1 billion in 2019 with 70% of this revenue generated from subscription-like service contracts. This performance continues to give us high levels of confidence that KLA services can deliver long-term revenue growth rates in the range of 9% to 11%. Several factors drive growth in our services business. Including increased complexity of our systems, expansion of the installed base and expanded demand at the trailing edge nodes with high fabulization and foundry and logic and signs of improvement in memory, our customers are also looking for opportunities to enhance productivity and extend the life of their installed base.As a result, we see robust service contract penetration, and our service business is providing a steady recurring revenue stream for all our businesses. Please turn to slide eight. In summary, the KLA operating model drives our investment thesis. This is accomplished by driving sustained technology leadership with a strong competitive moat, supported by a track record of strong free cash flow generation and capital returns. As we begin the new year with the expectation that the industry will see a resumption of growth in 2020, we are energized by the prospects that lie ahead. KLA continues to execute exceptionally well and deliver healthy relative revenue and earnings growth. Our focus on driving innovation and providing a steady stream of differentiated products and solutions, position KLA to achieve the long-term growth targets we established at our 2019 Investor Day. Despite industry headwinds, 2019 was a historic year for KLA, showcasing the enduring value created by the successful execution of our strategic objectives.As we look ahead, we are confident that we're investing in our future and are well positioned for growth and market leadership building on the momentum we have established in our process control markets and capitalizing on the market expansion opportunities from the Orbotech acquisition. Our Orbotech integration and product synergy programs are firmly on track and progressing well.I'd like to now turn the call over to Bren for his commentary on the December quarter financial results and our March quarter outlook. Bren? -- Thank you, Rick. Please turn to slide 10 for December quarter 2019 financial highlights. This was a strong quarter for KLA with revenue and EPS each coming in at the high end of our guidance ranges. Total revenue for the December quarter was $1.509 billion, which was at the upper end of the range of guidance of $1.435 billion to $1.515 billion. Gross margin for the quarter was 60.8% in the upper end of the guided range for the quarter of 60% to 61%, driven by incremental revenue growth and product mix. Operating margins was 34.8%. GAAP EPS was $2.40 and non-GAAP EPS was $2.66, both of which were also at the upper end of the range of guidance of $2.13 to $2.43 and $2.39 to $2.69, respectively. Cash from operations and free cash flow were both strong and above our internal targets coming in at $388 million and $353 million, respectively. Our financial results this quarter were exceptionally strong all around, and we remain laser-focused on our overall execution as well as our integration and synergy plans for Orbotech. During the quarter, we remained consistent and effective in our capital return framework by returning 119% of quarterly free cash flow to investors. Our capital return was accomplished by repurchasing $285 million of common stock and also distributing $135 million in quarterly dividends. We currently have $1.3 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization and plan to continue to execute our repurchases consistently going forward.A key pillar of our investment thesis is KLA's long-standing commitment to returning cash to shareholders. For calendar '19, KLA returned approximately $1.5 billion or 127% of our free cash flow to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs. Our capital return included more than $1 billion in stock buybacks. Please turn to slide 11 for revenue breakdown by reportable segments and end markets. Revenue for the semi process control segment, which includes the associated service business was healthy at $1.248 billion in the quarter, up 7% sequentially on the back of continued strength in foundry and logic. As Rick mentioned, our initial view of the WFE demand environment for 2020 is for solid growth off of a better-than-expected finish to 2019, driven by continued strong investment for multiple foundry and logic customers, investment in EUV and expanded memory investment in the year. In addition, continued high levels of demand from native China is expected to contribute to overall industry growth in 2020.As I mentioned, foundry was very strong in Q4 at approximately 52% of semi process control revenue, up from 44% last quarter. Memory was 40% in December, down from 43% last quarter. Logic was 8%, versus 13% last quarter and in line with our expectations. I'll turn now to the specialty semiconductor Process segment. As a reminder, SPTS was formerly part of Orbotech and is a leader in PVD and edge process solutions in fast-growing specialty semiconductor applications like MEMS, sensors, power and RF devices as well as in advanced packaging markets. Revenue for SPTS was $75 million, up 9% sequentially. While SPTS revenue for 2019 was impacted by global trade issues, we expect 2020 to be a strong year of -- to be a year of strong growth, driven by expanding RF demand to support 5G investment and a potential recovery in the automotive electronics market in the second half of the calendar year. On a very encouraging note, SPTS ended the December '19 quarter with record backlog and quarterly bookings. Revenue for the PCB display in component inspection segment was $186 million, up 4% sequentially and in line with expectations.This segment includes the former PCB and display businesses of Orbotech and KLA's component inspection business. After a cyclical low, we expect 2020 to be a modest year of growth for PCB, driven by the transition to 5G smartphones. Please turn to slide 12 for a breakdown of revenue by major products and region. The distribution of revenue by major product category in the December quarter was as follows: wafer inspection was 40%. Patterning, which includes reticle inspection was 19%. Wafer inspection and patterning are part of our semiconductor process control segment. Specialty semiconductor process was 4%. PCB, display and component inspection revenue was 9%. Service was 24% of revenue in the quarter. Other was 4%. In terms of regional split, Taiwan was 30%, China was 25%, Japan was 13%, Korea was 12%, the U.S. was 11%, Europe was 6%, and the rest of Asia was 3%. Please turn to slide 13 for other income statement highlights. Total operating expenses were $391 million in the quarter, including $220 million of R&D expense. Operating expenses were slightly higher-than-expected in the quarter due to non-headcount-related engineering and development expenses and modest variable compensation adjustments.Operating margin was 60 basis points higher than modeled at 34.8%. Other income and expense in the December quarter was $38 million, the effective tax rate was 13.5% in line with our long-term tax planning rate of 14%. Going forward, based on our expectations for the geographic distribution of profit, you should now use 13% as the long-term tax planning rate. Net income was $422 million, and we had just under 159 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Please turn to slide 14 for a look at our balance sheet highlights and debt maturities profile. We ended the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash, total debt of $3.4 billion and a flexible and attractive debt maturity profile supported by investment-grade ratings from all three agencies. In October, we retired our $250 million, 3.375% senior notes due November 2019. We intend to refinance our $500 million senior notes due November 2021 during the March quarter.Please turn to slide 15 for a review of free cash flow. KLA has a history of consistent free cash flow generation and high free cash flow conversion. Over the past five years, we have averaged 99% free cash flow conversion and in calendar 2019, it was nearly 90%. Our innovation and differentiation in the marketplace are what drives our industry-leading gross and operating margins and ultimately, our free cash flow conversion. Please turn to slide 16 for a review of our capital return to investors. KLA continues to execute on its commitment to return capital to shareholders in the form of both dividends and share repurchases. The dividend payout has increased at a CAGR of 15% since inception 13 years ago. Share repurchases have also increased over the years, with the average price paid for repurchase shares being slightly under $70 and with approximately $3.8 billion deployed for repurchases since 2010. The only exception to the company's systematic repurchasing activity was during the periods when it was blacked out due to acquisition proceedings. Please turn to slide 17 for March quarter 2020 guidance. The fluid situation accompanying the coronavirus response is adding complexity to our forecasting process.As seen with others, we are operating with key assumptions regarding the resumption of business activities in China, both in Hubei province, in addition to the rest of the country. To date, we do not expect a protracted disruption of our business for calendar year 2020. Policy changes regarding the response could affect our ability to ship and support shipments into China as well as to access key components from our China-based supply chain necessary to meet system shipment commitments to our worldwide customer base. In short, this is a situation with limited visibility that could impact our near-term results, and we will be prudent in providing you with the best information we have as we proceed through the quarter. As Rick mentioned, the range of guidance has been widened to reflect this quarter's uncertainty in our current estimate of potential disruption. We expect total revenue to be in the range of $1.325 billion to $1.525 billion in the March quarter. This revenue guidance would have approximately been 3% to 5% higher at the midpoint without the adjustments for the coronavirus impact. Foundry is forecasted to be about 60% of semi process control system revenue in the March quarter, depicting the strength we continue to see among our foundry customer base.We expect memory to be approximately 28% of system revenue, reflecting continued headwinds we see in the memory market. Logic is expected to be about 12% of semi process control system revenue next quarter. Based on product mix expectations for the March quarter, we forecast gross margin to be in the range of 59.5% to 61.5%. Operating expenses will be in the range of $380 million to $385 million, down sequentially from December as prototype material expenses normalized to run rate. Given expected revenue levels for 2020, new product development investments of multiple product technologies to support the industry's transition to high-volume production of EUV lithography and initiatives to reduce our long-term structural cost position, we expect quarterly operating expenses to remain in this range for the remainder of the calendar year. For 2020 operating margin, we are running the company and to perform in line with the $5.5 billion to $6 billion revenue interval of our business model presented at Investor Day back in September.We expect other interest expense to be approximately $39 million in the quarter and the effective tax rate to be 13%. For earnings, we expect GAAP diluted EPS of $1.79 to $2.57 per share, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.04 to $2.82 per share. Our EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 158 million shares. In conclusion, the December quarter results demonstrated strong performance and relative strength for KLA across many areas of our business. With our diversified end markets, continued technology leadership across a broadening product portfolio and operational discipline, KLA is delivering on our mission, strategy and objectives. As we begin the new year, calendar 2020 is shaping up for another year of growth in line with or slightly better than our long-term revenue growth rate target of 7% to 9%, earnings-per-share growth of 1.5x the revenue growth rate and demonstrating progress toward our 2023 revenue and non-GAAP EPS targets of $7 billion to $7.5 billion and $14.50 to $15.50 per share.With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin with the Q&A. -- Thank you, Bren. [Operator Instructions] With that, Charlie, we are ready for the first question.[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is now open. -- Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, first question, you talked about 2020 year-over-year growth of high single to low double digit and based on the other segments, it looks like that implies your semi business growing roughly 9%, 11%. So curious, is that the right math? And then as part of that, what are the puts and takes in terms of process control intensity in 2020, presumably, a year with more memory, which is an obvious negative? However, you have your new x-ray tool and growing share at demand as well as Gen5 and exposure to EUV. So can you kind of walk us through the puts and takes around your exposures to WFE, both good and bad in 2020. -- Yes. Sure, CJ, it's Bren, and I'll go first here, just in terms of just context on the numbers. I mean, certainly, 2019 finished much more -- much stronger than what we expected. Which was good to see. And as we look at 2020, if you go back to last earnings versus where we are today, given what we've seen in the foundry/logic base, we'd expect to see more growth in the space this year than what we thought before. And I don't think that our views on the memory environment have changed all that much, that we'll see flash memory recover, we would expect to see that through the year.And we're not relying much on DRAM in our overall forecast in terms of incremental WFE investment. So when you take all those puts and takes and then say, OK, where is the growth coming from? So certainly, our logic/foundry process control intensity is good. Some of the growth coming from memory is lower process control intensity, but to your point, we do have new product introductions that we believe will help drive some of that. So our assumption is that we think from a process control intensity perspective, it stays relatively flat year-over-year. And with new product introduction, we would expect to see some modest share improvement as well. So that's pretty much how we see things at this point. -- Very helpful. And as my follow-up, how should we think about seasonal trends for your PCB business? I imagine that, that's much more of a second half apple weighted kind of ramp. So is there any sort of -- kind of range, first half, second half kind of mix there? -- I would expect PCB to be stronger in the second half. It tends to be more mobile centric. So to your point, we would expect to see stronger revenue profile in the second half for PCB. Would expect this year to be, as Rick had indicated, a year of modest growth in the space and keep in mind, in that part of the business, we also have -- big chunk of it is also service, where it's over 90% of its contract base. So there's a high service utilization on those tools and stickiness to the investment as well. -- Thank you very much. -- Thanks, C.J.Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. -- Good afternoon guys. Good job on the quarterly execution and strong start to 2020. Great services showing on process control in calendar year '19. According to my calculations, your services business was up about 11% in the upper end of your long-term target of 9% to 11%. On your full year view of 10% revenue growth for the business here in calendar '20, based on your installed base growth in 2019, how do you see your process control services business growing in calendar '20? -- So I think when you look at the comparison to the year, I mean, certainly, we've got some incremental growth from the inclusion of the Orbotech business in '19 that drove the growth rate to the to the upper end of the range. So on the process control side, given the weakness in memory, particularly in the first half of the year, it did push us down toward slightly below the 9% to 11% range in terms of year-over-year growth for the process control part of the business. As we look at '20, though, is we've seen utilizations tighten pretty significantly both in memory, but also in the logic space over the course of the year.We would expect the service business to perform in line with its long-term growth rate expectation, which is, yes, the 9% to 11%. So we feel pretty good about what's going on there. Certainly, the contract penetration is high, as Rick had indicated, I think with rising utilization, with new products, given demand for customer -- from customers as they ramp new facilities, we tend to see strong service performance there. And I would expect to see that play out in 2020. So I'd expect more growth next year or in 2020 versus '19. -- Yes. I appreciate the insights there. And a big part of the growth for the team has been that the team has been driving is really due to new product cycles, right? Your Gen5, Teron for EUV as an example, to that end, can you guys just give us an update on some of your next generation programs, like X-ray for stack profiling, e-beam, both for wafer and medical, maybe some rough guidelines on product launch timing and contribution to revenues? -- Yes, I'll take part of that, and then Bren can talk about contribution. As we talked about it at the Analyst Day and also in our last earnings call, we have seen progress in some of the new products. We introduced the AXION, and I mentioned that in the prepared remarks, we're seeing POs now for some of the e-beam inspection tools that before were under evaluation. So we're pretty much on target in terms of the growth potential that we envisioned when we laid out the 2023 plan. And that starts to become more material in the second half of this calendar year.We're very excited about what we've seen with the CD product because we're -- the x-ray product we're seeing more use cases we're getting customers to give us really positive feedback, and we see a continued acceleration. Then I'd also say that the e-beam inspection, combined with the optical tool has been performing as we expected, and we're seeing momentum grow there. So we're on target. We continue to be on the strategic objectives that we laid out for those products to get us to where we believe we need to be to support our 2023 plan. And in terms of impact for this year, it's more second half loaded. And so Bren can talk as to a little bit of sizing it. -- Yes. To Rick's point, I mean, it is an important part of our strategy here to seed the market with these products and to start to develop use case and to drive value with these offerings with customers. And so initial results are pretty promising. And it's one of the -- really one of the factors, as we look at those products, whether it's incremental Gen5 print check applications, which is how customers will qualify reticles in the fab, in EUV, or whether it's e-beam, to Rick's point, or x-ray metrology, we're really excited about the contributions from those products as we move forward here. So the contribution in '20 will be less than what I would consider sort of a steady state expectation for those business because we're starting to see the market with those products, but we will see revenue. And I would think that it's one of those factors that I believe keeps process control intensity of flat despite the memory growth that we would expect to see in '20. -- The one other area you didn't ask about, Harlan, but I'll -- just for more perspective, the Gen5 adoption has accelerated throughout the 2019. And now in 2020, we're seeing additional growth, and we're seeing it really being a major product for multiple customers on both advanced but some nodes that we would have thought maybe it was late for insertion, but we're finding some applications. And where it's really gaining some traction is with EUV qualification. And I mentioned that in the prepared remarks, but I think it's really important as EUV fans out, we think is a great opportunity for Gen5 to exceed even some of the potential that we had originally envisioned because it's really the best way to verify the quality of the EUV masks and especially as customers are ramping the number of devices running on EUV, we're seeing a lot of support and interest from our customers for that. So we feel really good about where Gen5 is right now. -- Great. Great job on the execution. Thank you. -- Thank you. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of David Wong from Instinet. Your line is now open. -- Thanks very much. Can you give us some idea as to what percent of your semi equipment sales are to domestic Chinese makers? -- I would say it's probably between 25% and 30% generally. So to think about the systems piece in 2019, it was about $665 million on our -- what was about $3.2 billion of semiconductor shipments or semiconductor revenue. -- Okay, great. And the other question I had is when we try to calculate year-over-year for the March quarter, it's, of course, confused by the closing of Orbotech a year ago. So can you give us some idea of what the midpoint of your guidance implies in terms of organic year-over-year growth for traditional KLA excluding Orbotech? -- Yes. So we would expect -- and again, with some range to this, but the midpoint on the semiconductor side would be approximately 1.2 -- about $1,215 million to, let's say, $1,230 million, $1,235 million in that ballpark. -- Okay, great. Thanks.Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open. -- Thanks a lot. So Bren, I'm just looking at the second half of 2019. I'm just looking at your process control system shipments. And you did 831 in September and you just did 875, and last September, you did 830 and then you did 850 last calendar Q4. So that's up like small single digits year-over-year. But if I add together Intel and TSMC capex, it's up like more than 30%. So it seems like the number ought to be a little higher. I'm just wondering if maybe there's some timing effect there? Or how you sort of reconcile those numbers? -- So Tim, I think when I look at the data on the semiconductor process control part of the business, it looks like revenue was up about 24% half-over-half in the second half versus the first half of '19. -- Yes, Bren, I guess, I was talking second half of '19 versus second half of '18. -- Second half of '19 versus second half of '18? -- Yes. Basically, barely up. -- Yes, it looks like it's up a few hundred million. -- And I guess the question is, you guys are pretty well exposed to foundry and logic, so why would it be up so little when those guys' capex is up massively? I mean, it's up 30-plus percent. -- Well, Tim, you got to remember that even the activities that we saw at the end of the calendar year, that's revenue that didn't come in at the end of the calendar. And the other part of that was the change in memory during that same time period. -- Got it, Rick. Okay. Okay. So it's a timing issue. Okay. -- Yes, Tim, I think it's timing. I mean, look, we -- it's not a way I really thought about it. So we can follow-up on it. I need to think about those dynamics. I mean, you get different customers, different customer mix. You had the China dynamic. So there are a number of moving parts here that influence the numbers. I mean, if you look at our year-over-year performance, in a down year for the industry is down, what looks like about 10%, we're going to be up modestly, maybe -- I think it looks like we were up about 1% or so. So the second half strength driven by strong investment really from the foundry leader. I would say logic, if you look back at the detailed logic was not all that strong for us over the -- really over the course of most of '19. So I think that the relative performance is pretty good in '19 versus '18. -- Yes. And one last point, Tim, is there was a change in bare wafer. And we talked about that, that '19 was softer than '18. And so some of the business you would have seen in '18 would have been the wafer. So it was both a mix and timing issue. -- Got it. -- Yes, their wafer was down -- their wafer was down about 10% year-to-year. So that was another factor as well. -- Okay. Okay, awesome. Got it. And then, Rick, I think you said in the prepared remarks that obviously, you've widened the range, but I think you also said something about potential policy changes. What did you -- were you referring to export control that could come about? Or were you referring specifically to just the virus and something that might happen around that? -- No, just nothing about anything other than we're complying with all the -- and as you know, rather fluid changes in policy of support for overall China but also Wuhan, in particular. And following that and monitoring that very closely as everyone is right now. -- Got it. Okay. Thanks so much. -- Thank you,Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. -- Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. Two ones. First one for either Rick or Bren. If I look at your March quarter guidance, it looks like sequentially, foundry is up while memory is down. I'm kind of curious how -- why is memory down so much if NAND is going to come back? And secondly, in an environment where people think foundry/logic capex is front half loaded, should we assume that how your revenues have to trend? Or is it tough to say at this point? Then I have a follow-up. -- Well, Krish, on the memory recovery, it's more of a second half driven dynamic. I mean, the activity out there is pretty limited right now to one customer. So not a lot of investment. And so I wouldn't expect to see foundry recovery -- or I'm sorry, memory until we move into the second half of the year. -- Got it. Got it. And then just as a follow-up. If the memory recovery is going to be back half loaded and foundry/logic is front half loaded, how does it impact your gross margin profile? -- There's no changes in gross margin. Our gross margin across all our customer segments is generally the same. Now it varies across different product types. But customer segments don't drive, influence our gross margin unless the product mix dramatically changes. But product to product is the same margin generally across all segments. -- Okay. Thanks, Bren. Thanks, Rick.Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. -- Yeah. Good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Bren in your prepared comments, you said that the midpoint of the March quarter rev guidance would have been 3% to 5% higher if not for the cushion you guys are baking in for the uncertainty around the coronavirus. I'm just kind of curious, is that true of the EPS as well? Or are you not curtailing spending to sort of that lower number? And so EPS would actually be up more, kind of, at a higher revenue midpoint? -- Yes, the assumption is really about revenue. It's not about spending. Our spending plans are based on product development requirements and infrastructure requirements across the company over a broader view of the future. So in any given quarter in a situation like this, we would continue to spend according to our plan. I also said the expectations that I don't think it effects our overall planned for 2020. So I would think that, that business just shifts into the first part of -- or later on in the next quarter or two as we progress through the year. Obviously, this is a fluid situation and things can change, but based on how we see it today, that's how we're thinking about it.So the 3% to 5% is, basically, just comes off the top of same expectations for spending. And of course, there's a gross margin impact to that, which is reflected in the guidance. So we widened the range because there's some fluidity around not just what happens in who they province, but even broader China and how that restarts, not just with customers, but suppliers. So we tried to bake in the broader range to accommodate that potential risk, but that's how we're thinking about it right now. -- That's helpful. And then as my follow-on, Rick, it's always helpful when you give kind of your perspective at the industry. I'm going to put you on the spot a little bit. Your peer last week was a little bit more explicit on a WFE forecast for calendar year '20. Wondering if you endorse that forecast? And if you don't want to get too specific with numbers, I'm just kind of curious how you think about the profile of WFE? There's a lot of concern that maybe it's front half weighted versus second half weighted. How do you kind of see the half-on-half both for WFE in your business this year? -- Yes. Thanks a lot, John. I think that -- what I can say is the end of calendar year, there was more momentum maybe than we would have anticipated from a lot of the activity with our logic and foundry. In fact, as you know, there's very strong and very encouraging. The number of design starts and so the foundry really shapes up to be quite strong, and it's more than just one customer in advanced nodes. So we feel really good about foundry/logic, and we're getting the right signals from our customers about the strength there. Memory did strengthen in terms of our view. And as Bren just indicated, it's earlier for us to size what second half.And as you know, we don't give annual guidance. But I would say there is certainly momentum for the memory investment. And even if you look at the way '19 ended and you've talked about this in the past, if this is a downturn, it's a pretty good downturn because '19 ended pretty strong and the momentum feels pretty good. So if you take out any exogenous factors, like some of the things we're dealing with in terms of the coronavirus things look pretty good for 2020, and we're pretty excited. It's really hard for us to size it. And for us, we definitely feel momentum, and we're building our capacity to be able to support the increased demand, and we have some product areas where we're out of supply for what customers want. So we're having to add capability to support that. So I don't want to give a number, but we definitely feel more positive about '20 than we did probably four or five months ago, especially in light of how strong '19 ended. -- Yes, John. And the only other thing I'll add to that is, to Rick's point, I mean, look, strength and timing of memory recovery is probably the biggest wildcard. And so certainly, people have different views on that. And depending on which markets that you tend to do better in, you may have a different view of that. So I think that's one of the wildcards. The second one is, how much growth do we see in China, how robust is the growth. We do expect China to grow year-over-year in terms of WFE investment. I think the question right now or maybe one of the wild cards, if you will, is how much of that is memory in terms of the next phase of investment on the memory side.So certainly, there are a number of projects on the foundry/logic side, they're investing. And overall, but it's more foundry/logic heavy. So I think the memory, sort of question in China is probably another factor that influences that forecast. But I do think that where we line up is probably in this high single, low double digit kind of range, plus or minus, and we'll see how it plays through as we move through the year, given the flexibility we believe we have in the factory, if it turns out that it's stronger than that, we should be able to support that demand. So we'll be -- we are well positioned for that, if that materializes that way. -- Perfect. Very helpful. Thanks guys.Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your line is now open. -- Thanks for taking my questions. I get that you're taking the conservative view to Q1. When I look at your peers and others in the semiconductor industry, they have chosen not to adopt that conservatism or assume that even if there is a pause in China, that there is sufficient time to recover from it. So let's assume Q1 plays out for you the way you are guiding right now. Do you think there is an above seasonal catch up in the following quarter? Or it's too early to make that determination? Like is there a demand destruction here? Or do you think that there is a chance for a catch-up here? -- Yes, Vivek. So when I look at it, I think that business just shifts. Part of it is process control, part of it is -- it's really across our broader business. There's an impact to the specialty semiconductor business in Wuhan, in Hubei province there, an impact to the flat panel business and to process control. So what we're assuming is that area, given it's the epicenter of the coronavirus so far, that it takes a little bit longer for that to recover, and so we're adjusting our outlook to accommodate that.Perhaps, we're a little bit later than the others, and so we're adopting a slightly more conservative view. And -- but my view is that the 2020 outlook is no different. And so I would expect that business to -- as we start to be able to engage there and be able to support those customers that we'll shift that capability in the June quarter and in that time frame. -- Yes. And if you want perspective, you just look back at other disruptions in supply in our industry's history just recently and what comes flying to me are floods that we had in Southeast Asia. We had the tsunami and the effect of that. And we've had fires and fabs. And in every case, it bounced back. So I don't think there -- I think if it's a temporary disruption, it comes back. And that's what we're -- as we're viewing it right now. -- Got it. Very helpful. And for my follow-up, do you see higher process control intensity in memory in this cycle than it has been in the past? And within that, is there a difference between NAND and DRAM process control intensity? -- There is higher -- I think what's interesting is this is a case of having the capability as opposed to the desire. Our customers in -- especially in NAND, had a huge desire for more process control capability, we just didn't necessarily have the solution. So that was why the intensity was lower. There was plenty of desire. We have now our products that we've been working on for years, targeting and supporting some of the challenges in the advanced NAND technology nodes, and we're seeing adoption as a result of those new products. So that's driving our process control intensity. DRAM is benefiting from the fact they're still shrinking. And so you're seeing some use for some of the advanced wafer inspection capabilities to be able to deal with the increased defectivity requirements. So both of those are cases where we're seeing higher intensity and it's brought on mainly by solutions, not so much by need. -- All right. Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. -- Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a strong year. Just a quick follow-up on the coronavirus impact. Have you already identified disruptions to the supply chain? Or have you received changes to -- in terms of demand signals from customers? Or is this you guys being proactive and prudent and conservative? -- Yes, we're not seeing any change in the customer needs. And in fact, if anything, we're having more conversations with customers to ensure that we can continue to support them. We are modeling supply chain questions. And I think that, that is something that we continue to model, and that's what accounts for the range that we provided and the size of the range. So it's much more about sorting it out, and there's new information every day. I'd say in the last couple of days, it's actually been slightly more positive in terms of the ability to navigate. And so we're still working through a lot of those details. -- But we do have suppliers that haven't been able to get back in, in other parts of China whether it's in Shanghai or in Sojo, that to deliver capability that gets integrated into systems. And it's supply chain that could be dual sourced, but not in a short run, it would take a couple of months to qualify a second supplier. So right now, when those suppliers are able to come back online their people can actually get back into the factory, we would expect to have very little, if any, disruption based on the current plan. Now if it extends out and people can't get back in and these facilities stay closed, then it would have a broader impact. And again, another reason for the wider range. -- And maybe the last point, you all know this is the extension of the Chinese New Year means that there's still -- we're still sorting through what that means because people have been off. And so as they go back, we're trying to determine exactly how that plays out. -- Got it. That's very helpful. And then a quick follow-up on SPTS. Bren, you talked about exiting the year with record backlog, it looks like you guys are expecting a pretty strong year this year. In addition to RF, I think you talked about a recovery in auto in the second half. But if you can kind of speak to the relative contributions from those two dynamics in the year, that would be helpful. -- Yes. I mean, certainly, 5G and the increase in RF requirements are going to be a big driver for SPTS both in the infrastructure for 5G, but also in the movability cycle as that starts to play through. Automotive is there's increasing semiconductor content in automotive and automotive had a difficult year in '19. So even some of the stronger customers for SPTS bought very little in '19. So we're comfortable and optimistic about seeing that part of business recover. And I would expect SPTS, if you add the two together, both in terms of what 5G is driving in automotive, you end up with a 10% to 15% kind of growth year for that business. So we're excited about those opportunities. Packaging might provide another tailwind. And I think they're very well positioned in those markets. -- Thanks so much.Your next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. -- Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. In the past, you talked about the memory adoption on Gen5 being stronger than expected. So I was hoping maybe you could talk about just your confidence going into what looks to be a memory cycle and the potential incremental growth drivers there versus prior cycles? And then are those net new opportunities? Or are they competitive to put displacements? -- Joe, this is Rick. I'll take the first part and let Bren finish with the hard stuff. So my view is the -- we are seeing the adoption. We talked about earlier, over process control adoption, so you just back up and say, the process control intensity in '20 being nominally flat to '19. That's really a function of memory adoption being higher than it's been historically. And that's a function of the new products that we have as well as increased adoption and wafer inspection. We have seen new use cases in terms of what we're seeing, for example, for Gen5 as we expand that capability out. One thing we don't know is when or if EUV is really going to be implemented in any big way in memory, but that creates some upside. But the other thing is the metrology opportunities that we see based on the new products that we've introduced, drive that intensity up. So there is some displacement in terms of our new tools, displace our prior generation, but the net of it all is process control intensity, improving as we see it in the memory, specifically in the NAND. -- Yes, I think to Rick's point, I mean, one of the big things that we saw change in NAND intensity as we went to 3D, was a driver of our unpatterned inspection business to keep tools cleaner because of defectivity challenges as they start to process the stacks. You have increasing flatness requirements. And so if the stacks are rising, flatness becomes more and more important, wafer stress is more important. And so we're -- we have capabilities for that. And then certainly, the metrology requirements as you've gotten into 3D structures have intensified in a meaningful way for us. Then you add in new products, and we feel pretty good about that both with new products for metrology, but also in terms of some of the e-beam capability that we're bringing to market.To Rick's point, DRAM, with the introduction of EUV into DRAM, even at a single layer or 2, that should drive scaling again and ultimately will enable smaller defects, which tends to drive our inspection business and with the broader portfolio, we feel like we're very well positioned there. So we think there's opportunities for -- we have to execute, but we think there's opportunities for us to continue to drive some improvement in process control intensity and memory. It will never look like foundry/logic, but at the same time, I think there's incremental opportunity there if we can execute. -- That's helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up, your expectations for domestic China revenue for 2020, I apologize I've missed it, is that still flat year-over-year? -- No, it's one of the drivers that's changed since last earnings as I would expect to see some growth there. It's more logic/foundry heavy. I think the amount of memory investment in China next year is probably one of these wildcards that will influence the WFE level overall for next year. But I would expect to see it grow, and I think it's double-digit growth year-to-year. -- Thank you. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank. You line is now open. -- Thanks for taking my question. Just following up to previous questions on the implied memory revenue guide for the March quarter. I understand memory capex recovery is more second half, but it does imply a sharp decline quarter-over-quarter after three straight quarters of revenue being at a high level. So what was driving that dynamic in the previous three quarters that will be absent until the second half of this year? -- Well, you have multiple customers investing. And right now, when you look at the March quarter, there just isn't a lot of activity on the memory front. You still see customers investing in technology progression, but very little new capacity, particularly in the flash space right now in the March quarter for us. Now we shipped into that business more in the December quarter. So it could be a timing issue between when we see it versus where capacity centric flare might see it. But memory in the March quarter is kind of weak, and I would expect to see it strengthen as we move through the year. -- Okay. That's helpful. Maybe a follow-up is -- sorry, if this has been asked earlier, but last quarter, you had expected revenue to come down like 5% half-over-half in the first half of calendar '20. And given calendar Q4 was much stronger, does that change the slope of that and assuming that the coronavirus impact kind of offset itself in the first half of the year? And how should we think about first half versus second half for this year? -- I think it's a relatively flat outlook half-to-half in the first half of '20, given the assumptions that we have on the coronavirus, and we start to see this work itself and clear itself as we move into the June quarter. So relatively flat for the overall business. -- Okay, great. Thanks.We have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to the presenters. -- Thank you, and thank you, everyone, for your time and interest in KLA today.

Simply put, the market bought the stocks based on the idea that 2019 would mark a trough in the semiconductor industry leading to a recovery in the following years.

Indeed, some of into the idea. \u00a0Given that MKS Instruments generates around half of its sales directly from the semiconductor market,\u00a0and a large part of the rest from industries connected with it, it's likely to be a key beneficiary.The good news is that the idea of a recovery is being bolstered by positive remarks on the industry made both by the management of major companies  and by industry bodies.For example, Japan is a major semiconductor manufacturer.

AT&T's business is diversified across mobile, media, and technology, and this diversity is highly attractive to many. In addition, shares yield about 5.5% today and trade at roughly 16.5 times earnings.That's certainly a solid yield, but some would argue that AT&T's sprawling business had become too bloated and distracted from its main wireless business. This was the core criticism that \u00a0expressed in recent months, and AT&T management has responded by committing to a comprehensive portfolio review while pausing on any major acquisitions.Yet after the recent run, AT&T's stock may be running out of gas. The company still faces huge competitive threats in not one, but every single one of its main businesses, as the transition from 4G to 5G communications, and the migration from linear television to over-the-top streaming remain huge question marks for the telecom behemoth. A  from a leading telecom analyst cast further doubt on the company being able to meet its 2022 targets. So after AT&T's recent run, dividend-oriented investors may wish to look at other names that offer better total value and/or growth prospects. Here are three names to consider.Image source: Getty Images.If you're going to invest in a risky, debt-laden telecom, why not go for the cheapest, highest-yielding of the bunch? However, there's more going on at CenturyLink than just its juicy 7% dividend yield.CenturyLink is almost entirely focused on the wireline business, especially enterprise wireline, where it actually competes head-to-head with AT&T. Both companies have struggled here in recent years, as legacy technology services are declining more than newer, high-speed broadband services are growing; however, eventually the newer growth segments will outgain legacy services declines, returning each company to growth. Of course, when that happens is an open question.So why invest in CenturyLink over AT&T? Namely, it's much, much cheaper, and by fully concentrating on wireline services under all-star CEO Jeff Storey, CenturyLink appears to be more efficient at the moment:Data source: CenturyLink and AT&T third-quarter releases. Table by author. EBITDA = earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.AT&T actually received $80 million from the sales of some patents in the third quarter, perhaps boosting revenue above its normal run rate.  As you can see, CenturyLink is currently more profitable, and its profitability trajectory is improving to a greater extent than AT&T's, as CenturyLink continues to find cost synergies from its 2017 merger with Level 3 Communications.Not only is CenturyLink outperforming in this segment, but it is much, much cheaper. In 2019, CenturyLink expects to make about $3.25 billion in free cash flow, which equates to just a 5 times price-to-free-cash-flow ratio at today's market cap.  Meanwhile, AT&T recently guided for $28 billion in free cash flow in 2019, good for a forward price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 10. CenturyLink's dividend yield is also 120 basis points higher than AT&T's, even after  by more than half. CenturyLink has been using the excess cash to pay down debt, paying off $1.5 billion of debt year to date, and refinancing even more of its debt at a lower rate. That brought the company's debt-to-EBITDA ratio down from 4.0 to 3.7 this year. AT&T is paying down debt too, but CenturyLink's leverage ratio is higher. That means continued solid performance, deleveraging, and lower interest rates have the potential to boost CenturyLink's stock price much more than AT&T's.CenturyLink could be seen as more risky than AT&T, but at half the valuation, and without the uncertainty in the media and 5G spaces, its bargain valuation more than makes up for it.After a big run this year, hard disk and NAND flash storage producer   has run into a  after its third quarter earnings release. While a recovery in NAND flash is beginning to take hold, the recent progress has been slower than some expected. Additionally, Western Digital's CEO announced his retirement in conjunction with the company's , adding to the uncertainty. Since then, shares are off about 27.5% from their 52-week highs, but still up a healthy 35% on the year. data by The pullback could be an opportunity for yield-seeking investors, as Western Digital's dividend yield has climbed to 4.2%. At just under $48, shares are still far lower than the highs of 2014, when shares were priced above $110. Of course, 2019 has been a brutal year for memory stocks in general, as the \"boom\" of 2017-2018 led producers to increase the supply of chips, just before the U.S.-China trade war began, causing customers to pull back on demand, in turn causing memory prices to crash.Nevertheless, the long-term future looks bright for memory and storage. NAND demand is set to explode at a long-term growth rate of 30% to 40% per year, as memory-intensive applications such as big data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning applications take off over the next decade.\u00a0 Though it's , Western Digital still has a strong portfolio across both hard disks and flash, and should be able to find its way to the next memory upcycle, which seems like just a matter of time, barring a recession. Meanwhile, investors are getting paid a nice 4.2% dividend for their patience today.Of the three\u00a0AT&T alternatives in this article,   is the highest-quality of the bunch, though it currently has the lowest  yield. Nevertheless, that forward yield climbed over 2% recently, as shares fell 7% following an analyst double downgrade from \"buy\" to \"sell\" on Thursday, Nov. 21, over fears that the stock had run too far in the near-term.KLA has had an amazing run in 2019, having more than doubled since Jan. 1, and the downgrade appears to be mere caution after such a big move, with investors taking profits on the cautionary note.\u00a0 data by Why all the previous optimism? KLA has the No. 1 market share and a large economic moat in  for semiconductor manufacturers. Its machines are essential in producing smaller, more powerful logic and memory chips. KLA's equipment has been in high demand this year as the world's leading foundries are seeing a  and high-performance computing. While certain industrial and automotive segments of the chip world are lagging, high demand for the most advanced leading-edge chips, especially from China, means more demand for KLA's equipment.However, analyst Tim Arcuri of UBS thinks that foundry equipment buying has peaked in the near term when comparing today's buying patterns to past cycles. Arcuri moved his price target to $140 from $192, below today's share price of $161. However, this may be more of a short-term call after a big run. The capital intensity of chip production is going up over time, so past cycles may not be a perfect comparison. And though foundry spending has been booming, memory spending has actually been in the dumps this year as memory prices have plummeted. That segment should turn around next year, offsetting a potential flattening on the foundry side. In addition, KLA has a strong services revenue base at around 25% of its revenue, which is not exactly tied to its quarterly equipment sales, and should help even out the cycles going forward.Several other analysts actually came out in defense of the company after Arcuri's downgrade, with some giving price targets above $200 per share. \u00a0And taking more of a long-term view, KLA management guided for $14.50 to $15.50 in earnings per share (EPS) by 2023, meaning shares trade at only 10 to 11 times that figure today.While the stock isn't quite as cheap as it was earlier this year, KLA still has a large moat in an industry, that, while cyclical, still has very attractive long-term prospects. That means Foolish long-term investors should strongly consider picking up shares today after the recent discount.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

For SOXX to get anywhere in the ballpark of this year's surge in 2020, that effort will likely boil down to two factors: chip demand and the subsequent earnings generated by companies in this space.\u201cTo keep the rally going, semiconductor companies will need to start posting better-than-expected financial results, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore, who was one of the first analysts on Wall Street to get cautious on the group in the second half of 2018,\u201d\u00a0Demand is expected to be decent in the year ahead. The highly anticipated 5G rollout will happen, likely bolstering the case for communications chips, the need for\u00a0\u00a0chips remains strong and SOXX could also benefit from a video game hardware upgrade cycle later in the year.While there are credible reasons to believe semiconductor demand will, at the very least, be steady in 2020, investors will pay up for the privilege of entertaining that thesis. As the chart below indicates, the PHLX Semiconductor Index is as richly valued as it has been in a decade.\u00a0and\u00a0, a pair of this year's chip stars and two stocks that combine for over 13 percent of the SOXX roster, reflect the frothy valuations currently found in Chip Land. Nvidia trades at 30.30x next year's earnings, cheap compared to the 37.45x found on rival AMD.However, there's also a twist to the semiconductor equity thesis: some of these stocks, including high-flying Nvidia are actually under-owned by professional investors.\u201cBank of America says several major semiconductor companies are under-owned by funds, creating an \u2018attractive opportunity,\u2019\u201d\u00a0.Nvidia is up almost 68 percent this year and, somehow, that stock's ownership level among active fund managers is quite low.That name owned by 28% of fund managers with 0.90x weighting (vs. semis at 1.19x)\u201d while \u201cBofA also sees\u00a0\u00a0as \u2018particularly attractive\u2019 since the company is \u201cunder-owned and underweight\u201d by funds,\u201d according to Seeking Alpha. \u201calso makes the list with only 11.6% fund ownership.\u201dKLA is the tenth-largest component in SOXX at a weight of nearly 4%.In the third quarter, 75% of SOXX components reported better-than-expected earnings and sales with\u00a0joining that group late Thursday.

Goldman Sachs has an interesting idea\u2026 Move toward US companies with high exposure to international sales. Goldman points out that such companies are on an upswing in 2H19, and that a basket of such stocks has been outperforming both the firm\u2019s other portfolios and the broader S&P 500. For comparison, the firm notes that its \u2018international sales exposure\u2019 basket is up 29% this year, compared to the S&P gain of 23%.Stephanie Cohen, Goldman Sachs\u2019 chief strategy officer, in an interview last week talked down fears that the US-China trade tensions are unwinding long-established economic cooperation between the two countries. She said, after a visit to Chinese tech companies in Shenzen, \u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re decoupling. If you sit on the ground and you\u2019re talking to companies, people are continuing to talk about ways that they can do business together.\u201dGoldman Sachs has a decades-long record pursuing investment and business openings in China. The firm has partnerships with Chinese banks, and has taken the time to learn the facts on the ground. And now they see opportunity in the US companies that are most exposed to the international scene, where China is working hard to throw its weight around.Looking into Goldman\u2019s basket of stocks with international exposure, we\u2019ve chosen three that  reveals have shown recent strong gains, a healthy upside potential, and recent Buy ratings from 5-star analysts. This company services the semiconductor chip industry, providing essential process control and management systems for manufacturers of silicon wafers and integrated circuits, along with quality control and precision metrology. As the industry shifts to new, higher performance chips, and to 5G networks, the need to maintain quality tolerances becomes more important, and KLA, with operations across the US, Europe, and the Asia/Pacific regions is well-positioned to benefit. KLA shares have brought in a disproportionate 97% year-to-date return to the Goldman\u2019s international exposure basket.Looking at the numbers, KLA\u2019s revenue growth over the last few years confirms the company\u2019s importance to the industry. It brought in $2.98 billion in 2016, and has seen that number grow to $4.6 billion in fiscal 2019. In its fiscal Q1 2020 report, the company showed that revenue is still growing, with quarterly sales gaining 12% year-over-year to $1.41 billion.KLA has been active in the past several years making relevant acquisitions. The most recent, metrology tool-maker Capres A/S, was purchased in March of this year for an undisclosed amount. Last year, in a deal worth $3.4 billion, KLA acquired Orbotech, a major producer of circuit boards and flat-panel displays. The deal was completed in February of this year, after clearing regulatory hurdles in China.Writing from JPMorgan, top analyst  sees KLAC shares in a boom period. He writes, \u201cWe believe semiconductor capital spending is in the midst of a technology-driven cycle for 7nm/5nm Foundry/Logic, sub-20nm DRAM, and high layer count 3D NAND. As device manufacturing complexities increase, the need to analyze defects and metrology issues at critical points in the IC manufacturing processes increases significantly\u2026 [KLA] has diversified end-market exposure through the acquisition of Orbotech.\" Sur gives KLAC a $200 price target, implying an upside of 13%. (To watch Sur's track record, )KLA stock has a resounding \u201cyes\u201d on Wall Street. TipRanks analytics show that out of 12 analysts, 10 are bullish, while 2 remain sidelined. The average price target of $191 shows a potential upside of about 8%. ()With a market cap of $22.3 billion, Microchip is the sixth largest semiconductor manufacturer in the US. The company produces chips for the microcontroller and microprocessor industry, power management applications, memory solutions, and wireless connection devices. In the 2019 fiscal year, ending this past March, Microchip brought in $5.35 billion in total revenues. Last year, the company acquired competitor Microsemi in a deal with $10 billion.The US-China trade war has hurt Microchip, depressing sales through much of this year. Until this past September, the stock showed high volatility. Even with that, the MCHP is up 30% year-to-date, a solid performance based on the quality and necessity of its products. The company\u2019s first and second quarter fiscal 2020 reports have also helped to allay investor fears. Microchip earnings beat or met expectations in both quarters, while revenues were up year-over-year.Even with the two good quarters, Microchip\u2019s sales are down year-over-year, and the company has revised its full-year guidance downward. In a way, this may be a case of lowering expectations to set up a positive financial report \u2013 BMO's top analyst  points out.\u201cUnlike the better guidance/commentary we got for December from companies last week, Microchip's guidance is for lower revenues than expectations, and calling for yet another double-digit y-y decline in sales,\u201d Srivastava noted. In his bottom line, however, Srivastava says, \u201cWe like Microchip's operating model. We like the valuation, we like the two rounds of estimate cuts we have already seen. We see the company as among the higher rungs of diversified businesses we would like to recommend in our coverage.\u201d His $110 price target implies a 16% upside for the stock. (To watch Srivastava's track record, ), 5-star analyst from Rosenblatt Securities, also sees management\u2019s performance as key to MCHP\u2019s share price prospects. He writes, \u201cMCHP's environment remains uncertain, as the trade war and broad-based macroeconomic weakness hinder visibility. Management continues to execute well, however, and has managed the down-cycle with low channel inventory going forward... We continue to believe mid-to-longer term investors will have increasing confidence in management's ability to execute, as the company looks to exit this down-cycle gaining market share in secular MCU/analog markets and increase operating margins.\u201d Mosesmann puts a $115 price target on the stock, for a 22% upside potential. (To watch Mosesmann's track record, )Wall Street\u2019s analysts are sanguine about this stock\u2019s ability to gain going forward. Microchip\u2019s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 12 Buys and 2 Holds. It doesn\u2019t hurt that its $109.31 average price target puts the potential twelve-month rise at 16%. () And now we move away from the semiconductor sector and into the internet. We all know Alphabet; the parent company of Google, with a market cap of $893 billion, is the world\u2019s fourth-largest publicly traded company. With over $136 billion in annual revenue, and $30 billion in net income, there is no doubt that Alphabet will hold its position near the top.GOOGL shares are up 24% year-to-date, just slightly outperforming the S&P 500, after an earnings miss in the Q3 report. While revenues were up, at $40.5 billion, the EPS of $10.12 missed the forecast by 18.5%. The earnings slip came as the company increased capital expenditures from $5.28 billion one year ago to $6.73 billion in the current report. The company is increasing spending on its cloud sales force, and has just made a $2.1 billion offer to acquire smartwatch company Fitbit. The acquisition, if approved, will put Google in a direct position to compete against Apple in the smartwatch and wearable niche.Fitbit will make an interesting addition to Alphabet\u2019s \u2018other revenue\u2019 category, which includes both cloud systems and hardware. This category saw quarterly revenue of $6.43 billion, beating the forecast of $6.32 and coming in 38.5% above the year-ago quarter.So GOOGL has a firm foundation in its core search engine business, strong ad revenue, and rising revenues in its other endeavors. It\u2019s a solid picture, and explains why the stock makes up 2.26% of Goldman\u2019s \u2018international exposure\u2019 basket. Google\u2019s global reach and profitability are undisputed.5-star JMP analyst  is enthusiastic about the Fitbit acquisition, putting a $1,450 price target on GOOGL and writing, \u201cWe believe Fitbit is a natural fit with Google\u2019s current hardware brands that include its Pixel phones, Nest connected home products, and Google home smart speakers under its Made By Google brand, along with its Android OS\u2026 we believe Google is investing in developing the hardware and touchpoints that will enable its ambient computing strategy\u2026\u201d Josey\u2019s price target suggests an upside for 12% for GOOGL shares. (To watch Josey's track record, )5-star analyst , of Credit Suisse, focused more on Alphabet\u2019s free cash flow position in his comments, saying, \u201cGoogle in our view is a controlled outcome, with management looking to drive consistent revenue and FCF growth through the amassing and creation of a portfolio of assets even as the law of large numbers begin to result in deceleration for some of the largest businesses\u2026 overall revenue growth has once again settled into a managed ~20%+ range\u2026 Google has resumed free cash flow growth this year after two years of investments.\u201d Ju puts a $1,700 price target on the stock, showing confidence in a bullish 31% upside. (To watch Ju's track record, )GOOGL\u2019s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 25 Buys set in the past three months, against just 4 Holds. Analysts are confident that the company can meet the challenges inherent in the ever-changing digital world. Shares sell for an eye-popping $1,296, but the average price target, $1,455, truly gets into nosebleed territory. The stock has an average upside of 12%.

Rick? -- Thank you, Kevin, and welcome to KLA. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'll start with a brief strategic overview before I cover the business highlights from the quarter. Please turn to slide four. KLA continues to see strong momentum in our business from the secular trends we articulated at our recent September 17 Investor Day. Our performance this quarter clearly demonstrates how KLA is benefiting from our strategies for growth technology leadership and operational excellence. We delivered another solid quarter with revenue in both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS finishing above the range of guidance a result of strong customer pull for KLA's solutions and focused execution despite a backdrop that still includes some industry headwinds in key segments. As a global leader in process control and supplier of process-enabling solutions for the data, era KLA remains at the forefront of the most important industry trends and technology inflections in the electronics industry. Our deep collaborative customer relationships broad IP portfolio and differentiated solutions that address our customers' most complex challenges is the recipe that sustains our market leadership.Our business also continues to benefit from more complexity within semiconductor devices as well as multiple megatrends driving demand across multiple product generations in numerous key industries. Turn to slide 5. Underpinning our success and consistent outperformance is the KLA operating model, which codifies our corporate values and management principles. We have been running the company this way for a long time but we discussed it much more extensively at our recent Investor Day to better illustrate its power and impact on the KLA business and explain how it represents critical core competencies that we believe can enhance the long-term performance and profitability of acquired businesses. KLA operating model is essential to aligning the company on a consistent strategy and execution, heightened accountability and facilitate continuous improvement while ensuring, we always operate with strong financial discipline and rigor. turn to Slide 6. Strategically we have four objectives that serve as our guide and drive our high-performance culture. I also spoke about this extensively at our recent Investor Day but it's worth reinforcing for those who couldn't attend. These four objectives are: Market leadership; product differentiation; operational excellence; and attracting and developing talent.We run all our businesses including acquired ones with a focus on these key four objectives and it shows in our overall results published today. Please turn to slide seven for the September quarter business highlights. Before I cover the business highlights for the quarter I'd like to provide some high-level perspective on the current industry environment. The long-term growth opportunity for the semiconductor markets remains compelling driven by the proliferation of electronics across more diversified end markets the introduction of new advanced technologies supporting 5G and artificial intelligence growing semiconductor investment in China and continued device and process innovation to deliver superior performance and return on investment. KLA's strong results are primarily driven by demand momentum we see due to support both development and capacity growth in advanced logic. The demand to support advanced logic nodes is expected to remain healthy through the balance of 2019 and into 2020 driven by investment in EUV competitive dynamics and capacity additions.Given the recent news of increased capex investment in 2019 at leading-edge logic and better-than-expected demand from domestic memory customers in China, our outlook for WFE investment in 2019 has improved since our initial view for the year. We now expect WFE levels to decline by approximately 10% to 15% in 2019 with KLA Semi process control business inclusive of our guidance today, outperforming the broad semiconductor capital equipment and growing modestly compared to 2018. let me cover some of the product highlights from the quarter. KLA's market leadership is evidence of the successful execution of our portfolio strategy focused on differentiation to address our customers' most critical challenges. We're happy with our product positioning and the strong customer acceptance we are experiencing across our portfolio. continue to see accelerated growth of our flagship Gen5 Optical Inspection platform with customers now deploying Gen5 for both technology development and production monitoring at the advanced nodes. Driven by this expanded use case, we expect Gen5 shipments to double in 2019 and adoption to continue to grow in 2020 as customers are under intense pressure to ramp quickly and KLA's Advanced Optical Inspection platform is on the critical path to their success.The accelerating adoption of EUV and increased investment in leading-edge foundry and logic will continue to drive strong Gen5 demand in the near term. Also at last month's Investor Day, we announced the first new EBEAM inspection platform in several years. I'm pleased to report that we're receiving very positive feedback from our early customers related to the initial tool performance. KLA's differentiated EBEAM inspection platform works with Gen5 optical inspection platform with seamless connectivity to offer customers the best inspection performance combination at the lowest overall cost of ownership to identify and detect yield killer defects at the most advanced nodes. Demand for mask inspection continues to be a highlight for KLA. In the September quarter, we saw a continuation of the momentum we have experienced over the past several quarters and better-than-expected demand in the September quarter helping to contribute to the revenue upside we experienced in the quarter. We're seeing strong demand from leading foundries for our Teron mask inspection platform for optical and EUV applications and expect this to continue as customers ramp their advanced technology road maps. And finally KLA Service business continues to deliver excellent revenue growth performance while simultaneously generating record free cash flow. Semi process control service revenue is on track to top $1 billion in 2019 with over 70% of the revenue generated from subscription-like service contracts.This gives us high confidence that this business can deliver long-term revenue growth rates in the range of 9% to 11%. Several factors drive growth in our Service businesses including increased complexity of our systems expansion of the installed base and extended demand at the trailing edge nodes. With high fab utilization in foundry and logic and stable or bottoming in memory, our customers are also looking for opportunities to enhance productivity and extend the life of their installed base. As a result, we see robust service contract penetration and our Service business is providing a steady recurring revenue stream to our business. Please turn to slide eight. In summary, the KLA operating model drives our investment thesis. This is accomplished by driving sustained technology leadership with a strong competitive moat supported by a track record of free cash flow generation and capital return. Despite near-term headwinds and the industry demand environment centered on the timing of memory capacity investment, KLA continues to execute exceptionally well and deliver healthy relative revenue and earnings growth.Our focus on driving innovation and providing a steady stream of differentiated products and solutions sets the stage for growth in 2020 and positions KLA to achieve the long-term growth targets we established in our September Investor Day. 2019 is turning out to be a banner year for KLA showcasing the enduring value created by the successful execution of our strategic objectives. Looking to 2020 and beyond we're very excited about our prospects for growth and market leadership building on the momentum we've established in our process control markets and capitalizing on the market expansion opportunities from the Orbotech acquisition. We remain impressed with the Orbotech team and excited by market opportunities and technology leadership. Our integration and product synergy programs are on track and progressing well.With that, I'll turn the call over to Bren for his commentary on the September quarter financial results and our December quarter outlook. Bren? -- Thank you, Rick and good afternoon everyone. Please turn to slide 10 for a review of the September quarter financial highlights. This was a very strong quarter for KLA with revenue and EPS each coming in above the high end of our guidance ranges. Our free cash flow results also marked a new record for the company. Total revenue for the September 2019 quarter was $1.413 billion which was above the range of guidance of $1.31 billion to $1.39 billion. Gross margin for the quarter was 60.8% in the upper end of the guided range for the quarter of 60% to 61% driven by incremental revenue growth and a stronger-than-expected semi process control product mix. GAAP EPS was $2.16 and non-GAAP EPS was $2.48 both of which were also above the range of guidance of $1.75 to $2.05 and $2.04 to $2.34 respectively. Our cash flow execution was exceptional this quarter as both cash from operations and free cash flow came in at record levels of $496 million and $464 million. We are proud of our financial results this quarter and we remain focused on executing across all markets as we move forward with a focus on our integration and synergy plans for the Orbotech acquisition. A key element of our investment thesis is KLA's commitment to returning cash to shareholders.On September 17 we announced a 13% increase in our quarterly dividend level to $0.85 per share. This marks the tenth consecutive annual increase in our quarterly dividend level reflecting our confidence in our business strategy the strength of our free cash flow generation and our ability to grow it over time as well as our commitment to returning value to shareholders. In terms of returning capital to shareholders during the quarter we were consistent and effective in our execution as we repurchased $228 million of common stock and also paid $122 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents upon divesting of restricted stock units. In addition, we reaffirmed our commitment to continuing to return capital to shareholders as we announced that the Board of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion share repurchase program resulting in $1.6 billion available to repurchase under Board authorization at quarter end. Please turn to slide 11 for a review of the revenue breakdown by reportable segments and key end markets. Review of the semi process -- revenue for the semi process control segment was healthy and a new record at $1.163 billion in the quarter up 16% sequentially on the back of strength in foundry and logic. As Rick discussed in his opening remarks our view of the WFE demand environment for 2019 has improved modestly driven by investments in EUV and stronger foundry demand. In addition, increased demand from native China is also contributing to this improvement where expectations are for this business in 2019 to be relatively flat now versus 2018.As I mentioned foundry was very strong at approximately 44% of semi process control revenue up from 36% last quarter. Memory was 43% in September down from 52% last quarter; logic was 13% of total semi process control revenue versus 12% last quarter. I'll turn now to the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment. SPTS is a leader in PVD and edge solutions in fast-growing specialty semiconductor applications like MEMS sensors power and RF devices as well as in advanced packaging markets. Revenue for SPTS was $69 million up 3% sequentially. While we're encouraged by the market position of these products SPTS revenue for 2019 has been impacted by ongoing global trade issues and a slowdown in the automotive semiconductor market. Despite these near-term headwinds we expect SPTS to deliver revenue levels in 2019 that are roughly flat on a pro forma basis to calendar year 2018. Revenue for the PCB Display and Component Inspection segment was $179 million down 3% sequentially and in line with expectations. This segment includes the former PCB and display businesses of Orbotech and KLA's component inspection business. Please turn to slide 12 for a breakdown of revenue by major products and regions. The distribution of revenue by major product category in the September quarter was as follows: wafer inspection was 32%; patterning which includes reticle inspection was 27%.Wafer inspection and patterning are part of our Semiconductor Process Control segment; Specialty Semiconductor Process was 4%; PCB Display and Component Inspection revenue was 9%.; other which includes bench-top analytical instruments and the KLA Pro mature products and enhancements business was 3%; Service was 25% of revenue in the quarter. In terms of regional split Taiwan was 27% China was 24% Japan was 15% Korea was 14% the U.S. was 13% Europe was 4% with the rest of Asia at 3%. Please turn now to slide 13 for other income statement highlights. Total operating expenses were $376 million in the quarter and our operating margin was 34.2%. Other income and expense in the September quarter was $39 million. The effective tax rate was just under 11% below our long-term tax planning rate at 14% due to a decrease in tax reserves related to the resolution of a tax audit in the U.S. Non-GAAP earnings per share under the 14% planning rate would have been $2.39 per share. Going forward you should continue to use 14% as the long-term planning rate. Net income was $398 million and we had 160 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Please turn to slide 14. We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash total debt of $3.4 billion and a flexible and attractive debt maturity profile supported by investment-grade ratings from all three agencies. Please turn to slide 15 for a review of free cash flow. KLA has a history of consistent free cash flow generation and high free cash flow conversion.Over the past five years, we have averaged just over 100% free cash flow conversion. And over the last 12 months, it's been 84%. Our innovation and differentiation in the marketplace are what drives our industry-leading gross margins and ultimately our free cash flow conversion. Please turn to slide 16. KLA continues to execute on its commitment to return capital to shareholders in the form of both dividends and share repurchases. The dividend payout has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 15% since inception. The share repurchase has also increased over the years with the average price paid to repurchased shares being slightly over $66 since 2010. The only exception to the company's systematic repurchasing activity was during the period when it was blacked out due to merger discussions. Please turn to slide 17 for December quarter 2019 guidance. We expect total revenue to grow sequentially roughly 4% at the midpoint and be in a range of $1.435 billion to $1.515 billion in the December quarter. Foundry is forecasted to be about 55% of semi process control system revenue in the December quarter depicting the strength we continue to see among our foundry customer base. We expect memory to be approximately 36% of system revenue in the December quarter reflecting continued headwinds we see in the memory market. Logic is expected to be about 9% of semi process control system revenue next quarter.For the second half of the year, we now expect foundry and logic revenue combined to be up over 50% in the second half of the calendar year versus the first half. Based on product mix expectations for the December quarter we forecast gross margin to be in a range of 60% to 61%. In terms of operating expenses, we are modeling NIM to be approximately $385 million. The higher operating expense level in the December quarter is due principally to the timing of nonhead-count-related product engineering expenses for next-generation programs as well as new risk mitigation bubble costs associated with recent actions taken to drive long-term structural cost reduction actions related to leveraging KLA's global footprint to relocate certain manufacturing and engineering activities to lower-cost locations. We would expect to see an impact from these activities through 2020 with the return on these investments beginning in 2021. As we move forward to the March quarter our expectation today is that operating expenses will return back into the range of $370 million to $375 million as product development expenses normalize to run rate levels and acquisition synergies offset other costs. We expect other interest and expense to be approximately $38 million in the December quarter and the tax rate to be about 14%. For earnings, we expect GAAP diluted EPS of $2.13 to $2.43 per share and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.39 to $2.69 per share.Our EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 159 million shares. In conclusion, the September quarter result demonstrates strong operating performance and relative strengths for KLA across many critical segments in what remains an environment with some headwinds. With our diversified end markets continued technology leadership across a broad product portfolio and operational discipline KLA is delivering strong relative performance and we are encouraged by the momentum we see in our business. Before I turn the call over to Kevin to begin the Q&A I'd like to make a few qualitative comments on our outlook for the wafer fab equipment market in 2020. While it is too early for us to provide specific guidance or have to have trajectories for the year we continue to see a strong year for foundry and logic investment with investment levels consistent with what we've experienced in 2019 as customers continue to progress their technology road maps and a strong demand environment with improving competitive dynamics in diversified end demand. For memory we expect a better year in 2020 and disciplined supply management in 2019 has improved the overall condition in both segments. Given the strength of our market position, the purchasing behavior of process control in foundry and logic improving process control intensity in memory and contributions from new products calendar 2020 is setting up for another year of relative outperformance for KLA. We'll have more to say on this when we report earnings for December quarter.I'll now turn the call back over to Kevin to begin the Q&A. Kevin? -- Thank you, Bren. As we begin the Q&A, we request you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. With that Christian, we're ready for the first question.[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. -- Yes, good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the very solid results. Rick, I want to go back to one of your comments you made in your prepared comments about the Gen5 optical inspection platform. You mentioned that you expect shipments to double in 2009 and for that to still be a good growth driver in 2020. So I guess I'm trying to get a sense from you where in sort of the potential of that product cycle over time do you think we are? Maybe using a baseball analogy might be the right way to look at it. And as you think about logic/foundry being strong next year to what extent is that just a call on laundry -- on logic/foundry capex versus perhaps a Gen5 product cycle that's still in the sweet spot and accelerating? -- Sure, John. Thanks for the question. Yes, I think if I thought about Gen5 right now and you want to use baseball it's the third inning. It's relatively early in the life. We're now on the second iteration of that product in terms of a new platform and there are several iterations to follow. Engineering is being dedicated to that but we're now starting to see broad adoption and really the beginning of adoption in production where what we really had been dealing with for the most part in the last couple of years was during the development cycle. So we're still early on and we think it will become a primary tool. We always thought it would become the HVM tool once we got to EUV in ramping in production and it definitely feels like it's doing that. The upside to that is we've seen more memory adoption in the Gen5 than we originally anticipated. So that's probably upside to what we had originally envisioned. -- John, it's Bren. The only other thing I'd add to that is as we talked about at our Investor Day there is an application for reticle qualification in the fabs for EUV reticles. So we're -- as we start to progress that use case it's how the tool is used for full wafer coverage to be able to qualify reticles as they're being used in the wafer fab. So an incremental opportunity there that is slowly evolving but we think it adds another dimension of growth for Gen5 as it gets adopted. -- That's helpful. And Bren maybe just for my follow-up I want to go back to the operating model you shared at the Analyst Day around op margin sort of bridge between now and 2023. You're already kind of ahead of the revenue -- op margin targets you gave in that model both in the September quarter and in the December guide and it sounds like December opex is unusually high per your comments. And in general that op margin target you gave only assumed incremental op margins at the low end of your historical guidance. I'd hate to obsolete the model less than a quarter out but can you talk a little bit about whether or not you think there's upside or conservatism to that model you gave at the Analyst Day? -- Yes, John, it's a good question. I mean I think one of the challenges in putting together the model is it reflects a different mix of business that we have today but also expected moving forward. So clearly in the September quarter and even in December what's driving our business in terms of incremental growth is the process control part of the business and that is behaving consistent with the historical model that we've had out there. So anytime the mix is shifting in that direction you're going to see outperformance against the base model. So what we tried to reflect was based on our expectations for growth over time what the mix of business would do and how that would impact the model. Obviously, there's synergy and other actions that are embedded in that. But anytime we have an inflection driven by the process control part of the business we're going to see a period of outperformance. But in terms of your long-term view, I think it's the right way to think about it. -- Perfect. Thanks guys. Congratulations again. -- Thank you, John.Thank you. The next question is from C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is open. -- Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question on the foundry/logic side of things can you speak to whether you're seeing increasing breadth of spending in that category and really focused on the leading edge? And as part of that if you could speak to also reuse? That clearly was a headwind basically from 20-nanometer down but it sounds like seven non-EUV progressing to five EUV but that's a seismic shift here that is driving a real uptick in process control intensity. Would love to hear your thoughts on both of those things. -- Yes CJ I'll take the question and then Bren will add some color to it as well. It's not very broad right now. I think that the foundry/logic is -- it's not particularly broad. We expect it to broaden out next year in '20 as it expands. In terms of reuse, there are a couple of dynamics that are quite different from the prior cycles. One is the just very large number of starts -- design starts. So there's a lot of demand being driven by the fact there are so many different devices that are being introduced at these advanced nodes. So we don't suspect that there will be that much. The other thing is we have new product cycle which are really adding lot of capabilities. So obviously customers are always trying to optimize their capital and we'll see them be as efficient as possible. But we don't expect a repeat in the way we've seen it in some of the prior cycles. And that's based on our early returns and also some of the additional challenges the advanced nodes are pushing even without broad EUV. And once you brought out an EUV you get even more of that. -- Yes, I think the big difference between this node and let's say 20-nanometer even down to 14 16 is we're seeing much broader end market adoption that's driving these design starts through the advanced foundry and the leader there. And so all of that is sort of preventing in a reuse if that capacity is deployed to support all that activity and a high-mix environment puts more pressure on yield and delivering to tight product windows. So it's a good story and we expect this node to have some legs. And certainly, the investment for N5 is starting to pick up and strong expectations for that. -- Very helpful. If I could sneak in a quick second question. You talked about a return to $370 million $375 million opex in March. And I guess curious how should we think about potential synergies related to Orbotech as we move through 2020? -- Yes CJ I outlined it at Investor Day. There's a number of activities that are happening and we'll see those play through as we move through the year. One of the dynamics that I wanted to put a little bit of extra time into in the prepared remarks was some of the investments that we're making to drive longer-term structural cost reduction namely relocating some operations from subscale or higher-cost regions into lower-cost parts of our global footprint. So as you're ramping up one team and ultimately ramp down another team there's some incremental investment but those have returns over time. So as I think about that range I think we're in that range as we move in based on how we're sizing the business right now and thinking about top line we'll be operating in that range as we move through the year with the usual program development expenses that could cause you to move one direction or the other. I would think it would probably be lower end or slightly below the range as we move toward the end of the year. At the beginning of the year, it's probably at the higher end. -- Great. Thank you.Thank you. The next question is from Krish Sankar from Cowen and Co. Your line is open. -- Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. I just had a quick one Rick you kind of spoke about how Gen5 is going to double in 2020. Is that primarily coming from foundry's five nanometer? Or is there a significant chunk coming from DRAM adoption too? -- So Krish that was -- the comments were that we saw a doubling in '19 from '18. And although to Rick's earlier point about Gen5 I mean we're really encouraged by starting to see that deployed into production use cases and away from just defect discovery and R&D applications. So -- and then the print check as that rolls in in terms of how it supports EUV reticle qualification. So we would expect to see further growth as we move into next year in Gen5. But we haven't quantified how much more. I mean we are shipping both generations to support activity both for 7-nanometer and for five but you'll see more adoption of Gen5 in production as N5. -- Yes. And just to add to Bren's point what happened in '19 also was penetration across almost every customer major customer in terms of the early evaluation and use so that sets up the case for the longer run. But that was really a proliferation year for '19 where we got it out and established in all the leading jobs. -- Yes I mean certainly Krish just one other thing as I look at the order profile it would imply we're going to have growth in the number of units as we move into next year. I don't know if it will double but we'll certainly see growth in adoption next year. -- Got it. Thanks Rick. Thank, Bren.Thank you. The next question is from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. Your line is open. -- Good afternoon guys. Great job on the quarterly execution and strong free cash flow. On EUV litho adoption and your mask inspection business from Analyst Day, I think we could gather that your reticle inspection franchise is going to grow pretty strongly this year up about 45%. But if I look at the shipment profile for ASML let's say over the next couple of years it's still a runway for very strong growth around 25% 30% shipping CAGR. With that in mind, how should we think about the trajectory of your mask inspection business looking into next year? -- Yes. I mean I think Harlan you're right. We've had a very good year and a down WFE year in reticle inspection and that's been adoption for the Teron platform both for optical and EUV inspection support. Some of the drivers moving forward is yes the number of scanners but also design starts tends to drive reticle inspection demand. So we would expect to see some incremental demand on the 7-nanometer side as we see incremental capacity there. And then you'll start to see some activity as we move into next year. As we talked about at Analyst Day we do have a new platform that's specific for EUV inspection that we'll start shipping in 2020 also. So you'll see a mix and match. But as we stand today I think given what's out there for 7-nanometer and then for the layers that will be happening in EUV we believe we've got the market pretty well served with the capabilities that we're offering. -- Yes makes a lot of sense. And then on the Specialty Semiconductor segment, you drove pretty good quarterly results despite given the trade headwinds. And so again if I look at the trends heading into next year you've got a big step up in RF content in 5G smartphones in infrastructure you've got more power products in auto and industrial and of course all this advanced packaging and things like system and package. All of this should provide a pretty good backdrop for growth next year but wanted to get your initial views in terms of how you're thinking about 2020 for SPTS? -- Right. Well, obviously we're newer to that business. But as we spend more time with the team and spend more time with customers it does -- it is well positioned to grow. And as you've pointed out we had some headwinds that happened in '19 but still managed to get some traction. '20 looks like a good year for SPTS. And our current modeling of it based on what we see for the as you say for RF supporting 5G it looks like a hopefully a 10% to 20% range of growth for that business as we go into next year. So we feel good about it and we're continuing to learn more about those customers. -- Great. Thank you very much. -- Thank you, Harlan.Thank you. The next question is from Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is open. -- Thanks a lot. Rick, so if I look at your WFE share this year you're going to gain about 50 bps of WFE share but I think a lot of people are looking at foundry capex and they're sort of worried that this is a near-term peak at least here in the back half of the year. And if you look at the capital intensity numbers like we haven't seen these kind of quarterly numbers only really once in the past 20 years from kind of a quarterly capital intensity point of view for nonmemory. So -- also people are looking at TSMC capex and it's kind of $5 billion in Q4 and that's kind of a $20 billion run rate. So how do you respond to concerns that this is sort of a near-term peak in foundry logic shipments? Is that not what you see? Do you see the quarterly shipment rates continuing to grow in foundry/logic next year? -- Sure, Tim. Well, it is true that we had strength as we mentioned and you're half-on-half considerable strength but really not in a lot of customers. There are other customers that will broaden out in next year and so we feel pretty good about how we're positioned. We think that the actual mix between foundry and logic and memory for this year is about equivalent to what we see for next year and that's driving some of the capacity or the intensity that we're seeing. So we feel pretty good about next year. Obviously, we had a good second half to this year. But we're counting on some broadening. And again some of what we're seeing this year is ordering that will actually have deliveries in next year. So we'll see some of the benefit of that revenue next year. Bren do you want to add any color to that? -- No, I think Rick covered it. I mean look if you think most of the investment we've seen this year has been from the leader. And so the broadening out across a pretty diversified end demand environment into next year we feel comfortable given the comments we made in the prepared remarks that we see some sustainability in foundry and logic as we move into 2020. -- Okay. And then I guess I had a question on Orbotech. If you look at systems revenue it was pretty flat. It looked like display was still pretty weak. What's assumed for December brand for Orbotech shipments? And what's the outlook for the flat-panel display and the PCB business? I guess the real question is why is the flat-panel business still interesting to you? Because it seems like it's kind of on its lows and it would be arguably accretive if you sold it because it has much much lower margins. So just -- can you just kind of talk through all that Rick? -- Well, so we didn't guide the individual segments. I mean I will say that looks like we'll have an uptick sequentially in FPD next quarter in terms of overall planning. That does tend to be lumpy but based on the order profile we saw in the June quarter and lead times there that -- those deliveries happen in December. In that business, it's a build-to-order business so usually when we get the orders that the schedules hold pretty well. So I would expect it to uptick. I think as we think about next year I don't think we'll see any real recovery in the flat panel business. And I think that after six years of growth we saw 2020 -- or 2019 was a difficult year. I don't think it's going to grow much in 2020 either.So we're focused on the business. I mean I hear your points and we're -- some of the actions we're taking that I referred to in terms of cost structural cost reduction actions are particular to that business. And so the first thing we're going to do is get that business in a place that we believe is an acceptable level of profitability at these trough levels and position that we can -- as the business recovers that we can scale it and drive operating leverage through that model. But we're taking these actions first. I hear your point and we'll see how it plays out over time. -- Thanks, Bren.Thank you. The next question is from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. -- Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on the strong growth. I had two questions as well. For the first one, I'm curious what is the right way to think about process control and density in EUV versus non-EUV? I imagine EUV was not as big of a factor this year. Do you think it's a bigger factor of you next year? -- Yes. Process control intensity for EUV is higher than it is for non-EUV. In spite of the fact that there are fewer layers. I mean obviously, the value of EUV is a reduction in layers. And so we would see that that has some mitigating effect on the increased intensity around EUV but you really get process control intensity in a couple of ways: one you get it in a mask shop because you have to do more inspection to assure that you have a high-quality mask. And we're still as an industry trying to work out some of the challenges pellicle nonpellicle and getting mask to be good in the lifetime of the mask; the other thing is in print check to verify and validate that Bren mentioned in an earlier question we see that as an opportunity and that's been driving process control intensity around Gen5. So overall it's a plus for some of our businesses it is a minus for some but the net-net of it all is process control intensity ticks up in an EUV world as the industry goes forward. And on balance it's a net positive for KLA. -- And my follow-up how large was domestic China spend for you this year? And just conceptually how are you thinking about it going into next year? -- Yes, it's a good question. Actually, as I said in the remarks I mean at the beginning of the year we thought it'd be down 10% to 15% from a very solid number in '18. And it turned out with some projects that came back into the year one major one, in particular, we're going to end up about flat. And as I look at our preliminary scoping into 2020 and you do have some mix on what kind of projects are going to be invested in but it looks relatively flat to me again. So I don't see it changing much as we move into 2020. So it's in the $650 million range plus or minus in terms of revenue level for the company. And I would expect that to stay relatively consistent based on what I see today for 2020. -- So that is not part of the outperformance assumption for next year? -- No. I think -- look I don't think it's going to fall off. I mean certainly, it improved the performance in -- with a factor in performance improvement in 2019. So as I think about next year, no I don't -- I'm not banking on a lot of extra business in China to deliver the year in terms of how we're planning. I expect a flattish environment in native China. -- Got it. Thank you.Thank you. The next question is from Quinn Bolton from Needham & Company. Your line is open. -- Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to follow up on the question from Vivek about EUV driving higher process intensity. I assume that that's true in the memory side of the business as well. So as we look at EUV insertion in 1Z and then one Alpha processes do you see a meaningfully higher process control intensity in those steps as we see EUV coming into high-volume manufacturing? And then I've got a quick follow-up. -- Yes. I mean it's early for memory. As you know they're still trying to figure out what role EUV will play and how many layers but that is definitely a driver for us in a positive sense again for the same reasons. You have the mask shop and you have on the wafer and you have a reduction in layers counterbalancing it. I don't think it's a huge change in the intensity. It's a nudge up but it's not a big change in the overall intensity maybe on the order of if you're going to be at an average of say 10% process control intensity you might get 0.5 point to one point of increase in terms of overall process control intensity on that. So it depends but it will depend how much it's deployed. And ultimately it will also depend on what the strategy is relative to what people are going to do with pellicles or not do -- have pellicles. It will change a little bit in how it plays out for us. -- Okay great. And then a follow-up question was just it sounds like you're getting a little bit more optimistic in the memory side of the business and that might be somewhat driven by the indigenous Chinese guys. But just wondering if you could comment based on sort of orders for the Surfscan business. Are you seeing -- starting to see better activity in the NAND business? Or is it fairly isolated to certain customers at this point? You wouldn't call it kind of the beginning of a broader-based recovery? -- No, I wouldn't call it that. I mean certainly that business inflected pretty strongly through calendar '18 and so it's been down this year. And I would expect to see a little bit of recovery in the wafer part of that which ultimately supports memory in 2020. But right now I think it's too early to see that impact. So I wouldn't say I see that as a leading indicator of new business. But certainly given the market position of that product and how memory drives wafers if you do see a pickup in memory we will see that business impacted. -- Thank you.Thank you. The next question is from Joe Quatrochi from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. -- Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the results. As it relates to your service business I was wondering if you could give us an update on some of the capacity idling that you've seen particularly around the memory side in your installed base? And maybe how do we think about that relative to your gross margin guide for the December quarter? -- Yes. No, it's a good question. I mean one of the things that we are seeing that drove an uptick in the revenue level for Service quarter-to-quarter was a reduction in idling so more of that capacity being utilized. And so that drove some incremental revenue to the Service line for the semiconductor side of the business. So look you do have a gross margin impact to growth in Service on the overall model which is contemplated in the guidance that we give generally. And the thing to keep in mind is it with our Service business as it grows the profitability stream we believe is an accretive stream to the overall total. So it's not affecting I think quarter-to-quarter it has very little effect on the overall gross margin in terms of the guidance. So it's really -- when I think about guidance quarter-to-quarter it's mostly around some of the product dynamics and how that plays through our model. -- Okay, that's helpful. And then on the specialty semi side now I think you're calling for flat this year. Can you help us understand the -- was there any incremental impact indirectly from Huawei? Or is this more related to weakness that you're seeing in just general demand? -- Yes. It -- I wouldn't say it's the incremental effect that we talked about last quarter. So we continue to see that. And we talked about if I recall $40-ish million impact for the year related to that one in particular. There are broader trade issues. Certainly, there's the issue with Korea and Japan and how that's affecting Korean OSATs. So there are number of trade issues beyond Huawei that's affecting that business. Now in the long run as those customers in that area -- or the end customer the customers' customer starts to redesign around some of these issues it creates opportunities for us. So -- but in this year it's affecting that business. Also automotive has been on the margin a little bit weaker so that's affected that business as well. So it's still showing I think a decent result this year against the backdrop of the WFE environment we're in and would expect to see it recover next year in terms of growth as Rick suggested earlier but it's a business that has a really good market position. I think the long-term drivers around 5G advanced packaging power and so on are good ones. And so we're encouraged by what we see and we like the business model of that business. -- Yes. And more specifically I think on Huawei if you thought about the reactions to the suppliers to Huawei was there was uncertainty when the -- Bren first came in and trying to figure out and I think everybody froze. So the baseball analogy would be there was a rain delay in terms of trying to figure out what the next step was. And now there is more activity going on in the supply chain. So we think that business ultimately comes back but it was impacted probably more and longer in the year because just uncertainty around that. Now I think people are dealing with it and that will actually cause the business to resume its growth. -- Thank you.Thank you. The next question is from Patrick Ho from Stifel. Your line is open. -- Thank you very much. Rick maybe first off in the past you've talked about increasing metrology intensity on the NAND flash side of things particularly as layers increased. As the industry starts shipping to 128 layers do you see any potential new opportunities on the inspection side given the complexity of the layers and the increased number of layers for next-generation devices? -- I think the main opportunity -- it's good question, Patrick. The main opportunity for inspection is really in what's happening on the bare wafer on Surfscan and dealing with the flatness requirements as the wafers get higher both the cleanliness and flatness. So it may be less obvious at first. I mean we've talked in the past about being hopeful about finding defects and deep trenches but it's probably more flatness-driven and desire to have clean wafer. So that's where really been where we see it. Metrology has some opportunities. We talked about at the Analyst Day with the work we have on CD Saks in terms of great opportunity there. But specifically for inspection, it's more about Surfscan. -- Great. As my follow-up question in terms of the domestic China opportunity obviously we're seeing some of these capacity built begin and you're benefiting from new capacity build out. But given some of it is also trailing edge logic-type of capacity builds is this simply because they are new capacity? Or are there opportunities within the I guess the foundry and logic segment of that region that you see new opportunities both for your inspection and metrology products? -- Yes. I think that the -- there are a number of players that are small maybe subscale in terms of what you think of it as the larger. So there's actually some inefficiency in that supply chain if you're starting smaller companies in terms of trying to support for a strategic region -- reason. So that kind of creates additional demand for us and we're benefiting from that. Also, I think that as they're trying to figure out some of these capabilities then there's opportunity for us to help them and that drives both good share but also good intensity. And then lastly I think the move for auto as China is an important auto market there are more Specialty Semiconductors and there's more opportunity for us there as a result. -- Yes. Patrick I mean look I think this year is a heavier memory year in China. Not by much I'd say probably of our mix of semiconductor business it's 55-45 to memory. I look at calendar '20 and it's pretty balanced. So to your point, there's a lot of activity around IoT. Rick talked about automotive. And so the yield earnings challenges in logic are more complicated. The tools that we are shifting are configurable in terms of helping customers meet their requirements also providing some upgrade pass as they start to progress some of their technologies. So -- and they're serving I think real markets ultimately. And so I think that they're designing for specific opportunities which is good just in terms of the long-term trajectory of that investment and their viability. So we feel pretty good about all of it. And I think it's a mix across both segments there. -- Great. Thank you.Thank you. Your final question is from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. -- Hi, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question and congrats on the very strong results. I just wanted to go back to the half-over-half kind of cadence for your business going into next year. You guys accurately called your core process control business being up I guess every quarter on a sequential basis this year a couple of quarters ago. So I guess the question is based on customer projects based on customer conversations what are your thoughts into the first half of 2020 relative to the second half of '19? Do you think you can grow your business? Or should we be expecting more of a flattish outlook on a half-over-half basis? -- Well like I said I think we're little early to guide second half -- or half-to-half trajectory then obviously I think a part of how we do in the fourth quarter will impact how the March quarter lines up. I mean across the segments again as we said earlier we feel that there's broadening and sustainability investment in logic and foundry. I mean if you just take a step back and look at the second half up 20-ish percent over the first half it does obviously imply that WFE is higher in the first half -- or the second half versus the first half so the run rate of this WFE is probably 10% to 15% kind of growth into next year at these levels. So it does imply that you've got a second half. You have to have that kind of growth to sort of sustain at this level of business. But I think that's probably as far as I can go at this point. -- Yes. I guess what I would add to that is we feel pretty good about understanding our position relative to WFE. We're not in a great position to predict WFE. Does that sound good? -- Yes, it does. As a quick follow-up. On China -- on Native China WFE, I think Bren you talked about 2020 at least at this point kind of looking kind of flattish relative to 2019. When you think about the mix of spend on process control could that move higher? Or what are your preliminary thoughts on that? -- Yes -- no as I said earlier I think it's balanced across the business that we expect and we expect a flattish level of business in 2020. So I'm not expecting -- at least for our business not expecting growth but not expecting decline in 2020 at this point. We'll see how it plays out. But that's the least where we stand today. -- Thanks so much.Thank you. And that concludes the Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call over back to Mr. Kessel for closing remarks. -- Yes. Thank you, Christian. And thank you, everyone, for your time today and interest in KLA. Christian, please conclude the call.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- \n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Semiconductors play an increasingly important role in the world, as new technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, the , self-driving vehicles, and especially  take hold in the market. Yet at the same time, the ongoing U.S.-China trade war has sapped business confidence, leading to extreme caution on the part of chip buyers worldwide. A downturn in demand can wreak havoc on semiconductor stocks, which have oversupplied the market over the past year, leading to many negative-earnings surprises.This has set up an interesting dynamic where big secular trends are running headlong into a cyclical downturn. Yet starting in the second half of 2019, it appears that one secular trend -- the buildout of 5G networks -- is beginning to overwhelm these macroeconomic fears, sending certain semiconductor-related stocks soaring.5G is benefiting semi-cap equipment stocks, despite the trade war. Image source: Getty Images.One would think the global slowdown would absolutely kill the stocks of semiconductor equipment manufacturers, who make the machines needed to produce leading-edge chips. However, the opposite has been true, with many such stocks hitting 52-week and/or all-time highs in recent weeks.These include  , , , and . In addition,  , the world's largest foundry and buyer of this equipment, is also up nicely. As you can see, all of these stocks are crushing the market over the past year -- and that's in spite of the sharp December sell-off and ongoing trade war. data by .Interestingly, as U.S. and China relations continue to get more acrimonious, it seems both countries are stepping on the gas to become the leader in 5G technology. In particular, Taiwan Semi's management, which just had its third-quarter earnings release and conference call, gave some amazing numbers regarding the 5G buildout.In its earnings release, Taiwan Semiconductor revealed that it would again be boosting its capital expenditures for the year by a whopping 40%. Remember, the company is the world's largest outsourced semiconductor foundry and makes chips for most of the leading fabless semiconductor designers. Though Taiwan Semi had initially anticipated spending $10 billion to $11 billion on capex this year, management is now boosting that figure to $14 billion to $15 billion, with a similar forecast for 2020.Why such an increase? Taiwan Semi is seeing huge demand for leading-edge chips, which are the high-performance chips that will go into 5G handsets and base stations, well beyond what it had initially anticipated. According to management, about $1.5 billion of the capex increase is for the company's 7-nanometer chips that are just hitting the market, and the other $2.5 billion is to get an early jump on 5-nanometer chips for next year. In semiconductors, the nanometer distance signifies the distance between transistors; the smaller the space, the more transistors can be packed into a chip, making the chip more powerful. Management said, \"Since the middle of this year, we've been seeing an acceleration in the worldwide 5G development. This will speed up the introduction and deployment of 5G network in smartphone in several major markets around the world.\"The company now expects 5G penetration to ramp even faster than 4G, with 5G phones reaching a mid-teens smartphone market share next year, up from Taiwan Semi's previous expectations of just mid-single-digit penetration in 2020. Increased 5G demand is thus causing increased demand for smaller chips, yet smaller chips are becoming harder to produce. The smaller the chip, the more manufacturing process steps it must go through, which is why all of these semi-cap equipment makers are seeing such strong demand. In particular, ASML Holding's EUV technology is crucial for the ability to produce 7-nanometer and lower chips. That's why ASML's stock has gone up so much in the past year, and why it trades at a higher multiple than its peers. data by .Another favorite is KLA-Tencor, which has a competitive advantage in , which tests wafers and masks for imperfections. This diagnostic tool becomes increasingly important as die sizes shrink, because of the exactness required to produce high-density chips at scale.Though semi-cap equipment stocks have all had good runs over the past year, these big technological trends don't appear to be slowing down anytime soon. While a global recession may delay the growth of these companies, macroeconomic conditions probably won't hold them back forever. Therefore, investors should look to snap up these winning tech leaders on any big pullbacks. And if trade tensions ever ease up, so much the better.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.\n\n\n \nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["\nThe Board of Directors of Illinois Tool Works authorized a seven percent increase in the dividend payout to shareholders, representing a quarterly increase of $0.07 per share \u2014 or $0.28 per share annually \u2014 versus the current dividend rate.

Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Jerome and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation Second Quarter 2019 [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Now it's my pleasure to hand the call over to your host, Mr. Ed Lockwood with KLA Corporation, Investor Relations. The floor is yours. -- Thank you, Jerome. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer.We're here today to discuss quarterly results for the period ended June 30th, 2019. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website.Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release and in the investor presentation posted on the KLA Investor Relations website.There you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations, and conferences, as well as links to KLA's SEC filings, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2018. In those filing you'll also find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results.As you know our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick. -- Thank you, Ed. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call. Q2 was another solid quarter for KLA with results finishing above the midpoint of guidance demonstrated in the Company is benefiting from our strategies for growth and market leadership while delivering strong relative performance in a challenging year for the industry.I'd like to provide some insights into today's equipment demand environment. Even with the signs of stabilization in NAND pricing, DRAM continues to be weak and the business environment in memory is soft. This has resulted in broad-based low levels of investment as customers have idled existing capacity and delayed new capacity plans as they focus on rebalancing supply and demand.The weakness in memory is being offset by rising demand from foundry and logic, which are traditionally strong markets for KLA. The business environment in foundry and logic is expected to continue to be strong through the second half of 2019 and into 2020 driven by next-generation technology development, capacity additions at the leading edge, increasing competitive dynamics, and investment in EUV infrastructure. Altogether, our outlook for WFE investment in 2019 remains consistent with the initial view we held in January, with demand expected to decline by approximately 20% in the year and with a significant shift in product mix to foundry and logic.Now I'd like to update you on some recent product highlights from our semiconductor process control business. KLA's market leadership is enabled by successful execution of a portfolio strategy focused on differentiation to address our customers' most critical challenges. We're very pleased with our product positioning and the strong customer acceptance we are experiencing across our portfolio.For example, we are currently seeing accelerated adoption of our flagship Gen 5 optical inspection platform, which is now in its second iteration since first being introduced in 2016. We expect Gen 5 shipments to double in 2019 compared to the previous year. Customers are leveraging the combination of sensitivity and throughput in this platform to enable unique detection of yield-limiting defects at significantly lower cost of ownership compared to the alternatives.The strong customer adoption of Gen 5 and the continued success of the Gen 4 platform, now in its fifth iteration, are further confirmation of the success of our multi-generation platform strategy for innovation and market leadership in optical inspection. Further, the latest generation of our laser scattering optical inspection platform, known as Voyager, is also enjoying strong adoption in the marketplace. Leading memory and foundry customers are deploying Voyager for in-line monitoring application in high-volume manufacturing.In mask inspection, the strong momentum which we have experienced over the past several quarters continues and is positioned to extend through 2020. We are seeing upside from leading foundries for our latest generation mask inspection platform and expect demand to broaden as customers move ahead with their EUV deployment strategies.In metrology, as WFE is transitioning more toward logic and foundry, we're seeing strong adoption of the new film and CD platforms released last year as our customers ramped complex technology architectures like finFET, new materials, and new metal interconnects. And with the recent acquisition of Orbotech, we are further diversifying our business, broadening our product portfolio and growth opportunities and serving a larger market. Integration and synergy activities are now well under way, and we're very excited about the growth opportunities in combination with Orbotech. We look forward to further discussions of this in our upcoming Investor Day in September.In summary, despite uncertainty in the current industry demand environment, momentum is building for KLA, driven by strength in our semiconductor process control business and contributions from the recent acquisition of Orbotech. As a result, we are on a path for strong relative performance in 2019 while we continue to drive innovation and introduce differentiated products and solutions to serve the market when growth reaccelerates.With that, I'll turn the call over to Bren for his commentary on the Q2 financial results. Bren? -- Thanks, Rick, and good afternoon, everyone. Total revenue in Q2 was $1.258 billion and above the midpoint of the range of guidance. GAAP earnings per share was $1.35 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.78, each finishing at the upper end of the range of guidance. Total shipments were $1.354 billion, approximately $79 million over the midpoint and exceeding the high-end of the range of guidance for the quarter.Semiconductor process control shipments were approximately $1.080 billion. We're pleased with the results we've achieved in the June quarter despite significant noise and uncertainty in the global electronics market, as we continue to focus on executing our business across all markets and move forward with our integration and synergy plans from the Orbotech acquisition.Beginning this quarter, we will report our results under the new segment reporting structure that we adopted subsequent to the completion of the Orbotech acquisition and you will see this reflected in our Form 10-K when it is filed. Under this new structure, we will report the KLA process control business in the Semiconductor Process Control segment and we'll separate the former Orbotech businesses into two segments, Specialty Semiconductor Process and PCB, Display and Component Inspection. The latter segment now includes the former ICOS component inspection business of KLA. We believe this new segment reporting structure best reflects how our business is organized and the unique characteristics of each segment in terms of channel, markets, and technology. Results from the applicable services components will also be included within each segment.In addition, the June quarter will be the last quarter we report shipments in our , and we will no longer provide shipment guidance going forward. As explained in detail in the  last May, under ASC 606 for revenue recognition, the overall timing of revenue shifts forward, and as a result, the difference between shipments and revenue is immaterial and doesn't warrant the resource commitment to maintain dual reporting. Subsequently, investors can assume a close approximation of shipments to reported revenue in any given quarter.Now for the June quarter results. As I mentioned, total revenue in the second quarter were $1.258 billion. We expect total revenue to grow about 7% at the midpoint and be in a range of $1.31 billion to $1.39 billion in the September quarter, and for the second half revenue levels to be higher than the first half with continued sequential growth expected in the December quarter across all our business segments.I'll now turn to some detail and commentary regarding segment revenue trends in the June quarter. For the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment, which Ed stated represent all legacy KLA, except our component inspection business, revenue was $1.003 billion in the quarter. Component inspection revenue was just over $728 million. As Rick discussed in his opening remarks, our view of the WFE demand environment for 2019 remains mostly consistent with our original view from January, with KLA benefiting from stronger foundry and logic demand.I would note that on the margin over the past six months, although review of the overall demand environment in 2019 is unchanged, the near-term outlook for foundry and logic investment has improved, offset by declines in memory. In fact, over the course of the June quarter, we've seen our overall second half expectations improve modestly. Our current view for the Semiconductor Process Control business is for the second half revenue to be up in the low-double digits versus first half of the calendar year, as we now expect revenue from foundry and logic customers to be up over 35% versus the first half. Memory investment remains weak and directed toward technology migration mostly only.Memory was approximately 51% of Specialty Semiconductor Process system shipments in June, and we expect memory to be approximately 42% of system revenue in the September quarter. Foundry was 35% of shipments and is forecasted to be about 44% of system revenue in Q3. Shipments from logic customers were 14% and the current outlook is for logic revenue to be approximately flat in September.Turning now to the Specialty Semiconductor Process segment, the former SPTS division of Orbotech. SPTS is a leader in PVD and etch solutions in fast-growing specialty semiconductor applications like MEMS, sensors, power and RF devices, as well as in advanced packaging markets. Revenue for SPTS was $67 million. June quarter results for this business were impacted meaningfully by the US Department of Commerce ban on shipments of RF and MEMS semiconductors to Huawei as customers with Huawei market share delayed planned capacity investments. As a leader in etch and deposition tools for these markets, SPTS saw delay in a portion of its expected business due to this ban. Though the longer-term implications of this action are not clear, notwithstanding this issue, SPTS is still expected to deliver year-over-year pro forma revenue growth in calendar year '19.Revenue for the PCB, Display and Component Inspection segment was $185 million. This segment includes the former PCB and display businesses of Orbotech and KLA's ICOS component inspection business. Results for this segment were in line with our expectations for the quarter and are on track with our plans for this year.Now I'll discuss the distribution of revenue by major product category in Q2. Wafer inspection was 32%, patterning which includes reticle inspection was 23%, wafer inspection and patterning or part of the Semiconductor Process Control segment. PCB, Display and Component Inspection revenue was 10%, and Specialty Semiconductor Process was 4%. Other, which includes solar, instruments, and the KLA Pro, mature products enhancements business, was 4%. Service was 27% of revenue in the June quarter. In terms of the regional split of revenue. China was 32%, Taiwan was 25%, the US was 15%, Japan was 10%, Korea was 8%, Europe was 6%, and the rest of Asia was 4%.Now for more detail on the results in the P&L. Gross margin was 58.9% in June, at the top end of the guided range for the quarter of 58% to 59% as a higher level of Semi Process Control revenue offset the Huawei effect on our Specialty Semiconductor business. We expect gross margin in the September quarter to be in a range of 60% to 61% as a more favorable product mix in our Semi Process Control business and higher expected service margins drive gross margin improvement in the quarter. Looking ahead, we believe there are many opportunities for us to improve the Orbotech gross margin profile across the businesses by leveraging our global supply chain, service infrastructure, and global footprint. We will discuss these initiatives in more detail over the coming quarters as we get a firm picture on the timing and financial impact of these actions.Total operating expenses were $370 million in June, below the guided $375 million target, due to lower-than-expected expenses across the business and some synergy benefit from Orbotech. Operating margin was 29.5%. We expect quarterly operating expenses to be in a range of $370 million to $375 million for the remainder of calendar '19 consistent with the timing of our planned product development investments and the realization of initial synergy activities.Other income and expense in the June quarter was $38 million, and we expect OIE to be approximately $36 million this quarter. The effective tax rate was 13.7% and going forward investors should continue to model our tax planning rate at the 14% level given the new corporate tax structure in the US and our expectations for the geographic distribution of profit. Net income was $289 million, and we had $162 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding.Now for some highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and investments were $1.7 billion and total debt was $3.4 billion. Cash from operations was $325 million and free cash flow was $270 million. We are making the infrastructure investments to support our future growth, including the construction of a new building at our Milpitas headquarter site and a new facility in Ann Arbor, Michigan. We expect annual capital expenditures to exceed for the next few years due to these projects and other infrastructure investments necessary to sustain our future growth expectations.In the June quarter we paid an aggregate of $121 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents upon the vesting of restricted stock units and repurchased $345 million of common stock at an average share price of just below $112 per share, pursuant to our share repurchase program. We have approximately $900 million available under our current share repurchase authorization. For September, we expect a fully diluted share count of between 159 million and 160 million shares.In conclusion, the June quarter results demonstrated strong operating performance. With our diversified end markets, continued technology leadership across a broad product portfolio, and operational discipline, KLA is positioned for strong relative performance in 2019, and we are encouraged by the momentum we are seeing in our business.With that, to summarize, guidance for the third quarter is: revenue between $1.31 billion and $1.39 billion, GAAP diluted EPS of $1.75 to $2.05 per share, and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.04 a share to $2.34 per share. Before turning the call over for your questions, I'd like to remind investors that we have scheduled our 2019 Investor Day for Tuesday, September 17th in Midtown, New York. We look forward to seeing you there.I'll now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A. -- Thank you, Bren. As we begin the Q&A, we request you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please feel free to requeue if you have any additional questions, which we will accommodate as time permits. Jerome, we're ready for the first question.[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. You're now live. -- Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Appreciate letting me ask questions. Congratulations on the solid results. Rick, it's good to see foundry, logic performing strongly in the calendar second half with expectation that that continues into 2020. I'd be kind of curious as you look at the memory market and differentiate between NAND, DRAM, and maybe process control and bare wafer, how do you think that market plays out in the back half of the year. Which quarter do you think it bottoms in and how do you think about the recovery potential in 2020? -- I'll give some thoughts and then let Bren weigh in. Right now we don't see -- as we said, we don't see a lot of momentum in DRAM. I think what we've got now is some strengthening I think -- we think in the foundry and logic as we said, but not a lot other than technology migration and not a lot of capacity. So if you think about when the recovery might come for NAND, probably first half of 2020 and DRAM what our customers are saying now is more mid-2020 timeframe before we'd see any meaningful change. -- Yeah, John. I would say that -- I'd characterize the market as what we're mostly seeing is technology migration investment only. And one thing about KLA is since we do help our customers navigate their roadmap transitions, we are seeing some level of business from some of these customers. There is also some activity in China. We saw some last quarter influenced our shipments, and we expect to see some more in the second half of the year. But to Rick's point, I think as we look at the overall market, I wouldn't expect to see any meaningful capacity adds until we get into 2020. And given the customers have been disciplined in pushing out capacity, they've been idling capacity, how quickly that comes back it's a little early to tell from this point.You mentioned bare wafer. On the bare wafer side, we see our business bare wafer being roughly flat into the second half of '19. Now '19 overall for that business is lower than it was in '18. We had a huge inflection in '18. We've seen it come off a bit in '19, probably comes off a little bit in '20. I think we're operating at a more sustainable or a higher level for that business moving forward given the dynamics around memory, around specifications, both for inspection but also for metrology.So in the numbers that we've provided in the commentary, I think that's been part of our view in terms of expectations moving forward. So I wouldn't say that much has changed there and that's something certainly we've been -- we've been pretty open about. -- That's helpful, guys. Then maybe as my follow-up. Rick, I'd love to get your comments on just inspection and process control intensity in foundry, logic as you move to 5-nanometer and then to 5-nanometer. And I guess, it's kind of a complex equation. How does EUV benefit you guys in the business going forward? -- Sure, John. I think there are couple things: one, we mentioned the strength in Gen 5 and a lot of that is driven -- of course, logic is going to drive that harder, and we're seeing that transition from Gen4 to Gen5 in terms of the bulk of our system. So the design will shrink, are going to drive smaller defectivity requirements driving us toward the Gen5.The other thing that's happening is overlay is a big driver for us in terms of the additional pressure put on our customers as they drive advanced design rules. Eventually we're seeing that in a couple ways. One, we're seeing it in the mask shop with a number of starts pre-EUV but also the anticipated large number of EUV but also the printdown checks, because I think what's really going to happen for a while, as people are going to want to verify the designs, it's another use for Gen 5.So overall, we think there's going to be an increase in process control intensity. As we introduce EUV, I think that that's more in the development phase. Longer term I think it levels out a bit as we get into high-volume production later. But right now definitely the mix is favorable to us in terms of what we're seeing. We also mentioned, increased competition in foundry and that's also been a driver I think to the mix shift overall. -- Thanks, guys. Congratulations. -- Thank you. -- Thanks, John.Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. You're now live. -- Good afternoon, guys. Nice job on the quarterly execution and strong outlook. In terms of the strong results and outlook specifically within your mask or reticle inspection business, EUV system shipments looks like they're going to grow about 70% this year. If I look into next year at the installed EUV base, it's still growing about 50% to 60%. So given your guys' very high market share at the mask shops, how do you see your mask shop inspection business directionally this year? And do you guys already have visibility into the directionality of this segment next year just given the long lead times and continued growth of the installed base? -- Yeah, Harlan. It's Bren and I'll go first here, but if you look at the reticle inspection business, couple things are driving it. First, significant tapeouts in the foundry at 7-nanometer, and so that's driving significant purchasing of the product. You have to remember that reticle inspection in a mask shop behaves similar to process where you're inspecting ever reticle before you ship it to the fab. So it has some unique dynamics in terms of how customers buy relative to the design starts and they move together. That's one dynamic and that's driving the business.The other obviously is the EUV development activity that's also driving the Teron system. So you have both effects. Frankly, the biggest driver today is more around the design starts at 7-nanometer, and it's driving that business to have nice solid growth in a year obviously where WFE is down. So we're seeing growth in that, and as Rick said in his prepared remarks, we would expect that to continue into 2020.Timing of EUV deployment, how we see that plays out next year. Well, it'll potentially influence some of the upgrades to the existing installed base out there, but there is some sustainability in the business, and we're seeing a nice recovery in it, and then we'll see about next-generation products as they come out as we move into the second half of next year to support EUV directly.So there's a lot of exciting things happening in that space, and we're seeing the numbers flow through in terms of P&L impact. -- I think just to build on one aspect of it. I think the fact that we have extended the Teron platform to be able to handle these EUV layers, we benefit whether or not depending on the number of EUV layers, we still benefit because we've got an optical platform that can handle either the mask for EUV or for traditional lithography.So I think that's part of why we're benefiting more depending on the starts and just the intensity of the advanced nodes than necessarily just on the EUV because it's still not clear how many layers and at what nodes they're going to be adopted, but we're seeing strength in reticle regardless of which way that goes. -- Great. Thanks for the -- thanks for the insights there. And then you guys were thinking 90 days ago that there was an upward bias for the Orbotech business moving into the second half of the year, but just given all of the China trade overhang, given that Orbotech has a number of large China [Phonetic] customers, do you guys still see the second half of this year will be better for the Orbotech team? And if so, maybe a bit of color on what segments are improving in the second half? I would assume that Specialty Semi is doing well just given the strong focus on RF and power, but what about FPD and PCB? -- Yes. Our growth expectations for Specialty Semi have come down a bit for this year, directly related to the Huawei affect. It's an indirect effect, but you do have customers in the RF space that have market share with Huawei phones. And so they've gotten more cautious in some of their plans for capacity, and that's impacted that business.So that business is still going to grow year over year, but probably not to the degree that we expected 90 days ago before the ban came out. I would say PCB and flat panel are in line with our expectations. PCB flattish, flat panels down this year, but most of the growth for the business was going to come from Specialty Semi. So there's still some growth there year to year, but a little bit less given the Huawei effect. -- Yeah, but just to put it into perspective, Harlan. We're still within a few percentage of what we had originally modeled in terms of profitability and contribution [Indecipherable] life of the business. So it still looks good. As Bren said, some kind of shifting dynamics. So not really that different from what we thought earlier in the year. -- Yeah. Great job on the execution. Thank you. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. You are now live. -- Thanks a lot. I guess the first question, Rick, is that there have been some other companies in your broader sector that the past couple weeks have talked about some pull-ins from China that are sort of helping the back half of the year. And I know you talked last quarter about a big project that was out of the second half and now sort of back in the second half. But what are you seeing generally in China? I guess, is it your view that the trade stuff only increases the pace of these projects as you kind of look into the back half of the year and into next year? -- We have definitely seen some puts and takes in China, Tim, to the point, but we're seeing what others are seeing where -- some maybe increased urgency in terms of the second half to get those projects fully up. And as you know, there's just a lot of noise in the system in terms of what effects might come in. The only substantial thing we've seen is a very small part of our business, as Bren mentioned. But overall, pretty much where we thought in terms of the second half having some strength in it. -- Yeah. I think the DRAM project that pulled in, it's interesting it started beginning of the year. We thought it was completely out. Now it looks like we'll see it ship in the second half of the year. We're seeing, to Rick's point, some puts and takes related to some of the wafer plants in China. So overall, I would say, our expectations for China business this year versus where we thought are probably on the margin slightly higher than where we were before but not a lot of change there, overall -- Okay, Bren. Thanks. And then I guess as a second question, I'm wondering if you can quantify in the Spec Semi's segment how much the sort of indirect Huawei ban is. Is it something like $10 million to $20 million a quarter? Is that what it's costing you sort of into the back-half of the year? I'm just sort of trying to baseline what the business would look like if this ban had not -- or is not in effect. -- Yeah. So, Tim, I think in the immediate quarter you'll see some adjustments to plan. [Indecipherable] quarter the impact was between $20 million and $25 million, and certainly some of the strength in other parts of our business helped us achieve our results for the quarter.That number probably goes up to the $35 million-ish, plus or minus, as we move into the second half of the year in terms of our expectations. So probably -- in total, so probably somewhere around $35 million, $40 million impact on calendar '19.In the long run, it's interesting, as those -- as other providers that are non-US providers start to ramp their capacity that creates an opportunity for the Specialty Semiconductor business there. So in the long run -- and they're in a inferior position. So in the long run there potentially is a big opportunity out there in terms of how the designing around the supply chain works. But in terms of the current year the impact is probably somewhere between $35 million and $40 million in total. -- Okay, guys. Awesome. Thank you so much -- Jerome, next question.Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen. You're now live. -- Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. First one for Rick or Bren. I know you guys have not given out your guidance, but if I look at some of the commentary you made in terms of strength of foundry lasting into first half of '20 and NAND in first half, and maybe DRAM in the second half of '20 recovering, is it fair to assume that your legacy KLA, the business is going to be up in calendar '20 versus calendar '19? And if so, what is the risk to that estimate? And then I had a follow-up. -- Yeah. So let me take the first part and then give it to Bren. So we're not going to call it legacy. It's a process control business, now that we have other businesses. And the trajectory is good. We're going to get into more discussion of the outlook at our Analyst Day next month, but definitely, we feel like things are coming our way in terms of the right kind of market momentum, the advanced design rule work that's going on, in addition to some of the competitive dynamics. We talked about Gen 5 strengthening and some new projects -- new products hitting the market. So we feel very good about overall position. And Bren can talk in broader terms. -- Yeah. I think we feel pretty good about logic, foundry and sustainability of spend levels into 2020. So I think if you look across those end markets and you look at the activity there, we would expect to see continued investment. We talked about competitive dynamics. The strength of the 7-nanometer node out there is also limiting how much reuse customers can do. And so that's certainly having an effect as well. You'll see automotive and industrial hopefully start to come back next year. And so as you think about the broader demand across all of logic, foundry I think there are a number of drivers that give us some confidence moving into next year about those segments. -- Got it, OK. And then for follow-up, you guys introduced a new e-beam wafer defect review product recently, and I'm kind of curious, how do we think about the coexistence of Gen 5 and e-beam down the road for your product portfolio and is this e-beam kind of just targeted toward specialized applications. So just kind of curious on how to think about the lay of the land for your products? Thank you. -- Well, I think what we said all along is we think there is a complementary role for optical and e-beam, and this continues that. I think that what we have in our latest technology is a very capable e-beam tool that when our customers utilize with our advanced optical, they really get the best of both in terms of capabilities for the market. But I don't think they'll ever be a day where there is not a complementary e-beam solution with optical. Optical keeps getting better, e-beam has to get better, too, but I think the general mix between e-beam and optical will remain about the same in terms of the way customers spend their dollars. But we're very excited about what we've seen in the market, and we think the synergy of having our optical tool, coupled with our e-beam, is really great for our customers trying to solve some of their very challenging problems. -- Thanks, Rick.Your next question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Evercore ISI. You are now live. -- Great, thank you. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to follow up on that last question regarding your expectations for the sustainability of foundry strength to continue through 2020. I guess within that, could you speak to I guess both your positioning within Gen 5 EUV, e-beam, perhaps new products that you haven't announced yet, but you just highlighted. And then also from an end market perspective, in terms of rising competition as you look at Samsung coming in, would love to hear I guess in more detail your thoughts on that front? -- Yeah. So -- this is Rick. I'll talk more sentiment than actual numbers in terms of 2020 because we really don't know. But you can always tell how your customer is behaving, what the mood is in the market. And right now we're actually in a situation where we see a lot of energy around our customers pushing for new capability, pushing for getting their advanced designs out, you see a lot of tape-outs, the mask business has been good. So definitely feel strong.The other thing not to be missed what Bren mentioned is we don't see a lot of reuse is happening because of some of the challenges of the new technologies. So that was something that we were trying to really map out to see what it was going to look like. And the combination of new capability on our side, new challenges on our customer side make us feel like it looks very strong in terms of the momentum. How long into '20, we don't really have great visibility into that. It's just now we have a case where you've got multiple players really concerned about bringing out new technology and ramping new devices. And at the same time we're hitting with some products that are new to the market and very exciting for us. -- Very helpful. Thank you. As my follow-up, could you I guess speak a little bit to your expectations for growth in the service bucket, both for process control as well as for overall Orbotech? -- Yeah, CJ. So in process control, for those process control customers, we believe we have a long-term trajectory somewhere in that 9% to 10% CAGR opportunity over time. We're adding tools to the installed base at a much faster rate than they're coming off. So that creates opportunities for us.75% of that revenue stream is contract based because of customers' desire to keep those tools up and how they buy process control, also just the general complexity of what we sell. So that's good for that business. We've seen it slow a little bit in the near term related to just some of the idling of capacity that's well understood in the market. But over the long run, we've seen it grow at that rate, and we expect it to continue to grow at that rate over time.The PCB business for Orbotech has a strong service profile. Say, 95% of the tools are under contract. So of the PCB revenue, we report about 40% of it is service stream. So because of the imaging technology and the need for that tool as enabling for circuit boards, that's a positive trend for that business.I think on the flat panel side, there is very little service activity, in terms of some consumable parts that are attractive, but there is -- there is some opportunity there for us certainly. And on Specialty Semiconductors, as we think about how we try to leverage our position in working with customers to offer better solutions over time, there might be an opportunity for us to help customers that way on the specialty side.Smaller companies always have a harder time with service just the broader footprint. So maybe what we end up doing is enabling a better cost position for both flat panel and for Specialty Semi, but a lot of opportunity for us moving forward I think in terms of driving that string for the Company. -- Thanks, Bren.Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You are now live. -- Thanks for taking my questions. I had two as well. First on gross margin. So you're guiding gross margins up 160 basis points or so, 60%, 61%. What's driving that? And should we expect margins to continue to expand as your sales potentially grow again in December? -- Well, as I said last quarter, I thought there were some unique effects affecting the June quarter from an overall mix perspective in our Semi Process Control business. Not all our products carry the same margin. And under 606, it's whatever you ship is ultimately what you revenue. So some of that was a bit dilutive to our margins, drove the margins down to the almost just sort of 50%.Moving forward, obviously, we have some growth in revenue, and that's helpful. We're seeing a reversion, sort of, back to a normalized mix on the Process Control side, and I'm expecting to see stronger and higher utilization rates out of the service business in some higher margins in the service overall.So all those are driving us into the 60% to 61% range, and I would expect to see that as we move into next quarter as well. So a normalizing effect that I telegraphed last quarter off of the June number, and seems like that's where we expect to see the overall as we move into the next six months or so. -- Got it. And for my follow-up, Rick, I'm curious, how resilient has your core Process Control Services business been in this cyclical downturn versus what you assume, what went well, what did not go as well. Every time we get into a downturn, we always hope for the resilience of that business, but I'm just curious as you look back, how resilient it actually was over the last several quarters? -- Yeah, sure. It was pretty resilient. I think that, as Bren mentioned, there was a little bit of softening we saw, but overall, we still see healthy growth rate. It was a little bit under what's been modeled for the long term, but we actually think we'll catch back up with that long-term modeling for a lot of reasons.I think that the utilization on some of the fabs has obviously been decreased, but the service base is so large now and there's a lot of value in keeping those tools up and running. So we feel pretty good about it still, and I think the slowest quarter was still in low -- upper-single digit, so pretty good about 8%. Bren? -- Yeah. Back in the worst downturn we've ever had, it's always held up pretty well, right. And I think the other thing about that business was that it's bigger now, right, because it's growing faster than the systems business.So bigger as a percent of the total, so a solid anchor with we believe an earnings stream that's accretive to the overall. So I think the dynamics are intact. It goes to points earlier about how customers buy service that they need the tools up, they need matching performance, there's general complexity that's hard to deal with, and for all those reasons, they tend to rely on us and want a contract stream to ensure the uptime of those products. And even in difficult environments, they still tend to run the tools and there is a certain amount of businesses that's there for us. -- Okay. Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. You are now live. -- Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could talk about some of the gross margin puts and takes for some of the new products that you launched last month. Can you just help us remind us how we should think about these gross margins ramping over time? -- Yeah. Joe, it's something I've been talking about. Anytime -- and it really goes back to how we introduce products at KLA. Typically, when we're bringing products out into the market, our focus is on use case validation and driving applications and adoption. And so we usually come out with a product, we're trying to prove it out, and the margins typically are a little bit lower than what I'd say the mature iteration of the previous platform.Then the engineering team starts to design for cost. We start to look at ways to second source. And as we introduce new subsequent iterations to the product, the margin profile improves. So anytime we have a new one come out, it's a little bit lower and then over time it catches back up.So it did have an effect on the margin profile, as I mentioned in the prior quarters, and I think we'll see that play out as we move over the rest of this year and into next year. And with a big portfolio like we have, we tend to see some products where there are different stages of that maturity cycle, so they tend to offset each other.But, generally part of what we do at KLA is ensure the value of what we deliver to customers in terms of how we price and discipline around that. So we ensure that what we're able to deliver product-by-product is pretty consistent, and usually over time, we're able to drive more and more value out of it. And I would say that we're not any different today with the latest round of products. -- Okay, that's helpful. And then on the e-beam side, I was just curious if you could share any kind of early customer feedback that you've gotten so far. Maybe how should we think about the initial ramp for adoption of that solution? -- The initial feedback, and we're still -- we're out in a number of sites and we're getting feedback and we're doing demos. Feedback is good. We're not ready to start modeling it into the numbers yet, because it does take a while to get the adoption of these platforms going, but we feel pretty good about the technical capability and the production worthiness. It does, as I say, take a little while for customers to adopt enough to contribute meaningfully when we're at a $5 billion run rate. -- Yeah. I would say the portfolio approach that we have, these products fit with the portfolio. You've got common capabilities across the tools, common algorithms, common other options that help drive how incremental performance out of the inspectors. So with the review or even baseline ground truth reference tools, it helps sort of enable the broader franchise.So that's the approach we've taken at KLA. It matters more than ever today with the challenges in the production process, the size of the defects, the noise that happens on the wafer, so across all of that having those capabilities that independently are tough to sometime -- markets aren't always all that big, but collectively across the portfolio, create a lot of value for our customers.Your next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham. You're now live. -- Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the nice results and outlook. I'm just wondering, you mentioned the strength on the Gen 5 tool, you guys introduced the fifth iteration of Gen 4 last month. Just wondering what demand you're seeing for the older Gen 4 systems as Gen 5 ramps. -- Well it's -- think of it like a lithography mix and match. So what you get is, you end up with customers deploying the most cost-effective solution they can that has the capability that they need, and that really cascades, starting with e-beam, then getting to 39xx, then 29xx, and then the new Voyager platform.So it's really the easier layers are harder than they used to be on the advanced nodes. So customers will deploy where they can the Gen 4 and then they'll put Gen 5 up against the problems when that's the only way to really solve them. Does that answer your question? -- That's helpful. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on the China question. You referenced some puts and takes, but generally perhaps a strengthening in that market versus 90 days ago. Do you have any sense if the demand strengthening you're seeing more of a timing shift where projects are getting pulled in or do you think that this is just an acceleration in the roadmap for some of those indigenous Chinese fabs? Thanks. -- I don't think it's as much about -- I think what happens is there is uncertainty maybe about their own plans and their ability to procure tools. So that may be pushed it out. And then when they realize they could do it, pulled it back in. I don't want to speak for them. But I think it's more that the project's getting solidified, and I think 90 days ago maybe that was more on pause to see if they could even get the toolsets. So that's kind of where we are.It's not so much about end demand, I don't think, as them staying on some of their plans. And by the way, there are a lot more programs there that we already derated if you go back a couple years ago and had listened to what customers had said, we're getting closer and closer to what we anticipated for 2019 and a going run rate for 2020. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. You're now live. -- Great. Thank you. If you look at the capacity build for the upcoming 5-nanometers, how do you think the rate at which the capacity is being built as compared to previous nodes, say, the 7-nanometers or 10-nanometers. We've heard that the pilot line for 5-nanometers could be little bit bigger than in the past, but just want to hear from your perspective what is driving that kind of changes. -- Yeah, I think that -- I'll go first here. We are seeing a little bit stronger adoption level and to the point earlier, you're seeing less migration of other tools from previous nodes, and so that's driving a certain amount of activity. I would expect we'll probably be somewhere between 80,000 and 90,000 wafer starts for 5-nanometer as we get into the -- sort of, through the first part of 2020 or maybe that's toward the end of 2020. So I would say that because of some of those other dynamics related to 7-nanometer we're seeing perhaps more activity for us on the 5-nanometer node. -- Okay, maybe -- and then my follow-up question is on the China strength that you guys expect in the second half. It seems like you guys talk about the DRAM project being pulled in, but my understanding, is that -- is that true that a lot of that revenue you have already seen it because it seems like they have gone -- most of those customers have gone past the initial yield improvement stage. And from here on out, it's more on a production level type of run rate. -- Well, like I said, there are some puts and takes in the overall level of business in China. I think it's slightly better than what we thought before. But there is some rationalization of wafer capacity that's happening likely as well. So while you do have some strength around this particular DRAM project, you do have some other moving parts.I think the way to think about this business is more about proving out technology roadmaps and then moving on to the next node. So there is some amount of capacity that gets added, but then there's a lot of effort to progress down the technology roadmap. And because of that we're seeing more engagement than you otherwise might because, yeah, yields slightly improving on the trailing node that they're happy to move to the next node, then they are challenged again and need to upgrade certain parts of the toolset.So that's driving a more continuous level of business, not just with this customer but with other customers, and you might see when you're at some node and then go ramp, it's a significant volume production as in you'd see in one of the leading-edge memory fabs. It's a little different behavior, smaller fabs and more of a focus on trying to move down the technology curve than just ramping a lot of capacity. -- All right, that's helpful. Thanks.[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is now live -- Good afternoon. This is Brian Chin on for Patrick. Thanks for letting us ask a few questions on the PCB and flat panel markets. PCB first. The overlay of Huawei might also cloud things a little bit here. But of the major smartphone ecosystems, it sounds like China has been the laggard in terms of adoption of tighter line and space, SLP and mSAP manufacturing. So have you begun to see the China leader or leaders begin to adopt the Orbotech, or now KLA, imaging products this year, or are we still early on this adoption curve for them as we -- and maybe you'll see that more as we move into next year? -- Yeah, still not yet. I think we do expect that to see that, and the current expectation is, as you say, it's probably next year. Probably the third guys to do that. -- Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe [Indecipherable] the flat panel. From an early planning perspective, obviously a weak spending year environment this year. But do you see any lead indicators, early indicators for your product lines like the AOI tool that suggests we could see a meaningful pickup in the spending environment come next year? And if you do, does this increase the urgency to pull in some of the cost synergies relative to that 12-month to 24-month horizon? -- We don't -- it's too early for us right now to see 2020 picking up. I do think we had some marginal improvement off of a bottom, but I would say that it's probably later than that. And to your point, we are actively working some of the synergy programs there. -- All right, thank you.We have a follow-up question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. You are now live. -- Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my follow-up question. On the strong adoption of the Gen 5 wafer inspection platforms, I think it was originally targeted for sub-7 nanometer nodes, however. We keep hearing that customers are adopting Gen 5 for yield improvement even at some of the older nodes, and we also hear that Gen 5 has been adopted earlier by the memory guys. And then you also have EUV print check as another use case. So how much of these types of buyers are driving the strength in shipments this year versus the real leading-edge development activities? -- We haven't thought about in those terms. I'd probably say half and half, though. If I thought about it, it's broad use in development. I think what happens and especially since we make improvements to it and drive the productivity of the tool up, then it starts to be competitive in terms of cost of ownership with some applications for Gen 4, but a lot of this, as you might imagine, the discovery aspect of a new product is you're not really sure what it's going to find and what value it's going to create.So now what we're seeing is significant value, as you say, even in some maybe more traditional places. And frankly what we originally expected was in some places people might have tried to deploy e-beam inspection. They get away from that by leveraging the much higher throughput of the optical platform. So we kind of see it broadening and feel very good. It took us little while, but we feel very good about the progress there. -- I think as customers are seeing more and more demand, more and more activity at these other nodes, too, that that's driving the -- driving more yield challenges. And so now the tool is faster and so the debugging challenges they're having even at prior nodes now using the Gen 5 capability, to Rick's point, you have a whole bunch -- whole lot of headroom add -- that enables customers to use that tool for full wafer coverage type yield analysis that didn't exist without the Gen 5 product line out there. So given the demand there and how much activity is happening across new designs at those nodes, you're seeing more debugging that's happening there as well. -- So, just one last dynamic. I think you may know, but what a lot of customers do is it takes them a while to prove out the capability of the tool before they release it even internally for broad use. And so what we've seen in the last couple quarters is we've kind of broken through at some critical places where they have broader ability now to deploy outside of the first people we're just evaluating. And so that really opens up a number of use cases, and hence the significant progress in Gen 5. -- Yeah. Thanks for the insights. -- Thank you, Harlan. That's all the time we have for today's call. Jerome, if you would conclude the call with the final commentary.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- \n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

So, while the latest streaming service or hottest new semiconductor chip may seem like the most exciting parts of the , \u00a0, which makes \"boring\" tech products by comparison, has outperformed not only the broader index, but even its semiconductor peers this year as well.. Data by .KLA -- formerly called KLA-Tencor, due to the merging of KLA Instruments and Tencor Instruments in 1997 -- is the leader in process diagnostic control equipment. Essentially, these tools make sure there aren't any imperfections on silicon wafers, masks used to shape etch and deposition onto these wafers, or post-manufacturing packages.\u00a0These tools have become increasingly important as semiconductor manufacturing has progressed to smaller and smaller nodes. These advanced nodes require extremely precise manufacturing processes, as even the slightest imperfection can throw off an entire \"batch\" of chips, reducing yields and costing big chipmakers money.Eager to learn more about this winning company? KLA just held its annual investor day this week. Here are five key takeaways.KLA is a chip sector winner. Image source: Getty Images.While KLA isn't the largest semiconductor equipment company, it has a dominant market share in the niche of process control equipment. In fact, KLA has over 50% of this market, four times higher than the next largest PDC equipment competitor.\u00a0Domination of the niche has allowed KLA to spend nearly as much on research and development as the next largest PDC competitors make in revenue -- quite a . That scale advantage should insure KLA's leadership going forward, as the company expects to introduce innovation at two times the speed of the overall PDC market.Earlier this year, KLA acquired Israeli firm Orbotech. While the acquisition was only $3.4 billion,\u00a0compared with KLA's $24 billion market capitalization today and around $20 billion at the time of the acquisition, Orbotech stands to increase KLA's addressable market by almost 30%. Orbotech makes inspection and process equipment, but targets complementary end markets of printed circuit boards and flat panel displays. KLA believes it can get about 50 basis points of synergies from the company's already robust gross margin, and further believes that Orbotech is set to grow its revenue by almost 50% over the next four years. KLA management also pointed to the strength of the company's services offering, which encompasses maintenance, software, refurbished systems, and other big data services that help clients ramp up production while maximizing yields.The services segment makes up about 25% of its current revenue, but it's growing at a robust 9%-11% rate, higher than the overall company. This has been due to the company innovating new value-add services, as well as the continued growth of the company's installed base. Management pointed out that 70% of the company's $1.3 billion in service revenue now comes from subscription-like annual contracts, up from 10% in the past. KLA, shockingly, still has equipment in the field from 1990, and the average age of used equipment has increased from four years in 2000 to 14 years today after nearly quadrupling the installed base. That sets up well for more ongoing services, and could change investor sentiment that KLA does more than just sell equipment, which can go through volatile cycles. KLA also laid out its long-term financial targets for investors, and they were robust. In fiscal 2023, the company is targeting between $7 billion and $7.5 billion in revenue, up from $5.1 billion estimated for this year, and diluted earnings per share between $14.50 and $15.50, up from the $8.13 EPS forecast for 2019. The EPS target would mean that KLA is trading at just around 10 times its guided earnings for 2023. While the semi equipment sector is prone to cycles, that valuation is still favorable given where interest rates and valuations of other \u00a0are.In light of the company's optimistic projections for its business and financials, management also announced a big hike in its quarterly dividend from $0.75 to $0.85 per share and an increase in its buyback authorization by an additional $1 billion. The new buyback adds to the existing program, which had $859 million remaining at the end of the June quarter. Analysts clearly liked what KLA had to say after its report, with several analysts boosting their targets afterwards. While the stock has already had an impressive run, it's still reasonably priced, should KLA hit its 2023 targets. Semiconductor capital equipment stocks tend to drop when there is uncertainty about semiconductor demand, so while we are coming out of a downturn now, KLA should definitely be on your list should we encounter another slowdown in the chip space.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The company makes the  used by semiconductor manufacturers, from advanced chips to displays to memory chips.That's why its stock had sold off rather hard in May, when trade talks between the U.S. and China collapsed, sending the entire semiconductor sector into a tailspin.However, June saw the broader market rebound, as hopes for renewed talks between the two countries grew in anticipation of the G20 conference. At that meeting, President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping of China agreed to resume trade talks; this sent shares of global tech-hardware companies higher, KLA-Tencor included.Image source: Getty Images.As part of the new agreement, the Trump administration decided to hold off on implementing more tariffs as it had threatened in May. In addition, the administration indicated that it would likely ease restrictions on some equipment sales to Huawei, the Chinese tech giant, as long as those components weren't a threat to national security.Prior to the meeting, there was fear that U.S. tech companies might be prevented from selling to one of their largest customers. That would have hurt profitability for KLA-Tencor's customers, and likely would have dampened purchases of diagnostic equipment down the road.The memory sector is still dealing with oversupply, and several memory companies have indicated they will  in the near future, so KLA-Tencor still may see reduced sales to those customers this year and next. Last quarter, the memory segment made up 38% of KLA's shipments.However, chip foundries are KLA's largest customer base, at 54% of shipments, and that segment is still set to grow this year, as advanced chip manufacturers continue to invest in smaller, leading-edge chips. The long-term trend toward smaller and more advanced chips bodes very well for KLA, as its equipment is essential for these difficult manufacturing processes.Even after June's rise, with a price-to-earnings ratio around only 14, KLA-Tencor still seems like a solid bet.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

PDC equipment is key to the highly complex process by which leading-edge semiconductors are made. As such, KLA shares tend to fluctuate with the overall semiconductor market. The chip market fell into a downturn late last year, though many chip and chip equipment stocks have risen in 2019 as investors look for signs of a cyclical bottom.Image source: Getty Images.There wasn't much material news out of KLA during the quarter, but there were several events that boosted the prospects of the overall chip sector. First, in late June, a power failure at a factory co-owned by Toshiba Memory Corporation and  disrupted the supply of NAND flash chips, which had been in severe oversupply.  Just a few days later, a conflict between Japan and South Korea arose, threatening key supplies of semiconductor materials and causing fear of further supply shocks. These supply disruptions led some chipmakers to raise NAND prices in July, boosting prospects for this beleaguered section of the tech world. KLA got yet another boost when its large customer  reported earnings, painting a more bullish demand picture for the second half of 2019 and .Investors will get more color when KLA reports second-quarter earnings on Aug. 5. The consensus estimate is for $1.75 in EPS, which would mark a 17.75% decline from the prior year.\u00a0Still, this quarter is projected to be the trough of the current downturn, so investors should watch for management's commentary to see if that is indeed the case.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Though the memory chip glut was sure to come to an end as the past couple of them did, MU stock was apt to remain plagued by doubts, even against a backdrop of decidedly bullish news, I wrote. I\u2019m finally shifting gears now. Though\u00a0 I\u2019m still concerned about near-term ebbs and flows that could prove unsettling to new investors, it\u2019s arguable that Micron stock has mostly shrugged off what ailed it and has entered a new paradigm.And it\u2019s not just a feeling, nor is it an idea solely inspired by Goldman Sachs\u2019 recent (and significant) upgrade of Micron stock.Goldman announced a sweeping wave of upgrades that included MU\u2019s rival  (NASDAQ:), along with technology sector peers  (NASDAQ:),  (NASDAQ:) and (NASDAQ:). :\u201cWe are now more positive on global memory stocks as we believe that the excess inventory memory companies are carrying will be depleted faster than our previous expectations, primarily in NAND flash as a result of the Toshiba Memory Corporation (TMC) fab outage that has disrupted a mid single digit percent of annual industry production (and to a lesser extent incremental capex/utilization cuts).\u201dThe industry\u2019s underpinnings, Delaney believes, have set the stage for higher NAND prices through the third quarter. The same tide is proving beneficial to names outside the memory market too, added Goldman analyst Toshiya Hari.Micron is being viewed as a standout, though. Delaney pointed to shrinking inventory levels and an accelerated depletion of inventories,  \u201cWe believe that Micron is the best stock to express our view.\u201dArguably most important to current and would-be owners of MU stock, Delany notes, \u201c\u2026we believe that Micron\u2019s stock will trade more on memory pricing trends and intermediate term EPS expectations than FY20 earnings.\u201dIf he\u2019s right \u2014 and he likely is \u2014 the uptrend that took shape beginning in late June could indeed be the rekindled rebound effort by MU stock that first started to materialize early this year.In general, analysts have the clout and funding needed to acquire (or aggregate) data the average investor can\u2019t. Goldman Sachs based its upgrade on data it was able to ferret out from within the memory and chip market.Subtle signs of the memory market\u2019s turnaround were already starting to materialize, though.One of those signs was a slight rebound in DRAM prices following a multi-month decline from the peak pricing seen in early 2018. Sixteen gigabytes worth of DDR4-2400 DRAM memory chips, for instance, sold for a little over $200 in February of 2018, but fell to around $90 early this month. Now it\u2019s .That is not a game-changing price increase, but it is the biggest upward move in DRAM prices in nearly two years.NAND pricing, which Delaney specifically mentioned, is also already on the mend. A 512-gigabyte solid state drive from (NASDAQ:, priced at nearly $200 in September of 2017, fell to a low price of $77 in April of this year but has since .As was the case with DRAM, that was the best, steadiest price increases of NAND, also known as \u201cflash\u201d memory, in more than a couple of years.That\u2019s only anecdotal evidence, but it\u2019s in-line with data that\u00a0 Goldman Sachs\u2019 Micron analysts also identified.The data, and the relative lack of commentary on it, underscores something I\u2019ve explained several times over the course of the last year. That is, most investors won\u2019t see the end of the memory glut taking shape until well after it\u2019s arrived. And even then, the early part of that rebound will be mistrusted.That was certainly the case , when similar gluts came to an end. When they started fading,\u00a0 nobody noticed until months later. As was the case in 2013 and 2016, though, the rebound of MU stock earlier this year indicated that the glut was already abating. Anyone who doesn\u2019t think the same phenomenon is happening again now is naive.There\u2019s no guarantee that Micron stock will only rise from now on.

The notes have been issued in two parts. The offering is scheduled to settle on Mar 20, 2019, subject to customary closing conditions.The first part consists of $800 million, carrying a coupon rate of 4.10%, and will mature in 2029.The second part consists of $400 million, carrying an interest rate of 5.00%, and will expire in 2049.The interest on each series of notes will be payable semi-annually on Mar 15 and Sep 15 of each year.The company stated that the transaction proceeds from this offering are expected to be around $1.18 billion. This amount is likely to be used to refinance its existing debt, repurchase shares, and for other general corporate purposes.At the end of fiscal second-quarter 2019, KLA-Tencor's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance was $2.69 billion compared with $2.78 billion in the las  ed quarter.Cash from operations was $282.2 million, lower than $381.4 million in the last reported quarter.We believe that the company has a strong balance sheet, which will help it capitalize on investment opportunities and pursue strategic acquisitions, further improving growth prospects. In our view, the senior notes' offering will bring down the company's cost of capital, in turn strengthening its balance sheet and supporting growth.These notes should provide financial flexibility and propel long-term growth.KLA-Tencor offers complete yield-management solutions including hardware, software and services that help improve output, and reduce overall production cost. Cost reduction is of primary importance today, as increasing competition across all growing end markets leads to greater demand for lower-cost components.

After all, who wouldn't want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let's put  stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar o  in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock's current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, KLA-Tencor has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 13.54, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 18.23. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, KLA-Tencor's current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years.Further, the stock's PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Computer and Technology sector's trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 20.39. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that KLA-Tencor has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year's earnings) of just 14.74, which is tad higher than the current level. So it is fair to expect an increase in the company's share price in the near term.Another key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock's price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, KLA-Tencor has a P/S ratio of about 4.39. This is higher than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.32 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is above the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, KLAC is near the higher end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of overvalued trading-at least compared to historical norms.In aggregate, KLA-Tencor currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes KLA-Tencor a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for KLA-Tencor is just 1.32, a level that is lower than the industry average of 1.46. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock's earnings growth rate. Clearly, KLA-Tencor is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.Though KLA-Tencor might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of C. This gives KLAC a Zacks VGM score - or its overarching fundamental grade - of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  )Meanwhile, the company's recen  estimates have been encouraging. The current quarter has seen five estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to no movement in the opposite direction, while the current year estimate has seen five upward revision compared to one downward in the same time period.This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has increased by 5.2% in the past two months, while the current year estimate has risen by 1.1%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below: | This bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term.KLA-Tencor is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible line up of statistics on this front. A solid Zacks Rank #2 further instils our confidence. In fact, over the past two years, the Zacks Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry has clearly outperformed the market at large, as you can see below:However, a sluggish industry rank (among bottom 24% of more than 250 industries) makes it hard to get too excited about this company overall.So, value investors might want to wait for the broader factors to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-holds for the year?Who wouldn't?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corporation  , Xilinx, Inc.  , Lattice Semiconductor Corp.  and KLA-Tencor Corporation  .After a torrid 2018, chipmakers bounced back this year. Chip stocks collectively notched their best start to a year, boosting investors' sentiment amid lingering global growth concerns. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor, a fund that mostly tracks semiconductor stocks, has soared more than 20% since the beginning of this year, the best first-quarter performance since the fund's inception in 2000. The fund easily outperformed the broader S&P 500'S 12% rally so far this year. Chipmakers, in fact, have posted gains in 10 out of the last 12 weeks.Trade dispute between United States and China along with worries about China's economic well-being affected a few of the semiconductor industry bigwigs. Weak iPhone sales along with deceleration in cryptocurrency mining ventures further raised questions about weakening demand for chips. But, investors saw promising trends in the semiconductor industry this year, which eventually helped chip stocks climb more than 30% since the recent low touched on Dec 26, 2018.The Fed's patient stance with interest rate hikes has bolstered high-flyers in the industry. After all, rising rates do affect these stocks as investors adjust to a new environment.By the way, chipmakers have become more realistic about growth trends. The industry has recognized a glut of chips in the market and it's time to curb production. And that's exactly what Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra acknowledged and pledged to cut 5% of chip production. This lifted Micron's shares 9.6% to $43.99 on Mar 21, after touching an intraday high of $44.21. Largely, the PHLX Semiconductor Index increased 3.5% and closed at 1,441.83, just short of its record of 1,445.90 set on Mar 12.To top it, NVIDIA Corporation's $6.8-billion bid to acquire Israeli chipmaker Mellanox helped renew investors' faith on the beaten-down sector. If the deal is sealed, it would be Nvidia's biggest and will also strengthen its hold in the growing data center market.As a matter of fact, it's the data center market that first and foremost boosted chip stocks this year. Adding to the optimism is an array of new technological trends like 5G wireless, artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and the Internet of Things.Some investors are seeing even more positives for these semiconductor stocks, citing consumer are on a solid footing, especially, in the United States. Consumer confidence bounced back in February on a healthy labor market and an end to the U.S. government's longest shutdown in history. Consumers' assessment of current conditions improved and expectations about the future strengthened, indicating sturdy economic growth.Thanks to the aforesaid bullish trends, chip heavyweights will surely garner most of the attention from investors. But, there are some under-the-radar stocks whose shares have seen superb growth for quite some time. Here are some of them that are poised to gain further in the near term.Xilinx, Inc. designs and develops programmable devices and associated technologies. The San Jose, CA-based company has been progressing by leaps and bounds from healthy sales of chips for data centers as well as 5G wireless networks.Xilinx has also seen solid demand for its other 5G products, including the one-chip combination of analog radio chips and digital processors. Tristan Gerra, a senior research analyst with RW Baird, added that \"we think Xilinx will continue to see design win activity for 5G in multiple years ahead.\"Xilinx currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The Hillsboro, Oregon-based company is presently ranked three in terms of  share for field programmable gate array (FPGA) devices.Shares of the chipmaker are climbing north on stellar earnings and revenue growth in the fourth quarter mostly due to growth in communications and computing. In fact, Lattice Semiconductor expects revenues between $94 million and $98 million for the first quarter of this year, ahead of most of the analysts' estimates.Jim Anderson, the company's chief executive chipped in and said that \"we are positioned to benefit over the long term from multiple catalysts in our business, including growth in computing, industrial and automotive, and the global 5G buildout.\"Lattice Semiconductor currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show tha  make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.KLA-Tencor (KLAC) is headquartered in Milpitas, and is in the Computer and Technology sector. The stock has seen a price change of 20.97% since the start of the year. The maker of equipment for manufacturing semiconductors is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.75 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.77%. This compares to the Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry's yield of 2.01% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.93%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $3 is up 19% from last year. In the past five-year period, KLA-Tencor has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 9.61%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, KLA-Tencor's payout ratio is 33%, which means it paid out 33% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, KLAC expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is $8.34 per share, with earnings expected to increase 4.25% from the year ago period.From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. It's important to keep in mind that not all companies provide a quarterly payout.Big, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, KLAC is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The deal was valued at approximately $3.4 billion or $69.02 per share through a combination of cash and stock.Orbotech is an Israeli firm that develops yield management and process-enabling solutions for electronic products.The deal is in sync with the company's strategy to strengthen business by expanding into adjacent markets. This will also allow KLA-Tenor to diversify its revenue base.

(NASDAQ: KLAC)Q2 2019 Jan. 29, 2019 , Good afternoon, my name is Christine, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 . (Operator Instructions) Ed Lockwood with KLA Corporation Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. -- Thank you, Christine. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here today to discuss quarterly results for the period ended December 31, 2018. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it on our website.Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release and in the Investor Relation -- Investor presentation posted on the KLA -Investor Relations website. There, you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences as well as links to KLA's SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2018.In those filings, you'll also find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick. -- KLA reported excellent results for the December quarter with shipments, revenue and earnings per share each closing above the range of guidance in the period. The December quarter caps the third consecutive year of mid-teens revenue growth for KLA. The consistent strong financial performance we are delivering as a result of our continued customer collaboration, product innovation and outstanding operational excellence.Our performance also highlights the strength and resilience of the KLA business model and the Company's ability to consistently deliver long term growth while delivering top tier financial performance and strong cash returns to stockholders. Consistent with this vision and with an eye to the future, on January 10th, we unveiled the new name and log for KLA Corporation. Our new, more contemporary brand honors the legacy of KLA's past and reflects our vision of the future for employees and for partners. Now, for some perspective on today's market dynamics. In terms of our view of the current WFE demand climate, we are aligned with the consensus expectations for a down year for the equipment investment in 2019, largely driven by meaningful declines in memory spend in both segments, which is expected to be partially offset by growth in advanced foundry and logic. However, notwithstanding the near-term market headwinds currently impacting WFE investment, the long-term growth dynamics for the industry remains strong, fueled by larger and more diversified semiconductor device and demand and disciplined market-driven capacity planning. The reduction in memory capacity investment we are seeing today as a result of weaker mobile demand and a pull back at data center. However, we expect supply and demand to rebalance over time, given a more rationale and disciplined capacity investment posture by customers.In contrast to memory, leading edge foundry and logic investments have begun to ramp, and momentum is expected to continue in 2019 reasonably balanced through the year with customers investings to support transitions to advanced nodes and the insertion of EUV lithography. For KLA, we have already seen our mix of business shifting to logic and foundry and investment from these customers is expected to remain strong in 2019.Now, for some highlights of our market leadership and product differentiation strategies. KLA continues to experience significant growth in demand for our wafer and mask inspection products, driven by tighter wafer cleanliness and geometry specifications in the bare wafer market and the introduction of both EUV and non-EUV projects at the 7-nanometer node in the mask shops.We're also seeing strong customer acceptance of recently released new products including the revolutionary new Voyager laser scanning pattern inspection and the SP7 bare wafer inspection platforms. Both products are being adopted in volume at multiple customer sites demonstrating that our long term R&D investments and product strategies are meeting market requirements and enabling customers to progress their advanced technology roadmaps. KLA service business also continues to deliver excellent revenue growth performance while generating strong cash flow. Service is expected to exceed $1 billion in calendar '19 and deliver long term annual revenue growth rates in the 9% to 11% range. Growth in services is tied to a number of factors including expansion of the installed base and more end-demand for legacy applications driving higher utilization of capacity and extension of useful life.These are just a couple of examples of how our strategies are for technology and market leadership are delivering results. As we move ahead in the New Year, we remain focused on advancing our long term strategies, positioning the Company for success and continuing to deliver strong financial performance and long term stockholder value. To conclude before handing the call over to Bren, I'd like to give a quick update on the status of the Orbotech transaction. KLA and Orbotech are continuing to work cooperatively on approval of our transaction with the Chinese antitrust authority, the State Administration for market regulation and we are finally -- we're finalizing discussions with them. We expect to receive China regulatory approval this quarter. Given the timeliness and sensitivity of these discussions, we will forego any further discussions and will not answer additional questions regarding the transaction until we have new developments to discuss. This concludes my comments for today. Now, I'll turn the call over to Bren. Bren? -- Thanks, Rick and good afternoon, everyone. As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, the December quarter delivered excellent financial results for the Company. Shipments, revenue, GAAP, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share each came in above the range of guidance in the quarter. Revenue was $1.12 billion, GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.42 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.44 in the December quarter.In today's press release, you'll find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. As a reminder, unless I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be solely focused on the non-GAAP results which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release.Now for highlights of the December demand environment in terms of shipments. Total shipments were a record $1.09 billion above the range of guidance for the quarter. The upside to our shipment guidance was a result of pull-ins of approximately $65 million of deliveries, originally scheduled for the March quarter. As a result of these pull-ins, the shipment results for the second half of calendar '18 were essentially flat with the first half.Our outlook for March quarter shipments is in the range of $860 million to $940 million with the quarterly sequential decline in shipments, a function of these pull-ins into the December quarter as well as a shift in delivery dates from two memory customers that occurred very late in December. Though visibility in the industry today is challenging and customer plans remain fluid, particularly in memory, our current view is for the second half 2019 shipments to be greater than the first half, a result of the factors I just discussed and our latest customer delivery expectations for 2019. Memory was 61% of semiconductor shipments in December. DRAM accounted for 38% of system shipments. We expect memory to be approximately 40% of shipments in the March quarter. Foundry was 24% of shipments in the December quarter and is forecasted to be about 50% of the total in March. Logic shipments were 15% and the current outlook is for logic to be approximately 10% of shipments in March. The approximate distribution of shipments by product group was wafer inspection was 48% of shipments, patterning was 28%, patterning include shipments for reticle inspection, service was 21%, and non-semi and component inspection was approximately 3%.I'll turn now to the income statement. Revenue was a record $1.12 billion in December and $50 million above the midpoint of guidance. We expect March revenue to be in the range of $880 million to $960 million. March revenue levels are lower than we expected back in October. As highlighted in our recen  reports, the adoption of ASC 606 for revenue recognition means that quarterly revenue levels are now more closely tied to quarterly shipments.Due to this dynamic, the shipment pull-ins we experienced in December led to meaningful revenue upside in the quarter but at the expense of the March quarter. This coupled with the memory shipment delays I mentioned earlier are lowering our revenue expectations for March. Due to our record shipment backlog and expectations for system shipments scheduling for the remainder of the year, we anticipate that the March quarter will be the low point and anticipate sequential revenue growth to resume in the June quarter and continue for the remainder of calendar year '19. Gross margin was 63.6% in December, 40 basis points lower than the midpoint of guidance as the modest improvement in product mix was offset by slightly higher manufacturing and service costs.In March, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 62% principally due to volume as manufacturing costs are spread across a lower revenue base. Product mix expectations are roughly consistent with the December quarter. Total operating expenses were $275 million in December and at the midpoint of our guidance. Operating margin was 39.1%. For the March quarter, we expect operating expenses to be approximately $278 million at the midpoint with variability around this level driven principally by the timing of program development costs.Looking forward, our customers' technology roadmaps represent an opportunity for certain market expansion for process control and market share opportunities for KLA. Our operating expense investment levels for 2019 are geared to meet the needs of this expanding market for our products and technology. We are making significant investments to support EUV adoption, increasing metrology and inspection challenges in memory and data analytics and design-based capabilities to ensure customers are able to get increasing value from our products. We are optimistic about these growth prospects and plan to invest accordingly.The effective tax rate was 11.4%, given the new corporate tax structure in the US and our expectations for the geographic distribution of profit, we are adjusting our long term planning rate down 1% to 14%. At this point, we expect this rate to remain at 14% inclusive of Orbotech after close of the transaction. Finally, net income for the quarter was $372 million and we had 152.6 million fully diluted weighted shares outstanding. Now, for some highlights of the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and investments were $2.7 billion. Cash from operations was $282 million and free cash flow was $256 million. Capital expenditures for 2018 were higher than our historical run rate of around $50 million to $60 million per year due to the expansion of production facilities to support future growth as well as investment to support our new R&D focused facility in Ann Arbor, Michigan.I would expect CapEx levels to remain elevated in calendar '19 as we continue to make investments in these areas. For calendar year '18, free cash flow as a percent of revenue was 30%. In the December quarter, we've taken the aggregate of $115 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents upon the vesting of restricted stock units. And repurchased $250 million of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program. We are currently repurchasing shares under an existing $1 billion buyback authorization with just over 400 million remaining as of the close of the quarter. We expect to complete this program over the next couple of quarters consistent with the previously articulated approach and subject to market conditions.We have authorization for an additional $1 billion share repurchase upon completion of the Orbotech acquisition. In conclusion, the results demonstrated by KLA in the December quarter reflect the Company's technology leadership, the critical nature of process control and our customer's growth strategies and the value generated by our industry-leading business model. Given these factors and coupled with the new opportunities for market expansion represented by the anticipated Orbotech acquisition, we believe KLA is uniquely positioned to continue to deliver long term value to stockholders.After three strong years of memory investment, 2019 will be a year of digestion for this segment of the industry. Customers continue to press their technology roadmaps but their capacity planning remains fluid. For KLA, we expect that given our technology leadership coupled with expected growth in the foundry and logic segments and along with our exposure to broader opportunities in the wafer and reticle markets, we are well positioned to outperform the industry in 2019.With that to summarize, guidance for the March quarter is; shipments in the range of $860 million to $940 million, revenue between $880 million and $960 million and GAAP diluted EPS of $1.35 to $1.67 per share as well as non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.39 to $1.71 per share. We plan to update guidance inclusive of the Orbotech acquisition shortly after completion of the transaction later this quarter.Before turning the call over for your question, I'd like to notify investors that we have decided to shift our 2019 New York Investor Day from the original plan date in March to later in the calendar year. We will update you on the new timing at a later date.With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A. -- Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we will open up the call for your questions. We request that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up given the limited time we have for today's call. Please feel free to requeue for additional questions and we'll do our best to give everyone a chance for follow ups as time permits. All right, Christine, we're ready for the first question.(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. You may go ahead, sir. -- So Bren, I'm trying to sort of noodle through the pull-in and noodle through the impact of that. So if I adjust for the pull-in, the shipments were like 2.15 (ph) in the back half of 2018 and then if I adjust for that pull-in, the shipments would be like 965 (ph) roughly at the midpoint for March. You said before that the first half shipments would be up versus the back half.So you know for it to even be flat that would imply that June shipments would have to be like 1.18 (ph) or something like that so they have to be up a lot versus versus March. So I'm just wondering, have those two memory push-outs, did they push out beyond June such that the June shipments would not be 1.18 (ph) so that it would be what you said it was before. -- Yeah, Tim. So I think on your math, look we had $65 million of shipment pull-ins into the December quarter. So based on that guidance. Yeah, just that effect alone would move the number from my 900 (ph) to 965 (ph). The push-outs are pretty significant in terms of two major projects. So I would say, one pushed out further than the first half of the year. The other one, we'll see. I think that there are a number of projects that where timing might be in the middle of the year, so we'll have to see where it ultimately lands.But clearly, it had a effect on our view, first half. Now, I would expect to be down and versus the second half of '18 and then we would see a recovery in the second half of '19. So down somewhere in and around 10% plus or minus is how I model in it today. But we'll see how it plays out. -- Okay. Got it. And then if I look back at the revenue, if I just take the midpoint of the revenue guidance something like 920 (ph) and I look back at what you did when you were at 920 (ph) in the past. Margin was -- it was about 200 basis points higher than what you're guiding it. So can you maybe give a little information why is margin so low? Is it just mix and and do you get that back in June and throughout the rest of the year. Thanks. -- So, Tim. I mean, we were obviously sizing the Company and as you see our output from December in the 11 to 12 (ph) range. So the decline in the second half of the year and then that carrying forward here through the first quarter is that we're taking basically a factory that size to -- to ship a much higher level and spreading those costs across a -- a smaller revenue base. So the volume impact of that is pushing gross margins down and that's really the only change from a quarter-to-quarter basis as you look at the different moving parts within margin. So I would expect as we start to see revenue pick up given the guidance we said of sequential revenue growth through the rest of the calendar year, we'll start to see some incremental gross margin improvement there. You know based on the guidance that we were giving in terms of outperform relative to the industry based on where consensus WFE estimates likely are, we probably see gross margin somewhere in and around I would say 63% plus or minus 50 basis points as a model in the year and we'll have to see how some of the mixed dynamics play through.But obviously, we're at a much lower revenue level today and -- and with the industry contracting than what we saw in calendar '18 and that will have effect on our gross margins in the near term. -- Thanks, Bren.Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is -- you may go ahead, sir. -- Hi. This is Ada (ph) for John. Can you discuss if you're seeing any changes in domestic China at this point? -- Well so domestic China is a little weaker versus the last call where we were thinking that shipments looked about flat for the indigenous projects year-to-year. As we look at that today, it's probably somewhere in the 10% to 15% lower. We'll see obviously visibility in the second half is -- it's not so great at this point. But if I look at the shipment profile, what we shipped in '18, what we expect to ship in '19. It's about 10% to 15% lower. Most of it around memory. -- Got it. And can you talk about the implementation of EV and DRAM in logic foundry. And if you're seeing any changes to the adoption cadence given kind of the slow adoption of leading edge nodes that's being discussed right now. -- No, no real change. This is Rick. In terms of the rate of adoption, we see continued piloting and early development with an intent to ramp and we're participating in that through some of the development work we do and also in the mash up some of our demand has been driven by that. But no -- no real change in the cadence of what we've seen in the past. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar. Your line is open -- from Cowen. Your line is open. -- Hi there. This is Steve (ph) calling on behalf of Krish. Thanks for taking my questions. First one on -- I want to ask about was on your bear wafer inspection tool business. Just given how strong that business has been performing for a while now and just given some of the moderation in wafer starts in the semi industry, how should we think about the trajectory of that business across the rest of this year? -- Yeah, so this is Bren. So that business continuing to show very strong momentum. You have to keep in mind that there are number of things that are happening there. First of all, there was a long period of time without any investment really at all. So there is a change in the capacity requirements there that customers have been investing in. That coupled with spec changes have driven not just the inspection tools but also need for the metrology tools. So we've seen that business perform very well through '18 and would expect as we look at '19 not much changed from that business. So I would expect to see it carry forward and based on communication so far with customers, I don't have any reason to change that assessment. -- Okay, got it. And as from a follow up, I wanted to ask about the relative trend profile of foundry and logic demand across this year. Is that going to be more first half weighted and then followed by a moderation in the back half when -- I assume, memory picks up the demand profile or do you also see foundry and logic relatively steady across the year? Thanks. -- In some of the prepared remarks, we talked about it being reasonably balanced across the halves So I think, second half could be a little bit larger, but generally pretty reasonably balanced for both logic and foundry as you have the two segments together. -- Perfect. Thank you.Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. You may go ahead, sir. -- Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, first question on the deferred revenue side. It was a nice uptick for September but looks like very modest impact here in December. So I guess, first question, do you think that the volatility associated with deferred revenues is now behind us? -- Yeah, C.J., I think it is. It wasn't that big of an issue for us but certainly, we're seeing revenue much closer to shipments you saw from the results in the December quarter and the guidance for March. And if you look in the 10-Q filing, you see the reconciliation between ASC 605 and ASC 606, effectively the same results quarter-to-quarter. So there was these timing issues that played out. But at the end of the day, I don't -- I think the right way to think about the business and model is given that these are really timing dynamics is pretty much the shipment number will be the revenue number with some variation related to new products. Now, we do ship more new products maybe than some of the peers and so that can be -- have an effect or certain regions where you may have to go all the way to customer acceptance. But generally, the numbers are going to be pretty close to together. -- Okay, that's very helpful. And I guess as my follow up, as you think about the progression of EUV and thinking specifically to foundry, can you speak to what's driving the demand here 7-nanometer versus 5-nanometer and how you see the revenue kind of progression through calendar '19 and into calendar '20? -- I'm sorry, C.J., what's driving the demand from the device standpoint or for us? -- I'm trying to understand your -- your demand side. -- Sure. -- Both from a more modest pilot line 7-nanometer plus activity this year ramping more aggressively to 5-nanometer, next year. -- Yeah, sure. It's pretty straightforward actually. The -- most of the demand early in the 7-nanometer comes out of the mask shop, because that's where people are calling new mask sets and driving a lot of utilization of new capability in the mask shop and also in the development phases of trying to get those devices to work and then it'll shift toward production and it'll drive more in-line kind of applications both inspection and also some of the metrology needs as we ramp. So -- but right now, what we're experiencing is mainly in the mask shop in the development. -- Very helpful, thank you.Your next question comes from line of Patrick Ho from Stifel. Please go ahead, sir. -- Thank you very much. Maybe a follow up to C.J.'s EUV question. From your delivery perspective has everything generally remained on track or are you seeing any potential pull-ins or push-outs in terms of the timing of delivery of your reticle inspection tools? -- No. Nothing has delayed if anything throughout calendar '18. We saw accelerated demand in support of a larger number of starts than we would have forecast for a year ago in terms of advanced design. So far more tape-outs of advanced designs. Both for EUV but also just advanced 7-nanometer without EUV. So we're seeing the demand on both of those. We don't have a EUV-specific tool in the market. We have tools that can cover both. So we're pretty well situated to support it either way but that's been strong and particularly in foundry logic area. -- It's great. That's helpful and maybe as a follow up question in the DRAM market, we've seen how, I think in the past, you talked about an increase in metrology usage with 3D NAND as the DRAM industry goes to one Y and eventually to one Z and with increases in patterning steps. How do you see a mix of an increase in process control intensity? Is it going to be more biased toward your inspection tools because of the patterning steps or are you also seeing more metrology applications come online as the DRAM industry migrates down these next few nodes. -- Yeah some of -- but for sure, the DRAM will push inspection -- high level inspection sensitivity because they're more sensitive than say a NAND flash would be toward advanced inspection capability for smaller defects.So definitely, DRAM is going to push it in terms of things like our Gen 5. Metrology both of Metrology more so I think the flatness and cleanliness on wafers for NAND has been a driver we've talked about in the past. So it then moves when you got a DRAM back to overlay constraint, so it really depends fortunately for us there are different problems that kind of push different parts of the portfolio depending on where they are in the cycle. -- Great. Thank you.(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from J.P. Morgan. You may go ahead, sir. -- Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe focusing on products. On your flagship Gen 5 PWI (ph) inspection system, can you guys just true us up here. I know the team was anticipating 17 to 18 (ph) systems in the field exiting last year. Did you guys hit that target? And more importantly sort of given the ramp of EUV, the early work on 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer logic one alpha node for DRAM. What are your thoughts around growth of Gen 5 this calendar year? -- Yeah, Harlan, it's Bren. So thanks for the question. So yeah, we did hit our target expectations. We're very consistent -- our results were consistent with expectations for that product. And as we move into next year, we're still seeing a steady cadence of investment here. Most of the tools are development focused. We're introducing the second iteration of the product line that that provides more -- better customer ownership for customers, slightly better throughput and also has some new features with data analytics, computational capabilities, design-based capabilities and so on. So it is moving along pretty well, should be deployed (ph). We'll start to see a crossover. I don't know exactly what the crossover percent will look like in '19 but as you start to think about 5-nanometer ramps, you'll start to see more Gen 5 deployed in production. -- Okay. Good to see the momentum there. And then can you guys just give us an update on your multi-column ebeam inspector system for sub 7-nanometer mask inspection. Last time, you gave us an update which was about a year ago. I think, the team was on track to introduce systems this calendar year -- calendar year '19. Can we get an update and any early metrics on performance throughput or customer feedback? -- Customer interest remains high. We are now in a phase of this program where because we're engaged in developments with specific customers, we're not talking publicly about progress. But I can tell you the -- there's a lot of interest, a lot of demand out there for capability as you seen the increase in an EUV capability and implementation. But we're not in a position right now to go through the specifics of where we're going based on the collaborations we have. -- Yeah. Great. Thank you very much.There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters. -- Thank you, Christine and thank you all for joining us today.

The figure also jumped 23.8% year over year.Moreover, revenues increased 14.7% from the year-ago quarter to $1.12 billion, surpassing the consensus estimate of $1.07 billion. The figure also crossed management's guided range of $1.03-$1.11 billion.Products' revenues (almost 76.1% of the total revenues) increased 11.9% year over year to $852.2 million.Services revenues (23.9% of the total revenues) increased 25% to $267.7 million. | Shipments in the fiscal second quarter were $1.09 billion, up approximately 8% sequentially and surpassed the high end of the company's guided range of $985 million to $1.07 billion. The upside was driven primarily by $65 million worth of deliveries scheduled for the third quarter of fiscal 2019.Memory accounted for 61% of fiscal second-quarter semiconductor shipments, 24% of foundry customers and 15% of logic. DRAM composed 38% of system shipments.Memory capacity investment reduced due to weakness in mobile demand and a lull in data center.Foundry and logic investments increased. This uptrend is expected to continue in 2019, with customer investments in activities related to transition to advanced nodes and the insertion of EUV lithography.In terms of end market, Wafer Inspection, Patterning (including shipments from reticle inspection business), Service and Non semi (including back-end component inspection business) contributed 48%, 28%, 21% and 3% of shipments, respectively.KLA's growth momentum in demand for wafer and mask inspection products remains strong, driven by enhanced wafer cleanliness and geometry specifications in the bare wafer market. The introduction of EUV and non-EUV projects at the 7-nanometer node in the mask shops is also driving the momentum.Further, the company is witnessing significant adoption of its recently introduced products, including the Voyager laser scanning pattern inspection and the SP7 bare wafer inspection platforms.However, 10-15% lower shipment in China was an overhang. This is expected to persist throughout the year.KLA's non-GAAP gross margin came in 40 basis points lower than the midpoint of guidance at 63.6%, as improvement in product mix was offset by higher manufacturing and service costs.Total operating expenses were $275 million and in line with the midpoint of its guidance.During the quarter, $115 million was paid in the form of regular and quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents upon the vesting of restricted stocks, and $250 million of common stock was repurchased.KLA ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and a marketable securities balance of $2.69 billion compared with $2.78 billion in the las  ed quarter.Cash from operations was $282.2 million, lower than $381.4 million in the last reported quarter.For third-quarter fiscal 2019, KLA expects shipments within $860-$940 million. Revenues are expected between $880 million and $960 million, down from the company's projection in the first fiscal quarter. The memory shipment pull-ins from the third fiscal quarter, together with delays in certain shipments, led to the view cut.Memory is expected to be approximately 40% of shipments in the fiscal third quarter. Foundry should be about 50% and Logic is expected to be around 10% of the total shipments in the quarter.The company expects non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 61-62%. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected in the range of $1.39-$1.71 while GAAP diluted EPS is projected within $1.35-$1.67.KLA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Computer and Technology sector are Synopsys, Inc.  , Twitter, Inc.  and Marvell Technology Group Ltd.  , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show tha  make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Based in Milpitas, KLA-Tencor (KLAC) is in the Computer and Technology sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 19.52%. The maker of equipment for manufacturing semiconductors is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.75 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.8%. This compares to the Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry's yield of 2.04% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.97%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $3 is up 19% from last year. Over the last 5 years, KLA-Tencor has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 9.61%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, KLA-Tencor's payout ratio is 35%, which means it paid out 35% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.KLAC is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 is $8.34 per share, with earnings expected to increase 4.25% from the year ago period.Investors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Big, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. With that in mind, KLAC is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

While the world of small- and mid-cap tech stocks is replete with candidates for large capital returns (and, of course, the corresponding risk of substantial losses), there are some larger technology stocks that still offer investors the opportunity to enjoy meaningful capital appreciation over time (although maybe not as quickly as a smaller company might) while also paying a substantial dividend.Here are three technology stocks that -- at current prices -- offer sustainable dividend yields of at least 3%.Image source: Getty Images.One technology company that's known for its  is  (NASDAQ: AVGO) . The company is primarily a chip company, building products for a wide range of applications from the Wi-Fi chip inside of your iPhone to the processor that powers your cable box.On top of that, Broadcom recently entered the high-margin enterprise software market  of  -- an asset that it's looking to make far more profitable through smart cost-cutting. (Broadcom has a rich track record of making successful acquisitions.)After a recent 51% dividend raise, the company's shares currently offer a dividend yield of 4.18%, a figure that's generous both relative to what other semiconductor companies pay as well as to the kinds of dividend yields you can get from, more broadly, tech stocks.Another company that currently offers a generous dividend yield is computer storage specialist  (NASDAQ: WDC) . Western Digital hasn't actually increased its dividend in a long time; indeed, the company's high dividend yield is more a result of its share price having fallen substantially. (The drop is likely due to the fact that the prices of NAND flash -- a commodity that underpins a large portion of Western Digital's business -- have been on the decline.)If you bought Western Digital stock at higher prices, then that's got to be frustrating -- you're getting a much lower yield (since you bought it at a higher price)  you're down on your initial investment. However, for those looking to buy in for the first time, as well as those looking to add to their positions, the company's dividend yield currently sits at a generous 5.2%.Now, fair warning -- the situation in NAND flash doesn't look like it'll get better in the short term. However, if you buy into  -- that, in a nutshell, it's going after a large and growing total addressable market -- and you're willing to get paid a hefty yield to wait for things to improve, Western Digital stock might be worth a closer look.Semiconductor equipment maker  (NASDAQ: KLAC) currently offers a generous 3.29% dividend yield. Chip stocks in general -- including vendors of finished semiconductor products, contract manufacturers, as well as the vendors of the equipment that those contract manufacturers use to build those chips -- haven't been doing that well lately.Indeed, the  (NASDAQ: SOXX) is down about 10% over the last year.KLA-Tencor's stock hasn't been spared from that decline; the stock is down more than 26% from its 52-week high. However, the company's current dividend yield sits where it does thanks to that share price drop.The business itself, though, seems to be doing quite well. During its fiscal 2018, the company enjoyed revenue growth of 16%, with operating profit rising more than 24%. The company's fiscal 2019 was also off to a good start, with the company's revenue growing 12.7% and operating income rising 27.2%.The dividend itself also seems sustainable. Over the last 12 months, KLA-Tencor generated $7.43 per share in  -- more than twice the company's $3.00 per-share, per-year dividend payment. This means that even if the company were to hit a rough patch, the current dividend isn't likely to be at risk. (In fact, analysts currently expect the company to post 6.6% revenue growth and 11.5%  growth in its fiscal 2019.)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Then  (NASDAQ: KLAC) might be a great stock for you.KLA (which just changed its name from KLA-Tencor) provides wafer inspection and patterning equipment for the memory and semiconductor industries.As chipmakers pack more and more transistors into smaller and smaller areas, the process becomes harder and harder. That means chipmakers are increasingly relying on KLA's equipment to prevent mistakes, which can be extremely costly to manufacturers. The company is the dominant player and it supplies most of the industry, so no matter which chip comes out on top, odds are it will have been touched by KLA's equipment at some point.KLA jus  ed impressive results amid a challenging time for the semiconductor industry, sending shares up 5% the next day. Management also gave its outlook for the company and industry for 2019, which should be of interest to all tech investors.Image source: Getty Images.At first glance, KLA's results blew estimates out of the water. For December (fiscal Q2), KLA reported $1.12 billion in revenue -- up 14.8% year over year -- beating analyst estimates by $50 million.  of $2.44 also handily beat expectations of just $2.20.While those numbers are impressive, the results incorporated $65 million of project \"pull-ins,\" from the March quarter to the December quarter. That pulled-forward revenue, which benefited December, will thus hurt March. Management guided for lower revenue of only $880 million to $960 million in the current quarter, along with lower non-GAAP EPS of $1.39 to $1.72.The current quarter will also suffer from delays by two large memory customers, who decided to push out their capital projects from the first quarter to mid- to late 2019. Memory prices have fallen sharply amid U.S.-China tensions, but management reiterated its long-term optimism in that segment. The company expects the quarter ending in March to be the low point in the year, as those memory projects should ramp up in the coming quarters. That may have helped fuel the optimism around KLA's shares, despite the lower guidance.Last quarter, 61% of shipments were from the memory industry, but that will fall to just 40% in March. However, management expects foundry customers to offset the memory weakness somewhat, projecting the foundry segment to grow and increase to 50% of shipments, up from 24% in December. Due to that diversity across memory, foundry, logic, and services, management still expects to outperform the wafer equipment industry in 2019.In addition to memory weakness, KLA is also taking a hit from the Chinese market. The  is affecting KLA.Still, the shortfall is hardly a disaster. KLA now expects China shipments to decline 10% to 15% in 2019 versus previous expectations of flat shipments, due to the Fujian ban and macroeconomic conditions. China made up around 24% of shipments last quarter, so a 10% to 15% decline will only affect 2019 results by 2.5% to 3%, all else being equal.One of the overlooked strengths of KLA's business, one that should help falling shipments, is its services segment. KLA's services are tied to its growing installed base, and they help extend the life of older equipment. Management expects long-term annual services growth of 9% to 11% to fulfill this growing need. Given that services made up 24% of revenue last quarter, that's a nice base of recurring, growing revenue to help smooth out equipment purchase cycles.For comparison,  (NASDAQ: AAPL) -- another \"hardware\" company (albeit consumer-oriented) --  its own growing services division. Yet Apple's services business only made up 13% of sales last quarter while growing 19%, whereas KLA's services division made up 24% of sales last quarter while growing 25%.Finally, KLA is still awaiting Chinese approval for its $3.4 billion acquisition of Israeli company  (NASDAQ: ORBK) . Amid the tense U.S.-China trade dispute, some have questioned whether the acquisition will go through. But on the  , management said discussions with the Chinese authorities are progressing and that it expects the acquisition to close this quarter.While management's statement seemed pretty confident, whether China will use the merger as a bargaining chip in its trade talks remains to be seen.While the U.S.-China trade war is certainly having an effect on KLA, it was good to see the company post solid results given known industry headwinds. KLA's stock had sold off along with many other tech stocks late last year, but at just 12 times forward earnings with a nearly 3% dividend yield, the stock still seems pretty cheap, even after its post-earnings pop.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 191 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the KLAC options chain for the new June 2019 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $90.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.50. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $90.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $82.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of KLAC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $93.03/share today.Because the $90.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 61%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of KLAC stock at the current price level of $93.03/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $95.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 10.18% if the stock gets called away at the June 2019 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if KLAC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for KLA-Tencor Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing KLAC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $95.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $95.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

Shares have added about 5.2% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is KLA-Tencor due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.KLA-Tencor Beats Earnings and Revenue Estimates in Q1KLA-Tencor Corporation reported first-quarter fiscal 2019 earnings of $2.46 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 26 cents. The figure also surged 36.7% year over year and 10.8% sequentially.Moreover, revenues increased 12.8% from the year-ago quarter to $1.09 billion, comfortably surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07 billion. The figure was within management's guided range of $1.030-$1.110 billion.Products' revenues (almost 76% of the total revenues) increased 9% year over year to $829.2 million.Services revenues (24% of the total revenues) increased 26.5% from the year-ago quarter to $264 million.Management expects overall process control intensity to grow this year, driven by the expanding value of inspection and measurement in addressing critical customer problems, along with semiconductor industry expansion in China.Shipments DetailShipments in the fiscal first quarter were $1.01 billion, down approximately 5.6% sequentially but were at the high end of the company's guided range of $935 million to $1.015 billion, driven by strength in memory and sequential increase in shipments to foundry customers.Memory accounted for 57% of fiscal first-quarter shipments, 38% of foundry customers and 5% of logic.In terms of end market, Wafer Inspection, Patterning (including shipments from reticle inspection business), Service and Non semi (including back-end component inspection business) contributed 48%, 27%, 22% and 3% of shipments, respectively.KLA-Tencor continues to experience strong growth for its Wafer Inspection solutions. Management stated that new capacity addition by Wafer manufacturers and the adoption of more complex architectures by IC customers are driving demand for new bare wafer products. These are needed to support more stringent wafer flatness and process tool cleanliness specifications in advanced technologies.The company registered strong growth in China. Management stated that China was strong in terms of both process control adoption and market share gains.Operating DetailsKLA-Tencor's non-GAAP gross margin expanded 150 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 65.2% and came in above the guided range of 64-65%. The growth was driven by a favorable product mix.Total operating expenses increased 4.6% year over year to $263 million. As a percentage of sales, both research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses decreased.As a result, non-GAAP operating margin expanded 330 bps to 41.1%.Balance SheetKLA-Tencor ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and a marketable securities balance of $2.78 billion compared with $2.88 billion in the last reported quarter. Cash from operations was $381.4 million in the quarter.Fiscal Second-Quarter 2019 GuidanceFor second-quarter fiscal 2019, KLA-Tencor expects shipments within$985 million to $1.065 billion. Revenues are expected between $1.03 billion and $1.11 billion.The company expects non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 63.5-64.5%. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected in the range of $2.02-$2.34, while GAAP diluted EPS is projected within $1.88-$2.20.In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.Currently, KLA-Tencor has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a C. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, KLA-Tencor has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

That streak puts it in the realm of Dividend Aristocrats and within sight of becoming a Dividend King.The three stocks below don't necessarily have as long a record of paying dividends to investors as Pepsi does, but  (NYSE: BP) ,  (NASDAQ: KLAC) , and  (NYSE: TGT) offer richer payouts with better growth prospects.Drink in these three dividend opportunities. Image source: Getty Images. Sure, Pepsi's current yield of about 2.9% is pretty good. British oil and gas giant BP's, though, is currently more than twice as high, at nearly 6%. You might want to stop reading right there, but it's always a good idea to make sure that a high yield isn't a sign of a troubled company. Luckily, that doesn't seem to be the case for BP.Thanks in large part to rising  , BP's net earnings have skyrocketed over the past year. On a trailing-12-month basis, they're up more than 150%. Its recently released  were also impressive, with revenue up 32.9% and net earnings up 93.2% versus the prior-year quarter. Certainly, BP's entire industry benefited in Q3 from high oil prices, but not all of them can boast a yield of almost 6%.BP is doing so well, in fact, that it announced a change in the way it's going to pay for  of  's onshore U.S. shale assets that will benefit its investors. Initially, BP had planned to pay for the assets with a mix of cash from other asset sales and issuing new shares. However, BP is now so flush with cash that it plans to pay BHP Billiton entirely with the cash it's generating from its operations. Although it will still go through with the asset sales, it will use the $5 billion to $6 billion those sales generate to reduce debt. More importantly, it no longer plans to issue new equity to fund part of the sale, which is a win for current investors, whose shares won't be diluted.BP is a company at the top of its game, and its healthy dividend yield reflects that. Now looks like a great time for income investors to consider buying shares. This maker of equipment used by semiconductor manufacturers just barely beats Pepsi's dividend yield right now, offering a 3.15% yield versus the soda slinger's 3.11%. The two companies also run neck and neck when it comes to long-term dividend growth, as KLA-Tencor's 67% dividend boost over the last decade edged out Pepsi's 63% lift.But that's just a snapshot of a healthy growth stock that just happens to trade at a generous discount at the moment. Smart investors can lock in that dividend yield at levels above 3% right now and then enjoy KLA-Tencor's rebound to fantastic growth prospects in the long run.The company is a leader in chip-testing machines, selling into a unique spot in the semiconductor production pipeline. KLA-Tencor counts essentially all of the chip sector's giants among its customers, led by  and  . If you believe that semiconductors will play a significant part in the global economy for decades to come, you have to conclude that leaders in the manufacturing space -- including KLA-Tencor -- can look forward to strong long-term results.The stock is on sale due to  between California company KLA-Tencor's home country and China, where many of its customers have set up their chipmaking shop. In theory, import tariffs on American goods going into China could hurt KLA-Tencor's business prospects. However, it isn't always easy to find a drop-in replacement for its machinery from other suppliers. The order slowdowns the company is experiencing at the moment won't last forever, and the equipment orders KLA-Tencor isn't receiving today due to the drama in international politics would be released when the tariff-based tensions reach their conclusion.In the meantime, we're still looking at a company with 22% bottom-line profit margins and 13% year-over-year revenue growth in its most recent report. You can buy into this high-quality business, with zero long-term debt on its balance sheet, at share prices of less than 11 times forward earnings and 20 times free cash flows. Pepsi would kill for those margins and/or growth rates, and the soda stock is selling at far higher valuation ratios as well.So KLA-Tencor and Pepsi may be evenly matched in terms of their current dividend stats, but one is a sleepy, low-growth business with overvalued shares and the other is an exciting, long-term growth company whose share prices have been saddled with a temporary discount. I know which one I'd rather own. Who doesn't love a mispricing play? That's what investors get when they look at Target stock, which was crushed following a pretty decent earnings report. Although the company  Wall Street's revenue and earnings expectations, it still put in a strong third-quarter performance and offered indications of better things to come.Target generated $17.8 billion in revenue, which resulted in profits of $1.09 per share, just short of analyst forecasts of $17.9 billion and $1.11 per share, respectively. Yet it also posted some strong comparable-store sales numbers of 5.4% growth and it saw online sales surge 49% year over year, which was an acceleration of the e-commerce expansion recorded in the second as consumers responded to its two-day free shipping policy.With the Christmas shopping season now starting in earnest, Target ought to be able to hold its own against rivals  and  .Target's stock has lost almost a quarter of its value from its recent highs, which gives investors the chance to buy into this retailer, which is trading at just 13 times trailing earnings and 12 times this year's estimates. The stock is also priced in the bargain-basement bin, going for 10 times the free cash flow it produces. With a dividend that yields 3.7%, that means investors can earn a nice revenue stream while awaiting the capital appreciation to come.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

For the iShares Evolved U.S. Technology ETF (Symbol: IETC), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $28.10 per unit.With IETC trading at a recent price near $24.40 per unit, that means that analysts see 15.15% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of IETC's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Cloudera Inc (Symbol: CLDR), Marvell Technology Group Ltd (Symbol: MRVL), and KLA-Tencor Corp (Symbol: KLAC). Although CLDR has traded at a recent price of $11.89/share, the average analyst target is 67.56% higher at $19.92/share. Similarly, MRVL has 49.64% upside from the recent share price of $16.64 if the average analyst target price of $24.90/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting KLAC to reach a target price of $128.38/share, which is 41.13% above the recent price of $90.96.

A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he U.S. Commerce Department recently announced a ban on the sale of U.S. semiconductor equipment to China's state-owned Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co., a company at the heart of China's  to become a global technological powerhouse.Fujian is alleged to have conspired to steal DRAM memory designs from U.S. memory manufacturer  (NASDAQ: MU) and the Commerce Department wrote that \"Jinhua poses a significant risk of becoming involved in activities that are contrary to the national security interests of the United States.\"Last week, the U.S. Justice Department indicted both Fujian and United Microelectronics, a Taiwanese alleged co-conspirator -- as well as three individuals -- and filed suit to prevent the two companies from exporting any products that incorporate stolen designs.That's likely to be good news for Micron, but it could potentially be problematic for the companies that supply the equipment necessary to produce memory chips. These equipment providers include  (NASDAQ: KLAC) ,  , and  .KLA-Tencor reported first-quarter earnings on Oct. 29, and management touched on how the ban might affect -- or not -- its financials.Image source: Getty Images.It's perhaps no surprise that KLA-Tencor's management didn't sound any alarm bells, given the newness of the announcement. Management pointed out that the ban was related to just one specific company, Fujian, and that the ban wouldn't necessarily apply to the entire country, or to non-memory sales.\"I think we feel OK. I mean, strategically, that this situation around export control tends to be confined to that one particular situation,\" CFO Bren Higgins said. \"... we don't think it has much effect on how we're running the business or planning for it into next year.\"Last quarter, China made up 27% of KLA-Tencor's revenue, but that's distributed between native Chinese companies and multinational corporations with fabrication plants in China. KLA-Tencor also sells equipment to more than just memory manufacturers such as Fujian, also counting non-memory Chinese foundries as customers.On the negative side, management did say that most of the 27% of Chinese revenue was made up of native Chinese companies. So if the equipment ban eventually expands to all China companies, it would affect most of that revenue.But on the plus side, management said that most of its Chinese revenue was in foundry and logic, not memory. That's in contrast to KLA-Tencor's overall mix, which skews more toward memory, which accounted for 57% of shipments last quarter. China has long produced older-generation semiconductors, but its memory segment is relatively new.Fortunately for KLA-Tencor, the ban on selling to Jinhua comes at a time of solid financial performance. Last quarter, revenue grew 12% to $1.09 billion, beating expectations by $20 million, while earnings per share of $2.46 came in $0.35 ahead of expectations. The company guided in line with analyst expectations for the current quarter and said it expects the first half of 2019 to grow over the second half of 2018, which was down from the first half of 2018.Other elements should encourage investors. KLA-Tencor has a great balance sheet, with over $2.8 billion in cash and only $2.2 billion in debt, giving it a net cash position of over $500 million.I also think at least some of these China fears have been baked in to KLA-Tencor's price. Shares have fallen from over $120 per share to just above $90, and KLA's forward P/E ratio has compressed to only 10.2 times  , down from the mid-teens earlier this year.While I'm still bullish on KLA-Tencor's long-term prospects, investors need to keep track of some key risks. KLA-Tencor is still hoping to close its $3.4 billion acquisition of Israeli company Orbitech soon, which needs Chinese approval. While management expressed confidence in seeing the deal close, it remains to be seen if China will deny approval as retaliation against recent moves by the U.S. Commerce and Justice departments.In addition, a prolonged U.S.-China trade war could potentially lead to an economic downturn. Since KLA is a somewhat cyclical stock, a downturn could cause its sales to decline after a multiyear boom. And if the U.S. decides to take the drastic measure of cutting off equipment sales to all of China, not just Fujian, it could have a significant impact.Still, I think KLA's long-term positives and balance sheet outweigh the risks. For those with a higher risk appetite, KLA-Tencor still seems like a good  here, even after the U.S. equipment ban.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But what sets good dividend stocks apart isn't simply the dividend payment. If you are going to invest in dividend stocks, they should be a worthy investing proposition, period. Payout or no payout. This means that the business is going on the right track, and the fundamentals are looking strong.Plus dividend stocks are perfect for the current bout of market volatility. \"Dividends may help to mitigate portfolio losses when stock prices decline, and over long time horizons, stocks with a history of increasing their dividend each year have also produced higher returns with considerably less risk than non-dividend-paying stocks\" says  .So with that in mind, I used  to source seven high-yield dividend stocks. Here high-yield means a dividend yield above 2.5%. As you'll see, all seven of these stocks also score a \"Strong Buy\" consensus rating from the Street's top analysts. And that's with sizable upside potential to boot. Let's take a closer look now at what makes these high-yield dividend stocks so special now: 2.66%Pharmacy chain  (NYSE:  ) is a key dividend stock to watch right now.Top Argus Research analyst Chris Graja (  ) has just bumped up his price target from $88 to $100. The new price target suggests shares can surge 33% from current levels. Following a Q3 earnings beat, Graja is \"bullish on the management's ability to find innovative and profitable ways to reduce healthcare costs and deliver better care\".And of course there is also the massive Aetna deal  . That's because CVS won U.S. antitrust approval for its $69 billion acquisition of health insurer Aetna back in October.Graja is predicting \"significant upside for the shares if the company can close acquisition of Aetna (AET) and deliver on its financial targets\". This includes beating the initially estimated $750M in 2-year synergy benefits.Encouragingly, Cowen's Charles Rhyee makes a similar point, writing: \"We continue to believe shares currently under-appreciate the strategic value of CVS-AET. We also see upside to our estimates from greater than expected synergies.\" As a result he has a $103 CVS price target.Overall this 'Strong Buy' stock scores 7 top analyst buy ratings vs 2 hold ratings. Interested in CVS stock?  3.18%Based in California,  (NASDAQ:  ) is a global capital equipment company. This includes supplying process control and yield management systems for the semiconductor industry.The stock has the thumbs up from Top 50 analyst B Riley FBR's Craig Ellis (  ). He reiterated his Buy rating following stellar Q3 results. \"On higher estimates, our PT ticks up from $120 to $123 and we retain a Buy rating on shares which yield 3.2% and offer deal accretion catalysts\" Ellis wrote.\"Yet again, GM [gross margins], OM [operating margins], and EPS quality were high, contributing to robust free cash flow\" cheers Ellis.This drove the conclusion: \"Overall, we believe KLAC is executing well with new products, regional China growth and solid services gains.\"Indeed, he believes the stock's 'robust' dividend yield provides strong downside support- and with the stock currently trading at 'very compelling' levels, his price target indicates upside of over 30%.Out of 8 analysts polled on the stock, only 1 is staying on the sidelines. This is with a $130 average analyst price target (38% upside potential).  3.25%Burgers may be juicy but this dividend stock is even juicier.  (NYSE:  ) is one of the largest quick-service restaurants in the world. Burger King, Tim Horton's and Popeye's Louisiana Kitchen brands all fall under the QSR umbrella.What's telling is that five-star Oppenheimer analyst Brian Bittner (  ) has just selected QSR as his top stock pick for November-December.\"We are attracted to QSR's risk/reward\" the analyst writes.\"Its system-wide sales algorithm is high-singles and only lags DPZ [Domino's Pizza]. But despite this, and its unique ability to accelerate unit growth and optionality for another accretive deal, we believe valuation remains attractive off our '19 estimates\" he explains.Likewise, UBS analyst Dennis Geiger continues to favor QSR out of the larger US burger brands.He calls the stock's risk/ reward compelling, and cites a slew of reasons in the stock's favor. This covers everything from its attractive free cash flow yield, same-store systems sales growth, underappreciated unit expansion, to its strategic optionality.Given all this, it's not surprising the stock boasts only buy ratings in the last three months. Plus the $72 average analyst price target works out at 30% upside potential.  2.98% (NYSE:  ) is trading at bargain levels right now. This energy stock is currently down 10% in the last month (and 6% year-to-date). As a result the $108 average analyst price target suggests major upside potential of over 75%.The company recently snapped up Andeavor, making it the largest US refiner, with 16 refineries and a daily refining capacity of 3.04 M barrels.Top RBC Capital analyst Brad Heffern (  ) gives the deal his seal of approval. Achieving the $1 billion synergy target would be a 'major catalyst' for shares forecasts Heffern.\"MPC is confident on the achievability of both the ramp and total synergies, but commentary has suggested that there could be additional synergy upside\" he writes.Promisingly, MPC has noted that it will \"put to rest\" any doubt about the $1 billion synergy target at its analyst day on December 4.Plus the stock has another string to its bow: Speedway. \"Marathon's retail business, Speedway, is the most attractive retail franchise in our coverage universe, and the extension of the Speedway model to the acquired ANDV stores could provide meaningful upside\" cheers Heffern.In total, 9 analysts have published buy ratings on MPC in the last three months.

He notes that the company's 2019 booked position is ahead of the same time last year on both rate and volume for all core products. According to management, this points to another year of robust yield and EPS growth. \"Over the next 12 months, RCL's yields are currently up in rate and volume every quarter\" Woronka writes.Furthermore, he still detects a net positive sentiment for the stock, especially after the recent selloff.\"While it sounds like expenses (including some below the line, such as D&A) might ding 2019 EPS a touch more than previously anticipated, we come down on the side of RCL representing among the best risk-reward proposition in the broader hospitality and leisure space at current levels (~11x forward P/E)\" says the analyst.He believes consumer discretionary investors will continue to favor high quality \"growthy\" names, even if some re-rating does occur within the broader market.

(NASDAQ: KLAC)Q1 2019 Oct. 29, 2018 , Good afternoon. My name is Shanco, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA-Tencor First Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 . All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Ed Lockwood with KLA-Tencor Investor Relations. You may begin you conference. -- Thank you, Shanco. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to our conference call. Joining me on our call today are Rick Wallace, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bren Higgins, our Chief Financial Officer. We're here today to discuss quarterly results for the period ended September 30th, 2018. We released these results this afternoon at 1:15 Pacific Time. If you haven't seen the release, you can find it in our website.Today's discussion of our financial results will be presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in today's earnings press release and in the Investor Presentation on KLA-Tencor's Investor Relations website. There, you'll also find a calendar of future investor events, presentations and conferences as well as links to KLA-Tencor's SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30th, 2018.In those filings, you'll find descriptions of risk factors that could impact our future results. As you know, our future results are subject to risks. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today, are subject to those risks and KLA-Tencor cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements.With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick. -- Thank you, Ed and thank you all for joining us today. KLA-Tencor delivered another outstanding result in the September quarter, driven by the company's technology and market leadership and the compelling value of our diversified product and service portfolio and enabling customer success.The September quarter results also show the company is benefiting from our strategies for market leadership and revenue diversification. Furthermore, they demonstrate their critical nature of process control and enabling technology inflections in the semiconductor industry. Including growth markets such as vertical NAND, EUV adoption and the China semiconductor industry. And with the expected closing this quarter of the Orbotech acquisition, KLA-Tencor will further extend its market reach in the electronics value chain, enhancing the company's product and services portfolio beyond our core and WFE to address new growth markets where technological complexity is rising and where KLA can extend its core competencies into exciting new opportunities.Now for some perspective on the current industry demand environment. First, notwithstanding the recent adjustments in capacity investment for memory customers and delays in logic spend from the second half of 2018 into 2019, we believe the long-term factors underpinning demand in the wafer fab equipment industry remain sound. This is the result of several key elements, including more diversified end markets for semiconductor. The ongoing commitment of customers to driving innovation and leading-edge technology roadmaps, disciplined market-driven capacity planning and the high levels of investment required to address increased design complexity and advanced device architectures. We expect these industry drivers will persist in delivering long-term growth and value creation opportunities for the company, the industry and for all our stakeholders.Moving now to the recent highlights that demonstrates successful execution of the company's strategic focus on technology and market leadership. First, as the market leader in process control, KLA-Tencor is helping to enable growth of the semiconductor industry in China. Memory and foundry manufacturers in this region are investing in a high level to accelerate process development and yield learning. We expect momentum in China to continue in 2019 and beyond with customers progressing their technology roadmaps and ramping new production capacity in the initial phase of a multi-year investment cycle.Additionally over the past several quarters, we've seen exceptional demand for bare waver and mask inspection products. Growth in our mask inspection business is consistent with planned increases in CapEx from the leading foundries as these customers ramp 7-nanometer capacity to support a high number of customer tapeouts at this node and begin aggressive development of 5-nanometer, including EUV development. In bare wafer, KLA's market-leading inspection and metrology tools are key enablers of the growth in wafer supply to address capacity expansion in memory. These products are also essential in helping customers in all segments to meet more stringent design specifications for wafer flatness and cleanliness.And finally, KLA-Tencor service business continues to be a highlight. Going forward, it is on a trajectory to deliver high single-digit to low double-digit annual revenue growth with low business volatility consistent with historical trends. Long-term growth and services is tied to expansion of the installed base as well as from the increasing uptime requirements from current node production and at the trailing edge. Trailing edge fabs are currently running at near full utilization, creating new opportunities for product enhancements and upgrades.In summary before I turn the call over to Bren, KLA-Tencor delivered another outstanding performance in the September quarter, driven by the company's strong execution and market leadership. Given our momentum in the marketplace, diversified growth markets and the critical role the company's products and services play in enabling customer success, we are positioned for a strong finish in 2018.I'd now like to turn the call over to Bren for his review of the financial results. -- Thanks, Rick and good afternoon, everyone. As Rick highlighted in his opening remarks, September quarter delivered excellent financial results for the company. Shipments, revenue, gross margin and GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, all came in at the upper end of the range of guidance in the quarter. Revenue was $1.09 billion, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.54 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $2.46. The primary difference between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings was a discrete tax benefit taken in the quarter related to new guidance affecting our adoption of the new tax law in the United States.As a reminder, since this is the first quarter of our new fiscal year 2019, our results reflect the adoption of ASC 606 for revenue recognition. We have adopted the new standard using the modified retrospective approach. Therefore, all revenue commentary in our results and guidance exclusively reflect our adoption as the new standard and we do not plan to provide any color related to the financial results under the previous standard. In today's press release, you'll find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. As a reminder, unless I explicitly refer to GAAP results, my commentary will be solely focused on the non-GAAP results which exclude the adjustments covered in the press release.Now for highlights for the -- of the September demand environment in terms of shipments. Total shipments were $1.007 billion, above the $975 million midpoint and at the top end of guidance for the quarter, driven by strength in memory and an expected sequential increase in shipments to foundry customers. Looking forward, we are modeling December quarter shipments to be in a range of $985 million to $1.065 billion, consistent with the update we provided in early September.Our current outlook is for shipments in the first half of calendar 2019 to be modestly higher compared with the second half of 2018. The shipment profile in the first half of 2019 is expected to show accelerating momentum from foundry customers driven by 7-nanometer design starts in 5-nanometer development activity, consistent investment from logic customers and a balanced mix in memory. Memory was 57% of shipments in September. DRAM accounted for 26% of total system shipments in the period. We expect memory to be strong again in this quarter and approximately 64% of total shipments.Foundry was 38% of shipments in the September quarter, and is forecasted to be about 22% of the total in December. Logic shipments were 5% of the total in Q3 and the current outlook is for logic to be 14% in December. The approximate distribution of shipments by product group was; wafer inspection was 48% of shipments; patterning was 27%; patterning include shipments reticle inspection. Service was 22% and non-semi and component inspection was approximately 3%.I'll turn now to the income statement. Revenue was $1.09 billion in September and finishing at the top end of the range of guidance. We expect December revenue to be in the range of $1.03 billion to $1.11 billion for the quarter. Gross margin was 65.2% and also at the top end of guidance for the quarter. The factors driving the strong gross margin performance in September were consistent with recent margin trends, with the upside largely driven by product mix. In December, we expect gross margin to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5% as a slightly weaker product mix is offset by higher service and manufacturing efficiencies.Total operating expenses were $263 million in September, as non-headcount engineering program investments were lower than expected in the quarter due to timing issues related to prototype materials. We expect to incur those expenses in the December quarter, as we are modeling operating expenses to be approximately $275 million at the midpoint, with variability around this operating expense level driven principally by the timing of these types of program development costs.Looking forward for the next several quarters, we are modeling quarterly operating expenses in the $270 million to $275 million range, based on planned program -- product development requirements and our current top line expectations. Operating margin in September was 41.1%. The effective tax rate was a 11.3% in the quarter and below the 15% long-term tax planning rate as business mix and further implementation of provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation in the US impacted our rate.We will provide an update to the planning rate for the company inclusive of the Orbotech acquisition when we report results for the December quarter. Finally, net income for the quarter was $384 million and we ended the quarter with 156.1 million fully diluted shares outstanding. For the December quarter, you should model share count at approximately 153 million.I'll turn now to highlight for the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and investments were $2.8 billion. Cash from operations was $381 million and free cash flow was $359 million. In September, we paid an aggregate of $123 million in regular quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents for fully vested restricted stock units and repurchased 300 million of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program.We are currently repurchasing shares under an existing $1 billion buyback authorization and expect to complete this program over the next few quarters, consistent with the previously articulated approach and subject to market conditions. We have authorization for an additional 1 billion share repurchase upon completion of the Orbotech acquisition. Finally in regards to the adoption of ASC 606, please refer to our 10-Q filing for a detailed reconciliation of differences in revenue recognition under the new and legacy standards. These differences are largely driven by timing of revenue recognition, principally due to and control the products' transfers to the customer.Under ASC 606, we see a reduction in the time period between shipment and revenue recognition compared to the previous standard. Based on the product and customer mix in our current shipment and revenue forecasts, we expect reported revenue under the new standard to be favorable for calendar 2018 and in the range of 2.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. The difference in revenue recognition between ASC 606 and the legacy standard could fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter but will narrow over a multiple quarter time horizon.In conclusion, the result -- results demonstrated by KLA-Tencor in the September quarter reflect the company's technology leadership, the critical nature of process control in our customers' growth strategies and the value generated by our industry-leading business model. As the market leader in process control coupled with the new opportunities for market expansion represented by the pending Orbotech acquisition, we believe KLA-Tencor is uniquely positioned to deliver long-term value to stockholders.With that to summarize guidance for the December quarter is; shipments in the range of $985 million to $1.065 billion; revenue between $1.03 billion and $1.11 billion and GAAP diluted EPS of $1.88 per share to $2.20 per share as well as non-GAAP diluted EPS at $2.02 per share to $2.34 per share. Before turning the call over for your questions, I'd like to announce we have scheduled an Investor Day for March 6th, 2019 in New York City. Please circle that date on your calendars and keep an eye out for further details and a formal invite in the coming weeks. We look forward to seeing you all in New York.With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Ed to begin the Q&A. -- Okay. Thank you, Bren. At this point, we'd like to open the call up to your questions. We once again request you limit yourself to one question and one follow up, given the limited time we have for today's call. Please feel free to requeue and we'll do our best to give everyone a chance to rejoin today's call as time permits. All right, Shanco, we're ready for the first question.(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open. -- Thank you very much. Hi guys, I had two. First of all, I'm sure you saw the news today about the export restrictions to Jinhua which is one of the three big memory fabs of course being built, this was shipping to this year. So my first question is, does this sort of change how you think about your business next year, it seems to be a little more surgical than sort of, likely to spread to be a big broad export restriction, but I'm curious of your thoughts? Thanks. -- Hey Tim, this is Rick and then Bren will follow. It does not change our view for the rest of 9 -- 2018 or what we're looking at a 2019 based on the expectation we had from that customer. And to your point, it was a strategical export control, obviously other things would change if that were broadened, but as it stands today, it does not change our view. -- Yeah, Tim. I think as we look at this year, we feel pretty good about the tools that we've shipped there and closing on that business. There's some de minimis levels of business in our ship plans over the next several quarters and into our forecast for next year for that side. But I don't think it changes in a material way anyway of how we're really thinking about the business going forward. -- Okay, awesome. Thank you. And then, Bren service was up a lot, it was up 26% year-over-year. A big inflection. I guess my question is, are you doing something different in service that caused a big inflection? And can service grow that much year-over-year in December and then as you get in the first half of next year? Thank you. -- Now Tim, that's a result of our adoption of 606 and what is happening there and I provided some color in the last call on this topic for -- to provide a little bit of clarity and there will be more in the -- in our SEC disclosures that we'll file in the next couple of days. But what we're doing here is, that given the experience of our customers around our obligations in the first year warranty, is very similar to second year and third year contracts, as we are having to carve out of the tool purchase and defer the revenue associated with that first year obligation, historically, with the cost accrual. So what happened is, we've reversed the cost accrual and then for the tools under warranty, we've added the deferred revenue, which we will take over the next 12 months effectively for all tools that were under warranty effective the transition date to 606 on June 30th.So it's a unique dynamic that you saw with a pretty big inflection. I think the dynamics around our service business are consistent Rick talked about in terms of our views of growth rate going forward, but you will see this, this step up that will happen here and we'll see it probably play out over the next couple of quarters and then it will level back out something consistent with what we saw historically. So, no changes in cash flow or business operations, but given the experience is fundamentally consistent with second year and third year contracts, the literature guides us this direction in terms of how we treat those obligations. -- Awesome, guys. Thank you so much. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. -- Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the questions. Congratulations on the solid results. Bren, maybe to follow-up just on Tim's question there, relative to your view that first half of 2019 should be higher than second half of 2018. If you could elaborate a little bit about what's driving that views. How much of a benefit is 606, is the expectation that the memory adjustments are now behind you or is -- are you still seeing memory uncertainty but logic and foundry has really given you that confidence? Any color there would be helpful. -- Hey, John. It's Bren. So those were shipments' statements, not revenue and I think it's an important distinction here, because as we go through this transition, one anchor of continuity is the shipment metric which is why we're continuing to provide not only actual results and context but also guidance. So to be consistent with what we had said previously and to be consistent with this metric that is unchanging, our commentary reflects that.So as we move into this first half, I think that the way the second half of this year has played out is very similar to the way we described in an update that we did back in September, where the September quarter came in a little bit stronger, December quarter sequential growth weaker and consistent with that guidance. So as we look at the first half of next year, we see an increase in the -- in foundry and logic investment and we see memory in a relatively balanced profile as we move into the first half of the year.I would say that it is modest growth in terms of our expectations and we look at the build plan, but and I'm not going to comment at this point of whether given where we are whether it's March or June. But as we look at the first half given the timing and our conversations with customers, that's how we're seeing the first half play out at least at this point, in terms of shipments. -- That's helpful. And maybe as my follow-up just relative to all the consternation and concern about memory. It was interesting to hear you say that you believe memory shipments as a percent of overall shipments will grow sequentially in the December quarter. Rick, I wondering if you could just talk to what extent that that's rising sort of intensity of what you do in the memory market versus just timing of projects. Any help on sort of the rising intensity would be helpful? -- It's a -- the intensity has stepped up but it's more consistent with what we've seen over the last year. Remember, we have other products that contribute to that too such as the bare wafer inspection products which are leveraged to the memory overall wafer shipment. So those products have been extremely strong as the wafer demand around the world continues to get stretched and because of flatness requirements, we've seen an uptick in our business for flatness measurement. So I think it's more related to those functions and that really has been playing out throughout this memory cycle where intensity has grown partly because of the strength of the wafer houses themselves. -- Perfect. Thanks, guys.Your next question comes from Krish Sankar with Cowen. Your line is open. -- Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had two of them. First one, just to follow-up on China. It looks like you guys are not worried too much about the export control impacting your customer or at least your shipments to China so that's kind of good to know. Is there a way to quantify either, I think, you had said in the past how indigenous China bookings are in the $600 million range for this year or as a percentage of sales like 25% of system sales was China. Is there a way to quantify what it was for the September quarter? And then I had a follow up. -- Yes, Krish. Let me take the first part and then let Bren answer. We're not concerned about this particular movement in the market. So this one was a very strategic export control that -- that's let's just be clear on that. -- Yeah, Krish. So shipments, 27% of shipments in the September quarter were China. And then I would say that most of that is indigenous China. There wasn't a lot of activity with the multinationals there, probably a little bit, but not a lot. And consistently, as we've looked at that indigenous business into this year and into next year, the range you talked about is about how we're seen it in terms of shipment at revenue levels $500 million to $600 million is more foundry-centric, a little bit more foundry-centric and material-centric in 2018, it looks to be that way in 2019 as well, at least from an order perspective. But generally we expect a continuation of momentum from those customers. And to the earlier point, I think we feel OK, I mean, strategically that this situation around export control tend to be confined to that one particular situation. And as we said earlier, we don't think it has much effect on how we're running the business or planning for it into next year. -- Got it, got it. Thank you very much. That's very helpful. And then just as a follow up, your commentary on first half shipments and the fact that next year it would be more weighted toward foundry and logic. Is it fair to assume that, I mean, without any guidance like calendar 2019 revenue should grow, over calendar 2018 and given it's more weighted to foundry and logic. The margin profile or EPS should be better than sales. Is that a fair enough assumption? -- So, I'll make a couple of comments around 2019. And the first is, we do expect foundry/logic to be up in 2019 versus 2018 and that we expect the first half to be modestly up from a shipment perspective versus 2018 -- the second half of 2018. So we'll have more to say as we get to the end of this quarter and report results for the December quarter on the total year view. But at least that's how we see it right now.You're right, those segments are good segments for KLA in terms of process control intensity. Our margins are very consistent across our customer base, I don't think it affects the margin profile or expectations from that business. But certainly that business were more exposed to in terms of the process control intensity of those wafer fab dollars. So we're encouraged by that. We'll see how the broader industry plays out and have more to say about that as we move into December and in the first part of next year. -- Thanks, Bren. Thanks, Rick.Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open. -- Good Afternoon. Good job on the quarterly execution guys and strong free cash flow. Yes or no, talked about shipping 30 EUV systems next year, that's up from about 18 this year. So the EUV adoption curve is here and it look like it's a pretty aggressive ramp. You guys are supporting that with your mask inspection, blank inspection, CD overlay Gen 5, print check portfolios, so outside of yes or no, you guys are probably one of the bigger beneficiary, there is EUV ramps, and given that ramp adoption next year, can you guys just quantify your EUV-related opportunity next year and does this help the team sort of sustain that sort of 64% or 65% gross margin profile maybe into next year? -- Hey, Harlan, it's Rick. I'll take the first part and then Bren will follow-up. Let me start with -- we don't break out our business by EUV in particular, but to your point there are a lot of drivers about EUV that are frankly good for KLA-Tencor and for helping our customers solve the related problems that they have with it. And as you mentioned, we're seeing good business and -- as we mentioned in the prepared remarks in our mask business due to the number of advanced starts that are going through fabs and there's also support for print check as you mentioned with Gen 5 and also the overlay challenges that our customers face.So, it is a catalyst and a driver for us as we go forward, but we don't break it out in particular. And we're a little bit agnostic into how many tools there are per se next year. So our demand won't really change if it's the 30 tools they talked about or 20 tools. It's really the driving of the new capability nodes that are driving our business. And, Bren you can break up the second part. -- So on gross margins, Harlan, I think you know as we look at next year this -- and in my comments in the script, we see things operating generally around this level. Product mix will drive us directionally here and there from quarter-to-quarter, but in and around this 64%-ish plus or minus 50 basis points looks like that's how things are trending right now. Obviously, if we see expansion in the business, we should get leverage and you know that would work probably both directions if it turns out that the revenue were to come down. So -- but in terms of the fundamental structural dynamics around margins, that's generally the right place to be. -- Great. Thanks for the insights there. And then on your Gen 5 pattern wafer inspection system, I think you guys have said, you know anticipated 17 systems to 18 systems in the field by the end of this year, did you guys hit that target and how do you guys see the momentum of Gen 5 going into next year, just given the sharp ramp of EUV, the start of 5-nanometer EUV foundry and 7-nanometer EUV logic development activities? -- Yes, Harlan. We did hit our target. So we're consistent with the numbers that we provided earlier and we would expect an increase into next year. I would expect revenue from Gen 5 into next year given the drivers that you mentioned that Rick elaborated on. We would expect an increase in Gen 5 revenue in 2019 versus what we saw in 2018. -- And in terms of momentum, it's playing out very much the same as prior generations when we got the new generations of inspection products, or you have a couple of early adopters maybe one big early adopter that'll drive it. Then you have customers that are maybe more evaluative of it and they'll spend a lot of time trying to figure it out. And then the momentum gets going when the customers who have not adopted realize the advantage that the leaders are having and then we see it kind of flow out.So when we model those, it's not just the number of systems, it's where they're located and the use cases. So we have -- some that are being utilized in the early stages of manufacturing support where others are in development. So we like the momentum of the product, we're finding unique capabilities. It is true that EUV creates more opportunities for that product to differentiate and for customers to rely on it. So we're feeling very good about how we're positioned as we go forward in 2019. -- Great. Thank you.Your next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. -- Thanks for taking my question. For the first one, you've mentioned the potential for first half 2019 orders to slightly grow half over half. How sensitive is that to assumption of where memory prices will trend? -- So my statement was around shipments, and not about orders. And I think right now that the plans our customers have put in front of us given what we're seeing is, it doesn't seem to necessarily be pricing-dependent, obviously that does influence how they think about overall supply. But we've seen a number of adjustments already and how those have played out through 2018 and those pushes into 2019. So based on what we know today, our expectation is to see some balanced investment into the first half of 2019 from a shipment perspective. And as I said, modestly up versus the second half of 2018. -- Got it. And for my follow-up, just a question on inventories. They are higher than what we have seen historically. Can you give us some sense of what the range should for whether it's days or dollars or what have you over the next several quarters? Thank you. -- You're right it's a good question, and they are higher. We have seen some increases related to some of our long leadtime products that are in the queue, namely, the reticle inspection products and we talked about some of the incremental demand that we're seeing for that tool and those are long leadtimes so we have to get in the queue to buy that those materials early.We have a number of new products that are coming out and so we're spinning up supply chain to support that in some cases you -- we're working with newer suppliers and so you know we're buying early to qualify parts to support a ramp. We have a new product launch in laser scanning, in E-beam. We talked about Gen 5 and the increments for Gen 5 into next year. So all those things are driving the inventory levels higher.As we move over then that I would expect based on what we're seeing in terms of output expectations into next year that we'll see that number flatten out. And you know that will be -- that's a -- as we start to put that material into tools and ship those tools out. So we are committing earlier and in those cases to make sure we've got the products in position so we can ramp them and that's where we see in our financials is in the inventory build. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from the CJ Muse with Evercore. Your line is open. -- Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess first question, back on deferred revenues. You know it looks like that ticked up from June to September by $300 plus million. So is that the kind of number we should be thinking about in terms of an increase for deferred in fiscal 2019 versus fiscal 2018. And as a second part to that, should we be thinking about deferred being isolated to certain long leadtime or newer products and are there certain gross margins associated with those products vis a vis the rest of your mix? -- Yeah, CJ, maybe this is something we need to reconcile with you, but deferred revenue, revenue backlog should come down one thing about the 606 is, given the timing issues and given our implementation of 605 which was rules based and as a result took us longer to meet the conditions of transfer and customer acceptance, under 606, we get there much faster. So from the time we ship a tool till the time we revenue, it should only be about a month. So we should see deferred revenue related to that to come down.I talked a little bit about the warranty dynamic earlier which will play out over the next few quarters. But there isn't anything in particular that's -- that special or unique about certain products is more really based on, if you ship a new product and you know it's first of a kind of matching requirement things like that, that we have to go all the way to an acceptance on. But under 606 you go to that acceptance level and in a much faster way. And then all the follow-on tools are generally, you see revenue at shipment. As you know the installation acceptance process becomes or is considered more perfunctory from an accounting perspective. So that's what's happening and I would expect the deferred revenues to come down over time given those dynamics. -- Very helpful. And as a follow-up as you think about just the Jinhua ruling from the Department of Commerce, how are you thinking if at all that could impact MOFCOM and their willingness to sign off on your acquisition of Orbotech? -- We have not -- we've had dialog and discussions and we're proceeding along the path that we had modeled where we were in terms of regulatory in China. We feel very good about the exchange that we're having and we believe we're on track to close that out this calendar year. So as we had said at this quarter. So we feel good about that we have seen no indication of any change in their posture based on any of the other things that are going on relative to trade. -- Good to hear. Thank you.Your next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. -- Great. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Rick, you called out at Foundry 5-nanometer as one of the potential drivers heading into first half of 2019. And I realize it's really early but how do you think about that node in terms of contribution to your business over the next couple of years? -- Well I mean, I think it will be a continuation of the expansion we've seen in terms of the newer products that we have are going to be targeted at 5-nanometer. We see the process control intensity challenges are very significant for our customers because that -- that's the node in which EUV is going to be adopted in a greater percentage. Some people are looking at some level of EUV at 7-nanometer, but 5-nanometer is really where it increases an adoption then will drive a lot of use.So we're well positioned for now. We're working closely with the customers that are pushing their technology and this is part of the Gen 5 discussion that we've had in the past where a Gen 5 is really more of a development tool if you go back a year ago and now it's becoming more of a pilot tool an early production in 5-nanometer becomes more biased toward production. So we feel great about where we are with that tool but also the supporting metrology tools as well. -- In the first part of next year we'll see the 7-nanometer tapeouts that are currently -- the customers currently talking about we'll see that drive up some activity, we're seeing in the mask shop, we'll see it in the wafer fab as well. And we'll start to see more the n5 investments in early development as we move toward the second half of the year. As Rick said, it's a challenging node, it's a bigger node for EUV and we've got a number of products that are targeted for it. And I think it will be interesting and intriguing business for us as we move into the second half of the year. -- Great. And then as a quick follow up on bare wafer inspection, I think this is another segment or product group rather that you guys have called out over the past couple, if not several quarters. I realize it's a high margin business for you guys. I think some of your customers or all of your customers remain pretty constructive in the 2018 -- I'm sorry, 2019 in terms of their outlook in terms of pricing but some of them have toned it down a little bit, just given the weakness in memory and in certain parts of logic. How sustainable do you think this business is for you? I ask because, in the past I think it's been pretty volatile for you guys. Thank you. -- We're certainly in a period where there's both there's kind of three things working at once in favor of this business, which is there's capacity expansion, there's technological challenges associated with these activity and there's increased flatness requirements. So it is true that that has stepped up the level of business. So we're modeling as we go forward is, we don't see that level of growth going forward again where we've essentially over the last few years that business has grown quite a bit.But the sustainability of the current levels is what we're modeling in terms of when we talk with our customers as they continue to bring on capability and remember, the percent of their wafers that are going to leading-edge right now is relatively small and so over time they have to convert more of that to leading-edge. And so we'll be feathering in our products and support of that. So we feel pretty good about the current level of business that we have in the bare wafer and its sustainability. We don't see another leg up though as we saw in the last few years as we went to this node. -- Thanks so much.Your next question comes from Patrick Ho with Stifel. Your line is open. -- Thank you very much. Maybe just as a follow up to your comments on the memory market lease in the near-term. When you're discussing about a balanced memory market, does that include the combination of DRAM and NAND or are you seeing one or the other potentially driving the first half of 2019 outlook that you detailed? -- So that's the statement on our expectations for shipments into the first half. That it's a relatively balanced shipment profile across the two segments. So I don't really have much more to say than that. I think we feel pretty good. We have to remember one thing about KLA is that we tend to be more about enabling technology and less about just raw capacity expansion. And so as long as our customers are continuing to push their roadmaps and they are in DRAM and they are pursuing you know incremental layers in NAND that we see and expect to see a continued level of business from those customers, irrespective of the capacity adjustments that could happen. -- And we don't just agree with the industry perspective that DRAM investment in 2019 will be coming down, we did see foundry up and so, but as Bren said it's -- that's not as much of the driver for us as the other factors he mentioned. -- Great, and that's helpful. And maybe Rick as a follow up in terms of China and the indigenous market, particularly on the trailing edge foundry logic segment that's been a surprising strength for the entire industry in 2018. From a process control intensity standpoint, do you believe the local semiconductor manufacturers on the foundry logic side are seeing the value and this will then continue as they continue to migrate down nodes in the future or I guess I'm a little surprised that there has been so much strength coming out of there given that they can reuse tool or buy used tools in the marketplace? -- They have a -- there's another process challenges I think that they're facing even though they have as you say, there -- they have the options that some of the bigger players might have tried to leverage, but it's harder when you're relatively new and your scale isn't as big to be able to do the reuse and some of the things that you've seen in the other places So they're also tackling a number of technology challenges at once, we have excellent relationships there and we feel very good about the sustainability of that business.On a relative basis too, when you look at those fabs in terms of the scale they're significantly smaller as I said than what you'd see elsewhere. So I think it continues to be strong, I do think there's even potential for more in the way of things like mash ups, where you'll continuously strength. Ultimately they'd like to have wafer manufacturing, but I think that's several years away before that would be a significant piece of that. -- While they also are challenged to get used equipment, it's a pretty tight market out there and you know we will sell at time you scale the equipment, we don't really have in any of that in inventory. So what we've done is, we've restarted older product lines to support some of that business or you are seeing current revenues or products that are deconfigured to meet these trailing edge needs that certainly have the utility to be upgraded over time from those customers. So they're investing that way and to Rick's point, I mean, there are markets to ship into and eventually they'll be able to get to a place where they can do that. -- Great, thank you.Your next question comes from Atif Malik with Citigroup. Your line is open. -- Hi, and thanks for taking my question. Rick, I want to get your thoughts on the use of EUV for DRAM, when you think it gets implemented on DRAM and how you guys could benefit from that? -- Well I think that the -- you're going to start seeing some adoption of it very much depends on the economics, I think and that's going to be the big challenge, but I think we're going to see some in 2019 beyond what we've seen in pilot in 2018. It's really a similar story that to what we see in logic, where EUV presents opportunities both in terms of the mask shop. Obviously, with DRAM, you don't have the number of starts, but you do have very significant concerns about lifetime and contamination and EUV cleanliness overall. But I think it's much more about the scalability and scaling of the design role in DRAM and also some of the challenges they're trying to get around in terms of overlay control. So, it's a driver, but not as much as it is of course, than logic. -- Okay. And then on China in a nuclear winter scenario where, let's say there are broad restrictions put on equipment suppliers to ship equipment to China. Do you think this spending will just get absorbed elsewhere in Korea or Taiwan or in other fab infrastructure there to take the demand? -- boy that's -- it's hard to speculate on that, but I would think there's clearly a case that China is investing for strategic reasons and therefore, it's more additive in some ways than if they were to not be allowed to invest. So, I think you'd probably see some impact. We rate that probability as low and maybe also because of the action that was taken was very targeted and for specific reasons. So, we're not modeling that as one of the outcomes, but, yes, I think that that would have an overall impact on WFE for sure. -- Operator, we are ready for next question.Again, if you would like to ask questions, press star then number 1 on your telephone keypad. Your next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. -- Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on the service revenue. Want to make sure that you talk -- you talked about that takes a few quarters for the revenue recognition to normalize. So, should we think about by the end of this fiscal year, you will get back to a longer-term trend of up, let's say 9% to 10% year-over-year? -- Yes, yeah. No, that -- that's a good way to think about it, because you're going to have to work through the deferred revenue associated with all the tools that were under warranty at the time of conversion. So, there are some tool that shipped right at the end of that quarter. So, it'll take a year for that to completely roll off although it's likely a little bit heavier in the front end than it is in the back half of the fiscal year. That's a good way to think about it. -- Okay, great. My second question is that, in the past you have talked about trailing edge is now close to 40% of your revenues. Some foundries have talked about overcapacity of 28-nanometers wafers and utilization may come down. Do you expect that to be a short-term phenomenon? And do you expect next year you'll see trailing edge going back to 40% of your revenues? -- It looks pretty stable to us as we look at next year around and it's more trailing edge that more of a foundry statement than an overall. But given the diversity of end markets around semis, if you look at those customers that are investing in the activity we're seeing, I'd see it being fairly stable. We'll have to watch those markets and see, but at least at this point, that's how it looks to us. -- Part of what drives those, we have created options for those customers to upgrade their capability and so part of the business that we have for them even in a market where maybe they're not investing in new capacity is to upgrade their existing so they can get more efficient. And we're seeing big demand for that and that was the initiative started a couple of years ago to be able to extend the value of the tools that are already in the installed base where we obviously have a home court advantage too. -- Great. Thank you very much.There are no further questions at this time, I will now turn the call back over to Ed Lockwood. -- Thank you, Shanco. No further commentary from us today.

KLA-Tencor has over 50% market share in the process diagnostic and control (PDC) market according to  , making it the biggest player by far. For some product lines, such as its Surfscan SP7 for bare wafer inspection, KLAC has as much as 90% market share, by some analyst estimates.By virtue of its size, KLA-Tencor has also collected a vast database of past customer defects. KLAC uses this expertise not only to develop its next-generation products, but also to sell service contracts to its customers. Service revenue grew 13% last year and makes up just over 20% of its sales.Finally, KLA-Tencor is well-positioned in its industry due to its narrow focus on diagnostics. Competitors such as  and  have multiple business lines outside of diagnostics. Meanwhile, other competitors such as  are much smaller.Beyond the mere growth of the semiconductor industry, diagnostics in particular has very favorable prospects. Leading-edge chips have to go through hundreds of manufacturing steps, all of which must occur flawlessly for the final product to meet quality standards. The move to smaller, more complex memory and semiconductor chips requires more process controls to make sure each manufacturing step occurs without hiccups. The increased importance of diagnostics should pave the way for KLA-Tencor to grow in the years ahead.For instance, in the case of NAND flash memory, producers have begun increasing bit density by stacking memory cells on top of one another -- this is called 3D NAND. Since NAND flash bit demand is growing in the neighborhood of 40% per year, this is the most efficient way to cram more bits onto a single die.Last year, companies began stacking memory cells into 32-layer NAND, the first generation of \"vertical\" NAND chips. This year, major memory producers are moving to 64-layer chips. Next year, the industry will be moving to 96 layers, with 128-layer NAND projected to be developed by the middle of 2019.Stacking tiny flash cells precisely is very difficult, as the smallest imperfection in any step of the process can throw off the flatness and uniformity needed to achieve enterprise-ready 3D NAND.All of these companies will need lots of diagnostic tools for every step of this stacking process, meaning KLA-Tencor should benefit from the transition to vertical 3D NAND architecture.KLA-Tencor also should benefit from China's ambitions in the semiconductor industry. China imports the vast majority of its chips today, but has vowed to change that via its \"China 2025\" plan. China's goal is to be able to provide 70% of its domestic chip needs by that time.While that time frame may be ambitious, one thing is certain: China will be throwing billions of dollars into the effort. China is projected to spend $11.8 billion on semiconductor equipment this year, up 43% from 2017, and that figure is set to grow in the years ahead. As the Chinese semiconductor industry looks to catch up in its manufacturing capabilities, it will need lots of process diagnostic tools.In its most recent fiscal year, KLA-Tencor grew its China sales by 56% to $643 million, good for 16% of its total sales and much higher than the company's 16% overall growth rate.Currently, KLA-Tencor trades for just 11.2 times  with a nice 2.9%  -- not what you'd expect from a company that just posted 16% revenue growth. That's because the market is fearing a semiconductor slowdown next year after a bumper 2018. Still, in light of the long-term tailwinds, now may be a good time to look at a company that's indispensable to today's leading chip manufacturers.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and KLA-Tencor wasn't one of them!

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 29, 2018, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the  will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.This maker of equipment for manufacturing semiconductors is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.20 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +22.2%.Revenues are expected to be $1.07 billion, up 10.6% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.39% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For KLA-Tencor, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.15%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that KLA-Tencor will beat the consensus EPS estimate.While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that KLA-Tencor would post earnings of $2.14 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.22, delivering a surprise of +3.74%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.KLA-Tencor doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

Notably, Banco Inter has been touted as Brazil's \"first fully digital bank\". With the collaboration, the Brazilian bank attempts to make migration of its workplace platform to Apple's  Mac Operating System (\"OS\") seamless.Banco Inter's client base of 1 million can be attributed to its facility of free checking account. In fact, the bank is also witnessing increasing new accounts of almost 4,500 per day. These factors have compelled the bank to digitize its financial services.Consequently, Banco Inter has acquired 1,000 Macs and teamed up with IBM Services. Per the deal, IBM's Managed Mobility Services for Mac will support the bank to upgrade its software, run multiple devices, and integrate the financial apps into the Apple infrastructurein an organized and secure method.We believe IBM's partnership with Apple (since 2014) enhances Banco Inter prospects to tap into the benefits of Mac OS.

Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable.

The introduction of nests, extension of Java class-file formats to support CONSTANT_Dynamic, Z Garbage Collector (ZGC) and Flight Recorder are the features that really stand out.The nest-based access control enables the developers to access class files of other members' pertaining to the same code without compilers.Dynamic class-file constants attempt to minimize costs and troubles related to creating new structures of class-file constants by providing more options to bolster performance and expressivity.The new ZGC feature is expected to enhance efficiency as it comes with lower latency overhead and constrained allocation limit.Flight Recorder enhances the latest Java version with low overhead data collection infrastructure apt for troubleshooting Java apps and HotSpot JVM.Talking about share price performance, Oracle stock has returned 10.5% year to date, compared with the  's rally of 30%.This underperformance can primarily be attributed to investors' concern over slower paced growth in company's cloud revenues compared with other cloud vendors.Nonetheless, the company is expected to gain investors' confidence with the latest release of Java SE 11. Java has been a favorite among software developers, application builders for quite a long time.In fact, Java scored the highest rating of 17.4%, placing it at rank #1 in the 2018 TIOBE index this September. Notably, TIOBE index assesses the most popular programming languages. Notably, Java got the highest rating of 13.3%, with the top-rank in 2017 as well.Moreover, per Web technology surveys, notable websites utilizing Java are Linkedin.com, Salesforce.com, Alibaba.com, among others.Java SE Subscription allows users to support Oracle's Java SE installations in enterprises in a cost effective manner. Moreover in the press release, the company states that, \"Java is also the #1 developer choice for cloud, with over 21 billion cloud-connected Java virtual machines.\"We believe the new LTS release of Java 11 loaded with robust features, positions Oracle well to sustain the dominance it enjoys in the software programming market.However, competition from other software players striving to enhance their platforms with robust machine learning capabilities is a headwind.Oracle carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Salesforce.com Inc  , KLA-Tencor Corporation  and Apple Inc.  are a few stocks worth considering, in the same sector. All the three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.Based in Milpitas, KLA-Tencor (KLAC) is in the Computer and Technology sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of -4.27%. Currently paying a dividend of $0.75 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.98%. In comparison, the Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry's yield is 2.02%, while the S&P 500's yield is 1.8%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $3 is up 19% from last year. KLA-Tencor has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 7.54%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. KLA-Tencor's current payout ratio is 37%, meaning it paid out 37% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.KLAC is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is $9.28 per share, with earnings expected to increase 16% from the year ago period.Investors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that KLAC is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Though the stock is facing a few headwinds at the moment, these are transitory in nature. There is enough scope for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to rebound in the long haul.In fact, Oracle stock has gained 17.8% in the last three months, outperforming the  's rally of 14.2%.Oracle's non-GAAP earnings of 71 cents per share in first-quarter fiscal 2019 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents. Earnings increased approximately 16.4% from the year-ago quarter (up 19% in cc). Further, revenues increased 1% year over year and 2% in cc which was within management's guidance of 1-3%.Oracle's top-line benefited from the ongoing cloud-based momentum.Oracle recently released Java Special Edition (SE) version 11 or Java Development Kit (JDK) 11. Notably, the new Java version is compatible with advanced secure Internet protocols and cryptographic standards of HTTP/2 and TLS 1.3, to name a few.The company is anticipated to gain investors' confidence with the latest release of Java SE 11. Java has been a favorite among software developers, application builders for quite a long time.We believe the new LTS release of Java 11 loaded with robust features, positions Oracle well to sustain the dominance it enjoys in the software programming market.Further, the next-generation autonomous database launched by Oracle, which is supported by machine learning, is now available. This is a key catalyst for the company. Management believes that the new database will improve Oracle's competitive position in the cloud against Amazon Web Services (\"AWS\").From a valuation perspective, the stock looks attractive as it currently trades significantly lower than the industry average based on a forward earnings estimate. This signifies huge upward potential. Oracle currently trades at a forward P/E of 15.2x compared with the industry group average of 100.9x.The company has an expected EPS growth rate of 9.8%. Notably, the stock has delivered positive earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 6.9%.Stiff competition in the cloud is expected to hurt margins and hinder revenue growth. Notably, Oracle has undergone structural changes. It no longer intends to break out its cloud revenues and does not provide any guidance on SaaS, Cloud PaaS and IaaS. This move is likely to enhance investor concern about the company's outlook.We expect the aforementioned factors to help the company sustain strong momentum and stay afloat amid difficult times. Consequently, we suggest that investors hold on to the stock for the time being.Salesforce.com Inc  , KLA-Tencor Corporation  and Apple Inc.  are a few better-ranked stocks in the same sector. All the three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see  .Salesforce, KLA-Tencor and Apple have a long-term earnings growth rate of 25%, 9.8% and 9.7%, respectively.Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2020 put at the $90 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $7.20. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 8% return against the $90 commitment, or a 6.1% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to KLAC's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $90 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless KLA-Tencor Corp sees its shares decline 14.1% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $82.80 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $7.20 from $90), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 6.1% annualized rate of return.Interestingly, that annualized 6.1% figure actually exceeds the 2.9% annualized dividend paid by KLA-Tencor Corp by 3.2%, based on the current share price of $105.07. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 14.06% to reach the $90 strike price.Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of KLA-Tencor Corp, looking at the dividend history chart for KLAC below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2.9% annualized dividend yield.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for KLA-Tencor Corp, and highlighting in green where the $90 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2020 put at the $90 strike for the 6.1% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for KLA-Tencor Corp (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $105.07) to be 33%.

Though yesterday's 0.13% advance from the  was nowhere near Tuesday's rally, it's still another step forward. The index's close of 2,907.95 was the second-best close ever.Still, it's not clear if the broad market would have ended the day in the black had it not been for some roaring pot stocks. There were more losers than winners on Wednesday, and none of the biggest and most active winners weren't terribly familiar or big names. Market darling  (NASDAQ:  ) gave up 2.3% of its value as traders started to second-guess the viability of the recent rally.Level-headed traders would be wise to avoid the temptation that marijuana-related names like  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) are manifesting though. The sustainability of those uptrends is in question.Rather, stock charts of  (NYSE:  ),  (NYSE:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) are serving up the more reliable setups headed into Thursday's session. Here's why.If the name Weyerhaeuser rings a bell, there's a reason. It was one of the three stock charts put under the trading microscope back on Monday of this week. At the time, the stock was putting pressure on a long-term support line that - if broken - could open the selling floodgates.That happened on Wednesday, and along with that, another shorter-term technical floor was snapped. Yet, that's not even the most alarming red flag.Click to Enlarge  \u2022 On the daily chart, the floor in question is $33.94, plotted with a yellow dashed line. In retrospect though, we can look back and say this meltdown was ultimately set up by resistance at the 50-day moving average line last month.\u2022 In the weekly timeframe the floor that was broken is the one that tagged all the major lows going back to mid-2016. Already fighting an uphill battle, the sellers finally broke below that line too thanks to Wednesday's tumble.\u2022 The volume surge on the daily chart was accompanied by a strong, persistent rise in volume. For the first time in a long time, most investors are increasingly having doubts. That could fan the selling flames.This year has been, to put it bluntly, a miserable one for Invesco shareholders. The stock is off 37% from its January peak, and it's not even entirely clear why. The money management business has been fine (if not quite  ), and although it's a somewhat dividend-oriented name, it was punished more than its dividend peers.Whatever the ultimate reason, it looks like investors are starting to rethink their doubts. Though not in full-blown recovery mode yet, there are enough bullish clues starting to take shape that Invesco has at least earned a spot on watchlists.Click to Enlarge  \u2022 On Wednesday, IVZ moved above its 20-day moving average line, plotted in blue on the daily chart. While we've seen this happen before, we've not seen it in this context \u2026 the context of a bullish MACD crossover on the weekly chart.\u2022 There are a couple of resistance lines that need to be hurdled to put the finishing touches on the breakout effort. One of them is the upper resistance line on the weekly chart, marked with a white dashed line. The other is the 50-day moving average line on the daily chart, plotted in purple.\u2022 Given the sheer scope of the selloff, once a rally takes hold it could explode with little to no warning.Last but not least, with just a quick glance it looks like KLA-Tencor shares are just bouncing around, as they usually do. All of the recent pullbacks were countered with equally big rebound.This current meltdown, however, looks and feels a bit different than the other ones. This time around, it's happening against a backdrop of slowing momentum and a move under a major technical floor.Click to Enlarge  \u2022 Chief among the red flags is the face that KLAC has broken below the support line, plotted with a white dashed line, that's reversed all the selloffs seen since the middle of last year.\u2022 Simultaneously, though it's a bit difficult to see, all of the key moving average lines are converging. This is ultimately the result of waning momentum, and an undeniable sign of it. Both accumulation-distribution lines are now into multiweek low territory.\u2022 There's still a sliver of a chance KLA-Tencor could pull itself out of trouble, but one or two more bad days could unleash the selling volume that's already started to pick up the pace.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Chicago, IL - September 18, 2018 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Apple  , Microsoft  , KLA Tencor  and Micron  .Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. In the Global Week Ahead, here are Reuters' five big world market themes.These are likely to dominate the thinking of investors and traders in the coming week. I re-ranked them, in order of importance to equity markets. Reuters put rising  at the top of the global list they constructed.However, the bigger trading news looks to be the , out After the Market (AMC) closes on Thursday. The chip stocks follow this market leader. These bellwether Micron shares are basing off their annual lows now.Will chip shares break even lower, or a bounce mightily off the lows in their trading ranges? -- That is what this  can bring.Brent oil hit $80 a barrel last week - good news for exporters like Saudi Arabia and Russia, but less so for importers such as India and especially those with big current account deficits, like Turkey.The loss of Iranian supply into an already tight market should keep prices elevated for now.But $80 has proved a formidable psychological and technical barrier, so staying above that is going to be tricky. Brent briefly popped above $80 in May, marking its highest in over three years, but it could not maintain altitude. There's likely to be a lot of options positions around this big number, and for all you chartists out there, technicals are in play too.The 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of Brent's $90 plunge, between June 2014 and January 2016, comes in just above $81.There's another barrier to consider: Donald Trump. The U.S. president has complained repeatedly about oil prices, demanding OPEC action to bring them down. And he was doing that when oil was lower than it is today, so another tweet-storm from the White House would be a surprise to pretty much nobody.Turkey may have delivered a chunky 625 basis-point interest rate rise but similar fireworks are unlikely at next week's crop of central bank meetings in emerging markets. Nevertheless, with inflation and growth worries rising across the developing world and policymakers engaged in a delicate balancing act to calm investors, markets will watch for the sort of signals central bankers send.Hungary, for instance, is expected to keep interest rates unchanged but its inflation report, also due on Sept 18, could show price pressures picking up. So it could spell out details of future policy tightening, though the first rate rise is unlikely before end-2019.South Africa's rand, which is down 16% this year, looks like it needs the support of higher rates. But with the economy recently dipping into recession, authorities are unlikely to make the move, choosing to hold fire in case the emerging market turmoil worsens.Brazil too should hold rates at 6.5%. The real has not been spared by sellers, though, and is down 21% this year. But inflation is running below-target and growth is sluggish. Political risks ahead of next month's elections remain high too. All of which suggest the central bank will keep its powder dry.When the Bank of Japan meets next week, it will scrutinize market moves since its July decision to allow bond yields more flexibility around its zero percent target. There won't be much to look at, though.Despite Governor Haruhiko Kuroda's assurance the BOJ will allow 10-year yields to stretch to around 0.2 percent, they have been caught in a tight range around 0.1 percent. It's proving difficult to revive a market that has seen liquidity dry up as a result of the central bank's huge purchases. This in turn means strains on the banking sector will remain in focus.For now, the BOJ may blame sticky yields on a summer lull and prefer to wait for longer before drawing any conclusions. But policymakers will also have to debate the risks that global trade frictions pose to the export-reliant economy. They'll notice there was no holiday lull in the rest of the world.U.S. existing home sales have hit a wall, falling for four straight months, and next week could bring news that they slipped again last month.A decade after the financial crisis - which had its beginnings in the U.S. housing market collapse - sales of pre-owned U.S. homes remains more than 25% below its pre-crisis peak. The sales pace has dropped nearly 7% from its post-recession high last November.What's keeping a lid on sales? In a word: supply.The number of homes for sale is stuck near a record low and inventory growth has been negative on a year-over-year basis every month for more than three years. That is driving prices to a record with annual sales price increases of nearly 5%. Many economists believe the steep prices are cutting into affordability, and the limited number of homes for sale is dissuading current owners from putting their homes on the market to trade up.The mood music on UK retail is pretty dire. Sector bellwether John Lewis just told investors that its first-half profit was all but wiped out - down 99 pct as the store chain was forced to match discounting by peers.Its struggling rival Debenhams plumbed new record lows after telling adviser KPMG to examine radical restructuring options for the group.Overall, earnings growth for retailers on the FTSE 350 has slowly crept up since the Brexit vote, but is still a way from recovering to pre-June 2016 levels.Retail sales data on Thursday will update us on the health of the UK consumer, but signs are not encouraging. BAML economists say the summer bounce won't last and figures from the British Retail Consortium last week showed shoppers had shunned the stores during the hot weather, apparently in favor of pubs.Fears of Britain crashing out of the European Union without an exit deal have kept investors favoring exporter stocks over domestically-focused stocks like retailers, which suffer directly from the squeeze on consumer wallets.But retailers aren't just worried about a no-deal Brexit: as John Lewis shows, they face an intensifying struggle against discounters and competition online - where the \"infinite shelf\" of products lures in consumers while keeping costs low.How long can this narrow FAANG momentum trade go on? We shall see. Yes, it's a $1.1T market cap stock now. And a #1 Rank stock. But the Zacks Value score is D and the Growth score is also D. The stock trades on Momentum, which gets an A.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on  ,  and  .Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: : is a $16.5 billion semiconductor equipment manufacturer that became a Zacks #1 Rank Strong Buy in early August after delivering a solid June quarter and outlook for their coming fiscal year 2019, which began in July.Wall Street analysts raised EPS estimates for the year from $8.86 to $9.28, representing 16% growth. And the top line now sits at $4.45 billion for 10.25% growth.But shares took a hit recently after the company made subdued comments at the Citi Global Technology Conference last Thursday, September 6. CFO Bren Higgins gave a tempered view of the wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) industry, offering less enthusiasm about an expected December rebound.At the conference, Higgins said that while the company continues to expect the September quarter as the \"trough\" for shipments, He was less optimistic for the strength of the snap back he saw for the December quarter in previous statements.In his comments, he gave a \"modestly weaker\" view of his expectations for a rebound. Higgins now expects that shipments could be \"flat to down a few single digits or so,\" versus a prior projection of flat to up by low single digits.The KLA-Tencor caution is directly related to the DRAM and NAND memory space, where  and Samsung are big buyers of WFE hardware. Stifel Nicolaus analysts commented \"We believe this update adds on top of some of the other push outs and capex cuts that have occurred recently and certainly raises concerns that a larger cutback, pause, or extended downturn could be building in the near term.\"WFE peers  and  also fell sharply on September 6 and in the days since as they depend so heavily on the outlooks of giants Micron and Samsung.And one of the bigger Street bulls in this space, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, downgraded those two but stayed positive on KLAC on August 28...Analyst Vivek Arya downgraded Lam Research and Applied Materials, both to Neutral from Buy, after lowering his WFE growth outlook for this year to +7% from +10%. Arya cut his growth estimates for 2019 and 2020, primarily to account for lower memory capital expenditures.The BofA/ML analyst now expects relative growth in foundry/logic paired with declines in memory within the context of a muted WFE recovery in 2019. He lowered his price target on Applied shares to $49 from $65 and cut his target on Lam shares to $200 from $235.But Arya maintained a Buy rating on KLA-Tencor as he see it being more defensive as it is levered more to technology transitions than production.Then today as I write (Wednesday Sep 12), two different semiconductor analysts at Goldman Sachs lowered the boom on both of these industries.For the memory-maker Micron, Goldman analyst Mark Delaney downgraded the stock to Neutral as he sees weaker fundamentals for DRAM and NAND ahead. Delaney cited memory industry margin pressure into the first half of next year and lowered his price target on the shares to $50 from $68.And for the WFE makers that serve Micron, Goldman analyst Toshiya Hari downgraded Lam Research to Neutral and lowered his price target for the shares to $180 from $224. The analyst lowered his coverage view on the semiconductor capital equipment space to Neutral from Attractive as he sees memory capex expectations running into early signs of excess supply.Hari was initially hopeful this quarter that Samsung's decision to push out DRAM spending was specific to the company and related to node transition issues as opposed to supply/demand issues. But he now envisions a more broad-based correction in memory capex in 2019, as memory manufacturers digest excess capacity.The logic of these analysts with deep experience in the chip industry is that it is a very cyclical business. Goldman's Delaney reminds investors that memory downturns usually last for several quarters and can see an acceleration in price declines, as customers delay procurement to wait for lower prices.But earlier this week, Stifel analyst Patrick Ho and his team reiterated their view that new technologies -- from smartphones, tablets, and the IoT to data centers, autonomous cars/machines and AI -- are driving the semi cycle to last longer.Following last week's sharp group sell-off, they affirmed their near-term positive outlook for WFE and their longer-term \"cycles are dead\" thesis.Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra would agree as he explained during May's Investor/Analyst event that they have evolved beyond the old PC cycles to creating customized memory solutions for their customers in dozens of end markets. And that's why I bought more MU shares on Wednesday ahead of his company's quarterly report next Thursday, September 20.I detailed the expanded solutions arena for Micron in  , my August special report for Zacks Confidential. (If you don't have access to ZC -- where you get 52 special reports per year on all industry and investing trends for only $59 -- email Ultimate@Zacks.com today for a trial and tell 'em Cooker sent you!)Also presenting at Citi's Global Technology Conference last Thursday, Micron's CFO Dave Zinsner said that the company is going to be \"more of a product company than we've ever been\" and that Micron's DRAM products that go into automotive and IoT end-markets are a focus of the company and do not get a lot of attention from the market.And I almost bought some KLAC on Wednesday too, but I'm going to give the bears a few more days to feast and see how this all settles out. I think these bearish \"semi cycle top\" calls from Goldman and others may finally put a bottom in all these stocks.Because what we are hearing from  and  about technology expansion and demand -- from the consumer to the enterprise -- doesn't fit with the Goldman pessimism.I'll let Sanjay's outlook next week help me decide whether the call is valid. : is the giant Chinese Internet portal which provides mobile, telecom, entertainment, social media, and financial services to the largest middle class on the planet -- and monetizes most of these services with online advertising.The stock slipped to a Zacks #5 Rank on August 20, when it was trading above $44 per share, because analysts took EPS estimates down for this year and next as trouble in China's economy begins to surface.Before I give you the details about the decline in Tencent growth, let me share  in the brave new world of the World Wide Web.Next week, a new S&P 500 Communication Services sector will replace the current Telecoms sector, and it will absorb some of the biggest stocks from other sectors like Technology and Consumer Discretionary, with the big targets being  ,  ,  and  .This \"re-balance\" of the structure among Tech/Media titans should add some market volatility this month as the stock market architects at S&P grapple with the \"4th industrial revolution\" we now so glibly take for granted and just call \"the web\"... and its machine learning tentacles.But let's hear it from a leader of the sector re-hab...\"The lines among media, communications, and content are blurred,\" David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said. \"It is time to acknowledge this convergence and the overlapping services these companies provide.\"I wrote a Bear of the Day article about Tencent on August 20 to highlight the drop in growth estimates ahead of their earnings report that week. Since the company's slight miss and subdued outlook, analysts have taken down both revenue and EPS targets further.To summarize, in the last 30 days, 2018 analyst EPS projections have fallen nearly 10% from $1.34 to $1.21 and 2019 estimates were cut a chunky 14% from $1.80 to $1.55.More importantly, revenue projections have dropped significantly from about $49.5 billion to $47.5 billion for this year.And the top line drop for next year was even faster from $65.4 billion to $62.2 billion.Still, a true growth investor like me can't help but notice the sales trajectory remains solidly above 30%.As I explained in my last update in August, it's hard not to love 30%+ annual revenue growth, year after year -- especially for a $400 billion Internet behemoth.And despite the downward estimate revisions, which will keep Tencent a Zacks #5 Rank Strong Sell for some time, 15% and 25% EPS growth this year and next is nothing to complain about from a company on par with  , the so-called \"Amazon of China.\"But the fact remains that analysts are having to keep lowering their growth projections month after month. And if that trend persists, all future estimates remain in jeopardy.It appears best to stand aside until more visibility about the Chinese economy and its dominant consumer companies comes into clearer view.The Zacks Rank will let you know.In a matter of just a few years, \"the Cloud\" has evolved from a budding new tech feature to one of the main factors driving growth in the technology sector. Cloud computing is now an essential focus for software-related companies, and cloud stocks have piqued the interest of many tech-focused investors.New technologies and changing consumer behavior have changed the shape of the technology landscape, and an industry that was once centered on the personal computer has adapted to survive in the world of mobile computing and the Cloud. The markets have been paying attention, and some of the best tech stocks have been those that are either primarily cloud-based companies, or those that have shown growth in their cloud operations.With this in mind, we've highlighted three stocks that are not only showing strong cloud-related activity, but also strong fundamental metrics. Check out these three cloud stocks to buy right now:AppFolio offers cloud-based software solutions for the property management and legal industries. The company's AppFolio Property Manager is a leading solution for property management, while its MyCase application is ideal for practitioners and small law firms. APPF is holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now.AppFolio has locked down consistent profitability in recent quarters, crushing estimates by posting earnings of $0.24 per share in its most recent quarter. Now, forward-looking estimates are trending upward, and AppFolio's full-year earnings growth is expected to touch 93% in 2018. But that is expected to continue to the tune of another 55% next year. This is also a hot momentum play as shares have surged more than 15% in the past month to reach new highs.Paycom Software is a provider of a cloud-based human capital management software solution delivered as Software-as-a-Service. Paycom was one of the first fully online payroll options out there, so this is a really interesting example of a company that has that first-mover advantage and industry leading product that still has a mountain of growth ahead of it.PAYC is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Based on our latest consensus estimates, we expect the company to witness EPS growth of 103% and revenue growth of 28% in its current fiscal year. Looking further ahead, Paycom is projected to improve its bottom line at an annualized rate of over 25% over the next three to five years. Shares are trading at an expensive 60x forward 12-month earnings, but its PEG ratio of 2.4 is actually quite reasonable.Five9 provides cloud software for contact centers. The company offers software products such as workforce management, speech recognition, predictive dialer, and voice applications, as well as an all-in-one contact center cloud platform. Currently, FIVN holds a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).FIVN is on fire after crushing earnings estimates last month, and now the company is looking for even great bottom-line growth. Earnings are expected to improve by 264% this year and 32% next year on the back of 23% and 18% projected revenue growth. Shares are now up nearly 60% in six months and continue to test new all-time highs, with earnings expansion likely to inspire further momentum.Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

KLA-Tencor Corp (Symbol: KLAC) presently has an excellent rank, in the top 25% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most \"interesting\" ideas that merit further research by investors.But making KLA-Tencor Corp an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Wednesday, shares of KLAC entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $102.42 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of KLA-Tencor Corp, the RSI reading has hit 29.7 - by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by  currently has an average RSI of 50.5. A falling stock price - all else being equal - creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, KLAC's recent annualized dividend of 3/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 2.90% based upon the recent $103.59 share price.A bullish investor could look at KLAC's 29.7 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on KLAC is its dividend history. In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["etting big returns from financial portfolios, whether through stocks, bonds, ETFs, other securities, or a combination of all, is an investor's dream. But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Headquartered in Milpitas, KLA-Tencor (KLAC) is a Computer and Technology stock that has seen a price change of 19% so far this year. The maker of equipment for manufacturing semiconductors is paying out a dividend of $2.84 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 37% compared to the Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry's yield of 16% and the S&P 500's yield of 0.75%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $2.79 is up 7.5% from last year. Over the last 5 years, KLA-Tencor has increased its dividend 38.90 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 5%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, KLA-Tencor's payout ratio is 0.59%, which means it paid out 0.59% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.KLAC is expecting earnings to expand this fiscal year as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is $3 per share, with earnings expected to increase 9.79% from the year ago period.Investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons, from tax advantages and decreasing overall portfolio risk to considerably improving stock investing profits. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that KLAC is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

But if you're a contrarian wanting to buy an ever-volatile MU stock, a strategically placed bull call spread remains a better way to suit up. Let me explain.An always-lurkingMU stock bear came roaring back this past week with a vengeance. Shares plummeted nearly 15% after a warning Wednesday from semi equipment maker  (NASDAQ:  ), a  from Morgan Stanley and immediately followed by Micron's management spooking investors with a mixed update Thursday taken to a cautious extreme.Speaking at a Citi conference Micron's CFO noted weaker NAND prices in the third quarter. The news helped send MU stock down nearly 10% on the session, despite positive items such as average selling price increases in the company's multi-chip products and expectations the NAND market will grow at about 40%.While investors were quite decisive in selling shares Wednesday and Thursday, Micron did find other analysts coming out Friday to defend the stock. Bank of America Merrill Lynch reiterated its buy rating and $100 price target. The firm sees the quick drop as a  with fears of a cyclical downturn overblown and the business environment remaining very favorable for the company.The sell-off also saw Cowen & Co. reaffirming its bullish position, citing a healthy-looking market for DRAM and Micron's underappreciated 3D NAND cost structure. And echoing his peers, Cascend Securities Eric Ross implored investors not to Yet at the end of the day - and week, for that matter - Micron's analyst intervention fell on deaf ears. MU stock reversed early gains, finishing up a scant 0.47% Friday. It was no match for more convinced profit-takers, bearish shorts and wounded bulls exiting in front of the company's Sept. 20 earnings announcement.Once again, I'll be the first to admit I was  in calling for MU stock to rally out of a confirmed double-bottom at the tail-end of August. But for bullish contrarians, Micron's minor technical failure could always turn out to be an extreme head-fake and a great opportunity.The fact is MU remains a notoriously volatile type of stock known for its turn-on-a-dime ability. And with shares showing an oversold stochastics set-up while testing three key layers of Fibonacci support, the possibility for a sharp turn higher can't be denied.Still, the risk of MU stock continuing to head aggressively lower does need to be respected. Today's lower highs and lower lows could always be an emerging bearish trend despite our best judgement to the contrary.Bottom line, as a MU stock bull, rather than simply buying shares of Micron and the possibility of dealing with extreme and adverse price volatility, I can use the options market to define and reduce our long exposure continues to make sense.MU stock is off about 15% since my last erroneous technical forecast. The good news is a detailed intermediate-term bull call spread is only underwater by 3% or $1.60. Further, there's still a good deal of time to recoup the loss and even turn a profit if Micron's price volatility takes a turn for the better. And with earnings in less than two weeks, that path could certainly be set in motion.In looking at Micron's options board for fresh positioning, rolling down to the Jan $52.50/$65 call spread is viewed favorably. With shares at $44.86 the vertical is priced for $1.80.This spread begins to go in-the-money snear MU stock's recent high, and a profit of $10.20 is possible at expiration if shares are above $62.50 and back towards the high mark of $64.66 established at the beginning of summer.Net, net, with more than four months of life for the January contract, a couple earnings cycles built in, less than 4% of the risk associated with holding Micron shares and no additional downside exposure - this looks like a smarter risk-adjusted way to get or remain long MU stock.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Semiconductor stocks are rolling over \u2026 again.The  (NYSEARCA:  ), which I called my favorite exchange-traded fund  , has plunged this month, from $109.73 on Labor Day to $106.30 as trade opened Sept. 7.This is the fifth fall of the year for the index, which also fell hard in August, June, March and February. So far in 2017, however, it's still up 4.3%.That's not terrible, but what analysts are calling a \"chip plunge\" is really a recent preference for consumer discretionary stocks. The  (NYSEARCA:  ) is up 12.6% for the year, with most holdings in A balanced portfolio would have both these names, but it's the performance of individual semiconductor stocks that has drawn the attention.Companies that make the gear to make chips, like  (NASDAQ:  ), are down 8% since Aug. 31.  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ), which have been leading the sector this year, are both down for the week.Most worryingly,  (NASDAQ:  ) is down over 15%, in just five trading sessions. At its Sept. 7 opening bid of $45.05, it was trading at just 4.5 times earnings, and its market cap of $51 billion is barely 2.5 times its 2017 sales of $20.3 billion.The fall has accelerated as Micron admitted that prices on \"flash memory\" chips, known as NAND,  with Morgan Stanley saying Micron inventories are growing, and There's nothing unusual about this. Memory prices are volatile, they're commodities and as supply catches up with demand, prices fall. Micron had room to fall because  , as demand from both cloud and device companies remained strong.This decade has seen a secular change in memory, as chips are now preferred over disks for their durability, energy efficiency and faster response. The price difference between chips and disk memory have fallen to the point of irrelevance, so these advances have come to the fore. Even PCs aren't shipping with hard drives anymore.The main drivers of chip sales, however, remain the Cloud Czars. If they begin slowing their capital expenditures, semiconductor stocks will roll over. But there is no indication this is happening. Capital spending on cloud data centers was up 59% year-over-year in the second quarter If there is something to worry about, it is that  (NASDAQ:  )  , that its margins are falling as a result and that the social media space as a whole has rolled over, meaning there could be excess cloud capacity down the road.Things are just going so well that anything less than great looks bad. We were at a market peak, so profit-taking and weakness should be expected.If you're to see the present pause in chip stock prices as anything but a buying opportunity, you believe we're entering a technology recession and that economic growth is about to slow dramatically.What's happening is that the social media crisis, the China trade \"war,\" and a global growth slowdown are making semiconductor stocks the \"canary in the coal mine\" for investors, since the use of chips in clouds and devices keep deflation and growth going.Growth may pause. A recession may come. But chip makers have been expecting this.Micron had $5.1 billion in cash on its books at the end of August, Nvidia $7 billion, while KLA Tencor had cash and securities worth $3 billion on its books in June. They're ready for anything that comes.If it comes \u2026 when it comes, buy with both hands, because they will come back.

The stock was down about 9.9% at 2:40 p.m. EDT.KLA-Tencor spooked investors with its presentation at the Citi 2018 Global Technology Conference in New York on Thursday. CFO Bren Higgins warned that September memory chip shipments were \"still in a drought,\" and predicted that a recovery could be weaker than expected.Image source: Getty Images.KLA-Tencor sells the equipment used to manufacture memory chips. The market for memory chips, particularly DRAM, has been booming thanks to demand outstripping supply.  , a major manufacturer of DRAM and NAND chips, has been enjoying record revenue and profits in recent quarters.That bonanza may be starting to come to an end. \"We thought that December quarter would snap back pretty strongly, when we look at it today ... feels like it will be up a little less than what we thought,\" said Higgins about the memory chip market.The average selling price for NAND chips has declined by almost 50% since peaking in 2017, according to Reuters. \"NAND pricing did decline in the third quarter,\" said Micron CFO David Zinsner, speaking at the same conference. DRAM prices are still strong, but some analysts are now  sometime next year.Falling prices could lead to chip manufacturers cutting back on equipment purchases. KLA-Tencor now expects its second-half shipments to be flat to down by a single-digit percentage, far worse than its previous outlook calling for mid-single-digit growth.The memory chip industry is cyclical. Periods of strong demand, low supply, and high prices lead to increased supply, which can eventually surpass demand and lead to tumbling prices. That, in turn, leads to slower supply growth, which sets up the cycle to begin anew. This has happened before, and it will happen again.The portion of KLA-Tencor's business that serves memory manufacturers ebbs and flows along with this cycle. If the boom in the memory market is truly close to an end, the impressive revenue and earnings growth KLA-Tencor has managed over the past couple of years will likely end as well.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

One presenter at the event was KLA-Tencor  , a popular growth and income play and a major provider of semiconductor manufacturing equipment.KLA-Tencor's comments at the conference spooked investors, sending its own stock and shares of other major chip companies sharply lower in morning trading.But any hesitation about KLAC's outlook clearly has not made it to analysts yet, as the company has witnessed universally positive earnings estimate revisions within the past two months. KLA-Tencor has even received upward estimate revisions for its fiscal year extending into 2020, so it seems analysts have been bullish about its future.So that leaves investors in an interesting spot.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.KLA-Tencor Corporation reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings of $2.22 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents. The figure surged 36% from the year-ago quarter and 10% sequentially.Revenues increased 14% from the year-ago quarter to $1.07 billion, comfortably surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.05 billion. The figure was within management's guided range of $1.02-$1.08 billion.Products' revenues (almost 79% of the total revenues) increased 14% year over year to $840.5 million.Services revenues (21% of the total revenues) increased 14.1% from the year-ago quarter to $229.5 million.The company stated that the integration of Orbotech Ltd. is well on track. The deal will allow KLA to be a diversified technology leader in process and yield management solutions, and services.Management expects overall process control intensity to grow this year, driven by the expanding value of inspection and measurement in addressing critical customer problems, and semiconductor industry expansion in China.Shipments in the fiscal fourth quarter were $1.07billion, up approximately 3% sequentially and were at the high end of the company's guided range of $1.01-$1.09 billion, driven by strength in memory.Memory accounted for 69% (in line with guidance) of fiscal fourth-quarter shipments, 22% of foundry customers and 9% of logic.In terms of end market, Wafer Inspection, Patterning (including shipments from reticle inspection business), Service and Non semi (including back-end component inspection business) contributed 47%, 29%, 21% and 3% of shipments, respectively.KLA continues to experience strong growth for its Wafer Inspection solutions. Management stated that new capacity addition by Wafer manufacturers and adoption of more complex architectures by IC customers are driving demand for new bare wafer products. These are needed to support more stringent wafer flatness and process tool cleanliness specifications in advanced technologies.The company registered strong growth in China. Management stated that China was strong in terms of both process control adoption and market share gains.Also, orders from native Chinese customers remained solid and this momentum is expected to continue in 2018.KLA's gross margin expanded 180 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 64.8% and came in at the upper end of the guided range of 64-65%. The growth was driven by a favorable product mix.Total operating expenses increased 11.1% year over year to $268.6 million. As a percentage of sales, both research and development, and selling, general and administrative decreased.As a result, operating margin expanded 340 bps to 38%.KLA ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and a marketable securities balance of $2.88 billion compared with $2.89 billion in the last reported quarter. Cash from operations was $373.5 million in the quarter.For first-quarter fiscal 2019, KLA expects shipments within$935 million to $1.015 billion.

Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for growth investors than value investors.Estimates have been trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising.

Stocks recently featured in the blog include Amazon.com  , Petroleo Brazileiro S.A  , Gilead Sciences  and KLA-Tencor  .Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. It is late August again. The world's central bankers are going to be in Jackson Hole, Wyoming speaking to Jerome Powell and the rest of the Fed contingent. Mr. Powell himself will speak Friday morning.I would not expect market moving news out of the 2018 confab. Still, this it is a good conference to learn about macro themes keeping these central bankers up at night.In light of that, it may surprise many of you to learn this-The Jackson Hole conference's official 2018 theme is the economic impact of superstar firms like  . That makes the discussion going on there particularly relevant for share investors too.Across the Global Week Ahead - to consider events across the rest of the world - here are five big Reuters in London themes. These are the ones most likely to dominate the thinking of investors and traders alike:The Chinese yuan is under pressure, and close to falling below 7.00 per dollar for the first time in over a decade. It got some respite as talks planned for later this month between lower-level officials from Beijing and Washington offered a glimmer of hope that the two superpowers may work towards a solution to their escalating trade conflict. Chinese policymakers are not taking any chances, though, banning some offshore lending to discourage short-selling and support the yuan.A light schedule of data releases this week should take some pressure off the yuan. But global aversion towards emerging markets might still push it towards the 7.00/$ level that many see as a line in the sand Beijing authorities will defend to prevent further currency weakness and capital outflows.It's that time of year again - Jackson Hole time. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak on Friday, Aug. 24, at the annual global central bank conference in Jackson Hole, WY. He will speak on monetary policy in a changing economy at the start of the two-day conference. In the past, Fed chairs have used speeches at the Kansas Fed-sponsored conference to signal future U.S. central bank policy moves.The Fed has signaled to markets it will hike interest rates in September and possibly December. Against this backdrop, the U.S. central bank is shrinking its balance sheet by allowing maturing securities to roll off without replacing them.Some analysts and investors say the Fed could mention the balance sheet in its latest minutes, to be released Aug. 22, and that could also be a major focus at Jackson Hole. And what about the waves of Turkey-fueled risk aversion crashing around global markets? Will Powell nod to that or the damage higher U.S. rates and a rising dollar are doing to emerging markets?The grizzly conditions in emerging markets will remain front and center. Emerging stocks have just entered bear market territory, the Turkish lira and Argentine peso are locked in turmoil, the yuan and Chinese tech stocks are wobbling and the three R's - the South African rand, Russian rouble and Indian rupee - are all flashing a deep shade of crimson.There are a number of events watch out for next week.Chinese and U.S. officials meet in Washington, just before new U.S. tariffs on $16 billion of Chinese goods are due to take effect.Turkey's markets are closed for most of the week for Eid al-Adha, which could make things volatile because the U.S. Treasury has warned Ankara to expect more economic sanctions unless it hands over detained American pastor Andrew Brunson. A Turkish court on Friday rejected an appeal for his release.There could also be progress in the long-running NAFTA saga that has been hanging over Mexico. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer expressed hope on Thursday that a breakthrough could be made in the coming days, though his Mexican counterpart Ildefonso Guajardo cautioned flexibility will be needed.The dollar's status as the go-to currency in times of market turbulence has been reinforced by the Turkish crisis and fallout. It's risen to its strongest level in over a year, but few analysts are prepared to call the peak just yet.It's up a blistering 8% since mid-April, and few currencies have been left unscathed: countries with big current account deficits have taken a beating, the offshore yuan had slid to a 19-month low, while the euro, sterling and Australian dollar are all at their weakest levels in more than a year.The Fed's interest rate hikes and buoyant U.S. economy have boosted the greenback, at the same time inflicting increasing damage on emerging markets. As the Bank for International Settlements said last month: \"When the dollar is weak, there tends to be greater appetite for risk, but a stronger dollar often goes hand in hand with the reversal of risk attitudes.\"President Trump took to Twitter this week to proclaim that money \"is pouring into our cherished DOLLAR like rarely before.\" There may be more upside ahead.The days of #Euroboom seem far behind us, with trade wars, a weakened Angela Merkel and crisis in Italian politics bringing the Eurozone pessimists out of the woodwork in recent months.What's more, growth appears to have peaked.On the other hand, the euro's slide to $1.13, its weakest in over a year, will be welcomed in the corridors of power in Eurozone capitals and ECB Towers in Frankfurt. Purchasing managers index data, the most up-to-date snapshot of activity, should tell us whether growth is picking up or not.ECB watchers will be paying close attention. Signs of resilience in the Eurozone economy will allow the ECB to go ahead with its gradual withdrawal of stimulus. Signs of weakness, especially against a backdrop of severe emerging market volatility, might make them think twice. ECB President Mario Draghi may share his thoughts on this and more at Jackson Hole. Yes. The consensus says don't take a chance on Brazil. But the long-term Zacks Rank is A here, and we have share trading at near $11. This is the major state oil company of Brazil. Could it be time to bet on a rebound here? This is a major biotech stock. The shares price at $73 each. The long-term Zacks VGM score is D, which is not as scary as it may seem, due to the company's biotech space being so pricey.

But for income investors, generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments is your primary focus.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Based in Milpitas, KLA-Tencor (KLAC) is in the Computer and Technology sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 6.98%. Currently paying a dividend of $0.75 per share, the company has a dividend yield of 2.67%. In comparison, the Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry's yield is 1.66%, while the S&P 500's yield is 1.79%.Taking a look at the company's dividend growth, its current annualized dividend of $3 is up 19% from last year. In the past five-year period, KLA-Tencor has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 7.54%. Future dividend growth will depend on earnings growth as well as payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. KLA-Tencor's current payout ratio is 37%. This means it paid out 37% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, KLAC expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is $9.28 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 16%.Investors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.High-growth firms or tech start-ups, for example, rarely provide their shareholders a dividend, while larger, more established companies that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that KLAC is not only an attractive dividend play, but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The world's central bankers are going to be in Jackson Hole, Wyoming speaking to Jerome Powell and the rest of the Fed contingent. Mr. Powell himself will speak Friday morning.I would not expect market moving news out of the 2018 confab. Still, this it is a good conference to learn about macro themes keeping these central bankers up at night.In light of that, it may surprise many of you to learn this-The Jackson Hole conference's official 2018 theme is the economic impact of superstar firms like  . That makes the discussion going on there particularly relevant for share investors too.Across the Global Week Ahead - to consider events across the rest of the world - here are five big Reuters in London themes. These are the ones most likely to dominate the thinking of investors and traders alike:The Chinese yuan is under pressure, and close to falling below 7.00 per dollar for the first time in over a decade. It got some respite as talks planned for later this month between lower-level officials from Beijing and Washington offered a glimmer of hope that the two superpowers may work towards a solution to their escalating trade conflict. Chinese policymakers are not taking any chances, though, banning some offshore lending to discourage short-selling and support the yuan.A light schedule of data releases this week should take some pressure off the yuan. But global aversion towards emerging markets might still push it towards the 7.00/$ level that many see as a line in the sand Beijing authorities will defend to prevent further currency weakness and capital outflows.It's that time of year again - Jackson Hole time. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak on Friday, Aug. 24, at the annual global central bank conference in Jackson Hole, WY. He will speak on monetary policy in a changing economy at the start of the two-day conference. In the past, Fed chairs have used speeches at the Kansas Fed-sponsored conference to signal future U.S. central bank policy moves.The Fed has signaled to markets it will hike interest rates in September and possibly December. Against this backdrop, the U.S. central bank is shrinking its balance sheet by allowing maturing securities to roll off without replacing them.Some analysts and investors say the Fed could mention the balance sheet in its latest minutes, to be released Aug. 22, and that could also be a major focus at Jackson Hole. And what about the waves of Turkey-fueled risk aversion crashing around global markets? Will Powell nod to that or the damage higher U.S. rates and a rising dollar are doing to emerging markets?The grizzly conditions in emerging markets will remain front and center. Emerging stocks have just entered bear market territory, the Turkish lira and Argentine peso are locked in turmoil, the yuan and Chinese tech stocks are wobbling and the three R's - the South African rand, Russian rouble and Indian rupee - are all flashing a deep shade of crimson.There are a number of events watch out for next week.Chinese and U.S. officials meet in Washington, just before new U.S. tariffs on $16 billion of Chinese goods are due to take effect.Turkey's markets are closed for most of the week for Eid al-Adha, which could make things volatile because the U.S. Treasury has warned Ankara to expect more economic sanctions unless it hands over detained American pastor Andrew Brunson. A Turkish court on Friday rejected an appeal for his release.There could also be progress in the long-running NAFTA saga that has been hanging over Mexico. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer expressed hope on Thursday that a breakthrough could be made in the coming days, though his Mexican counterpart Ildefonso Guajardo cautioned flexibility will be needed.The dollar's status as the go-to currency in times of market turbulence has been reinforced by the Turkish crisis and fallout. It's risen to its strongest level in over a year, but few analysts are prepared to call the peak just yet.It's up a blistering 8% since mid-April, and few currencies have been left unscathed: countries with big current account deficits have taken a beating, the offshore yuan had slid to a 19-month low, while the euro, sterling and Australian dollar are all at their weakest levels in more than a year.The Fed's interest rate hikes and buoyant U.S. economy have boosted the greenback, at the same time inflicting increasing damage on emerging markets. As the Bank for International Settlements said last month: \"When the dollar is weak, there tends to be greater appetite for risk, but a stronger dollar often goes hand in hand with the reversal of risk attitudes.\"President Trump took to Twitter this week to proclaim that money \"is pouring into our cherished DOLLAR like rarely before.\" There may be more upside ahead.The days of #Euroboom seem far behind us, with trade wars, a weakened Angela Merkel and crisis in Italian politics bringing the Eurozone pessimists out of the woodwork in recent months.What's more, growth appears to have peaked.On the other hand, the euro's slide to $1.13, its weakest in over a year, will be welcomed in the corridors of power in Eurozone capitals and ECB Towers in Frankfurt. Purchasing managers index data, the most up-to-date snapshot of activity, should tell us whether growth is picking up or not.ECB watchers will be paying close attention. Signs of resilience in the Eurozone economy will allow the ECB to go ahead with its gradual withdrawal of stimulus. Signs of weakness, especially against a backdrop of severe emerging market volatility, might make them think twice. ECB President Mario Draghi may share his thoughts on this and more at Jackson Hole. Yes. The consensus says don't take a chance on Brazil. But the long-term Zacks Rank is A here, and we have share trading at near $11. This is the major state oil company of Brazil. Could it be time to bet on a rebound here? This is a major biotech stock. The shares price at $73 each. The long-term Zacks VGM score is D, which is not as scary as it may seem, due to the company's biotech space being so pricey. This may be the time to buy, as the Zacks #1 Rank says the analysts think something is cooking here. This is a semiconductor equipment - wafer fabricator. If the news is so poor for chips, why is this stock on our #1 list this week? Another time to be contrarian may have arrived for the chip research stocks like this. The long-term Zacks VGM score is a solid B at the moment.It is late August and the macro front looks quiet. I would pay attention to U.S. durable goods orders on Friday.The big meeting on Jackson Hole will also kick up its biggest speakers on Friday, too. , Chile's GDP was forecast at 5.2%.

SEMI however sees 11.7% growth this year to $50.8 billion, with the front end growing stronger than the back-end.Wafer fabrication is a process during which a silicon wafer (usually 200mm or 300mm in size) is treated with successive layers of conductive and semiconductive material using stencil-like structures called reticles. After each deposition of material on the surface, the excess material is etched away and the wafer exposed to a light source to implant the design. This is the front end process. The back end process is involved in cutting up the individual die, packaging for protection and use, attaching of electrical leads and sorting.So wafer fab equipment demand is dependent on the level of the demand for semiconductors themselves on the one hand and the level of installed capacity on the other.The last few years have seen the proliferation of smartphones and other consumer electronics gadgets, as well as cloud infrastructure buildouts. With smartphone demand moderating and IoT demand accelerating, both these segments are likely to be the most important drivers of semiconductor demand along with artificial intelligence, HPC and automotive. Communications infrastructure (5G) will jump on the bandwagon soon.As far as installed capacity is concerned, memory manufacturers are likely to remain the biggest spenders although foundries are also expected to remain strong. Technology transitions, an important consideration for equipment purchases are also expected to remain a driver due to the move toward larger wafer sizes (fab upgrades to 300mm, continued demnd for 20mm and development starting for 300mm in 2018-19 according to Technavio), shrinking nodes (10nm and 7nm), memory chip advancements (3D NAND processes are maturing, driving down cost), denser packaging (MEMS) and so forth. Materials research, device complexities, the need for greater manufacturing integration and new applications are other drivers.The  , which is a stock group within the broader  , has outperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector over the past year.So we see that the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 23.0% over the past year, while the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Computer and Technology Sector have rallied 15.6% and 17.9%, respectively.While the industry is small, players like KLA-Tencor, Applied Materials, Lam Research and ASML Holding NV are very important players.The strong run in share prices over the past year have however led to a relatively rich valuation.Since the industry is made up of relatively mature companies, earnings flow is usually steady. So the industry's 1.04X  (PEG) is well below the 1.76X for the S&P 500. At the moment, it also happens to be below the annual high of 1.17X as well as the 1.06X median.Similar is the case when compared to the sector's 1.78X.But it probably makes more sense to value the industry based on sales and book value because this is a highly capital intensive business and success depends on the ability to provide the most advanced equipment and related customer service.The industry currently has a  ratio of 5.48X, which is below the annual high of 7.39X and the median level of 6.39X, suggesting the possibility of some upside. Comparing this with the S&P 500, we see that it is however ahead of its 3.40X (median 3.31X).Comparing the industry to the S&P 500 on the basis of , we see that the industry's 5.48X is ahead of the sector's 3.72X.Comparing the industry to the S&P 500 on the basis of  , we see that the industry's 5.48X is ahead of the sector's 3.72X.Comparing with the S&P 500 on the basis of  , we see that the industry's 9.28X is just short of its annual high of 9.75X but ahead of the median 8.76X. It's also ahead of the S&P 500's 3.94X.It is also ahead of the sector's 4.29X.So while there appears to be some risk based on valuation, there may also be some opportunities as well.With semiconductor demand remaining strong on account of cloud computing, big data, IoT, auto and other mass market adoption, costs coming down for NAND makers (where demand is more elastic) coupled with increased supply from improved yields and foundries racing to meet customer demand amid stiff competition, the demand scenario appears robust.However, the nature of the business necessitates heavy investments on the development of new technology as device complexities increase. The cost of development is so high that customers may at times finance development directly or through an equity purchase (as Intel, Samsung and TSM did in ASML).The above ratio analysis shows that while there could be some risks, there may be some opportunities as well. A quarter-to-quarter analysis is not really meaningful for the industry. At the same time, investors will continue to question whether this group has the potential to perform better than the broader market in the quarters ahead.One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry's prospects for a solid price performance going forward is the industry's earnings outlook. Empirical research shows that earnings outlook for the industry, a reflection of the earnings revisions trend for the constituent companies, has a direct bearing on its stock market performance.The Price & Consensus chart for the industry shows the market's evolving bottom-up earnings expectations for the industry and the industry's aggregate stock market performance. The red line in the chart represents the Zacks measure of consensus earnings expectations for 2019, while the light blue line represents the same for 2018.This becomes even clearer by focusing on the aggregate bottom-up EPS revisions trend. The chart below shows the evolution of aggregate consensus expectations for 2018.Please note that the $1.61 'EPS' estimate for the industry for 2018 is not the actual bottom-up dollar EPS estimate for every company in the Zacks WFE industry, but rather an illustrative aggregate number created by our proprietary analytics model. The key factor to keep in mind is not the dollar earnings of $1.61 'per share' of the industry for 2018, but how this dollar number has evolved recently.The group's  , which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued outperformance in the near term.The Zacks WFE industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #37, which places it at the top 14% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Our proprietary Heat Map shows significant fluctuation but ultimate improvement in the industry's rank over the past five weeks.While near-term issues could bring varying results to investors, the estimated long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth for the Zacks WFE segment is attractive. Despite correction over the past year, the group's mean estimated long-term EPS growth rate of 14.88% compares favorably with the 9.82% for the Zacks S&P 500 composite.The long-term growth is a continuation of strong performance over the past few years. Take revenue for example, which has gained momentum since 2016.The net income before non-recurring items tells the same story.While the debt level spiked in the beginning of 2017, the debt cap remains reasonable.As evident, the market is expected to get a bit worse before it gets better, as in all cyclical industries that go through periods of relative weakness. But underlying drivers are extremely strong, so for investors looking to invest for the longer term will make attractive gains.Here's a list of stocks that display the above characteristics- (KLAC): The stock has gained 27.4% over the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year EPS is up 4.7% in the last 30 days. (AMAT): The stock has gained 11.2% over the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year EPS is down 3 cents in the last 60 days, of which the decline in the last 30 days was a cent. (ASML): The stock has gained 34.7% over the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year EPS is up a couple of cents in the last 60 days.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6% and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The benchmark S&P 500 index - generally used by market participants as the barometer of the broad market movement - was up for fifth straight week.Robust U.S. economy, strong labor market, solid consumer and business spending along with government's deregulation policies is likely to pave the way for further upside. Massive tax cut and fiscal stimulus will act as catalysts. Consequently, investment in S&P 500 stocks, which provided significant return in the last one month with favorable Zacks Rank and have further upside potential, will be a prudent move.In the last five weeks, the S&P 500 gained 1.5%, 1.5%, 0.1%, 0.6% and 0.8%, respectively. This marks the broad-market index's longest weekly winning streak so far this year. Year to date, the S&P 500 is up 6.2%.This indicates that the U.S. stock markets momentum remained largely unhindered in spite of recent volatility, signaling a recovery for Wall Street in the second half of 2018.U.S. GDP grew at 4.1% in the second-quarter of 2018, marking its highest gain since the third quarter of 2014 and the third-best growth rate since the Great Recession of 2008-2009.In the second-quarter, consumer spending increased 4%, business investment grew 7.3% and government spending rose 3.5%. Notably, first-quarter 2018 GDP growth rate was revised to 2.2% from 2% reported earlier.On Aug 3, the Labor Department reported that the U.S. non-firm job addition increased by 157,000 for the month of July. Moreover, data for May and June were revised upwards to add 59,000 more jobs in the economy.Unemployment rate in July fell 0.1% from June to 3.9%, its lowest level in nearly 50 years. Average hourly earnings increased by 0.3% to 2.7% over the same period a year ago, reducing investor's fear of a hyper-inflation.U.S. corporates have so far posted robust results for second-quarter 2018, maintaining the terrific earnings momentum which has begun since the first-quarter 2018.Notably, in the second-quarter, total earnings of S&P 500 companies are expected to be up 23.9% from the same period last year on 9.3% higher revenues.

Some of the classic dividend stocks look pretty weak from an investing perspective. For example,  (NYSE:  ) has a very cautious Hold analyst consensus. So does  (NYSE:  ) and  (NYSE:  ). If you are going down the dividend route, you may as well find stocks which are performing well, regardless of the dividend - stocks where the price is set to rise. This gives you the flexibility to sell at a profit if you decide to cash in sooner rather than later.That's why all five of the dividend stocks covered here boast a \"strong buy\" rating from the Street's best analysts. With these stocks, you can enjoy long-term dividend returns, but without compromising on stock quality.The analyst consensus is based on ratings from the last three months. I also focus on the consensus from only the top-performing analysts. This is according to analyst ranking service TipRanks. I use their  to find \"strong buy\" dividend stocks with upside potential of over 10% according to top analysts.So what makes these stocks so attractive? Let's take a closer look:\u2022 Dividend Aristocrat with 32 years dividend growth\u2022 $4.48 annualized payout, paid quarterly\u2022 3.6% dividend yield vs 2.3% sector average (NYSE:  ) is now the best-performing oil producer in the  . The company has just announced an impressive $3 billion stock buyback. The news sent shares up even though reported earnings of $3.41 billion missed the $3.94 billion consensus.Most encouragingly, Chevron's CEO Pat Yarrington said the buyback isn't a one-off. She let slip on the  that further buybacks could be on the way. \"We do want this to be a sustainable element here,\" she told analysts. \"There might be a bit of conservatism in here in how we started.\"Plus Chevron delivered strong growth in the lucrative Permian basin. Well production in the region is now up by over 50% year-to-date. And analysts noted that the earnings miss was due to a slight expense increase that shouldn't happen again.Indeed the outlook from the Street is extremely bullish. Six best-performing analysts have rated CVX a buy in the last three months. That means no hold or sell ratings, and a \"strong buy\" consensus. Meanwhile their average price target of $147 indicates 18% upside potential.  .\u2022 8 years dividend growth\u2022 $3 annualized payout, paid quarterly\u2022 2.5% dividend yield vs 1.1% sector averageSemiconductor equipment provider  (NASDAQ:  ) is up 10% in just five days. Shares are surging on earning results that beat Street expectations across the board. Revenue of $1.07 billion revealed a 14% year-over-year gain.

Back in February the company announced its biggest-ever dividend increase of 27%, to 75 cents per share per quarter.\"The move is an even more impressive reflection on mgmt's outlook for fundamental strength sustainability, since action does not appear to preclude a meaningful share repurchase\" cheered top B.Riley FBR analyst Craig Ellis (  ) at the time.He believes the move still \"leaves abundant wiggle room for substantial increases in early 2019.\" Ellis has just reiterated his \"buy\"rating on the stock with a $145 price target (24% upside potential).Overall, this \"strong buy\" stock has received five recent buy ratings, with only one top analyst remaining sidelined.

The stock suffered on the rapid decline of its key hepatitis franchise. But the tide is shifting. With newly approved HIV medicine Biktarvy, Gilead is becoming investable again. Indeed, its Best Analyst Consensus has just shifted from \"moderate buy\" to \"strong buy.\"Five-star RBC Capital analyst Brian Abrahams (  ) has just reiterated his GILD buy rating. This is with a $90 price target (16% upside potential). \"We believe Biktarvy's strong profile and robust launch, along with favorable demographic and pricing dynamics, will underpin good HIV franchise sustainability through 2025\" says Abrahams. And \"with nearer-term competitive threats overblown; we expect this to maintain a strong foundation for GILD's valuation.\"Plus even though it's a relative dividend newbie (its dividend started in 2015), GILD has demonstrated a strong commitment to raising payouts.

VLO's 2Q18 $2.15 EPS represented a whopping 8% beat to consensus. The beat was driven by 1) higher refining margins and 2) higher throughput.The best part for dividend investors: VLO reiterated its shareholder return policy with a targeted annual payout ratio of 40%-50%. VLO believes this represents the right balance of shareholder returns and cash to invest back.Five-star RBC Capital analyst Brad Heffern (  ) gives VLO his seal of approval. He writes: \"We like Valero Energy for its position at the bottom of the global refining cost curve and its significant leverage to the U.S. Gulf Coast refining market.\" Plus \"VLO has a very strong program to return capital to shareholders, with $8+ billion returned in 2015-17.\"Hefferen reiterated his \"buy\" rating on July 27 with a $131 price target.

But when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.KLA-Tencor (KLAC) is headquartered in Milpitas, and is in the Computer and Technology sector. The stock has seen a price change of 11.08% since the start of the year. The maker of equipment for manufacturing semiconductors is paying out a dividend of $0.75 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 2.57% compared to the Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication industry's yield of 1.66% and the S&P 500's yield of 1.78%.In terms of dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $3 is up 19% from last year. KLA-Tencor has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis over the last 5 years for an average annual increase of 7.54%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. KLA-Tencor's current payout ratio is 32%. This means it paid out 32% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, KLAC expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 is $9.28 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 16%.From greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. However, not all companies offer a quarterly payout.For instance, it's a rare occurrence when a tech start-up or big growth business offers their shareholders a dividend. It's more common to see larger companies with more established profits give out dividends. Income investors have to be mindful of the fact that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle during periods of rising interest rates. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that KLAC is not only an attractive dividend play, but also represents a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The semiconductor packaging equipment specialist is valued at just $1.65 billion, and it recorded just $809 million of revenue last year. That's a much smaller number than those posted by semiconductor equipment giants like  (NASDAQ: AMAT) ,  (NASDAQ: KLAC) , and  (NASDAQ: LRCX) .I've owned shares of Kulicke and Soffa for a few years, in part because  , and in part because of a rock-solid balance sheet. At the end of the latest quarter, Kulicke and Soffa had $628 million of cash and investments and no debt, despite ongoing share buybacks.The company is now getting more serious about returning some of that cash to shareholders. Kulicke and Soffa announced an expansion of its capital return program earlier this month, initiating a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share. That puts the dividend yield at about 1.96%.Image source: Getty Images.The semiconductor equipment industry is cyclical, and Kulicke and Soffa's revenue and profits can swing up and down depending on demand. In fiscal 2017, for example, Kulicke and Soffa posted a net income of $126 million, up from just $48 million in 2016.But the company believes these swings will moderate in the future, thanks in part to diversification into product areas beyond the core wire bonding business. \"The Company's diversification and growth has reduced volatility and increased earnings quality, enhancing our confidence as we look ahead. Our strong balance sheet, product positioning, ongoing development programs and M&A pipeline are anticipated to create additional growth opportunities into the future,\" said CEO Fusen Chen in the press release announcing the dividend.When Kulicke and Soffa does face a bad year or two down the line, the balance sheet provides a giant cash cushion that will allow the company to keep paying the dividend. Based on the current share count, the dividend will eat up just $34 million each year. In the past 10 years, there have been only two years where the company's free cash flow was less than this new dividend payment: 2008 and 2009.Kulicke and Soffa doesn't sport the highest dividend yield among its peers, but a low payout ratio and a strong balance sheet make a dividend cut unlikely. Here's how the dividend compares to a few other semiconductor equipment dividends:\n  \nDividend yield based on most recently announced dividend. Payout ratio based on fiscal 2017 net income. Date source: Morningstar.In an industry where profits can fluctuate quite a bit from year to year, keeping the payout ratio low when times are good makes a dividend cut less likely when times are bad.Shares of Kulicke and Soffa have just about doubled over the past three years, but the stock is still attractively priced. If you back out the cash on the balance sheet, shares trade for just over 8 times 2017 earnings.Because Kulicke and Soffa's earnings fluctuate, this ratio is a little deceptive. Realistically, the company's average earnings going forward will probably be lower than its earnings last year, given that 2017 was the most profitable year Kulicke and Soffa had seen since 2012. But even based on its average earnings over the past five years, the company's P/E ratio is still just 14.7 after backing out the cash.With the initiation of a dividend, Kulicke and Soffa is now a solid dividend stock trading at a reasonable price. Growth won't come in a straight line, given the cyclical nature of the industry, but there's a lot to like for patient investors.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the KLAC options chain for the new August 17th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $100.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.20. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $100.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $96.80 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of KLAC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $104.35/share today.Because the $100.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

If an investor was to purchase shares of KLAC stock at the current price level of $104.35/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $105.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.22% if the stock gets called away at the August 17th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if KLAC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for KLA-Tencor Corp, as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing KLAC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $105.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $105.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

Edwin Mok to \"hold\" from \"buy\".This downgrade comes on the heels of lower customer spending on foundry products and memory pushouts. Moreover, KLA's customer concentration poses a serious threat to its shipment growth.Following this announcement, the company's share price declined 3.4% at market close on Jun 22.Coming to the price performance over the past 12 months, shares of KLA have returned 10.9%, outperforming the  's rally of 30.9%.Per the analyst, the ongoing sluggish trend in customers' investments on 7 nanometer (NM) and 5 NM foundry products is likely to persist throughout the second half of 2018. This poses a serious threat to the KLA's shipments.Further, Samsung, one of the most important customers of KLA, has decided to postpone some of its 10 NM DRAM production and related equipment purchases. Notably, Samsung has accounted for more than 10% of KLA's total revenues for three consecutive years since fiscal 2015.This is likely to impact the demand for KLA's wafer equipments adversely. Its shipments in the third-quarter of calendar year 2018 will be hurt, which will further hinder the company from meeting its shipment expectations.Further, fall in wafer demand from major customers will hurt the fundamentals and profitability of the company. Consequently, restricted number of customers remains a major issue.Moreover, this decision of Samsung has resulted in share price declines of Lam Research  and Applied Materials  .Further, the recent trend of transition from 2D NAND to 3D NAND remains negative for wafer demand since the latter requires less wafer and provides higher density.Despite of the cyclicality in consumer investment pattern and major transitions in the semiconductor industry, KLA managed to perform well in the third-quarter fiscal 2018.KLA reported revenues of $1.02 billion which improved 5% year over year. Product revenues came in $797.8 million, accounting for 78% of revenues. This can primarily be attributed to increased investments from memory and logic customers for next generation technology as well as capacity-related investments.Additionally, shipments were $1.041 billion, which went beyond the guidance of $945 million to $1.025 billion. Memory, foundry and logic contributed 78%, 13% and 9%, respectively.Moreover, we remain optimistic about the company's positive outlook for fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 in which the company expects revenues between $1.02 billion and $1.08 billion, and shipments in the range of $1.01-1.09 billion.Memory shipments are anticipated in the range of 60-70% of the total shipments, foundry is likely to account for 24% while logic is expected to account for 8% o the shipments. Further, in foundry segment, KLA expects orders for the first wave of investment in 5 NM in the second half of 2018.Consequently, the positive business outlook, strong fundamentals and continued momentum in China are likely to aid the stock rebound in the upcoming quarters. | Currently, KLA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock that can be considered in the broader technology sector is Micron Technology  , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

KLA-Tencor Corp (Symbol: KLAC) presently has an excellent rank, in the top 25% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most \"interesting\" ideas that merit further research by investors.But making KLA-Tencor Corp an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Monday, shares of KLAC entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $103.09 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100.

In the case of KLA-Tencor Corp, the RSI reading has hit 29.6 - by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by  currently has an average RSI of 51.1. A falling stock price - all else being equal - creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, KLAC's recent annualized dividend of 3/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 2.82% based upon the recent $106.56 share price.A bullish investor could look at KLAC's 29.6 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the December put at the $92.50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $2.60. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.8% return against the $92.50 commitment, or a 5.6% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to KLAC's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $92.50 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless KLA-Tencor Corp sees its shares decline 15.7% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $89.90 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $2.60 from $92.50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 5.6% annualized rate of return.Interestingly, that annualized 5.6% figure actually exceeds the 2.7% annualized dividend paid by KLA-Tencor Corp by 2.9%, based on the current share price of $109.71. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 15.69% to reach the $92.50 strike price.Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of KLA-Tencor Corp, looking at the dividend history chart for KLAC below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2.7% annualized dividend yield.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for KLA-Tencor Corp, and highlighting in green where the $92.50 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the December put at the $92.50 strike for the 5.6% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for KLA-Tencor Corp (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $109.71) to be 31%.

In other words, if we look at the number of call buyers and then use the long-term median to project the number of put buyers we'd expect to see, we're actually seeing more put buyers than expected out there in  so far today.  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["t has been about a month since the last earnings report for  .

The figure was also better than the consensus estimate of $211 million.Last month, the company agreed to acquire Orbotech, Limited. The deal will allow KLA to be a diversified technology leader in process and yield management solutions and services.Management expects overall process control intensity to grow this year, driven by the expanding value of inspection and measurement in addressing critical customer problems and semiconductor industry expansion in China.KLA's shares have returned 2.7% in the past 12 months, underperforming the 29.8% rally of the industry.Shipments in the fiscal third quarter were $1.041 billion, down 3% sequentially and within the guidance of $945 million to $1.025 billion.Memory accounted for 78% (in line with guidance) of fiscal third quarter shipments, 13% of foundry customers and 9% of logic.In terms of end market, Wafer Inspection, Patterning (includes shipments from reticle inspection business), Service and Non semi (includes back-end component inspection business) contributed 45%, 29%, 22% and 4% of shipments, respectively.KLA continues to experience strong growth for its Wafer Inspection solutions. Management stated that new capacity addition by Wafer manufacturers and adoption of more complex architectures by IC customers are driving demand for new bare wafer products. These are needed to support more stringent wafer flatness and process tool cleanliness specifications in advanced technologies.The company witnessed strong growth in China. Management said that China was strong in terms of both process control adoption and market share gains.Also, orders from native Chinese customers remained solid and this momentum is expected to continue in 2018.KLA's gross margin expanded 150 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 63.9% and came in above the guided range of 63.5-64.5%.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Sunday said that the U.S.-China trade conflict has been put on hold.This certainly is good news for U.S. tech companies, particularly chipmakers, which have been reeling under pressure since the two countries sparked fears of a trade war by imposing tariffs and counter tariffs on imports from the two countries.U.S. tech companies generate an estimated more than $100 billion in revenues from China annually. Understandably, the tech sector stands to suffer the most, as the trade war has increasingly focused on technology and intellectual property rights.However, both countries are now initiating talks and making efforts to pull back from an undesired trade war. Given this scenario U.S. chipmakers stand to gain the most. So, it makes good sense to invest in semiconductor stocks.President Donald Trump in late March announced that the United States would be imposing tariffs on Chinese imports worth $150 billion for alleged violation of intellectual property rights. Consequently, China too announced retaliatory tariffs.However, both countries since then have cooled down on their stance and are now negotiating to avoid a much-feared trade war. On May 20, Mnuchin said, \"We are putting the trade war on hold.\"This certainly will bring a sigh of relief for U.S. tech companies, as tech companies stand to suffer the most if trade war takes place. U.S. tech companies generate an estimated $100-$150 billion in revenues annually from China, with  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) alone generating $105.5 billion from China.Other companies like  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) too make a significant portion of their revenues from China.U.S. tech companies have been reeling under fears of a trade war for quite some time now, which saw their shares taking a hit. However, now that both the United States and China are working on a possible solution to avoid a trade war, it definitely will boost the morale of tech companies.Tech companies undoubtedly will be one of the biggest gainers if a trade war is avoided. From large caps to medium and small caps, a number of U.S. tech companies have operations in China. Naturally, companies who have their assembly plants in China stand to gain the most if the trade negotiations fall into place.Also, the Commerce Department last month imposed a ban on American companies from selling components to Chinese company ZTE for seven years, accusing it of misleading U.S. regulators after it settled charges last year of violating sanctions against North Korea and Iran.While this made the company announce that it was ceasing operations, the ban can also have an adverse affect on American chipmakers, as an export ban would definitely hurt the revenues of U.S. chipmakers. However, with Trump tweeting on Sunday that he is working with Chinese president Xi Jinping to get ZTE back into business, U.S. chipmakers have ample reasons to party.It goes without saying that after suffering over the last couple of months as a result of huge selloffs owing to fears of a trade war, U.S. chip stocks will stand to gain from a mutual agreement between Trump and Xi Jinping. While we wait for an amicable solution through negotiations, let'sadd tech stocks for quick gains.Now, picking winning stocks may be difficult.

Similarly, investors should look for EEX to open 0.38% lower in price and for KLAC to open 0.68% lower, all else being equal.Below are dividend history charts for HTH, EEX, and KLAC, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared. : : :In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time.

Hence, demand for NVIDIA's chips will remain unaffected, in our opinion. Moreover, this March, the company unveiled the Constellation driving simulator which enables companies to test self-driving systems in a virtual environment.Although NVIDIA doesn't expect the new simulator to fully replace real-world testing of self-driving cars, the number of trials will likely come down, significantly. We believe the latest simulator will enhance NVIDIA's competitive position in the self-driving car market space, particularly against chip makers, like Intel and Advance Micro Devices.Furthermore, although NVIDIA predicts a slowdown in crypto-specific GPUs revenues in the near term, we believe this will be immaterial to its financials. The company foresees demand for its GPUs to shift from miners to gamers, going forward, which will boost the gaming business revenues and offset loss of revenues from miners.NVIDIA, which flaunts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the preceding four quarters, the average positive surprise being 40.1%. The company witnessed sharp upward estimate revision over the past 7 days. The EPS estimate for the current quarter increased 5.4% (9 cents) to $1.77 per share, during the same time frame, and reflects year-over-year growth of more than 75%.Of course, NVIDIA is our first choice in the semiconductor industry, however that does not mean the list ends here as several companies in the space are likely to benefit from the rising demand for chips.The semiconductor industry has been benefiting from the rising demand for chips used in cloud-based platforms, Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, Augmented/Virtual (AR/VR) reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS), as well as Internet of Things (IoT) related software and hardware.Notably, according to the latest report of World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS), semiconductor revenues climbed 20.6% year over year to $408.7 billion in 2017. It is believed the semiconductor industry will continue to witness growth this year as well, although not as high as 2017, but still at a respectable rate. Per the WSTS report, semiconductor revenues are likely to touch $437.3 billion in 2018, marking 7.7% growth.Additionally, the U.S. chip-equipment makers' earnings and cash flow are likely to get further boost from President Trump's business-friendly tax-cut policies. The tax reform will make semiconductors repatriate significant amount of cash held abroad and eventually drive after-tax earnings. Chip makers can also use this extra cash for research and development, and mergers & acquisition activities.Therefore, it is wise for investors to have some semiconductor stocks in their portfolio which have potentials to provide better returns. takes the second position in our list after NVIDIA. Micron has turned out to be one of the best performers in the semiconductor industry, in the year so far. The company's shares have appreciated nearly 31.3% during the period, a much better performance than the S&P 500, iShares PHLX Semiconductor and Technology Select Sector SPDR ETFs.This outperformance can be primarily attributed to Micron's robust revenue and earnings growth, as well as expanding margins. We note that the company posted positive earnings surprise of 8% in the past four quarters.We believe the company will continue its splendid growth performance in the quarters ahead. The optimism surrounding the stock comes from the fact that the DRAM market is still witnessing a huge demand-supply gap which has been escalating prices.It should also be noted that as Micron generates nearly 70% of its revenues by selling DRAM products, the company is the biggest beneficiary of this supply shortage. In the last reported quarter, sales from DRAM products witnessed a massive 76% year-over-year increase.Micron, which has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), has also witnessed significant earnings estimate revision in the past 60 days. The EPS estimate for the current quarter moved up 3% (8 cents) to $2.84 per share during the same period.Our next pick is  . The company is anticipated to benefit from the improving WFE market, elevated demand for server DRAM and increased adoption rates of 3D NAND technology in the near future. This is driven by cloud computing, big data, mobile devices and IoT. The company has undertaken cost-reduction activities, and density scaling for 3D NAND and new memory technologies.The company, which sports a Zacks Rank of 1, outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the past four quarters, coming up with an average positive surprise of 9.1%. The EPS estimate for the current quarter moved up 8.9% (41 cents) to $5.00 per share, in the last 30 days. The stock has ascended 9.8% in the year-to-date period. You can see  .The next stock in our list is  . KLA-Tencor is likely to benefit from an expanding product portfolio. Furthermore, the technical complexity of manufacturing semiconductors and increasingly challenging yield issues are anticipated to drive growth for the company's process control and yield-management solutions.KLA-Tencor's shares have gained 6%, in the year so far. The company, which sports a Zacks Rank of 1, outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate, over the past four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 7.5%.

For the First Trust NASDAQ-100-Technology Sector Index Fund ETF (Symbol: QTEC), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $86.55 per unit.With QTEC trading at a recent price near $78.61 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.10% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of QTEC's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Western Digital Corp (Symbol: WDC), KLA-Tencor Corp (Symbol: KLAC), and Microchip Technology Inc (Symbol: MCHP). Although WDC has traded at a recent price of $78.45/share, the average analyst target is 47.86% higher at $116.00/share. Similarly, KLAC has 26.41% upside from the recent share price of $109.17 if the average analyst target price of $138.00/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting MCHP to reach a target price of $112.45/share, which is 22.42% above the recent price of $91.86. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of WDC, KLAC, and MCHP:Combined, WDC, KLAC, and MCHP represent 7.43% of the First Trust NASDAQ-100-Technology Sector Index Fund ETF. Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:\n  \nAre analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on  ,  ,  .Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:The retail sector has slowly found its footing in the wake of the e-commerce revolution, and just as investors were ready to declare the death of brick-and-mortar as we knew it, plenty of great stocks emerged from the special retail industry. For example,  is an option that every investor should be aware of right now.Urban Outfitters is a specialty retailer and wholesaler offering a variety of lifestyle merchandise to highly defined customer niches through Urban Retail stores in the United States, Canada, and Europe; an Urban Outfitters website; Anthropologie retail stores in the United States; and Free People, the company's wholesale division.New store openings, increasing digital penetration, merchandising improvements, and international expansion have set Urban Outfitters up for success in the long term, and an improving earnings outlook and attractive valuation metrics make this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) a stock to consider right now.Analysts have become increasingly bullish on URBN recently. Within the past 60 days, the company has witnessed nine revisions to its current-quarter EPS estimates and 12 to its full-year EPS estimates, with 100% agreement to the upside. Urban Outfitters is now expected to post earnings growth of 36.5% in its current fiscal year.This is likely a tailwind effect from the company's latest earnings report, which saw Urban report positive comps at all of its brand while notching its third consecutive positive earnings surprise. Management also noted that it had seen \"positive customer reaction\" to its new spring offerings and was \"optimistic regarding the first half of the year.\"Urban's next earnings report is still about a month away, but things are looking up for the quarter. As mentioned, positive revisions have been pouring in, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved 11 cents higher in just two months. Analysts are now expecting the company to see an EPS improvement of 123.1% from the prior-year quarter. :Amid unpredictable trading and market-wide volatility, investors should do their best to avoid stocks with questionable outlooks and stretched valuations. One such example is  , which currently sports a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and a \"D\" grade for Value in our Style Scores system.Credit Suisse offers investment products, private banking and financial advisory services, as well as insurance and pension solutions. The company is wrapping up a multi-year restructuring and might finally be able to see hope on the horizon, but its stock will likely remain anything but smooth in the coming weeks and months.Credit Suisse reported its latest quarterly earnings results on April 25, posting EPS of $0.31 and revenue of $5.94 billion. Earnings were flat on a year-over-year basis, while revenue was able to move about 7.8% higher.Some investors thought this marginal improvement might be enough to get the stock going, but shares are actually down about 2.5% since the company's report date. The stock has now lost more than 17% since reaching a new 52-week high in January.Part of this decline is likely due to its sluggish earnings estimate revision picture. Analysts have revised EPS downward recently, with the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Credit Suisse's full-year earnings dropping 13 cents in the past month alone.Adding to the concern here is that CS still looks largely overvalued. The stock's P/E of 13.0 might look attractive to value investors, but it is actually a noticeable premium to the average of 11.3 displayed by our \"Banks - Foreign\" group right now. Meanwhile, Credit Suisse is generating just $0.91 per share in cash, with cash flow growth heading in the wrong direction.There are a number of questions lingering around the global markets, and with many investors choosing to sit things out entirely right now, there is simply no need to buy an overvalued foreign bank in the midst of a restructuring that has struggled to generate.One highlight in the May 2018 Zacks Market strategy report is the sudden dominance of Industrial spending.The Industrial Products sector is currently placed at the top 6% out of the 16 Zacks sectors. It is one of the sectors expected to record double-digit earnings growth, mainly driven by U.S. tax reform. According to our latest projections, the sector is anticipated to log an earnings growth rate of +25.8% in the first-quarter of 2018, on the back of a +12.8% rise in revenues.Earlier this year, an Equipment Leasing and Finance Foundation report focused on the $1T equipment leasing and finance industry. It highlighted the breaking trends.Investment in equipment and software is projected to expand +9.1% in 2018.That 2018 investment growth projection is well above the +5.2% growth rate experienced in 2017.It continued a strong improvement trajectory seen over the last 12 months.While a few headwinds persist, they should be outweighed by an encouraging business investment climate.In addition, an upbeat outlook for industrial companies - such as defense contractors, building products and machine makers - is a bet on continuing global economic revival.Stronger growth around the globe means companies spend more on new machinery, see increased cargo demand on railroads, and profit from an increased pace of automation.Internally, U.S. corporations must spend more to replace aging equipment and tech systems. The age of equipment in the U.S. remains at all-time highs and desperately needs to be replaced. This so-called \"upgrade\" cycle is creating a boom for industrial companies.What about the money to finance the spending? It comes from the new lower 21% corporate profit tax - that stronger U.S. and global economy - and an internal change in U.S. tax rules. This change will allow companies to take a deduction for the full value of new plant and equipment upon purchase, rather than stringing it out over a number of years.Every four years, the American Society of Civil Engineers issues a report card\u00a0on the condition of the nation's infrastructure. In 2013, the country received a sad D+. The 2017 report card was no better\u00a0- another D+.Clearly, the need for a U.S. infrastructure overhaul had been there.

Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. KLA-Tencor Corp (Symbol: KLAC) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of KLA-Tencor Corp, looking at the history chart for KLAC below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.

The analyst team, led by Timothy Arcuri, are apparently bearish on Micron due to \"cyclical memory concerns and big estimate cuts.\"Arcuri argued that Micron's supply chain has struggled to keep inventory growth on pace with revenue expansion over the four quarters, a phenomenon which has helped create a \"very favorable cyclical backdrop\" for the semiconductor business. However, the analyst feels this factor is rapidly waning and will soon become a headwind.UBS also assigned a sell rating to chip behemoth Texas Instruments  . Meanwhile, the firm initiated coverage of three semiconductor plays-Broadcom  , Marvel Technology  , and KLA-Tencor  -with buy ratings.Arcuri's concern that cyclical trends could eventually become headwinds is one that frequently looms above the semiconductor industry. Decades of progress in personal, business, and mobile computing have allowed analysts and investors to pick up on recurring factors that both drive growth and cause pullbacks.However, those that are bullish on Micron believe that new secular trends are enough to outweigh these cyclical factors, and company management is working to shift the rhetoric by painting a new picture of its business.\"The dealer market today is very different from the PC-dominated market of the past,\" said Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra in the company's latest earnings report. \"More specifically, memory is making possible applications such as AI and VR, and enabling new cloud-based business models which deliver a fundamental value far in excess of a price per bit.\"Memory remains a heavily-commoditized segment of the technology sector, thanks in large part to cyclical trends like those mentioned by Arcuri. But for those that believe in the power of these new secular trends, this means that Micron is trading at extremely attractive valuation levels.For instance, MU is currently sporting a Forward P/E of just 5.2, which comes in at a significant discount to the average of 18.8 displayed by our broader \"Computer and Technology\" sector. Micron is also sporting an \"A\" grade for Value in our Style Scores system.It is also worth noting that, despite Arcuri's bearish sentiment, analysts have been largely optimistic about Micron over the past month. In fact, the company has witnessed nine positive revisions to its full-year EPS estimates within the last 30 days, lifting its Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.48.

(  ) to diversify its core business. Its acquisition price stands at about $69 per share through a combination of cash and stock. Our valuation dashboard suggests that KLA-Tencor is offering an attractive price, but given the growth potential of Orbotech and the likelihood of realizing synergies, the deal seems fair. To understand its valuation better, we have created an  that shows how changes in its segment revenues, margins, and P/E multiple can impact Orbotech's valuation.Our price estimate of $68 is based on expected overall revenue of $1 billion in FY 2018 and a P/E multiple of 21.5x. We expect Orbotech's net income margin to improve to 15.3%, from 14.7% in FY 2017, as a result of strong demand from the smartphone, television, & automotive sectors, as well as a lower tax rate. The 15% margin would imply net income of $154 million.We expect Orbotech revenue to grow by nearly 13% to reach $1.01 billion in 2018, driven by strong performance in the PCB, FPD, SD segments. We expect the PCB segment to grow driven by increasing demands for complex and multilayer printed boards from the smartphone and the auto industry, with increased adoption of hybrid and electric vehicles, coupled with additional safety features in driver assistance and autonomous vehicles. Meanwhile, the ongoing shift from LCD to flex OLED in the smartphone and television industry should drive the FPD segment, in addition, the  to supply flex OLED displays will further boost this segment. The increasing functionality of smartphones with the introduction of AR/VR, expanding 4G and emerging 5G wireless infrastructure, and increased adoption of hybrid and electric vehicles will boost the demand for radio frequency (  ) devices, thereby driving growth in the SD segment.Our valuation methodology above suggests that KLA-Tencor is paying a reasonable price for Orbotech, as its counterparts in the U.S., are trading at P/E multiples between 16 and 31.What's behind Trefis?

KLA-Tencor Corp shares are currently trading up about 2.2% on the day. The chart below shows the one year performance of KLAC shares, versus its 200 day moving average:    Looking at the chart above, KLAC's low point in its 52 week range is $87.93 per share, with $123.96 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $105.01.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, KLAC makes up 4.13% of the Semiconductor ETF (Symbol: SMH) which is trading higher by about 1.5% on the day Friday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (NASDAQ:  ) fell more than 5% on Monday after announcing the purchase of  (NASDAQ:  ) for $3.4 billion. KLAC currently stands as the world's leading enhancer of production techniques for the chip industry.In buying out ORBK, it takes control of an Israeli-based peer. More importantly, investors wanting to buy KLAC stock not only gain a more diversified business but also a precious buying opportunity.KLAC will pay $69.02 per share for ORBK stock. ORBK rose as much as 11.5% on the news. However, it gave some of that gain back in Monday trading and trades well below the price that KLAC will pay.With the deal, KLAC acquires a stake in printed circuit boards and flat-panel displays. This will diversify its revenue sources as well as remove one competitor. In the announcement, KLAC's CEO Rick Wallace, said the deal fit company goals to \"pursue sustained, profitable growth while expanding into adjacent markets.\"The company also expects that the two companies operating as one will yield a cost savings of $50 million over two years. Interestingly, Orbotech became a leader in LCD flat-panel displays after  from KLA-Tencor in 1999.Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised the deal, calling it \"good news for the hi-tech sector and the Israeli economy.\"No comment yet from the Trump administration, which has recently blocked mergers in other industries. In fact,  (NASDAQ:  ) canceled its planned buyout of KLAC in 2016 over fears antitrust authorities would block the merger.However, LRCX has double the market cap of KLAC. Also, peers such as  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NYSE:  ) and others will compete with KLAC, so analysts don't expect the deal to stoke monopoly fears.Moreover, by announcing this merger, the company created a buying opportunity. Along with the purchase of Orbotech, the company will purchase $2 billion worth of KLAC stock back. This will be funded by both cash and new debt issuance.The picture for KLAC stock also continues to improve. The equity has risen by 36% since hitting a 52-week low last August. Last month, it also approved the largest dividend increase in its history. The company raised its quarterly dividend to 75 cents per share, up 27% from the 57 cents per share it paid in the previous quarter. The new dividend will bring the dividend yield to 2.6%.Moreover, profitability is expected to markedly improve for the foreseeable future. After earning $5.88 per share in fiscal 2017, analysts expect profits to rise to a consensus $7.71 per share in fiscal 2018. This will bring the forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio to under 15.Consensus estimates in future years also have earnings growth forecasted at over 10% per year. Moreover, analysts based these estimates on pre-merger information. ORBK is also experiencing profit growth. Hence, profit estimates will likely move higher once the company completes the merger.News of KLA-Tencor's pending buyout of Orbotech not only makes KLAC a more diversified company, it also provides the chance for investors to buy KLAC at a lower price. Merging the two companies will not enhance its chip manufacturing niche. It will also bring the company into the printed circuit board market and return KLAC to the flat-panel display business.Moreover, the short-term selling in KLAC stock caused by the merger gives investors the chance to buy in more cheaply. The stock price fell despite the fact that a buyback will reduce the supply of shares.Stockholders will also benefit from an increased dividend, rising profits and a PE well below the  average. Hence, the merger will not only benefit current shareholders, but new investors as well.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" :Shares of  () are down $3.87, or 3%, at $116.75, after the company  it would purchase fellow chip equipment maker  () for $3.4 billion in cash and stock, or $69.02 per share.

Not all criteria in the below table receive equal weighting or are independent, but the table provides a brief overview of the strong and weak points of the security in the context of the strategy's criteria.\n  \nFor a full detailed analysis using NASDAQ's Guru Analysis tool, Since its inception, Validea's strategy based on John Neff has returned 144.50% vs. 137.76% for the S&P 500. For more details on this strategy,  : While known as the manager with whom many top managers entrusted their own money, Neff was far from the smooth-talking, high-profile Wall Streeter you might expect. He was mild-mannered and low-key, and the same might be said of the Windsor Fund that he managed for more than three decades. In fact, Neff himself described the fund as \"relatively prosaic, dull, [and] conservative.\" There was nothing dull about his results, however. From 1964 to 1995, Neff guided Windsor to a 13.7 percent average annual return, easily outpacing the S&P 500's 10.6 percent return during that time. That 3.1 percentage point difference is huge over time -- a $10,000 investment in Windsor (with dividends reinvested) at the start of Neff's tenure would have ended up as more than $564,000 by the time he retired, more than twice what the same investment in the S&P would have yielded (about $233,000). Considering the length of his tenure, that track record may be the best ever for a manager of such a large fund. : Validea is an investment research service that follows the published strategies of investment legends.

This Silicon Valley giant is one of the top suppliers of equipment to the global semiconductor business, and with the rise in demand for high-end chips throughout the world, AMAT has seen its client activity pick up significantly.In its most recent quarter, Applied Materials witnessed adjusted earnings of $1.06 per share, up 59% from the year-ago period. Total quarterly revenues came in at $4.2 billion, improving more than 28% year over year.It is not often that companies with AMAT's size and legacy see such rapid expansion. And investors have certainly noticed this growth, sending the stock soaring more than 50% over the past year. Still, there appears to be plenty of room left for Applied to run higher.One catalyst for a continued surge could be the company's improving outlook. Within the past 60 days, we have seen seven positive revisions for AMAT's full-year earnings estimates, bringing our Zacks Consensus Estimate a whopping 31 cents higher over that timeframe. We now expect to see the company witness full-year earnings growth of 35%.Even with the stock's recent surge, AMAT's positive outlook makes its forward-looking guidance extremely attractive for value investors. What's more, the stock is also trading at a discount to its most comparable peers.Here's Applied's Forward P/E trend compared to that of its peer group:AMAT's peer group includes ASML Holding  , Lam Research  , KLA-Tencor  , and Advanced Energy Industries  . Not all of these companies are direct competitors to AMAT, but they do function as suppliers to semiconductor manufacturers. Comparing AMAT to these stocks helps us show how investors tend to value this niche market.When we break it down like this, we can really see that AMAT is an interesting value option. However, we should note that the stock is only sporting a \"C\" grade for Value in our Style Scores system. In contrast to its attractive P/E, AMAT's P/S of 4.1 is less appealing than the broader market. Applied might also raise eyebrows from a cash-flow perspective, as it is only generating about $3.69 in cash per share right now-about 40% less than its industry's average.Still, the foundation of AMAT's is only getting stronger right now, and the stock's Forward P/E implies that investors are getting a great price for that strength.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce \"the world's first trillionaires,\" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

(Symbol: KLAC) saw new options begin trading this week, for the April 20th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the KLAC options chain for the new April 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $105.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.10. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $105.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $101.90 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of KLAC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $109.09/share today.Because the $105.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

If an investor was to purchase shares of KLAC stock at the current price level of $109.09/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $110.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.14% if the stock gets called away at the April 20th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if KLAC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for KLA-Tencor Corp., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing KLAC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $110.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $110.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

The industry serves as a driver, enabler and indicator of technological progress.According to the  dated Jan 19, technology is one of the six sectors predicted to report double-digit earnings growth this quarter. Per the report, total earnings for the tech sector are projected to be up 14.3% on 8.7% higher revenues.We note that the technology sector has been a robust performer over the past year. The sector has been benefiting from the increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.We believe the aforementioned emerging trends have provided some much-needed opportunity to semiconductor companies to counter the loss of business due to the declining PC market which still consumes bulk of chips. Notably, according to the latest report of World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS), semiconductor revenues climbed 20.6% year over year to $408.7 billion in 2017.It is believed that the semiconductor industry will continue to witness growth this year as well, although not as high as 2017, but still at a respectable rate. Per the WSTS report, semiconductor revenues are likely to touch $437.3 billion in 2018, representing growth of 7.7%.The industry is poised to benefit from the rising demand from the aforementioned new trends in technologies, deployment push of 5G-broadband technology across the globe and President Trump's pro-business policies, including tax cuts, deregulation and outlays on infrastructure.However, this does not ensure earnings beat for all companies in the space. It should be noted that a company's earnings outperformance is dependent on the overall business environment as well as management's ability to implement operating and strategic plans.In other words, a company may perform dismally despite a favorable business environment if it fails to capitalize on the opportunities due to lack of execution.Let's see what's in store for these semiconductor stocks, all of which are slated to release quarterly figures tomorrow.The world's largest semiconductor company  is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results. We expect this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to post earnings of 86 cents per share and revenues of $16.3 billion. Estimates, when compared with the year-ago quarter figures, represent 8.9% increase for earnings and almost flat growth for revenues. You can see  . | Intel's earnings report will still serve as an important bellwether for the entire technology sector, but the stock has struggled to gain momentum as investors have become increasingly concerned with this chipmaker's competition. Of late, the company has been sensing the pressure from the likes of NVIDIA and Avanced Micro Devices. Nvidia's artificial intelligence processors are already at the forefront of the booming AI industry, while AMD has doubled down on its server chips. And both of these companies compete with Intel in the ever-important gaming segment.However, we anticipate the company's impressive growth at the data-center group segment to cushion its top- and bottom-line results. Increasing demand for data storage and high-performance networks has been propelling this segment's growth. As the number of smartphones and Internet-connected devices escalates, along with the rise of artificial intelligence and cloud computing, Intel's data-center business will expand. (Read:  )Let's take a sneak peek at  , which is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results. We expect KLA's top-line growth to benefit from its expanding product portfolio. The company is well poised to gain from sturdy demand for more efficient manufacturing processes. Moreover, the technical complexity of manufacturing semiconductors and increasingly challenging yield issues are anticipated to steer growth from the company's process control and yield management solutions. (Read:  ) | The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's revenues and earnings are pegged at $960.2 million and $1.72, respectively, for the to-be-reported quarter. Estimates, when compared with the year-ago quarter's figures, indicate growth of 9.5% for revenues and 13.2% for earnings. The stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Lastly,  is another company scheduled to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings numbers. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's revenues and earnings are pegged at $460.1 million and $1.01, respectively, for the quarter under review. Estimates, when compared with the year-ago quarter figures, indicate growth of 5.6% for revenues and 17.4% for earnings. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3. | The company's data-center segment is likely to continue its outperformance in the to-be-reported quarterly results, chiefly driven by the sound adoption of the latest technologies, including AI and HPC. Increasing usage of its smart-controller solutions on Intel's Parley platform is also anticipated to prove conducive to growth. Also, an improving economy and energy markets, continuing semi-cap strength, as well as demand for emerging industrial automation and motor control applications is likely to drive its Industrial market segment revenues. Nonetheless, pockets of weakness related to product transition at medical customers and push-out of some communications spending in China are likely to dent revenues.Another semiconductor company,  , is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's revenues and earnings are pegged at $619.9 million and 64 cents, respectively, for the to-be-reported quarter. Estimates, when compared with the year-ago quarter's figures, indicate growth of 12.5% for revenues and 39.1% for earnings. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). | The company's fiscal second-quarter revenues will likely gain from sturdy demand for its Automotive and Industrial end-products. However, the concentration of Maxim's mobility revenues at Samsung is a big concern. Samsung's projections and announcements, especially those related to its high-end models, where Maxim has greater exposure, might have a significant impact on the company's performance.

(Symbol: KLAC) saw new options become available this week, for the September 21st expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 240 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the KLAC options chain for the new September 21st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $115.00 strike price has a current bid of $10.00. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $115.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $105.00 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of KLAC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $116.19/share today.Because the $115.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 57%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of KLAC stock at the current price level of $116.19/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $120.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 11.03% if the stock gets called away at the September 21st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if KLAC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for KLA-Tencor Corp., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing KLAC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $120.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $120.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the KLAC options chain for the new February 2018 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $110.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.00. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $110.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $106.00 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of KLAC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $111.44/share today.Because the $110.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 57%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of KLAC stock at the current price level of $111.44/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $115.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.98% if the stock gets called away at the February 2018 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if KLAC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for KLA-Tencor Corp., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing KLAC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $115.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $115.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

Those issues come as energy stocks power up, with  (  ) among Thursday's powerful moves into buy zones.[ibd-display-video id=3037595 width=50 float=left autostart=true] S&P 500 futures rose 0.15% vs. fair value. Dow futures were up a fraction. Nasdaq 100 futures were slightly above fair value.Bitcoin futures were falling yet again this week, with CME and Cboe futures tumbling to about $14,100. CME futures opened trading on Sunday evening at $20,650. Several Bitcoin- and blockchain-related stocks were retreating as well. (  ), which surged 183% on Thursday on its decision to change its name from Long Island Iced Tea, was down 31% in premarket action.  (RIOT) lost 12% and  (OSTK) 5.5%.Intel fell 1.7% to 46.76 in Thursday's  , dropping below a 47.40 buy point cleared on Wednesday. Volume was 44% above normal, slightly more than on Wednesday's breakout. However, Intel's action, by itself, is not that concerning or surprising.While you never want to see a stock fall below its entry point, Intel had surged 9.9% over four days in heavy volume from near the bottom of a cup-like base. Breakouts from cup bases without handles are less likely to succeed, because after a big run up, a pullback is natural as weak holders exit. The Dow technology giant could retake that buy point, ideally in robust trade.But other chip action renewed concerns about the broader chip sector.KLA-Tencor fell 3.4% to 108.62, easily dropping below the 110.11 entry crossed on Monday. Volume was below normal, suggesting big institutions weren't dumping shares. Then again, Monday's breakout volume was just OK, 9% above average. You want to see volume at least 40%-50% higher than normal on breakouts.Meanwhile, chip groups were among Thursday's losers with chip equipment down 2%. Few chip-equipment makers are trading above their 50-day lines, with  (ASML),  (AMAT) among those finding resistance there recently. Among chipmakers,  (MU) is still above that support area, but fell 2.9% Thursday. That erased more than half of Micron's 4% pop Wednesday following the memory giant's strong earnings and guidance.Facebook nudged down 0.25% to 177.45 on Thursday, barely undercutting its 50-day line. Since breaking out past a 175.59 buy point in late October, Facebook has made little progress, briefly dropping out of buy range a few weeks ago. Facebook's Relative Strength line has been nudging lower since the start of November, reflecting the FANG stock's underperformance in recent weeks.Facebook rival  (SNAP) sank 0.8% to 15.37 on Thursday. But that completed a handle in its first-ever proper consolidation. That lowers the potential entry slightly to 16.55 from 16.98. Keep in mind that Snap's new base is well below its highs, so the stock could face upside resistance. Also, the Snapchat operator is struggling with user growth and finding a path to profitability in the face of intense Facebook competition.Energy stocks and groups were market leaders for a second straight session. Oil prices are at two-year highs while Trump tax cuts should especially benefit the oil and gas industry.Chevron rose 3.25% to 124.82 on Thursday, retaking a 120.99 entry with volume that was nearly double normal.  (CXO) also broke out on strong volume, while  (EOG),  (BP) and  (RDSA) were among the oil stocks breaking out on less impressive trading.

Tech giants certainly led the way, but a number of indexes soared to new highs, and profits were enjoyed by value, growth, and momentum investors alike.This type of yearly performance means that the holiday season can be even more celebratory. Another great thing about this season is that it opens the door for members of the media to dole out their end-of-year awards.Here at Zacks, we definitely have award-season fever, and looking back on a great 2017, there are a number of great stocks that skyrocketed throughout the year-and sported strong Zacks Ranks for many months.Check out five of our favorite stocks from 2017:From the emergence of artificial intelligence to self-driving cars and bitcoin mining, Nvidia dominated 2017 because of increased demand for its products from a variety of markets. Nvidia spent a staggering 30 weeks as a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) or higher, including 24 weeks as a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Heading into today, the stock was up nearly 80% on the year, and current full-year projections are calling for the company to wrap things up with sales growth of 37% and earnings growth of 63%.2017 was a great year for semiconductor manufacturers, and as logic implies, it was also a great year for the companies that supply equipment to the chipmakers. One such firm is KLA-Tencor. Shares of KLAC have soared about 35% in 2017, and the company is expected to conclude its fiscal year with earnings growth of 23% and sales growth of 14%. During the year, KLAC spent a whopping 39 weeks as a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) or better, including 23 weeks as a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Throughout the year, we saw a renewed interest in Chinese stocks, and one of the highest-flying Chinese stocks of 2017 was TAL Education Group. Shares of this tutoring services company were up more than 150% heading into Tuesday. It was also a year of aggressive top and bottom line expansion for the firm, and full-year estimates are calling for TAL to finish up with earnings growth of 68% and revenue growth of 64%. TAL has spent 10 weeks as a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 16 weeks as a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) this year.2017 has also been packed with encouraging economic news, including low unemployment rates and rising consumer confidence. This helps companies that benefit from discretionary spending, such as RV maker Thor Industries. Shares of Thor have gained about 50% in 2017, and full-year estimates are now calling for sales growth of 14% and earnings growth of 29%. Thor is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has spent 34 weeks as a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) or better.Finally, we have seen several notable low-priced, small-cap stocks have a breakout year. One of our favorites is ZAGG Inc., a designer of protective accessories for consumer electronics. Shares of ZAGG have soared more than 183% so far in 2017. Our current consensus estimates are calling for the company's full-year earnings to grow 234% and revenue to swell 27%. ZAGG has spent 27 weeks as a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) or better, including 20 weeks as a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Full disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

The company's results have been negatively impacted by weak switching and router revenues.

While Apple helped the Nasdaq reach a record close, other Silicon Valley tech stocks continue to hover near the mark. The Cupertino-based iPhone maker reported blowout earnings results, while such an encouraging trend is noticeable for the entire tech sector.Some market pundits believe that tech stocks are riding the years-long economic expansion, while most of them attribute a part of this uptick to Trump administration's pro-business policies including tax cuts, deregulation and outlays on infrastructure.Needless to say, tech stocks are preferred by astute investors due to their proprietary technological expertise and heavy cash balances. These companies also relish high barriers to entry, which position them for faster growth in the market.Given such bullish trends, investing in some rock-solid Silicon Valley stocks for better gains seems judicious.The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite trumped all records on Nov 3. The index registered its 63rd record-closing high of this year that beat the previous record of 62 highs in a calendar year. The index has also outpaced the other major indices so far this year.While the Nasdaq has rallied almost 26% on a year-to-date basis, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones gained nearly 16% and 19%, respectively, over the same period. In fact, the tech-stacked indexes' year-to-date gains are the best since the dot-com boom of the late 1990s.Stellar quarterly results from tech-bigwig Apple helped the Nasdaq scale a record high. The iPhone maker gained 2.6% and flirted with a valuation at $900 billion. The world's most valuable company has soared 48.9% so far this year.Apple's fiscal fourth-quarter sales of $52 billion topped analysts' expectations. Almost half of the sales came from iPhone. Chief Executive Tim Cook declared that iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus sales were the best ever in the company's history. Its service units that comprise iTunes, Apple Music, Apple Pay and Apple Care, to name a few, also raked in record-high revenues.Profits also rose to $10.71 billion, while the executives showed more optimism over the current quarter. They raised the fiscal first-quarter sales guidance from $84 billion to $87 billion. This has ward off fears related to the company's flagship iPhone X production, priced at $1000. This is, incidentally, the most exorbitant iPhone model in the company's history (read more:  ).Apple isn't the only Silicon Valley tech stock moving north this season. Better-than-expected quarterly results from other tech giants like Alphabet (Google) and Microsoft also helped drive the Nasdaq to a record high.Alphabet's third-quarter earnings of $9.57 increased 91% sequentially and 32% year over year. Net revenues of $22.27 billion increased 6.5% sequentially and 21.9% year over year.

To top it, Netflix, Cisco Systems, eBay and NVIDIA continue to hover near record highs as the tech sector displays strength in the third-quarter earnings season.Total earnings for the tech companies' third-quarter earnings so far are up 22.4% from the same period last year on 9.3% higher revenues, with 81.8% beating EPS estimates and 86.4% surpassing revenue estimates (read more:  ).Hopes of pro-business legislation promised by Trump have, mostly, supported the gains among both the manufacturers of the internal technologies - the semiconductor makers and the software industry.As per Statista, corporate taxation rate in the United States is among the worlds' highest. This explains why most of the tech majors stash cash overseas. The proposed tax plan will lower taxes from 35% to 20%. As a result, tech companies' after-tax earnings will improve and will lead to repatriation of trillions of dollars held abroad by such companies. Tech companies can use this extra cash for R&D and M&As.Tech players including Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon have billions of dollars in cash reserves parked abroad. In fact, a  showed that combined overseas cash reserves for such companies exceeded the Japanese government's overall tax revenues in fiscal 2016.Investors, thus, should double down on the hottest Silicon Valley tech stocks after they cross one record after another on earnings strength, primarily, backed by favorable government policy.

This generation is one of the largest in the history of the United States, currently estimated to be 74.1 million in number and accounting for approximately 23% of the country's population. The oldest members are now 72 years old, while the youngest are just about to turn 54.The first baby boomer officially retired in late 2007 and since then, the number has increased to millions over the past decade, as increasing number of baby boomers continue to reach their retirement age. Over the next 15-20 years, the majority of them will have left the workforce.But are they financially strong enough to maintain their lifestyle and meet healthcare costs post retirement?Per Pew Charitable Trusts' latest report, only 13% of working baby boomers are currently covered under pension schemes. This means the majority of retirees will need to plan their retirement on their own, making it the most challenging factor for the boomers.Furthermore, this generation is notably believed to be the most active and wealthiest group of their era. Also, baby boomers were the biggest beneficiary of the 1982-2000 secular bull market, which gave them the opportunity to make plenty of money through aggressive investment in stock markets.Despite this, the generation has not saved enough assets due to the boomers' excessive spending habits and luxurious lifestyle, according to a Paladin Registry report. The report states that about 60% of baby boomers have inadequate assets for post retirement survival.Additionally, the generation is expected to have a longer life span - thanks to the advanced medical science and healthier lifestyles - which again means they need more funds for longer periods. Escalating healthcare costs is another challenge, which boomers have to face with increasing age.Therefore, as the majority of baby boomers are still working, they need to plan their investments to maintain their living standards post retirement.In our opinion, if one has enough assets to maintain existing lifestyle and meet necessary healthcare expenses, it will be wise to play safe and invest in less risky portfolio. However, the majority of this generation does not have this liberty due to lack of adequate savings.Therefore, they need to invest in assets, which can generate solid regular returns with minimum associated risks. Also, the return should cover the investment and inflation costs.Obviously, baby boomers will never get that return by investing in bonds. So, which investment plan has the potential to generate regular returns and provide them the opportunity to accumulate assets for the future as well?Blue chip  boast solid financial structure and healthy underlying fundamentals, and are unperturbed by market turbulence. Such stocks are believed to be safer and more durable than an average stock. Most of these companies consistently raise dividends and are typically large in size as well.The companies' dominating market position, large customer base, sustainable business model, long track of profitability and strong liquidity help them offer outsized payouts or sizable yields on a regular basis, irrespective of the market direction. As a result, these stocks provide greater stability and offer continued income for investors, as well as more scope for capital appreciation.We have, thus, selected four blue chip dividend stocks for baby boomers that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), and have a dividend yield of more than 2%. The search was also narrowed down with a  of A or B. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. All these four stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 index over the past decade.The first stock is one of the world's leading semiconductor companies,  (KLAC), which sports a Zacks Rank of 1, has a VGM Score of B and a dividend yield of 2.2%.Our next pick is also from the tech sector -  (WDC).

For the First Trust NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index Fund ETF (Symbol: QQEW), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $62.64 per unit.With QQEW trading at a recent price near $55.85 per unit, that means that analysts see 12.16% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of QQEW's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are American Airlines Group Inc (Symbol: AAL), Akamai Technologies Inc (Symbol: AKAM), and KLA-Tencor Corp. (Symbol: KLAC). Although AAL has traded at a recent price of $47.36/share, the average analyst target is 18.95% higher at $56.33/share. Similarly, AKAM has 13.85% upside from the recent share price of $52.29 if the average analyst target price of $59.53/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting KLAC to reach a target price of $121.00/share, which is 13.74% above the recent price of $106.38.

But if the rumors are right, the company could pay $70-$80 a share in cash and stock, valuing the company at over a $100 billion, the largest semiconductor deal ever. It's possible that regulators will not approve the deal on competitive considerations, but just in case they don't, there's much going for both the companies-There are a number of reasons why the deal makes sense.First, Qualcomm is one of the largest semiconductor companies, as is Broadcom, so their combination will create a semiconductor giant like Intel or Samsung with greater resources to tap emerging opportunities.Second, being the leading supplier of modem chips having also made some progress in 5G, Qualcomm brings Broadcom important technology to round out its portfolio. Not only that - there is very little product overlap despite the fact that both target the market for mobile devices. Smartphone growth rates have been coming down recently because of increased penetration, but other markets like IoT, self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and cloud computing continue to emerge. A combined company with much greater product breadth, a larger client roster and scope for greater integration of technology should do better in this landscape.Third, Qualcomm has a large number of standard essential patents that it licenses on the basis of fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms. It also has several other patents that do not form part of standards but that it bundles with standard essential patents. So on the one hand, Qualcomm shouldn't have to license all patents at standard essential rates, while on the other, it needs to offer greater clarity on the amount it's charging for the non-standard technology that forms part of the bundle. It also needs to allow companies to build or second source their own non-standard technology.The practice has drawn ire from a number of foreign governments and now, Apple  and its suppliers have ganged up against it. What's worse, Apple is roping in others like Samsung, so Qualcomm's legal problems are mounting. Apple phones use Qualcomm technology, but Apple and its suppliers have also stopped paying Qualcomm on this pretext while second sourcing from Intel.This has of course been a big blow to Qualcomm's revenue and profits. The acquisition has the potential to bring another big semiconductor player on Qualcomm's side. It can also lead to a resolution of the conflict.Fourth, Broadcom management has a lot of experience with acquisitions, which have been the most consistent pillar of growth for the company. The biggest of these was the Avago-Broadcom merger, which retained the Broadcom name post closure. Before that, it made more than 50 smaller acquisitions over the course of a decade. Management is also known for cost control, so the combined entity may see greater fiscal discipline, which could be a good way to extract profits.Fifth, the chances of prolonged litigation have pressured Qualcomm's share prices, so the deal will be a good return on investment for shareholders.Both Qualcomm and Broadcom are in the middle of other acquisitions. Qualcomm is looking to buy NXP, the shareholders of which are asking for a higher price. Broadcom is trying to acquire Brocade  (a much smaller deal). There could be many glitches along the way.The second concern is regulatory. Qualcomm is quite a dominant player in its own field and Broadcom further expands that field. In a way, since they aren't competitors, there may not be anti-competitive concerns. But on the other hand, the two together will be a mobile chip making powerhouse, which may be something regulators will consider.These may be some of the biggest acquisitions we have talked about, but consolidation in the space will likely continue in the foreseeable future because chip development and verification isn't getting any cheaper. Also, companies generally compete on their ability to deliver energy efficient chips that are also more powerful, fast and durable while being cheap. This naturally benefits larger players that can invest heavily in R&D and then manufacture on scale.On the other hand, some of the biggest propositions have been shot down by regulators, such as Applied Materials' attempt to buy Tokyo Electron, or more recently, Lam Research's  attempt to buy KLA-Tencor  .Broadcom has apparently been trying to acquire Qualcomm for some time, but its previous attempts weren't attractive to Qualcomm management. Given its current problems, the company may be more willing to go for it.Broadcom has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) while Qualcomm has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.14%.Let's find out what KLA has to offer investors in this quarter.We expect KLA's top-line growth to benefit from an expanding product portfolio. The company is well poised to gain from strong demand for more efficient manufacturing processes. | Moreover, the technical complexity of manufacturing semiconductors and increasingly challenging yield issues are anticipated to drive growth from in the company's process control and yield management solutions.We believe solid customer demand for products across the four end-markets - Wafer Inspection (50% of shipments), Service (21%), Non-semi (4%) and Patterning (25%) - is anticipated to drive order growth in the quarter.For first-quarter fiscal 2018, KLA expects shipments of $945-$1.025 billion. Foundry and memory shipments are projected to be approximately 42% and 43% of the total shipments, respectively. NAND is anticipated to represent about half of the memory mix.KLA forecasts revenues between $910 million and $970 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $943 million.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the Product segment is currently pegged at $740 million.Services have become a key-growth driver in recent times. Last quarter, services revenues crossed $200 million for the first time in the company's history. The growth was driven by expanded installed base and increasing demand for the upgrade and maintenance of legacy nodes.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the Service is currently pegged at $202 million.Moreover, KLA management expects strong growth in China (18% of shipment in the fourth quarter) to continue in the soon-to-be reported quarter.Moreover, our proven model shows that KLA is likely to beat earnings due to the favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and +1.48%  .

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because KLA-Tencor is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings - with the most up-to-date information possible - is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for KLAC in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.65 per share for KLAC, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.63 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for KLAC, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.48% heading into earnings season. | A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that KLAC has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

The market undervalues these companies and prices them as if their profits are going to significantly decline. The market is missing the structural shifts that will drive profit growth via increased demand and less cyclicality going forward.We recommended four stocks to investors in that initial report. Today we are digging deeper into one of those stocks: KLA-Tencor (  ), the most profitable company in the industry and this week's Long Idea.KLAC operates in the semiconductor process control segment, which is a subset of the semiconductor equipment sector. The company controls  or nearly five times its closest competitor.It's almost impossible to make a case against KLAC based on its current profitability. We analyzed the company's 10-K for fiscal year 2017 (which ran through June 30) on Monday, and the results were impressive. The company has a 54% return on invested capital (  ), which puts in the top 2% of all the companies we cover, and it grew revenue by 17% in 2017.Investors are clearly discounting KLAC's impressive 2017 due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry. Figure 1 shows that this fear has some merit but is likely exaggerated. KLAC's after-tax profits (  ) and margins have been cyclical, but have consistently trended upwards over the past 20 years.Since 2007, a major cyclical peak, KLAC's NOPAT has increased by 7% compounded annually while its NOPAT margin has expanded from 25% in 2007 to 37% over the last 12 months. Over the last five years, KLAC has generated a cumulative $3.7 billion (26% of market cap) in  . Going forward, analysts expect the semiconductor process control market to grow by 11% compounded annually until 2020. No matter where we are in the cycle, the long-term growth trend for KLAC looks strong.In addition to the long-term growth trend, there have been structural shifts in the semiconductor industry over the past few years that should make cycles less volatile going forward. We covered these changes in our original report, but we'll recap them briefly here:This last point is especially crucial for KLAC and other process control management companies. As computers take on more complicated and crucial tasks, the tolerance for error goes to near zero. If a chip in your cellphone malfunctions, that's an inconvenience. If a chip in your car malfunctions, it could cause a fatal accident. That means automotive semiconductors require more sophisticated and rigorous testing, increasing demand for KLAC.As discussed above, KLAC has a dominant market share in the process control industry, and there's nothing to suggest it will lose that position going forward. On top of its market share advantage, KLAC dominates its competitors, which include Nova Measuring Instruments (  ), Applied Materials (  ), and ASML Holdings (  ) in terms of ROIC and NOPAT margin, per Figure 2.Importantly, KLAC's impressive margins don't come at the expense of investing in its future. The company spends ~15% of revenue on research and development, which is right around the industry average.KLAC's superior ROIC and margins should give the company the ability to withstand pricing pressure if competitors try to cut into its market share. Meanwhile, the company's strong free cash flow and $2.9 billion in excess cash give it the resources to invest in new production and strategic acquisitions to maintain its industry position.Aside from the cyclical nature of the industry discussed above, it's hard to find a strong bear case for KLAC. Most major threats to the business would require an unforeseen technological development, such as chipmakers running up against a wall in their efforts to make smaller and more complex chips, or some drastic change to the semiconductor manufacturing process.Aside from these unforeseeable developments, KLAC acknowledges one of the biggest risks in the \"Risk Factors\" section of its 2017 10-K. Among the listed risks is:In short, if one of the companies that provides equipment used in the manufacture and assembly of semiconductors could integrate those products with some of the testing and measuring products that compete with KLAC, that bundle could draw customers away.Lam Research (  ) tried to acquire KLAC last year in a combination that could have led to such integrated products, but the deal was  . Given the antitrust ruling, a firm would have to invest significantly to develop the measuring products in house. At the moment, this risk remains hypothetical, but investors should continue to watch developments in this area.KLAC had been on a year-long tear until it peaked at ~$110/share on June 8. Since then, the stock has pulled back by ~10%, creating a buying opportunity. Investors have a chance to snap up this great company at a bargain price. In fact, the stock is cheap by almost any metric. Its price to economic book value (  ) of 0.8 implies that the market expects a permanent 20% decline in NOPAT. The company also looks cheap on conventional valuation metrics, as it has a P/E of just 17x.As we wrote in our original report, KLAC is valued similarly to its peers in the semiconductor equipment sector based on its ROIC. However, the stock is  , and Figure 3 shows that it trades at a discount to the tech sector as well. ROIC explains 46% of the difference in valuations for companies in the tech sector, and KLAC's enterprise value divided by  (a cleaner version of price to book) is roughly half of what it should be based on the regression analysis below.According to Figure 3, if the market valued KLAC's cash flows on par with the rest of the tech sector, it would have an enterprise value divided by invested capital of 13.95. This valuation would equate to a stock price of $172/share, 74% above its current valuation.As optimistic as that valuation may sound, our DCF model reaffirms $172/share as a plausible valuation for the stock. In order to justify a valuation of $172/share, KLAC must  . As mentioned above, KLAC grew NOPAT by 7% compounded annually over the past decade. Even if investors expect a slowdown in growth, this stock has significant upside.Over the past 12 months, KLAC insiders have acquired 384,000 shares and sold 252,000 for a net addition of 133,000 shares (40% of executive compensation at KLAC comes from short-term cash bonuses tied to operating margin, and 25% comes from long-term share awards tied to free-cash flow margin. These are reasonable metrics as they encourage cost control and discourage wasteful investments. We especially like the fact that KLAC's operating margin calculation still includes stock compensation expense, so executives can't exclude their own compensation when calculating their bonuses.Nonetheless, the company would benefit from tying at least a part of executive compensation to ROIC, as improving ROIC is  . Operating margin is important, but so is capital turnover. Tying long-term bonuses only to free cash flow could at times discourage the investment necessary to maintain market share and grow the business. Fortunately, the lack of focus on ROIC has not led to executives getting paid while destroying shareholder value. Since 2007, economic earnings have grown from $445 million to $907 million in 2017.Even with its impressive profit growth, KLAC has been able to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders. The stock currently has a dividend yield of 2.3%.Due to the uncertainty over the LRCX acquisition, KLAC only repurchased $25 million of stock in 2017, but it repurchased $182 million worth of shares in 2016 and $609 million in 2015. Under its current authorization, KLAC can repurchase up to 5.7 million shares, which at current prices would equate to $521 million.If KLAC were to average 2016 and 2015 repurchase activity ($393 million), the firm's existing authorization would last just over one year. A repurchase of this size is 2.5% of the current market cap. When combined, KLAC's possible 2.5% repurchase yield and 2.3% dividend yield offer investors a total potential yield of 4.8%. These buybacks and dividends should provide some support to cushion any further decline in the stock price.Despite the recent pullback in the stock, there looks to be plenty of positive news that could boost shares in the near future. KLAC ended 2017 with a record backlog of $1.8 billion and revised its forecast for the next six months upward by nearly 20%. This indicates strong demand for the company's products. In particular, the company expects to double its Chinese business during calendar year 2017.

The market undervalues these companies and prices them as if their profits are going to significantly decline. The market is missing the structural shifts that will drive profit growth via increased demand and less cyclicality going forward.We recommended four stocks to investors in that initial report. Today we are digging deeper into one of those stocks: KLA-Tencor (  ), the most profitable company in the industry and this week's Long Idea.KLAC operates in the semiconductor process control segment, which is a subset of the semiconductor equipment sector. The company controls  or nearly five times its closest competitor.It's almost impossible to make a case against KLAC based on its current profitability. We analyzed the company's 10-K for fiscal year 2017 (which ran through June 30) on Monday, and the results were impressive. The company has a 54% return on invested capital (  ), which puts in the top 2% of all the companies we cover, and it grew revenue by 17% in 2017.Investors are clearly discounting KLAC's impressive 2017 due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor equipment industry. Figure 1 shows that this fear has some merit but is likely exaggerated. KLAC's after-tax profits (  ) and margins have been cyclical, but have consistently trended upwards over the past 20 years.Since 2007, a major cyclical peak, KLAC's NOPAT has increased by 7% compounded annually while its NOPAT margin has expanded from 25% in 2007 to 37% over the last 12 months. Over the last five years, KLAC has generated a cumulative $3.7 billion (26% of market cap) in  . Going forward, analysts expect the semiconductor process control market to grow by 11% compounded annually until 2020. No matter where we are in the cycle, the long-term growth trend for KLAC looks strong.In addition to the long-term growth trend, there have been structural shifts in the semiconductor industry over the past few years that should make cycles less volatile going forward. We covered these changes in our original report, but we'll recap them briefly here:This last point is especially crucial for KLAC and other process control management companies. As computers take on more complicated and crucial tasks, the tolerance for error goes to near zero. If a chip in your cellphone malfunctions, that's an inconvenience. If a chip in your car malfunctions, it could cause a fatal accident. That means automotive semiconductors require more sophisticated and rigorous testing, increasing demand for KLAC.As discussed above, KLAC has a dominant market share in the process control industry, and there's nothing to suggest it will lose that position going forward. On top of its market share advantage, KLAC dominates its competitors, which include Nova Measuring Instruments (  ), Applied Materials (  ), and ASML Holdings (  ) in terms of ROIC and NOPAT margin, per Figure 2.Importantly, KLAC's impressive margins don't come at the expense of investing in its future. The company spends ~15% of revenue on research and development, which is right around the industry average.KLAC's superior ROIC and margins should give the company the ability to withstand pricing pressure if competitors try to cut into its market share. Meanwhile, the company's strong free cash flow and $2.9 billion in excess cash give it the resources to invest in new production and strategic acquisitions to maintain its industry position.Aside from the cyclical nature of the industry discussed above, it's hard to find a strong bear case for KLAC. Most major threats to the business would require an unforeseen technological development, such as chipmakers running up against a wall in their efforts to make smaller and more complex chips, or some drastic change to the semiconductor manufacturing process.Aside from these unforeseeable developments, KLAC acknowledges one of the biggest risks in the \"Risk Factors\" section of its 2017 10-K. Among the listed risks is:In short, if one of the companies that provides equipment used in the manufacture and assembly of semiconductors could integrate those products with some of the testing and measuring products that compete with KLAC, that bundle could draw customers away.Lam Research (  ) tried to acquire KLAC last year in a combination that could have led to such integrated products, but the deal was  .

Source: It started its Mountain View operations in 1967, while Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young were still Buffalo Springfield and Lyndon Johnson was still president. And it has been doing the same kind of work for the chip industry that it was doing back then.Today, its revenue is derived from three main businesses - semiconductor equipment and services, visual display manufacturing and global services.And given the fact that we're entering a new golden age of semiconductors, as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, cloud, mobile and Big Data computing are transforming every aspect of our lives.According to the industry group SEMI, worldwide semiconductor manufacturing billing was up 58% in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the same quarter a year ago. Sequentially, billing was up 14%, to $13 billion for the quarter.Korea's billings were up 110% year-over-year; Taiwan's were up 84% YoY, but down sequentially; China was up 74%; and Japan was up 19%. AMAT has significant clients in all these markets.And when their business grows, so does Applied Materials'. That's principally why AMAT stock is up 40% year-to-date.Some analysts warn that its display division isn't seeing the kind of growth that its semi division and global services divisions are, and that may be the case in the short term.LCD displays are a mature market and the transition from old-style TVs to new slim TVs is complete. But that market is now transitioning to OLED displays, which are also becoming the go-to options for most smartphones.What's more, even if AMAT's display division continues at the pace it's on, the growth in semiconductors (almost two-thirds of its revenue) and global services will more than make up for any slack in displays, which only make up about 10% of revenue.And growing demand for the newest generations of smartphones may mean the display division may see an increase in growth in coming quarters.But AMAT's essential business is helping semiconductor manufacturers make high-quality chips on the cheap. It relies more on its expertise in systems engineering and design than it does on simply selling products.It's a knowledge-based tech firm that is at the heart of global chip industry. And given its longevity, it has built a substantial competitive moat around its core business.By market capitalization, AMAT is twice the size of its closest competitor  (NASDAQ:  ), which is testament to its position in the industry. That means as long as demand in semis is high, AMAT will continue to grow at a similar clip.It's also good to know that even when the chip market was slow, AMAT was still growing its return on equity and its net income margins. That shows management knows what to do to keep the lights on in the cyclical tech markets.The post ) Stock appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" reported optimistic second-quarter 2017 results, driven by robust sales growth and higher income from continued operations, and also reiterated its full-year 2017 guidance.The Dutch electronics giant reported second-quarter net income from continuing operations of \u20ac161 million ($177 million), up 36.4% from the prior-year quarter's figure of \u20ac118 million. Earnings were driven by strong sales growth, lower financial expenses and improved operational performance. The year-earlier figure had been hurt by taxes linked to the company's efforts to divest the lighting business.The company posted second-quarter 2017 net income of \u20ac0.27 (29.7 cents) per share, as against earnings of \u20ac0.46 recorded in the year-ago quarter. Earnings were hurt due to lower income from discontinued operations, higher restructuring and acquisition-related costs.Investors cheered the solid results, with shares of the company rising 3.8% at one point in  following the release. | Total revenue in the quarter came in at \u20ac4,294 million ($4721.8 million), up 3.9% from the year-ago tally. Top-line improvement came on the back of impressive HealthTech portfolio sales.Philips' adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA) - the company's preferred measure of operational performance - jumped 14.6% year over year to \u20ac439 million ($482.7 million), benefiting from cost-productivity programs and higher volumes.On the other hand, net cash flow generated from operating activities came in at \u20ac73 million ($80.3 million) compared with net cash flow of \u20ac177 million witnessed in the prior-year quarter.The company's comparable order intake rose 8% year over year, driven by strong growth in Diagnosis & Treatment and Connected Care & Health Informatics businesses.In the reported quarter, Personal Health sales rose 6% year over year to \u20ac1,761 million ($1,936.4 million). This segment recorded a 6% hike in comparable sales. Double-digit growth in Health & Wellness, high-single-digit growth in Personal Care and mid-single-digit growth in Sleep & Respiratory Care drove this segment's top line.Diagnosis & Treatment revenues increased 4.4% in the quarter to \u20ac1,671 million ($1,837.5 million). Comparable sales grew 3% for the quarter. Mid-single-digit growth in Ultrasound and Image-Guided Therapy proved conducive to growth.Connected Care & Health Informatics revenues were almost flat year over year at \u20ac768 million ($844.5 million). On a comparable basis, sales inched up 1%. Sales improvement came mainly on the back of low-single-digit growth in Patient Care & Monitoring Solutions.However, sales decline in Healthcare Informatics, Solutions & Services proved to be a drag for the segment.Revenues in the HealthTech & Other segment continued to be weak and fell 8.6% year over year to \u20ac92 million ($101.2 million). Lower royalty income due to foreseen expiration of licenses marred the sales of this segment.With effect from this quarter, Philips is reporting results of Philips Lighting under discontinued operations.Exiting the quarter on Mar 31, 2017, Philips' cash and cash equivalents rose to \u20ac2,220 million ($2,535.8 million) from \u20ac1,926 million a year back. The company's long-term debt fell to \u20ac2,599 million ($2,968.8 million) compared with \u20ac5,269 million a year ago.During fourth-quarter 2016, the company completed its three-year EUR 1.5 billion share buyback program. Philips will launch a share buyback program for \u20ac15 billion in third-quarter 2017, to be executed over a span of two years.Philips has been strongly benefiting from three of its comprehensive performance improvement and change-initiative programs - namely Accelerate, End2End productivity, and Design for Excellence - implemented earlier. These programs have been designed to maximize the value potential of the company, and accelerate growth by leveraging on innovation and operational execution.Thanks to these initiatives, in 2016, the company achieved \u20ac269 million of gross savings in overhead costs, \u20ac418 million of gross savings in procurement and \u20ac204 million of productivity savings from the End2End program. In second-quarter 2017, cost savings on overhead and procurement led to a remarkable increase in margins, saving about \u20ac109 million.The company now aims to enhance its performance further and targets to deliver 4-6% comparable sales growth, and adjusted EBITA margin expansion of around 100 basis points per year.The quarter was marked by a string of acquisitions which the company had identified over the past two years. Philips signed an agreement to acquire Spectranetics to strengthen its Diagnosis & Treatment businesses. Spectranetics is a provider of vascular intervention and lead management solutions. Philips also acquired CardioProlific, a US-based company that develops catheter-based thrombectomy technology for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease. Both these acquisitions will complement Philips' portfolio of image-guided therapy devices.Philips also inked an agreement to buy U.S.-based medical device company, Electrical Geodesics, Inc. This acquisition will likely enhance the former's imaging technologies and advanced informatics portfolio, used in neurological applications.The company penned an agreement to buy Respiratory Technologies, which provides an innovative airway clearance solution for patients with chronic respiratory conditions.Furthermore, subsequent to the quarter, Philips acquired image-analysis software provider TomTec Imaging Systems. TomTec specializes in diagnostic ultrasound that helps healthcare personnel to increase efficiency and diagnostic quality. Along with CardioProlific and Spectranetics, TomTec will likely be conducive to Philips' image-guided therapy portfolio as well.Earlier this month, Philips also acquired the UK-based Health & Parenting, a London-based developer of healthcare and family-related mobile applications for expectant and new parents, in order to strengthen its Personal Health businesses.Philips had successfully offloaded a major stake in its lighting business - Lumileds - as it inked an agreement to sell an 80.1% stake in Lumileds to NY-based private-equity firm, Apollo Global Management LLC in early February this year. This fresh deal, which values the whole unit at $2 billion, closed in second-quarter 2017. Also, Philips sold 22.25 million shares of Philips Lighting.As a result of these transactions, its shareholding in Philips Lighting has decreased to 41.2%. Hence, the company is reporting Philips Lighting as part of Discontinued Operations.Philips continues to project full-year sales growth of 4-6% and anticipates gaining momentum in the second half of the year, boosted by a strong order book.While the company expects an uncertain climate in the U.S. and continued volatility in its markets, Philips is enjoying robust orders in China and India, as well as Europe.Philips' second-quarter results were quite consistent, with growth in both top- and bottom-line performance. The company's cost-saving programs have been producing tangible results, thus supplementing its strength. It further believes that increased spending on healthcare and fitness will act as a long-term growth driver, even in the face of continued volatility in the markets in which the company operates.Philips is presently focusing on key opportunities in population health management, while improving its enterprise-wide solutions for health systems and collaborating with health care organizations, to fortify the company's foothold in the healthcare industry. Its numerous acquisitions should also prove accretive to its top line in the quarters ahead, and help strengthen its foothold in the end markets.Moreover, offloading of the lighting business is a major positive and will likely help this company allocate its resources in core business areas to stoke growth, moving ahead.Philips presently holds a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Some better-ranked stocks in the same space include Lam Research Corporation  , Applied Materials, Inc.  and KLA-Tencor Corporation  . While Lam Research sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Applied Materials and KLA-Tencor carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 remained unchanged at $4.46, while that for 2018 declined to $4.70 from $4.75 over the same time period. The downgrade can primarily be attributed to declining product demand, competitive market structure, sluggish macroeconomic environment and IT spending trends.We believe Seagate's significant investments in HAMR technology, 10 and 12 terabyte Helium HDD and fourth generation SMR technology will take some more time to translate into credible top-line growth.Notably, Seagate's shares have underperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. While the index gained 10.1%, the stock returned 1.7%.Seagate is experiencing a downturn primarily due to declining demand in the PC market as evident from Gartner and IDC's recently released worldwide PC shipments data.Shift in demand from PCs to inexpensive mobile devices is hurting the growth of hard disk drives (HDD) manufacturers like Seagate. Moreover, the merger of Western Digital and SanDisk has intensified competition in the storage industry, particularly in the solid state drive (SSD) market. This remains an overhang on the company.The company is diversifying its product portfolio to outweigh the negative impact of diminishing HDD market, thereby lessening the risk of customer concentration. However, the products are at a very nascent stage to contribute positively to its top-line growth. | Seagate faces pricing pressure because of high volatility in the DRAM and NAND space, which led to the company maintaining low inventories in the current quarter.Better-ranked stocks in the broader sector include KLA-Tencor  , Veeva System  and Applied Optoelectronics  .

Revenues and earnings grew 28.4% and 43.8% year over year, respectively, driven by strong demand in wafer fab equipment market and customer acceptance for the company's new products.We expect strong demand for more efficient manufacturing processes and preference for mobile to work in favor of the company. The technical complexity of manufacturing semiconductors and increasingly challenging yield issues remain revenue drivers for this leading manufacturer of process control equipment.Given that each system is high valued, customer concentration is obviated, which results in significant fluctuations in revenue/orders in times of uncertain demand.For the fourth quarter, KLA expects shipments of $890-$970 million. Quarterly revenues are expected between $885 million and $945 million. Non-GAAP EPS is expected in the range of $1.46-$1.66.KLA's comprehensive product line, cost-reduction initiatives and strong balance sheet remain positives that will generate growth whenever cyclical pressure permits.

(Symbol: KLAC) stock, but cautious about paying the going market price of $99.48/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the December put at the $95 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $4.50. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 4.7% return against the $95 commitment, or a 9.7% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to KLAC's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $95 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless KLA-Tencor Corp. sees its shares decline 4.8% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $90.50 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $4.50 from $95), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 9.7% annualized rate of return.Worth considering, is that the annualized 9.7% figure actually exceeds the 2.2% annualized dividend paid by KLA-Tencor Corp. by 7.5%, based on the current share price of $99.48. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 4.76% to reach the $95 strike price.Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of KLA-Tencor Corp., looking at the dividend history chart for KLAC below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2.2% annualized dividend yield.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for KLA-Tencor Corp., and highlighting in green where the $95 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the December put at the $95 strike for the 9.7% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for KLA-Tencor Corp. (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $99.48) to be 23%.

Additionally, analysts maintained the rating on the stock to Buy.Coming to share price performance, the stock has outperformed the Zacks  industry in the last one year. It has returned 75.8% compared with the industry's gain of 56.8%.Y. Edwin Mok, an analyst at Needham & Company, remains optimistic about Lam's increasing market dominance and growth prospects in two of the fastest growing segments in wafer fab equipments (WFE) - etch and deposition.Mok is positive about Lam's market growth in the second half of calendar year 2017 and beyond, driven by a strengthening WFE market.As per Technavio's market research report, the global WFE market is expected to grow steadily at a CAGR of around 4% by 2020. The recent increase in the sale of consumer electronic devices, such as smartphones, hybrid PCs, wearables, and video game consoles, is likely to augment growth in the semiconductor market, which in turn will impel growth in the wafer fab equipment market.Anticipating strong growth in the wafer fab equipment market in the coming years, Lam Research and other players in the semiconductor space including Applied Materials  are poised to benefit from it.Mok said, \"Lam is benefiting from artificial intelligence systems in data centers, which are big users of DRAM and Nand memory chips. Lam has a robust business selling equipment to memory-chip makers\".Since storage is the starting point of this digital economy, there is huge demand for memory chips, particularly the more efficient variety. This has led to innovation in the form of 3D NAND. Lam's products address the high aspect ratio challenges of advanced memory applications and position it well to capitalize on the growth opportunity that is likely to unfold in the coming years.Lam Research delivered strong third-quarter 2017 results, wherein adjusted earnings of $2.80 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 26 cents.

Here, we have used Driehaus strategy based on the \"buy high and sell higher\" principle that helped the genius earn a place in Barron's All-Century Team.Portfolios such as that of The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns. AAII's portfolio, which was developed following the strategy, returned 13.5% and 18.1% in the five- and 10- year timeframe, respectively, compared with -1.1% and 4.2% gains for the S&P 500. Thus, investors with a high risk appetite may opt for this strategy.After a detailed study of Driehaus' strategy, AAII concluded that it mainly focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive prospects to pick potential outperformers. While this strategy was made to provide better returns over the longer haul, companies with a strong history of beating estimates were also given importance.\"I would much rather invest in a stock that's increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that's already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around,\" Driehaus had said in an interview.The percentage 50-day moving average is one of the key criteria in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend. It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator - positive relative strength - has also been included in this strategy.In order to make the strategy more profitable, we have only considered those stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) as well as a momentum score of 'A' or 'B'. Our research shows that stocks with a  of 'A' or 'B' when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.(Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through.

You could wait for one of those healthy pullbacks, but this market is so strong that they are usually pretty tame and short lived (like our recent \"tech wreck\").Another possibility is to use a screen that finds the growth regardless of what the market does. Fortunately, that's exactly what the  screen is all about. It finds stocks that have a minimum historical growth rate of at least 20% and, more importantly, a projected growth rate of 20%. On top of all that, it only picks Strong Buys.Below are three stocks that passed this screen's criteria.Momo (MOMO) may be one of the youngest stocks on this screen with less than two years of reported quarters, but its gaining a lot of attention from the market. That's what happens when you announce triple-digit gains on the top and bottom lines in a quarterly report. The company also has a daily average volume of around 10M shares. As the leading mobile social networking platform in China, a lot of people consider MOMO to be that country's Facebook. Given that China has the highest population in the whole world (approximately 1.3 billion), it's easy to see why this stock has such growth potential.Late last month, MOMO reported first-quarter earnings of 40 cents per share, or 43% better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate at 28 cents. The result also blew past last year's 3 cents. It's four-quarter average surprise is now up to 27.7% after three straight positive surprises and a match. Revenues soared 421% from last year to $265.2 million, which was ahead of the company's outlook between $238 million and $243 million. The live video service continued its momentum with revenues of $212.6 million. For the second quarter, MOMO sees net revenues between $283 million and $288 million, which would account for year-over-year growth of 186% to 191%.MOMO still doesn't have many covering analysts, but the ones it does have are raising their expectations. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this year has climbed 15.7% in just the past month to $1.40 per share. Earnings are expected to soar another 47% next year to $2.06 per share, which has gained 18.4% in the past 30 days. | Over the past several years, Lam Research Corp. (LRCX) has been significantly expanding its market share in the wafer fabrication equipment market, which is smart since that space is in the top 1% of the Zacks Industry Rank. Semiconductor Equipment - Wafer Fabrication has the third spot out of 256 industries, which puts LRCX on some of the most fertile ground in the market. The company's fiscal third quarter report from April and its Price, Consensus and EPS graph (below) both show how this company has been growing for years now, but it's the earnings estimate revisions for next fiscal year that really explain why LRCX deserves a spot on the Zacks #1 Rank Growth Stocks list.As Kevin Cook put it in a  article on LRCX last week, the company delivered the \"earnings trifecta\" in its fiscal third quarter, which means it beat on both the top and bottom lines while increasing its guidance. It earned $2.80 per share in the quarter, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.2% and soared year over year by nearly 131%. But the graph below shows the really impressive datapoint for LRCX, as it hasn't missed estimates in 19 quarters. So if it beats when reporting again on July 26, it will mark five straight years of overperformance. Revenues of $2.15 billion also got past our expectations while jumping nearly 64% from last year. Results were driven by strong successes in device architecture, process flow and advanced packaging technology inflections. Shares are up nearly 22% since the report.Earnings estimates have been on the rise thanks to an encouraging outlook. This fiscal year ends this month, and analysts are expecting $9.88 per share. Over the past two months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has improved 7.2% as eight of ten analysts revised higher. But this screen is really interested in where a company is going, and earnings estimates for next fiscal year suggest it's going UP. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal year ending June 2018 is expected to climb nearly 9% from this year to $10.76. Analysts have boosted that number by approximately 26.7% over the past 60 days, so LRCX doesn't seem to be slowing down anytime soon. | Let's stick with this highly-ranked industry for one more stock summary. KLA-Tencor Corp. (KLAC) doesn't have as many covering analysts as LRCX, but the overall trajectory of earnings estimates and share price is the same. KLAC is one of the leading suppliers of inspection and metrology products and services, and it too has an impressive history of beating quarterly earnings expectations. The company has eclipsed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 11 straight quarters. Going further back, it has beaten in 17 of the last 18 quarters, so the wind is at its back heading into the next report on July 27.The company's new products have been met with strong customer acceptance, leading to a positive surprise of 5.2% in its fiscal third quarter report. The result of $1.62 per share not only beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.54, but also improved by nearly 44% from the previous year. Over the past four quarters, KLAC has an average beat of nearly 11.6%. Revenues jumped 28.4% from last year to $913.8 million. Its comprehensive product line, cost reduction initiatives and strong balance sheet will continue to generate growth, especially in a space that's in the top 1% of the Zacks Industry Rank.Strong results and a solid guidance has given earnings estimates for KLAC a boost over the past two months. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal year that ends this month is $5.88 per share, or 3% better than 60 days ago as all five estimates moved higher. But this screen is most interested in next fiscal year's earnings, which are expected to jump 12.6% to $6.62 per share. Over the past two months, that consensus has improved 5.2% as four of five analysts boosted their expectations. | Before looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

This was largely backed by the company's aggressive merger and acquisition strategy.Acquisitions have helped Trimble in building a comprehensive portfolio, entering new markets and generating additional revenues.Headquartered in Coralville, Iowa, ISE is an engineering and systems integration firm. The company provides Internet of Things and telematics solutions, enterprise mobility applications and other software solutions to businesses to help them in meeting their Electronic Logging Device (ELD) requirement.The ELD rule is applied to most motor carriers and drivers who are required to maintain records of duty status (RODS). The rule applies to commercial buses as well as trucks and to Canada- and Mexico-domiciled drivers. The ELD rule helps in increasing the efficiency of roadside law enforcement personnel in reviewing driver records. These rules help to protect commercial drivers from harassment. According to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), the ELD mandate is expected to impact 3.4 million drivers across the U.S.The acquisition, effective immediately, will extend Trimble's capabilities in serving its customers in the transportation business. The deal will focus on advanced technologies and implementation solutions for better fleet management. It will enable Trimble to provide its customers with robust and compliant ELD solution.Post acquisition, ISE businesses will become a part of Trimble's Transportation Segment.The acquisitions are part of Trimble's bid to expand its international business, while sustaining focus on commercial applications. These being more macro-sensitive, allow a stable revenue stream and better profits.Trimble has added a large number of companies in the last few years. Only last month, it acquired Muller-Elektronik, a German-based company which specializes in implement control and precision farming solutions. In 2014, 2015 and 2016, it acquired 10, five and three companies, respectively, as well as important assets of several others to complement its current business and capabilities.These acquisitions are small in comparison to Trimble, so there have been no integration issues. Instead, the acquisitions facilitated market expansion and revenue buildup. The company also forms joint ventures to build positions in strategic areas.

Here, we have used Driehaus strategy based on the \"buy high and sell higher\" principle that helped the genius earn a place in Barron's All-Century Team.Portfolios such as that of The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns. AAII's portfolio, which was developed following the strategy, returned 13.5% and 18.1% in the five- and 10- year timeframe, respectively, compared with -1.1% and 4.2% gains for the S&P 500. Thus, investors with a high risk appetite may opt for this strategy.After a detailed study of Driehaus' strategy, AAII concluded that it mainly focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive prospects to pick potential outperformers. While this strategy was made to provide better returns over the longer haul, companies with a strong history of beating estimates were also given importance.\"I would much rather invest in a stock that's increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that's already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around,\" Driehaus had said in an interview.The percentage 50-day moving average is one of the key criteria in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend. It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator - positive relative strength - has also been included in this strategy.In order to make the strategy more profitable, we have only considered those stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) as well as a momentum score of 'A' or 'B'. Our research shows that stocks with a  of 'A' or 'B' when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.(Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through.

(Symbol: KLAC) were yielding above the 2% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $2.16), with the stock changing hands as low as $107.90 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 2% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. KLA-Tencor Corp. (Symbol: KLAC) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of KLA-Tencor Corp., looking at the history chart for KLAC below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2% annual yield.    According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, KLAC makes up 3.37% of the First Trust NASDAQ-100-Technology Sector Index Fund ETF (Symbol: QTEC) which is trading up by about 0.4% on the day Thursday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["E Connectivity Ltd.

KLAC stock beat Q4 2016 estimates, reporting $1.62 vs. an expectation of $1.55. Sales rose 28%, and that too was better than forecast. KLAC pays a dividend of $2.16 for a dividend yield of 2.1%.The current advance by KLAC stock started in December 2016 in the high $70's. The stock has regularly established new highs, trading in a narrow bull channel with a spread from low to high averaging 8 to 10 points. However, a recent high late in April penetrated the bullish resistance line, jumping to $104.22.The current initial support is at the 20-day moving average at about $101 and then the more important major support line at $100.

(Symbol: KLAC) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $107.00, changing hands for $107.80/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 7 different analyst targets contributing to that average for KLA-Tencor Corp., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $82.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $120.00. The standard deviation is $15.652.But the whole reason to look at the  KLAC price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with KLAC crossing above that average target price of $107.00/share, investors in KLAC have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $107.00 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

The year-over-year growth was driven by favorable product mix and operating leverage.

It has beaten estimates in each of the last four quarters with an average beat of 14%. Year to date, the stock has outperformed the Zacks  industry. It has gained 28.2% compared with the industry's gain of 22.2%.The company's earnings per share (EPS) and revenues exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues and earnings grew 23.5% and 46.2% year over year, respectively driven by strong demand in wafer fab equipment market and customer acceptance for the company's new products.At the call, management was found upbeat on KLA's technology leadership position and the pace of execution of a product strategy focused on innovation and differentiation. | We expect strong demand for more efficient manufacturing processes and the preference for mobile to work in favor of the company. The technical complexity of manufacturing semiconductors and increasingly challenging yield issues remain revenue drivers for this leading manufacturer of process control equipment.Note that since each system is high valued, customer concentration is obviated, which results in significant fluctuations in revenue/orders in times of uncertain demand.For the third quarter, KLA expects shipments of $850-$930 million, up 0.34% sequentially at the mid-point. Quarterly revenues are expected between $860 million and $920 million, reflecting an increase of 1.5% sequentially at the mid-point. Non-GAAP EPS is expected in a range of $1.42 to $1.62.KLA's comprehensive product line, cost reduction initiatives and strong balance sheet remain positives that will generate growth whenever cyclical pressure permits. Though competition and a concentrated customer base increase execution risk, accelerated process control spending across foundry, memory and logic players through 2017 and beyond will enable KLA to deliver stronger results.

The company posted first-quarter 2017 earnings of \u20ac0.25 (27 cents) per share, as against earnings of just \u20ac0.03 recorded in the year-ago quarter.Investors cheered the strong results, with shares of the company rising 1.3% in  following the release. | The Dutch electronics giant reported first-quarter net income of \u20ac259 million ($275.9 million), a seven-fold leap from the prior-year quarter's figure of \u20ac37 million. The year-earlier figure had been hurt by taxes linked to the company's efforts to divest the lighting business.Improved operational performance and an increase in the top line drove the year-over-year improvement in net income.Total revenue in the quarter came in at \u20ac5,724 million ($6,098.3 million), up 3.8% from the year-ago tally. Top-line improvement came on the back of impressive HealthTech portfolio sales.Philips' adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA) - the company's preferred measure of operational performance - jumped a whopping 50.7% year over year to \u20ac437 million ($465.6 million), benefiting from cost-productivity programs and higher volumes.On the other hand, net cash flow generated from operating activities came in at \u20ac343 million ($365.4 million) compared with net cash flow of \u20ac10 million in the prior-year quarter. This improvement is attributable to robust growth in income from operations.In the reported quarter, Personal Health sales rose 6.7% year over year to \u20ac1,719 million ($1,831.4 million). This segment recorded a 5% hike in comparable sales. High-single-digit growth in Sleep & Respiratory Care, and Health & Wellness, and mid-single-digit growth in Domestic Appliances drove this segment's top line.Diagnosis & Treatment revenues increased 5.1% in the quarter to \u20ac1,491 million ($1,588.5 million). Comparable sales grew 2% for the quarter. Low-single-digit growth in Ultrasound, Image-Guided Therapy and Diagnostic Imaging proved conducive to growth.Connected Care & Health Informatics revenues were up 5.5% in the quarter to \u20ac732 million ($779.9 million). On a comparable basis, sales inched up 1%. Sales improvement came mainly on the back of low-single-digit growth in Patient Care & Monitoring Solutions. However, sales decline in Healthcare Informatics, Solutions & Services proved to be a drag for the segment.Revenues in the HealthTech & Other segment fell 10.7% year over year to \u20ac92 million ($98 million). Lower royalty income due to foreseen expiration of licenses dragged the sales of this segment.Lighting revenues stayed relatively flat year over year to \u20ac1,689 million ($1,799.5 million) as a decline in Lamps more than offset double-digit growth in LED and Home sales. During the reported quarter, total LED lighting sales grew 19% year on year, and currently represent 61% of total Lighting sales.Exiting the quarter on Mar 31, 2017, Philips' cash and cash equivalents rose to \u20ac2,731 million ($2,909.6 million) from \u20ac1,385 million a year back. The company's long-term debt fell to \u20ac3,969 million ($4,228.6 million) compared with \u20ac3,984 million a year ago.During fourth-quarter 2016, the company completed its three-year EUR 1.5 billion share buyback program.Philips has been strongly benefiting from three of its comprehensive performance improvement and change-initiative programs - namely Accelerate, End2End productivity, and Design for Excellence - implemented earlier. These programs have been designed to maximize the value potential of the company, and accelerate growth by leveraging on innovation and operational execution.Thanks to these initiatives, in 2016, the company achieved \u20ac269 million of gross savings in overhead costs, \u20ac418 million of gross savings in procurement and \u20ac204 million of productivity savings from the End2End program. In first-quarter 2017, cost savings on overhead and procurement led to a remarkable increase in margins.The company now anticipates to further improve its performance and targets to deliver 4-6% comparable sales growth and adjusted EBITA margin expansion of around 100 basis points per year.Late in the reported quarter, Philips signed an agreement to acquire Australian Pharmacy Sleep Services, a pioneer in pharmacy sleep testing. This strategic buyout will complement Philips' sleep and respiratory care portfolio, and help it to fully access the Australian pharmacy channels, thus allowing it to accelerate the market traction of home sleep testing offerings.Philips was finally successful in offloading a major stake in its lighting business - Lumileds - as it inked an agreement to sell an 80.1% stake in Lumileds to NY-based private-equity firm, Apollo Global Management LLC in early February.Per the terms of the deal, Philips will get cash proceeds of about $1.5 billion for the stake, roughly 46% less than what was expected in the Chinese deal. This fresh deal, which values the whole unit at $2 billion, is slated to close in second-quarter 2017 and is subject to customary closing conditions.As a result of the sale, Philips' shareholding in Philips Lighting decreased to 55.2%, down from 71.2% prior to the deal. The company expects to gradually sell down its remaining stake in Philips Lighting in the coming two years or so.Philips continues to project full-year sales growth of 4-6% and expects to gain momentum in the second half of the year.While the company expects an uncertain climate in the U.S., Philips is enjoying robust orders in China and India, as well as Europe.Philips' first-quarter results were largely impressive, with growth in both top- and bottom-line performance. The company's cost-saving programs have been producing tangible results, thus supplementing its strength. It further believes that increased spending on healthcare and fitness will act as a long-term growth driver, even in the face of continued volatility in the markets in which the company operates.Philips is presently focusing on key opportunities in population health management, while improving its enterprise-wide solutions for health systems and collaborating with health care organizations, to fortify the company's foothold in the healthcare industry. Moreover, offloading of the healthcare business is a major positive and will likely help this company allocate its resources in core business areas to stoke growth, moving ahead.Philips presently holds a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Some better-ranked stocks in the same space include Lam Research Corporation  , Applied Materials, Inc.  and KLA-Tencor Corporation  . While Lam Research sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Applied Materials and KLA-Tencor carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Its share of the semiconductor wafer fab equipment (WFE) market has increased significantly since 2013 and the momentum is expected to continue.Lam Research continues to see increased adoption rates of 3D NAND technology, FinFETs and multi-patterning. The company has initiated cost reduction and density scaling for 3D NAND and new memory technologies.The company is likely to remain the market leader in dielectric etches as VECTOR Strata and ALTUS deposition and its Flex and Kiyo etch products have been extremely successful so far. It anticipates strong demand for leading-edge silicon in the enterprise market to continue driven by the long-term move to the cloud, storage and networking applications.Moreover, Lam Research is making good progress with its customer support business and anti-trust agency reviews.However, concerns persist in the form of volatility and lower growth expectations globally, with a slow but steady improvement in some developed markets balancing the weakness in certain emerging economies.For the fiscal third-quarter, Lam Research expects revenues of approximately $2.350 billion (+/- $75 million) on a non-GAAP basis. Shipments are projected to be roughly $2.125 billion (+/- $75 million). Gross margin is predicted at around 45.5% (+/-1%), while operating margin is likely to be about 25.5% (+/-1%).

Earnings were up 13.2% year over year.Following the better-than-expected first-quarter results, share price was up 0.11% to $62.32.However, in the last one year, shares of Fortive underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry. While the industry gained 49.4%, the stock returned only 28.7%.Revenues of $1.54 billion were up 4.1% year over year. The increase was driven by strength across all its end markets. Also, the top line was slightly above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.52 billion.Moreover, acquisitions contributed to the revenue growth in the first quarter, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation due to the strength of the U.S. dollar.Gross margin for the quarter was 48.5%, up 140 bps year over year, driven by higher revenues and solid expense management through restructuring activities.Operating expenses (research & development and selling, general & administrative expenses) in the quarter were $449.1 million, 3.9% higher than the year-ago quarter. As a percentage of sales, selling, general & administrative expenses remained flat while research & development expenses decreased from the year-ago quarter. Therefore, adjusted operating margin of 19.2% was up 140 bps year over year.Fortive's pro forma net income came in at $209.4 million, or 60 cents, compared with $181.9 million or 53 cents in the previous quarter. Our pro forma estimates exclude acquisition-related costs, restructuring charges, amortization of intangibles and other one-time items, as well as tax adjustments.Including these above-mentioned items, GAAP net income was $199.7 million (57 cents per share) compared with $182 million (53 cents) in the year-ago quarter.During the reported quarter, the company generated approximately $121 million of free cash flow.For second-quarter 2017, management expects adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of 65-69 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is pegged at 68 cents.For 2017, management expects adjusted diluted net earnings to be in the range of $2.68-$2.78.

It provides industrial technology and professional instrumentation solutions on a global basis.The company delivered strong fiscal first-quarter 2017 results with both earnings and revenues exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate.We remain encouraged by the high single-digit core growth in the company's Transportation Technologies platform. Also, the ongoing margin expansion owing to the Fortive Business System is impressive.Also, Fortive's foray into the Cloud computing segment is very encouraging. The recent acquisition of eMaint Enterprises by Fortive's subsidiary, Fluke, and the buyout of Global Traffic Technologies have allowed the company to enter into the rapidly growing cloud computing market. The deal provides cloud/SaaS solutions for asset and equipment management primarily for industrial applications. It is trying to expand its SaaS and cloud capabilities within its portfolio, most likely through M&A.However, end market cyclicality, integration issues and uncertainties in the international markets pose concerns. | Currently, Fortive has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Over the last one year, the stock has outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry. It has gained 36% compared with the industry's gain of 35.8%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcementeBay's fourth-quarter earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. However, revenues were up sequentially and year over year.Revenue growth was driven by a strong holiday season and improvements in structured data, customer-to-customer (C2C) business and mobile platform. eBay added 2 million active buyers in the quarter taking the total to 167 million.In the quarter, eBay's customer-to-customer (C2C) business grew after nearly three years, driven by its efforts toward simplifying experience and tailoring price. The company also started integrating marketplace inventory into its Classified's platforms. | eBay continues to increase user engagement and satisfaction by driving traffic to its top-rated sellers. Although its growth rate has come down after PayPal's spinoff, standalone eBay offers a convincing opportunity with a desirable marketplace format. It has no inventory risk, better margins, and greater capital efficiency than most retailers.Numerous initiatives including structured data, application of artificial intelligence, enhancing mobile experience, increased use of social media to drive traffic, focus on a discovery-based user experience, category merchandising, and an easier listing process are tailwinds.However, concerns remain in the form of increasing competition in the e-commerce and hardline retail market from companies like Amazon  and Wal-Mart and deceleration of growth in the e-commerce market both domestically and internationally.eBay's increased investment toward overall platform technology and slower growth rate compared to its peers are also overhangs. Furthermore, eBay's growth continues to suffer due to a weak world economy. The company is heavily dependent on countries outside the U.S for its transaction and Internet sales. Although the U.S. is flourishing, emerging economies are slowing down.eBay's unique capabilities backed by technological improvements give it an edge over its competitors. We remain positive about the pace of building a solid foundation of structured data and artificial intelligence, increasing personalizing capacities and enhancing mobile experience. However expected results may take some time to show up due to weak global economy, slow e-commerce growth and increasing competition.Here are some stocks that you may want to consider as our model shows these have the right combination of elements to post a positive earnings surprise:KLA-Tencor Corporation  , with an Earnings ESP of +2.60% and a Zacks Rank #2.

Last quarter, the company's loss was wider than expected. However, Proofpoint outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate thrice in the trailing four quarters. It has an average positive surprise of 13.33%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Proofpoint is a leading security-as-a-service provider, which focuses on cloud-based solutions for threat protection, compliance, archiving & governance, and secure communications.According to a Markets and Markets report, the cyber security market will touch $202.36 billion in 2021 from $122.45 billion in 2016, representing a compounded annual growth rate of 10.6%. The favourable trend in the space is likely to aid Proofpoint's first-quarter results.Although Proofpoint witnessed remarkable top-line growth, on the back of consistent focus on launching products, acquisitions and partnerships, the company has failed to deliver on the bottom line.It should be noted that over the past few years, Proofpoint invested heavily to enhance its sales and marketing capabilities, particularly by expanding the company's sales force, in order to survive in the highly competitive cyber security market. Notably, the company's expenses escalated approximately three-fold to $461 million in 2016 from $124 million in 2012. This adversely affected Proofpoint's bottom-line results.Since Proofpoint continues to invest in sales and marketing, we anticipate this to remain a drag on the company's first-quarter bottom line.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Proofpoint will beat on earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.

So any manufacturing advancement actually happens first on the equipment side, which thereby facilitates the change on the chip side. Companies may either build out new fabrication facilities for manufacturing or retool existing facilities, both of which lead to equipment purchases.Another reason semiconductor companies buy equipment is the need to enhance/replace existing equipment because of normal wear and tear.China's focus on building its internal capabilities to cater to the constantly rising demand for and therefore, import of semiconductors is a more recent phenomenon and one that should benefit leading equipment makers.Since semiconductor equipment and facilities are very capital intensive, decisions to invest in them don't take place overnight. The manufacturer has to carefully consider the current and future demand to optimally manage idle capacity and determine the possible payback period. As far as the market is concerned, even one major new facility can lead to demand/supply imbalance, thus impacting prices for all peers. This made the business highly cyclical, with periods of high investment followed by periods of lower investment.But this cyclicality may now be no more because of factors that can lead to more sustained demand, i.e. semiconductor design innovations, shrinking chip geometries, the growing popularity of cloud computing, the advent of the Internet of Things, self-driving cars, solar power and other technological advancements. Chinese equipment purchases will only add to this.So here are a few stocks that can make you money today: (you can also see  ).This Zacks Rank #1 company has seen its shares jump 15.0% over the last three months, well above the 3.8% for the S&P 500.And this is not without reason.

These stocks that sustain their rally typically have sound fundamentals, a favorable recommendation, strong earnings beat potential, and positive estimate revisions.You must have noticed how some stocks skyrocket after their earnings release. Studies indicate that a positive earnings surprise drives shares for several weeks following the report. The earnings season has started and the investor community is busy comparing estimates with actuals.The computer and technology sector performed well in the last earnings season, registering higher revenue and earnings growth rates than the S&P 500 average. Per the latest  report, the trend is expected to continue this earnings season.Per the report, the sector's total earnings for the first quarter are expected to grow 11% from the same period last year on 6.7% higher revenues. This is much higher than 9.2% earnings growth witnessed in the fourth quarter of 2016 on a 5.6% increase in the top line.The strong growth projections may be mainly attributed to the growing adoption of cloud computing, cloud infrastructure build-out, Big Data, flash storage, networking, security, 3D printing, wearable devices and Internet of Things (IoT) at home, office and car.

(IT), worldwide IT spending is projected to increase 2.7% to $3.46 trillion in 2017 from $3.38 billion in 2016. This will mark a solid recovery in IT spending after two consecutive years of decline. Notably, in 2015 and 2016, worldwide spending declined 5.5% and 0.6%, respectively.The optimism surrounding the technology sector is well reflected in its year-to-date performance. The sector has outperformed the S&P 500 in the aforesaid period, appreciating 9.1% compared with the S&P 500's gain of 5.4%.The technology space continues to be investors' favorite due to its dynamic nature.

Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 2.45%. In the past four quarters, the company posted an average positive earnings surprise of 4.87%.We note that IBM performed almost in line with the Zacks  industry in the last one year. IBM's shares increased 12.9% as compared with the industry's gain of 13% during the period.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.IBM is going through a tough time, attributable to its ongoing business model transition to cloud, which is heavily time consuming. Further, sluggish IT spending, particularly on on-premises and data center hardware, along with foreign exchange volatility, remains concerns. Moreover, intensifying competition in the industry is a major headwind.Nevertheless, IBM's strategic growth initiatives, including its cognitive solutions, cloud computing, mobile and social business are expected to drive growth.Additionally, the company's policy of making strategic acquisitions will lead to incremental revenues, strengthening its technology leadership and resulting in a more favorable mix of business. Moreover, growing adoption of its Watson IoT platform is likely to have a positive impact on IBM's first-quarter top-line results.Our proven model does not conclusively show that IBM will beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  (NASDAQ:  -  ),  (NASDAQ:  -  ),  (NASDAQ:  -  ),  (NASDAQ:  -  ) and  (NYSE:  -  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. After a dismal 2015 which witnessed SOXX ETF lose over 3.3%, stocks across the semiconductor landscape rebounded well last year and the momentum is likely to continue this year as well. In 2016, SOXX ETF gained 36.6%, while the XLK ETF returned 12.9%. (NASDAQ:  -  ) was one of the best performers in the semiconductor space last year. The stock clocked solid returns in 2016 and gained approximately 54.8%, outperforming the Zacks Electronic-Semiconductor industry's return of about 31.9%. The momentum has continued this year and the stock is up 31.5% so far this year, while the industry has just gained 7.8%.The main reason behind the optimism surrounding the stock is improving prices for DRAM and NAND chips, which makes investors confident about Micron's growth. Per various sources, DRAM and NAND prices have improved primarily due to a better product mix optimization and higher-than-expected demand for PCs.This can be further substantiated by the fact that HP Inc., during its latest earnings conference, hinted that there may be a shortage of DRAM and Flash memory chips. Any shortage in supply will escalate prices, thereby boosting Micron's forthcoming top- and bottom-line results.The benefit from improved pricing was well reflected in the company's last three quarterly results wherein it registered tremendous year-over-year growth in the top and the bottom lines.Furthermore, the company is expected to benefit from strong demand for NAND flash memory chips, which are used in smartphones and tablets. Driven by new tablet products and greater adoption of solid state drive (SSD), total demand in the NAND flash memory industry could surpass manufacturing capacity, leading to a periodic shortage and higher pricing in the near term.Additionally, we are positive about the company's strategy of enhancing capabilities through acquisitions which are likely to boost its top-line performance. The acquisition of Inotera in Dec 2016 is estimated to be accretive to Micron's DRAM gross margin, earnings per share and free cash flow. According to the company, the acquisition will also have some operational benefits, leading to efficient management of investment levels and cadence followed by alignment with global manufacturing operations.Looking at the improving selling prices for DRAM and strategic initiatives of expanding in the SSD market, we consider that Micron is one such technology stock which is worthy of remaining in investors' portfolio.On the valuation front too, the stock looks attractive. The company currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of 12.3x, significantly lower than the Zacks categorized Electronics-Semiconductor industry average of 15.3x. The ratio, which is obtained by dividing a stock's current market price with its historical or estimated earnings, measures how much an investor needs to shell out per dollar of earnings. Therefore, lower the P/E of a stock, the better for a value investor.Hence, we believe that there is still much momentum left in this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, which is quite evident from its  of \"B\" and long-term earnings growth rate of 10%.The U.S. economy seems to be rebounding as reflected in the recently released improved economic data for GDP, Consumer Confidence Index, unemployment rate and factory activity data. We believe that there are tremendous growth opportunities for semiconductor stocks in the year ahead.Notably, as per latest predictions from World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS), semiconductor sales are likely to increase 3% in 2017 and 2% in 2018.Right now, the semiconductor segment has several promising stocks to choose from. Here we have picked four semiconductor stocks which have performed well in this year so far and have the potential to retain the momentum in the next year as well. They also have a favorable Zacks Rank #1 or #2 (Buy), and VGM Style Score. You can see  .

Danaher consistently beat earnings in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 6.6%.We expect the company to post an earnings beat in the about-to-be-reported quarter.Our proven model shows that Danaher is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. The  , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +1.19%. This is very meaningful and a major indicator of a likely earnings surprise. |  Danaher carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. Sell-rated stocks (4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Danaher's Zacks Rank #2 and ESP of +1.19% makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming report. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  .Danaher's key strengths include an efficient management team, impressive customer base and wide geographic presence. The company's operating culture, Danaher Business Systems (DBS), which provides a set of philosophies, processes and toolsets to drive improvement, has acted as a major growth catalyst.In fourth-quarter 2016, DBS contributed significantly to Danaher's year-over-year core revenue growth, excellent adjusted earnings per share rise and free cash flow. We believe DBS will continue to fuel impressive sales, margin and earnings growth for the soon to be reported quarter. In addition, each of the company's platforms has leading brands, high market share in multi-billion markets and impressive secular growth that are expected to supplement first quarter sales performance.For instance, positive industry trends like new regulations from the Chinese Food and Drug Administration and strategic product launches in the Life Sciences segment bode well for first-quarter top line growth. Pall launched 35 new products for full-year 2016 and SCIEX rolled out the latest model of the X-Series mass spectrometry platform, X500B.Last year, the company completed the Fortive Corporation (FTV) spin-off and split itself into two independent, publicly traded companies. Post spin-off, Danaher reorganized its business into four segments, each of which has businesses with a recurring revenue structure and strong exposure in healthcare and environmental business verticals. The strategic spin-off, which has strengthened the company's consumables base, in the dental, life sciences and water businesses, are expected to boost first-quarter financials.This apart, Danaher's strategic acquisition strategy, for expansion in targeted regions, is also expected to act as a major catalyst for the first-quarter results. During full-year 2016, the company acquired eight firms across all five platforms for nearly $5 billion. These accounted for 4.0% of sales growth. Two most notable acquisitions from the last quarter, which include the Cepheid and Phenomenex, are expected to boost Danaher's Life Sciences and Diagnostics business for the soon to be reported quarter.Here are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:NCR Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +4.35%, and a Zacks Rank #2.

Shares have added about 8.5% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.KLA-Tencor Corporation reported second-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings of $1.52 a share, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.41. Earnings were up a massive 46.2% from the year-ago quarter.The year-over-year increase was driven by higher revenues and strengthening gross margins on the back of strong demand in wafer fab equipment market.Underlying demand remains strong given high demand for more efficient manufacturing processes and the preference for mobile. The technical complexity of manufacturing semiconductors and increasingly challenging yield issues remain revenue drivers for this leading manufacturer of process control equipment.At the call, management was found upbeat on KLA's technology leadership position and the pace of execution of product strategy focused on innovation and differentiation.Note that since each system is high-valued, customer concentration is obviated, which results in great fluctuations in revenue/orders in times of uncertain demand.A look at the numbersKLA reported revenues of $876.9 million, up 16.8% sequentially and 23.5% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $838.0 million and at the high end of management's guidance, courtesy of strong customer acceptance for the company's new products.Shipments in the second quarter were $887 million, up sequentially and above the guided range.Order contribution by segment was as follows: memory accounted for 61% of new system orders, foundry 37% and logic 2%.Management said that foundry contribution is expected to decline to 63% of total system orders in the third quarter. Memory orders are expected to be 34% and Logic is expected to stay flat in the fiscal third quarter.KLA's gross margin surged 66 basis points (bps) sequentially and 317 bps year over year to 63.8%. The better-than-expected year-over-year gross margin was backed by a favorable mix of products and services and strong operating leverage in manufacturing and service operations.Operating expenses of $220.7 million were up 0.5% sequentially and 8.1% from the year ago-quarter. Operating margin increased 476 bps sequentially and 674 bps from last year helped by cost management.Pro forma net income was $238.2 million, or 27.2% of sales compared with $181.7 million, or 24.2% in the September quarter and $161.8 million, or 22.8% in the December quarter of last year. Including restructuring and merger-related charges, GAAP net income was $238.251 million ($1.52 a share) compared with $181.7 million ($1.173 a share) in the previous quarter and $161.8 million (98 cents a share) in the year-ago quarter.KLA ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments balance of $2.59 billion, up 4% sequentially. Account receivables were $663.9 million, up from $654.7 million in the fiscal first quarter.During the quarter, the company generated $222.4 million of cash from operations after spending $8.6 million on capital expenses, $84.5 billion on dividends and $40.0 million to repay its debt.For the third quarter of fiscal 2017, KLA expects shipments of $850-$930 million, up 0.34% sequentially at the mid-point. Quarterly revenues are expected between $860 million and $920 million, reflecting an increase of 1.5% sequentially at the mid-point. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 853.4 million. Non-GAAP EPS is expected in a range of $1.42 to $1.62. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.42.Following the release, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.

The idea is a good one, following the performance of stocks that have beaten expectations and then guided higher. But which ones were the best?The idea came to me on October 30th and I started it with prices as of October 31st. That means that all the beats prior to the 31st that made my list might have seen a little better (or worse) performance because of the arbitrary time that I added the names to the list. With that in mind, let's focus on building a much cleaner list this quarter.Next week I will do a full review of the list after I have done the same for paying subscribers of Zacks Game Changers. At this time I can tell you that the leader of the list was Ultra Clean (UCTT) continues to sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). At the bottom of the list is Ellie Mae (ELLI) which basically flat lined since the report and is now a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).First I want to mention a stock that I think will be the best performer for 1Q17.  (NASDAQ:  ) beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.41 by $0.11 in posting earnings of $1.52. That translates into a positive earnings surprise of 7.8% marking the 10th straight beat of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Guidance called for revenue of between $860M - $920M when the consensus estimate was calling for $849M. As the aggressive growth stock strategist at Zacks, this is what I love to see. Also on the call, management noted that they expect CY17 gross margin to be a \"couple hundred basis points\" better than previously expected.It world of beating and raising this stock has higher revenues and higher margins. Usually, when that happens you see higher multiples. Speaking of multiples, KLAC trades at 15.6x forward estimates and over the last two years the stock has traded between 13.2x and 17.8x. This tells me that the stock could go as high as $109 (17.8*6.17) if it trades at the high end of the range over the last two years.One thing that I like to see is a stock that has room for future catalysts. KLAC has three brokerages that have \"Hold\" or equivalent ratings on the stock. Instinet is by far the most bearish of the three with a price target of $78 and a neutral rating. Stifel Nicolaus has a hold and a price target of $83. A few days after the most recent report Deutsche Bank reiterated their \"Hold\" on the stock and increased their price target from $78 to $85.Goldman Sachs, Cowen and Company, Credit Suisse, B. Riley and Needham all have KLAC at either \"Buy\" or \"Strong Buy\" or the equivalent. Of those, B. Riley is the most bullish with a $106 price target and Needham is just a dollar behind at $105.Over the years I have picked up on the lingo for chip stocks. At first I learned all about book to bill and after that the focus became backlog. More recently I have picked up an even bigger tell than a stock with records billings or record backlog. The phrase that pays is \"design wins.\"During the most recent conference call management spoke the phrase that pays when talking to 3D NAND. If there is anything that is as good as a design win, I have yet to know what it is. This ensures some high margin business over the next 6 to 18 months, and that alone should have the multiple for this stock increasing.Last night after the close we had earnings from Cavium Networks (NASDAQ:  ). The company posted a modest beat of two cents ahead of the Wall Street number for a roughly 3.8% positive earnings surprise. That didn't catch my eye, but 124% year over year revenue growth did.The company went on to guide analysts to a range of $0.55 to $0.57 when the consensus was calling for $0.54. Revenue also was guided higher than expectations so we should expect analysts to increase their estimates going forward.CAVM is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but given the beat and the raise you can expect the Rank to move higher. It takes a little time for all the analyst reports to come in and get into the system so check back soon to see if the Rank has increased.Kulicke and Soffa (NASDAQ:  ) may not be a household name, but just like KLAC, this company is in the semiconductor capital equipment space. Basically, both companies help the chips stocks makes their chips. If semiconductors were pizza's, then KLIC and KLAC would be the oven makers while INTC and NVDA would take the dough and sauce and meat for the pizza.KLIC reported this morning and beat the Wall Street estimate by 10 cents and posted revenue of $149.6M when $140.6 was expected. That is a solid beat.To be part of this article you have to have a raise too, and this stock had one as well. They see next quarter revenues between $185M to $195M when the consensus was calling for $156M.Like CAVM, I would anticipate the Zacks Rank for KLIC to move higher to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the next few days. The analyst reports will not be not be in for some time for KLIC, so it might take until Tuesday (2/7).In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?

Penetration levels have increased significantly with the scope for further innovation shrinking with each new product generation. So users not just in traditional markets but also in some emerging markets have less of a reason to upgrade.Since Apple  sells a high-end product, its market is further limited. So a jump in the holiday sales doesn't excite me as much as the fact that the number of iPhone users increased double-digits during the quarter. Because it is the installed base of over a billion active devices that Apple can count on to use its services and generate recurring revenue for the company.Apple's service revenue grew 13.4% sequentially and 18.4% year over year to around $7.2 billion. Management said that growth would have been higher taking out the one-time receipt of $548 million in the year-ago quarter and adjusting for the extra week of sales in December. This is the fourth straight quarter that services grew strong double-digits and contributed an equal or greater share of revenue than both Macs and iPads, making it the second most significant segment behind iPhones.At just 9% of revenue, Apple however has no legal compulsion to provide too much detail on what this business is about. It does offer interesting tidbits though such as the paid subscriptions number that was over 150 million in the last quarter.Consequently, services include a motley crowd, the chief of which is the App Store. This business \"broke all-time records during the holiday quarter, including $3 billion in purchases in December alone, making it the App Store's single best month ever,\" in the words of CEO Tim Cook. Over 2.2 million developers are currently working on apps for the App Store and payments to developers have now topped $60 billion.So it isn't surprising that both the average revenue per customer account and the number of customer accounts grew strongly. Apple also quoted App Annie as saying that App Store revenue more than doubled Google Play revenue in calendar 2016. Another positive about this business is that it isn't geographically limited, meaning that even a soft market like China is currently contributing to sales.Apple Music grew for the third straight quarter as Apple enabled downloads in addition to the streaming business. It has had good luck with exclusive content to date and is currently looking at original content to further push things.Apple Pay users tripled, transaction volumes jumped 500% running into the billions of dollars as the service expanded to Japan, Russia, New Zealand and Spain. Nearly 2 million small businesses are accepting payments through Apple Pay.AppleCare is closely linked to the growth in the installed base, so it continues to grow strongly.iCloud storage services are doing well, and that's all that Apple will say about it.It's hard to overstate the importance of this segment as mobile computing devices race to their saturation point. Device sales overall are coming down and what little growth is there today will be gone tomorrow. Upgrades will be fewer and sales will depend on the ability to take market share.The other reason is profitability. Management says very little about the margin profile and makes sure we understand that there are many parts to this business that don't generate the same margins. But they also say that the segment carries higher margins than the rest of the business.This makes perfect sense since hardware generally carries lower margins than software that is increasingly offered as a service these days. So as the mix of this business grows, it will fetch stronger margins for Apple.Also, while Apple has successfully convinced customers its devices are worth the money, hardware innovation hasn't been that great in recent times and could get more difficult going forward. So differentiation could be rooted in the software ecosystem more than it has been thus far.Apple shares currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Technology stocks with better prospects are Anixter International  , Aspen Technology  , KLA-Tencor  or Inphi Corporation  , all of which have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

A lot of the optimism was on account of iPhone sales, which grew 4.7% from last year to the highest ever tally of 78.3 million units or around two-thirds of total sales. Street estimates varied between 77-78 million units. | Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics, said in a statement that this was the iPhone's best performance in over a year, putting it back on top as the world's largest smartphone vendor. But he also said that the numbers were helped by the Samsung Note 7 fiasco. As a result, Samsung didn't see as much of the fourth-quarter bump-up as it usually does (it still managed a 29% share in the U.S. compared to Apple's 31%, according to Kantar Worldpanel).Apple's growth rate was also slightly lower than in the year-ago quarter, and was likely impacted by the stronger dollar and by stiff competition from local players in China like Huawei, ZTE, Lenovo, OPPO and Vivo that may have led to a loss in market share. Revenues from China were down 12% in the last quarter. Tim Cook used an optimistic tone: \"I'm encouraged with the significant improvement but we're not without challenges there.\"He also said that sales would have been stronger if demand for the more expensive iPhone 7 Plus hadn't been underestimated. As it turned out, the more expensive device was more popular based on new features like better cameras and more RAM, which therefore led to a supply shortage. If it wasn't such a competitive market, this may not have been such a bad problem to have.However, it does reverse an earlier trend that saw the iPhone 6S Plus and iPhone 6 Plus growing slower than their less expensive partners. It also seems to indicate that customers are unwilling to upgrade without meaningful new features, but will pay more for them when they're there.As a result, the two new models that also came with water resistance while ditching the headphone socket accounted for 17% of iPhone sales, according to research firm Localytics, as reported in the media. This also raised the average selling price to $695 from $691 in the year-ago quarter.Smartphone sales growth rates are not going to come back to where they've been the last few years. For example, consider that the iPhone 6 launch in Sep 2014 was followed by a 46% increase in shipments the following quarter. This kind of growth is history, because penetration continues to increase across the world.Second, Apple's growth rates have also been fueled by market share gains in China, which may not be repeated for a number of reasons including greater penetration, the stronger dollar, a more difficult operating environment, the increasingly strained relations between China and the U.S. and the abundant supply of local makes of varying price tags.Third, Apple is likely to maintain or even grow share in developed markets and markets with higher penetration on the strength of its brand. But these upgrades will be dependent on innovation. Tim Cook says: \"The smartphone is still in the early innings of the game,\" and \"I think there's lots more to do... We've got some exciting things in the pipeline. I still feel really, really good about it.\" But if the upgrades over the past two years are anything to go by, it seems that there's a limit to that innovation.That of course brings us to the question of the upcoming iPhone 8 that is expected to have an all-new design, glass casing and other exciting features. Plus, it's the iPhone's 10 th anniversary, so there's some pent-up excitement there. If Apple delivers in line with the hype, it should have blockbuster sales. Beginning in the September quarter when it will launch that is and provided Apple doesn't under-supply the things. Until then, we should expect customers to hold off purchases (more so than in earlier years because the excitement for the new phone is more this time).The other somewhat positive factor is India where Apple's talks with government officials appear to be going well. India is a faster-growing market than China at the moment because of relatively lower penetration, a rising middle class and the Prime Minister's stated goal of digitizing the nation. Once Apple starts building its stores in the region, its brand value is bound to appreciate and translate into increased sales for the company. But it's not a done deal yet, especially considering the concessions Apple is asking for, so some uncertainty persists.Apple shares currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Technology stocks with better potential are Anixter International  , Aspen Technology  , KLA-Tencor  or Inphi Corp.  , all of which have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The idea is a good one, following the performance of stocks that have beaten expectations and then guided higher. But which ones were the best?The idea came to me on October 30th and I started it with prices as of October 31st. That means that all the beats prior to the 31st that made my list might have seen a little better (or worse) performance because of the arbitrary time that I added the names to the list. With that in mind, let's focus on building a much cleaner list this quarter.Next week I will do a full review of the list after I have done the same for paying subscribers of Zacks Game Changers. At this time I can tell you that the leader of the list was Ultra Clean (UCTT)continues to sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). At the bottom of the list is Ellie Mae (ELLI) which basically flat lined since the report and is now a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).First I want to mention a stock that I think will be the best performer for 1Q17.  (KLAC beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.41 by $0.11 in posting earnings of $1.52. That translates into a positive earnings surprise of 7.8% marking the 10th straight beat of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Guidance called for revenue of between $860M - $920M when the consensus estimate was calling for $849M. As the aggressive growth stock strategist at Zacks, this is what I love to see. Also on the call, management noted that they expect CY17 gross margin to be a \"couple hundred basis points\" better than previously expected.It world of beating and raising this stock has higher revenues and higher margins. Usually, when that happens you see higher multiples. Speaking of multiples, KLAC trades at 15.6x forward estimates and over the last two years the stock has traded between 13.2x and 17.8x. This tells me that the stock could go as high as $109 (17.8*6.17) if it trades at the high end of the range over the last two years.One thing that I like to see is a stock that has room for future catalysts. KLAC has three brokerages that have \"Hold\" or equivalent ratings on the stock. Instinet is by far the most bearish of the three with a price target of $78 and a neutral rating. Stifel Nicolaus has a hold and a price target of $83. A few days after the most recent report Deutsche Bank reiterated their \"Hold\" on the stock and increased their price target from $78 to $85.Goldman Sachs, Cowen and Company, Credit Suise, B. Riley and Needham all have KLAC at either \"Buy\" or \"Strong Buy\" or the equivalent. Of those, B. Riley is the most bullish with a $106 price target and Needham is just a dollar behind at $105.Over the years I have picked up on the lingo for chip stocks. At first I learned all about book to bill and after that the focus became backlog. More recently I have picked up an even bigger tell than a stock with records billings or record backlog. The phrase that pays is \"design wins.\"During the most recent conference call management spoke the phrase that pays when talking to 3D NAND. If there is anything that is as good as a design win, I have yet to know what it is. This ensures some high margin business over the next 6 to 18 months, and that alone should have the multiple for this stock increasing. | Last night after the close we had earnings from Cavium Networks (CAVM). The company posted a modest beat of two cents ahead of the Wall Street number for a roughly 3.8% positive earnings surprise. That didn't catch my eye, but 124% year over year revenue growth did.The company went on to guide analysts to a range of $0.55 to $0.57 when the consensus was calling for $0.54. Revenue also was guided higher than expectations so we should expect analysts to increase their estimates going forward.CAVM is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but given the beat and the raise you can expect the Rank to move higher. It takes a little time for all the analyst reports to come in and get into the system so check back soon to see if the Rank has increased. | Kulicke and Soffa (KLIC) may not be a household name, but just like KLAC, this company is in the semiconductor capital equipment space. Basically, both companies help the chips stocks makes their chips. If semiconductors were pizza's, then KLIC and KLAC would be the oven makers while INTC and NVDA would take the dough and sauce and meat for the pizza.KLIC reported this morning and beat the Wall Street estimate by 10 cents and posted revenue of $149.6M when $140.6 was expected. That is a solid beat.To be part of this article you have to have a raise too, and this stock had one as well. They see next quarter revenues between $185M to $195M when the consensus was calling for $156M.Like CAVM, I would anticipate the Zacks Rank for KLIC to move higher to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the next few days. The analyst reports will not be not be in for some time for KLIC, so it might take until Tuesday (2/7). | In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2017?

After all, who wouldn't want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let's put  stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock's current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, KLA-Tencor has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.09, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.1. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, the current level puts KLA-Tencor's current PE ratio below its midpoint. Moreover, the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock, suggesting that the stock is undervalued compared to its historical levels.Further, the stock's PE also compares favorably with the Zacks Categorized Semi-Equipment Water Fabrication industry's trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 22.2. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is highly undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that KLA-Tencor has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year's earnings) of just 15.82, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for KLA-Tencor stock in the near term too.An often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price/cash flow metric. This ratio doesn't take amortization and depreciation into account, so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business. This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are (a) generally less prone to manipulation by the company's management and (b) are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies.The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company's stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors. However, it is not commonly used for cross-industry comparison, as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry.In this case, KLA-Tencor's P/CF ratio of 20.2 is lower than the Zacks Categorized Semi-Equipment Water Fabrication industry average of 32.4, which indicates that the stock is highly undervalued in this respect.In aggregate, KLA-Tencor currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of 'B', putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes KLA-Tencor a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for KLA-Tencor is just 0.74, a level that is fairy lower than the industry average of 1.10. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock's earnings growth rate. Clearly, KLAC is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.Though KLA-Tencor might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of 'C' and a Momentum score of 'A'. This gives KLAC a Zacks VGM score-or its overarching fundamental grade-of 'B'. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  )Meanwhile, the company's recent earnings estimates have been positive. The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower, while the full year estimate has seen four up and no down in the same time period.This has had just a favorable impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 8.6% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has also risen by 4.2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price actionfor the stock in the chart below: | This positive trend is the reason why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.KLA-Tencor is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front.Boasting a good industry rank (top 7%) and a solid Zacks Rank, the company deserves attention right now. In fact, over the past two years, the Zacks Categorized Semi-Equipment Water Fabrication industry has also clearly over performed the broader market, as you can see below:So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company's prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.How would you like to see our best recommendations to help you find today's most promising long-term stocks?

Let's take a look at why the stock is the Bear of the Day and if there are some trends that might help investors avoid other stocks that could become a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).ICON is a brand management company. The Company's brand portfolio includes brands, such as Candie's, Bongo, Joe Boxer, Rampage, Mudd, London Fog, Mossimo, Ocean Pacific/OP, Danskin/Danskin Now, Rocawear/Roc Nation, Cannon, Royal Velvet, Fieldcrest, Charisma, Starter, Waverly, Ecko Unltd/Mark Ecko Cut & Sew, Zoo York, Umbro, Lee Cooper, Strawberry Shortcake and Artful Dodger, and interests in Material Girl, Peanuts, Ed Hardy, Truth or Dare, Modern Amusement, Buffalo, Nick Graham Hydraulic and PONY brands.It isn't too often that a Bear of the Day has a good earnings history. Usually I see a bunch of misses but ICON has 3 straight beats of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. That is pretty good.Estimate revision are the key to the Zacks Rank. As estimates fall, so does the Rank. The current quarter estimates is at $0.14, but that is down from $0.19 about 90 days ago. The current year estimate of $1.11 is down 2 cent from about 90 days ago as well. Both of those items don't help, but the real issue here is the move in 2017 estimates.The 2017 Zacks Consensus Estimate moved from $1.08 to $1.00 in the last thirty days. That move lower is what has pushed this stock down to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).E-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:  -  ) just released its fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 earnings results. While Amazon made its name as an online shopping marketplace, one of the most notable aspects of today's report was the latest data from Amazon Web Services. )Web Services is a collection of enterprise-level platforms designed for websites and companies that can't afford the time or money it takes to develop their own server farms.

(Symbol: KLAC) saw new options become available this week, for the September 15th expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 233 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the KLAC options chain for the new September 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $80.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.50. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $80.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $75.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of KLAC, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $83.33/share today.Because the $80.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 60%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.62% return on the cash commitment, or 8.81% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for KLA-Tencor Corp., and highlighting in green where the $80.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $85.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.30. If an investor was to purchase shares of KLAC stock at the current price level of $83.33/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $85.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.16% if the stock gets called away at the September 15th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if KLAC shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for KLA-Tencor Corp., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing KLAC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $85.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $85.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 53%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 5.16% boost of extra return to the investor, or 8.09% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 24%.

Earnings were up a massive 46.2% from the year-ago quarter.Following the better-than-expected results, shares were up 3.29% in yesterday's after-hour trading.The year-over-year increase was driven by higher revenues and strengthening gross margins on the back of strong demand in wafer fab equipment market.Over the last one year, the stock has underperformed the Zacks  industry. It gained 29.21% compared with the industry's gain of 63.31%.Underlying demand remains strong given high demand for more efficient manufacturing processes and the preference for mobile. The technical complexity of manufacturing semiconductors and increasingly challenging yield issues remain revenue drivers for this leading manufacturer of process control equipment.At the call, management was found upbeat on KLA's technology leadership position and the pace of execution of product strategy focused on innovation and differentiation.Note that since each system is high-valued, customer concentration is obviated, which results in great fluctuations in revenue/orders in times of uncertain demand.A look at the numbersKLA reported revenues of $876.9 million, up 16.8% sequentially and 23.5% from the year-ago quarter.

Memory orders are expected to be 34% and Logic is expected to stay flat in the fiscal third quarter.KLA's gross margin surged 66 basis points (bps) sequentially and 317 bps year over year to 63.8%. The better-than-expected year-over-year gross margin was backed by a favorable mix of products and services and strong operating leverage in manufacturing and service operations.Operating expenses of $220.7 million were up 0.5% sequentially and 8.1% from the year ago-quarter. Operating margin increased 476 bps sequentially and 674 bps from last year helped by cost management.Pro forma net income was $238.2 million, or 27.2% of sales compared with $181.7 million, or 24.2% in the September quarter and $161.8 million, or 22.8% in the December quarter of last year. Including restructuring and merger-related charges, GAAP net income was $238.251 million ($1.52 a share) compared with $181.7 million ($1.173 a share) in the previous quarter and $161.8 million (98 cents a share) in the year-ago quarter. | KLA ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments balance of $2.59 billion, up 4% sequentially.

(Symbol: KLAC) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $84.57, changing hands for $84.67/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 7 different analyst targets contributing to that average for KLA-Tencor Corp., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $71.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $95.00. The standard deviation is $8.303.But the whole reason to look at the  KLAC price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with KLAC crossing above that average target price of $84.57/share, investors in KLAC have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $84.57 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  (NASDAQ:  -  ),  (NASDAQ:  -  ),  (NASDAQ:  -  ),  (NASDAQ:  -  ) and  (NASDAQ:  -  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. After a highly volatile first half, the stock market is poised to end 2016 on a solid note, thanks to a rebounding U.S. economy as evident from recently released improved economic data for GDP, Consumer Confidence Index, unemployment rate and factory activity data.The technology space continues to be investors' favorite due to its dynamic nature. It is expected to grow faster than ever before. Therefore, if you invest right, you can reap the benefits over time.Among the 11-sub industries in the broader technology sector, the semiconductor industry has been one of the outperformers so far this year. After an abysmal 2015 that saw iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) lose over 3.3%, stocks across the semiconductor landscape have rebounded well this year.Notably, the ETF, which represents semiconductor stocks, has witnessed a year-to-date (YTD) gain of approximately 39%, while the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK), which represents the overall technology sector, returned 14.2% YTD. (NASDAQ:  -  ) remains one of the best performers in the semiconductor space. The stock has been clocking solid returns since the beginning of 2016 and has gained over 225% YTD, well outperforming the  industry's return of just about 31.6%.The robust performance is mainly because of the company's phenomenal results in back-to-back quarters. This has boosted investor confidence in the stock as many realized that the company is much larger than simply GPUs.Notably, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing six quarters with an average positive surprise of 49.3%. Over the past several quarters NVIDIA has been witnessing significant top and bottom line growth on a year-over-year basis mainly driven by robust performance in three of its four major segments - gaming, datacenter and automotive.However, NVIDIA's remarkable run may not continue next year as the company is currently trading at a higher price/earnings (P/E) multiple than the industry average. So, we believe that NVIDIA with its hefty forward P/E valuation of 44.0x compared with the industry average of 18.0x may be a risky bet. Moreover, the stock currently carries a  of \"D,\" which makes us slightly skeptical about the stock's future.As we approach 2017, we should look for stocks that have the potential to record significant growth like NVIDIA did in 2016.As the U.S. economy is rebounding, we believe that there are tremendous growth opportunities for semiconductor stocks in 2017.Notably, as per latest predictions from World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS), semiconductor sales are likely to increase 3% in 2017 and 2% in 2018.Right now, the semiconductor segment has several promising stocks to choose from. Here we have picked four semiconductor stocks that have performed well so far this year and have the potential to keep the momentum going in the next year. They also have a favorable Zacks Rank #1 or #2 (Buy), VGM Style Score of \"A\" or \"B,\" and low P/E multiple than the industry average. You can see  . (NASDAQ:  -  ) has established itself as one of the leading worldwide providers of semiconductor memory solutions. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #1 and has a VGM Style Score of \"A.\" Moreover, Micron Technology currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of 14.6x, which is lower than the industry average of 18.0x. Year-to-date, the company has gained 63.8%. (NASDAQ:  -  ) develops, manufactures, markets and services semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment and related spare parts for the worldwide semiconductor industry. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #1 and has a VGM Style Score of \"A.\" Moreover, Applied Materials has a long-term EPS growth estimate of 13.7% and currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of 13.7x which is lower than the industry average of 17.1x.

If a stock is trading at a P/E ratio of 30, it is said to be trading at 30x times its annual earnings.In general, the lower the P/E ratio the better. A common threshold for many investors is a P/E of 20 or less. (For the record, at the time of this writing, the S&P 500 Index was trading at a P/E (using F1 Estimates) of 15.33.)A PEG ratio is the: Conventional wisdom says a value of 1 or less is considered good (at par or undervalued to its growth rate), while a value of greater than 1, in general, is not as good (overvalued to its growth rate).Many believe the PEG ratio tells a more complete story than just the P/E ratio. (The S&P at the time of this writing had a PEG ratio of 1.93.)Let's take a look at both of these in action.For example: a company with a P/E Ratio of 25 and a Growth Rate of 20% would have a PEG ratio of 1.25 (25 / 20= 1.25).While a company with a P/E Ratio of 40 and a Growth Rate of 50% would have a PEG Ratio of 0.80 (40 / 50= 0.80).Traditionally, investors would look at the stock with the lower P/E ratio and deem it a bargain (undervalued). But looking at it closer, you can see it doesn't have the growth rate to justify its P/E.The stock with the P/E of 40, however, is actually the better bargain since its PEG ratio is lower (0.80) and is trading at a discount to its growth rate.In other words, the lower the PEG ratio, the better the value. That's because the investor would be paying less for each unit of earnings growth.So which one is better?They both have their usefulness.

Most of the semis where beating down over fear of a global slowdown that never came about. Additionally, the sector has witnessed impressive earnings from leaders in the industry, causing stock prices to rise across the board.

Analysts feel pretty good about KLAC as a stand-alone company, which was on full display in the recent quarterly report. It beat on both the top and bottom lines, while also increasing the quarterly dividend. KLAC supplies process control and yield management solutions to the semiconductor industry, which means it's part of a space in the top 5%(!) of the Zacks Industry Rank.

It is expected to grow faster than ever before. Therefore, if you invest right, you can reap the benefits over time.Among the 11-sub industries in the broader technology sector, the semiconductor industry has been one of the outperformers so far this year. After an abysmal 2015 that saw iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF  lose over 3.3%, stocks across the semiconductor landscape have rebounded well this year.Notably, the ETF, which represents semiconductor stocks, has witnessed a year-to-date (YTD) gain of approximately 39%, while the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF  , which represents the overall technology sector, returned 14.2% YTD. remains one of the best performers in the semiconductor space. The stock has been clocking solid returns since the beginning of 2016 and has gained over 225% YTD, well outperforming the  industry's return of just about 31.6%.The robust performance is mainly because of the company's phenomenal results in back-to-back quarters. This has boosted investor confidence in the stock as many realized that the company is much larger than simply GPUs.Notably, this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing six quarters with an average positive surprise of 49.3%. Over the past several quarters NVIDIA has been witnessing significant top and bottom line growth on a year-over-year basis mainly driven by robust performance in three of its four major segments - gaming, datacenter and automotive.However, NVIDIA's remarkable run may not continue next year as the company is currently trading at a higher price/earnings (P/E) multiple than the industry average. So, we believe that NVIDIA with its hefty forward P/E valuation of 44.0x compared with the industry average of 18.0x may be a risky bet. Moreover, the stock currently carries a  of \"D,\" which makes us slightly skeptical about the stock's future.As we approach 2017, we should look for stocks that have the potential to record significant growth like NVIDIA did in 2016.As the U.S. economy is rebounding, we believe that there are tremendous growth opportunities for semiconductor stocks in 2017.Notably, as per latest predictions from World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS), semiconductor sales are likely to increase 3% in 2017 and 2% in 2018.Right now, the semiconductor segment has several promising stocks to choose from. Here we have picked four semiconductor stocks that have performed well so far this year and have the potential to keep the momentum going in the next year. They also have a favorable Zacks Rank #1 or #2 (Buy), VGM Style Score of \"A\" or \"B,\" and low P/E multiple than the industry average. You can see  . has established itself as one of the leading worldwide providers of semiconductor memory solutions.

If a stock is trading at a P/E ratio of 30, it is said to be trading at 30x times its annual earnings.In general, the lower the P/E ratio the better. A common threshold for many investors is a P/E of 20 or less. (For the record, at the time of this writing, the S&P 500 Index was trading at a P/E (using F1 Estimates) of 15.33.)A PEG ratio is the: Conventional wisdom says a value of 1 or less is considered good (at par or undervalued to its growth rate), while a value of greater than 1, in general, is not as good (overvalued to its growth rate).Many believe the PEG ratio tells a more complete story than just the P/E ratio. (The S&P at the time of this writing had a PEG ratio of 1.93.)Let's take a look at both of these in action.For example: a company with a P/E Ratio of 25 and a Growth Rate of 20% would have a PEG ratio of 1.25 (25 / 20= 1.25).While a company with a P/E Ratio of 40 and a Growth Rate of 50% would have a PEG Ratio of 0.80 (40 / 50= 0.80).Traditionally, investors would look at the stock with the lower P/E ratio and deem it a bargain (undervalued). But looking at it closer, you can see it doesn't have the growth rate to justify its P/E.The stock with the P/E of 40, however, is actually the better bargain since its PEG ratio is lower (0.80) and is trading at a discount to its growth rate.In other words, the lower the PEG ratio, the better the value. That's because the investor would be paying less for each unit of earnings growth.So which one is better?They both have their usefulness. I do like how the PEG positions the P/E ratio in relation to its growth rate to put everything into perspective.Quite frankly, I use both, so I'm going to say it's a tie. Plus, you couldn't even create the PEG ratio without the P/E.But, you don't have to choose one or the other. You can use both. And that's how we're using it in this week's screen.Let's first start with:\u2022 (Only stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buy or #2 Buy can get thru.)\u2022 (Market outperformers are what we're looking for. The 1 year projected growth rate for the S&P is currently 7.94%. So only those above that will qualify.)\u2022 (Not only do we want our P/Es to be below their classic valuation threshold, but we want them to be below the median for their industry as well.)\u2022 (P/E divided by its (F1) projected growth rate.

For the ProShares S&P 500 Ex-Energy ETF (Symbol: SPXE), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $49.18 per unit.With SPXE trading at a recent price near $44.11 per unit, that means that analysts see 11.49% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of SPXE's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (Symbol: GT), Kansas City Southern (Symbol: KSU), and KLA-Tencor Corp.

They rarely see news-making variation quarter to quarter and the direction of their results can be predicted in advance. That's because major equipment buyers (their customers) offer capex estimates which in combination with market research data on new fabs coming to market leave little to imagination.But that just means they are suitable for longer-term calls on whether to buy or sell.A negative sentiment follows when individual memory and logic makers and specialized foundries have equipped their fabs and will only make moderate purchases to supplement existing equipment. They will try to make their fabs as efficient as possible to continue without major investment for as long as possible because building fresh capacity is extremely expensive.But things turn positive when there's good reason for customers to upgrade existing equipment either due to technology inflections like shrinking geometries, 3D NAND, etc or due to increasing demand. So that's when we need to take a look at the markets driving the demand for such technologies, whether such demand is likely to sustain and for how long.Since foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor  , logic makers like Intel  , memory makers like Samsung and Micron  are all trying to bring to market products based on new technologies and China is trying to get a number of fabs and foundries online both this year and the next, the spending environment remains positive.Add to this the fact that concepts like cloud computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence are greatly increasing the need for computational efficiency in data centers while the concept of IoT and the resultant data that is generated is raising demand for a humongous number of chips that must be manufactured. Besides, industries that have thus far stayed away from automation and technology (mining is an example) are beginning to consider the investment to drive efficiency in operations.Unlike semiconductor makers, semiconductor equipment makers still aren't too many and it's still a handful of companies that rake in most of the revenue and profits. Because semiconductor equipment is extremely expensive to develop, this concentration of capabilities is not likely to go away any time soon.Of course, China does have a semiconductor focus, but current efforts are focused on internal production of its huge chip consumption. So it remains a buyer of equipment and will remain so for a few years.With that backdrop, let's jump to the stocks-Three semiconductor equipment companies have reported September-quarter results and there's a couple more left to round out the top five. Of the companies that reported, Lam Research  and KLA-Tencor  beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate while ASML Holding  missed.Lam has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) (you can see  )and VGM score \"A.\" Its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has moved up 21.6% since it reported results last week. The March quarter estimate is up 12.0%. | KLA has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and VGM score \"A.\" Its Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has moved up 10.3%. Since it reported results last week, estimates for fiscal 2017 and 2018 are up 2.4% and 2.1%, respectively. | ASML may have missed estimates and seen moderate correction in forward estimates, but the company has received a number of orders for EUV machines that will be a positive going forward. Growth can be a challenge however since EUV machines generate lower margins, so can result in a negative mix if legacy products see weaker sales.The company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and VGM score \"F.\" Growth can be a challenge, however, since EUV machines generate lower margins, so can result in a negative mix.Investors should note that the Zacks Rank is a short-term recommendation covering the next 1-3 months although today's picks also look good as long-term investments.This week, Zacks researchers have named 7 other stocks that look to break out even sooner than today's Bull of the Day.

Revenues were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $733.0 million and at the high end of the management guidance range, courtesy of strong customer acceptance for the company's new products.Products generated 75% of total revenue, up 21.9% year over year. Services revenue comprised the remaining 25%, up 3.9% year over year.Shipments in the first quarter were $786 million, up sequentially and within the guided range.Order contribution by segment was as follows: foundry customers accounted for 69% of new semiconductor system orders, memory 15% and logic 16%.Management said that foundry contribution is expected to decline to 30% of total system orders in the second quarter due to project timing. Memory orders are expected to jump to 60% in the upcoming quarter due to concentration of orders to support a single new memory project build out in Korea. Also, Logic is expected to increase to 10% of the order mix in the fiscal second quarter.KLA's gross margin shrank 27 basis points (bps) sequentially and expanded 437 bps year over year to 63.1%. The better-than-expected year-over-year gross margin was backed by a favorable mix of products and services.Operating expenses of $219.7 million were down 2.4% sequentially but up 6.6% from the year ago-quarter. Operating margin decreased 504 bps sequentially but increased 717 bps from last year helped by cost management.Pro forma net income was $181.7 million, or 24.2% of sales compared with $276.8 million, or 12.2% in the Jun 2016 quarter and $112.2 million, or 20.3% in the Sep quarter of last year.

Account receivables were $654.7 million, up from $613.2 million in the fiscal fourth quarter.During the quarter, the company generated $169.8 million of cash from operations after spending $9.9 million on capital expenses, $89.3 billion on dividends and $40.0 million to repay its debt.For the second quarter of fiscal 2017, KLA expects shipments of $800-$880 million, up 7% sequentially at the mid-point. Quarterly revenues are expected between $805 million and $865 million, reflecting an increase of 11% sequentially at the mid-point. Non-GAAP EPS is expected in the range of $1.28 to $1.48, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.26.KLA-Tencor reported a strong quarter with both the top and the bottom lines exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Note that since each system is high-valued, customer concentration is obviated, which results in great fluctuations in revenue/orders in times of uncertain demand.However, underlying demand remains strong given high demand for more efficient manufacturing processes and the preference for mobile. The technical complexity of manufacturing semiconductors and increasingly challenging yield issues remain revenue drivers for this leading manufacturer of process control equipment.During the quarter, the company increased its quarterly dividend by 4%, reflecting the company's strong fundamentals. Also, Lam Research  terminated its proposed acquisition of KLA-Tencor, following antitrust objections from the Justice Department. | Currently, KLA-Tencor carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Though it's pricey, it's a good, environmentally friendly car. But Tesla Motors's stock (symbol  )? It's really expensive and risky, most would say. Competition is looming, too, and who knows what impact that will have?But most baby boomers still need growth from their stock holdings. Growth--but not crazy, shoot-the-lights-out growth. Ideally, you should own stocks that can provide strong and steady gains at a reasonable price--investments you can buy today and not think about for five, 10 or 20 years.In assembling this basket of stocks, we sought companies with durable competitive advantages and the ability to lift earnings for many years. A hefty dividend wasn't a requirement, but it was a plus. Collectively, our stocks yield 2.8%, higher than the 2.1% yield of Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.The business: A wonderfully innovative company, 3M makes hundreds of products, from consumer goods such as Scotch Tape and Post-It notes to health care products, electronics and industrial goods, such as adhesives for aircraft. The business isn't growing fast, with sales estimated to climb just 2.2% in 2017. But the company is constantly on the move, streamlining divisions, acquiring other firms and developing new products.Andrew Adams, comanager of Mairs & Power Growth fund, thinks 3M can lift earnings by 9% annually for many years. \"The company's secret sauce is innovation,\" he says.Over the next few years, in fact, 3M aims to pump more of its revenues into research and development, hiking its spending on R&D to 6% of sales, from 5.5% currently. The company is also likely to make more acquisitions along the lines of its recent $2.5 billion deal to buy Capital Safety, a maker of safety harnesses and other equipment to prevent injuries in the workplace.Why we like the stock: With a P/E of 20, the shares trade above S&P 500's P/E of 16. But 3M should be able to boost profits by 8% to 11% a year through 2020, well ahead of the broad market's long-term growth rate. Higher earnings should also support a rising dividend, which 3M aims to hike by 15% a year.The business: American Tower operates more than 144,000 communication facilities that it leases to wireless carriers such as AT&T (  ) and Verizon Communications (  ). In the U.S., the firm controls much of the tower business with two rivals, Crown Castle International (  ) and SBA Communications (  ). American Tower has also expanded into foreign markets such as Africa, India and Latin America, which now account for about one-third of its revenues.That non-U.S. business should charge up growth for years. The firm will benefit from both the proliferation of smartphones and the rapid growth of data transmitted over mobile devices. Only 43% of adults globally have smartphones, according to Pew Research. A study by Ericsson projects that total mobile data traffic will grow 45% annually for the next five years. Much of that growth is in foreign markets such as India, where American Tower has invested heavily and should benefit as the country builds out its wireless infrastructure, says Jeff Rottinghaus, manager of T. Rowe Price U.S. Large-Cap Core Fund.Doing so much business abroad does pose risks. A strong dollar would depress sales and profits earned in foreign currencies (which are worth less when converted to greenbacks). The company also faces political risks in India and other emerging countries where it does business.Still, American Tower should be a steady earner. The firm signs long-term contracts with wireless carriers, creating a stream of recurring revenues that accounts for more than 90% of its sales. Moreover, American Tower is set up as a real estate investment trust, which means it must pay out at least 90% of taxable income as dividends, providing steady a paycheck to shareholders.Why we like the stock: For a REIT, American Tower's yield is low at 1.8%. But the firm has hiked its payout by 25% a year since it initiated a dividend in 2012, when it converted to a REIT. Analysts expect that pace of dividend growth to continue through 2018. The stock is also likely to deliver solid gains as adjusted funds from operations climb at an estimated 12% to 16% annual pace. (AFFO is a measure commonly used by REITs that essentially adds depreciation and amortization back to earnings). At 17 times AFFO, the stock look reasonably priced, says Rottinghaus.The business: KLA-Tencor makes diagnostic, measurement and inspection tools for manufacturing computer chips. The firm controls more than half of the market for these tools, which help manufacturers crank out chips more efficiently and profitably. Chip-equipment maker Lam Research (  ) tried to buy KLA in 2015, but the deal fell apart in October 2016 because of antitrust concerns.KLA and its stock should be just fine on their own, though. Chip makers are embarking on a new generation of smaller, more powerful chips, transitioning from the current standard 10-nanometer wafers to 7-nanometer wafers, says Lori Keith, comanager of Parnassus Mid Cap Fund. Transistors on 7-nanometer wafers are so minuscule (with up to 20 billion transistors on a single wafer) that it's becoming increasingly difficult to identify flaws, making good diagnostic systems more critical. KLA's new 3900 Series inspection system--used for 7-nanometer wafers and capable of working with 5-nanometer wafers--is gaining traction, she says.Why we like the stock: With a P/E of 14, KLA looks a bit pricier than rivals Applied Materials (  ) and Lam Research. But KLA possesses better profit margins and growth prospects. Although the chip industry is cyclical, with big ups and downs, the trend toward ever-smaller chips in smartphones and other mobile devices should make KLA's inspection and measurement tools \"increasingly relevant,\" says Keith. Had the Lam Research deal closed, the takeover price would have been about $92 per share. KLA-Tencor trades 18% below that, making it a bargain.The business: Nike's shoes, apparel and other athletic gear, adorned with its trademark swoosh, may seem ubiquitous. But the company isn't the speed demon it once was. Sales rose just 5.8% in the fiscal year that ended in May 2016, Nike's slowest growth since its 2013 fiscal year. Revenues are climbing faster in foreign markets, where Nike gets 55% of its sales. But unfavorable foreign-currency exchange rates and weakness in China have weighed on its bottom line. Some investors are also gravitating to Under Armour (  ) and Adidas (  ), which are growing faster. Add it all up and Nike's stock has tumbled 21% in the past year.The good news (if you don't own the shares) is that this should be an excellent time to swoop in. Nike aims to boost annual sales from $32 billion to $50 billion by 2020. The firm is making a big push to sell more women's apparel. It's expanding direct sales to consumers through its website. It's also trimming manufacturing costs with a new plant in Mexico that will produce the same volume of shoes as its Asian plants, but with one-third of the workforce. Hourly wages are similar for Nike's Chinese and Mexican workers, but the firm saves a bundle on shipping from Mexico.Why we like the stock: As a growth stock, Nike never gets dirt cheap. But its P/E has fallen to 22, well below the 28 it hit in late 2015. Scott Klimo, chief investment officer at Saturna Capital, which manages the Amana mutual funds, estimates that Nike could earn $4.00 a share in its 2021 fiscal year, up from a projected $2.69 in the fiscal year that ends next May. He estimates that the stock will produce annualized returns of 11%, including dividends, through 2021.The business: A world leader in paints and coatings, PPG sells products that cover cars and trucks, vehicle underbodies and buildings. The firm also makes sealants, aerospace adhesives and innovative products such as sprayable \"rubber\" for golf balls, a coating that could also help extend the lifespan of aging pipes, a much bigger market.PPG, in fact, spends far more on research and development than competitors such as Valspar (  ) and Sherwin Williams (  ). It sells coatings and paints made with nanotechnology that results in deeper, richer pigments. These recently launched products represent a growing portion of its sales. PPG also looks well positioned in emerging markets such as China, where it dominates the automotive paint business.Why we like the stock: Shares of PPG have slumped 18% from highs hit in April 2016. Sluggish sales in Europe and Asia have curbed its earnings, but PPG looks well-positioned for a pick-up in global growth. At 15 times earnings, the stock trades below the 19 P/E of rival Sherwin Williams. If PPG can lift earnings at a 8% rate per year--the company's current forecast--the shares should return an average of about 10% a year (including dividends).The business: Wells Fargo (  ) is Warren Buffett's largest stock holding. But his favorite bank stock may now be U.S. Bancorp, the seventh-largest position in the portfolio of Buffett's holding company, Berkshire Hathaway (  ).U.S. Bancorp has racked up a great record. Surprises are rare, and in banking that's a good thing. The bank held up relatively well during the Great Recession and its shares significantly outpaced other financial stocks over the past 10 years, returning an annualized 5.1% (including dividends), compared with a 2.1% annualized loss for SPDR S&P Bank ETF (  ), an exchange-traded fund that holds bank stocks.The nation's fifth-largest commercial bank, U.S. Bancorp has a culture of efficiency, strict lending standards and technological leadership. With $422 billion in assets, U.S. Bancorp can gain advantages from its size. But because it holds less than $1 trillion in assets, regulators require the firm to keep just 8.5% of its capital in reserves, well below the 11.5% reserve requirement of its four larger competitors: JPMorgan Chase (  ), Wells Fargo, Citigroup (  ) and Bank of America (  ). Holding less capital enables U.S. Bancorp to offer cheaper loans than the bigger boys. It also helps make U.S. Bancorp more profitable, with returns on assets and common equity (measures of profitability for banks) that exceed big rivals.Why we like the stock: Mairs & Powers manager Adams thinks U.S. Bancorp should be able to boost earnings by 8% a year as it continues to expand geographically and delivers industry-leading profit margins (analysts, on average, are less bullish, forecasting long-term profit growth of 5% a year). Add the stock's 2.4% dividend yield to Adams's growth forecast and investors can expect annualized returns of about 10%. Although the stock isn't cheap, at 14 times earnings--a steeper P/E than those of U.S. Bancorp's big competitors--it looks worth the price.The business: Investing in Visa provides a great way to capitalize on the great migration of consumer spending from cash to electronic payments. According to the financial industry publication Nilson Report, spending with cards will rise at an 8% annualized rate through 2019, while cash and check-based payments will decline by 6% a year.Although Visa's name appears on millions of cards, financial firms that issue the plastic are responsible for unpaid bills, leaving Visa off the hook. This is an outstanding, transaction-fee-based business. And it's quite profitable. Visa's adjusted operating-profit margins--essentially the cash profits from running the business, less expenses--are 66%.Visa does face stiff competition. Rivals include American Express (  ), Discover Financial Services (  ) and Mastercard (  ), along with upstarts such as PayPal Holdings (  ) and Square (  ), as well as ApplePay, a service from Apple (  ). Visa's sales growth slowed to 8.6% a year from 2011 to 2015, after soaring at a 22.3% annual rate from 2006 to 2010. Sluggish retail sales in China haven't helped the business.But long term, Visa looks well positioned. The company does business with PayPal and some of the other electronic-payment firms. Visa recently signed branding deals for its cards with Costco (  ) and USAA. And it acquired Visa Europe, which was poorly managed and charged relatively low fees because the banks themselves owned it.Why we like the stock: Visa and Mastercard are both terrific businesses. But Visa possesses a lower P/E ratio, and the firm has three major growth drivers (the Costco and USAA deals, and the acquisition of Visa Europe) that Mastercard lacks. Analysts expect Visa to boost revenues by 10.5% in 2017, and earnings by 17%. Over the next decade, Visa should be able to boost profits well above 10% a year--growth that its stock should match.The business: Before you read another word, understand that Williams Partners is a master limited partnership. That means it pays out most of its cash profits from running the business, supporting distributions that give the stock its enormous yield. But MLPs have complex tax-filing requirements that can make the stocks a headache to own. Consult an accountant about the tax consequences if you plan to invest.A pipeline company, Williams owns one of the energy industry's great assets: the 10,200-mile Transco pipeline, which runs from South Texas to New York City. The pipeline can transport 10.9 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day, enough for the daily needs of 265,000 homes. Demand should climb steadily as U.S. gas production booms and more electric utilities make the switch from coal-fired energy to cleaner-burning gas.Williams is investing in pipelines to transport gas from the booming Marcellus and Utica shale regions of the Midwest and Northeast. Over time, demand from liquefied-natural-gas processing plants should lift sales, too. Williams also extracts natural gas liquids and petroleum distillates from \"tar sands\" in Alberta, Canada, where production is thriving.Williams's stock could tumble if  were to plunge back to their lows from earlier in 2016 (when a barrel of West Texas Crude oil dropped below $27). Energy prices have climbed sharply since then, and the company appears to be in stronger shape than it was when oil prices collapsed. The firm has renegotiated some contracts and sold assets that were more directly exposed to commodity prices. With revenues improving, the firm's annual distribution of $3.40 a share appears \"pretty safe,\" says John Roth, manager of Fidelity New Millennium,  .Why we like the stock: Don't be put off by the high P/E of 31. It reflects estimated earnings of $1.11 per share in 2017. But most analysts value MLPs on measures such as \"distributable\" cash flow, net asset value and their potential to increase distributions. The stock looks attractive on those measures, says Roth. Another reason to buy the shares: Williams Companies (  ) owns about 60% of Williams Partners and may buy the rest of the business at a share price above the current level.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photoThe  is up .19 to 4,877.94.

Stocks recently featured in the blog include  NYSE:  -  ,  NASDAQ:  -  ,  NYSE:  -  ,  -  and  NYSE:  -  .Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. We are in one of the longest bull markets in history, so it's not surprising that investment advisors and market watchers alike are pointing to signs that the bears are taking over. And this is a good thing because it helps curb bubble-like prices and avoid the plunge that follows.After the depression in 2008-2009, companies have been conservative about increasing investments and have tried to supply to consumption. Investors too have jumped off stocks that appeared remotely risky. This has resulted in a conservative (and therefore, prolonged) rally.But in life and especially in the stock market, anything good soon appears to be too good to be true and over the past month or so, experts have been pointing to some negative signs. So let's take a quick look at what those are:In the words of HSBC technical analyst Murray Gunn, \"With the U.S. stock market selling off aggressively on October 11, we now issue a RED ALERT.\" His reason? \"The possibility of a severe fall in the stock market is now very high\" because volatility continues to increase since the end of the summer.Global equity strategist at HSBC, Ben Laidler says that high earnings expectations, economic-policy uncertainty, the upcoming U.S. election and the Italian referendum are a combination of risk factors for stocks.Citi's Tom Fitzpatrick (as reported in  ) sees great similarities between the current charts of the S&P 500 and the index in 1987 right before the crash. Other than the technical factors, concerns highlighted by him include:1. Europe-related: the UK beginning legal proceedings to exit the EU by Mar 2017 and Deutsche Bank's inability to lower the $14 billion fine by U.S. authorities.2. Most polarizing U.S. election in modern times.3. Reports that the central banks in Japan and Europe will be lowering their bond purchases, which can impact central bank policies worldwide.4. Market factors: a 16% move in  within a week; a 20-basis-point shift in U.S. 10-year yields in five days; and a $90 move in  in nine days. Plus, the Chinese yuan and British pound have made massive moves in a short period of time.HSBC's Gunn is looking for a Dow Jones Industrial Average of 17,992 or S&P 500 average of 2,116. Citi's Fitzpatrick is looking for a support level for the S&P 500 of 2,119. Below these numbers there will be greater volatility and continued declines in search of a new floor.Jim Cramer, in conversation with technical analyst and colleague Rob Moreno uncovered that when the market punishes yesteryear darlings like General Electric, Under Armour, Disney and Starbucks, it is a sign of bearish sentiment. Stunned that biotech stocks, particularly Gilead could slump so much because of Clinton's promise to control drug prices, Cramer is advocating investing in technology instead: primarily companies dominating in social, mobile, cloud, Internet of things (IoT), augmented reality (AR) or artificial intelligence (AI). in a Sep 2016 report mentioned several negative indicators: soft ISM readings at the beginning of September, some weaker-than-expected housing data for August (housing starts fell 5.8% and building permits dropped 2.3% according to the U.S. Census Bureau; existing home sales fell 0.9% according to the National Association of Realtors), some signs of weakening of the seemingly ever-growing auto market (percentage of banks tightening auto loan standards is 8% compared to negative in the first quarter according to Cornerstone Macro Research. Possible reason is the 17% year-over-year increase in the number of subprime loans that are now 60 days or more delinquent).In addition, possibilities of a rate hike remain although the Fed has already scaled back on its plans for 2016. Still, the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in September indicate that sentiments are moving in support of a rate hike in November although after the election in December. Of the ten voting members, three supported a rate hike while several others weren't opposed to it.Chairperson Janet Yellen has said that the Fed is looking for \"evidence\" of a stronger economy, jobs report, international trade factors, etc. Raising rates are a bit of a double-edged sword, since it will pull money out of the market while not raising them soon enough will lead to inflation (currently contained at under the targeted 2%). Jobs have increased steadily through the year but mostly because of new people entering the work stream (unemployment rate remains at around 5%, which is fine but the Fed may be waiting for this to go down further). : Initial jobless claims in October have declined to the lowest level since Nov 1973, marking 84 consecutive weeks of initial claims below 300,000, the longest streak since 1970. The trend line shows a continued decline since Jan 2015 indicating the likelihood of a more or less stable unemployment rate going forward. Since the unemployment rate of 5% is considered full employment, this is a huge positive for the economy. : The U.S. Consumer Confidence Index (CCI)), i.e. the degree of optimism on the state of the economy that consumers are expressing through their activities of savings and spending, is rising. In Sep 2016, the Index jumped to 104.1 (1985=100), up from 101.8 in August. The Present Situation Index rose from 125.3 to 128.5, while the Expectations Index improved from 86.1 last month to 87.8 this month. This is its \"highest level since the recession\" according to Lynn Franco, Director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board. : A look at the  dated Oct 12 shows that we are entering a stronger period. While quarter three estimates for S&P 500 stocks were adjusted after second quarter earnings reports, the expected decline of 2.9% in Q3 earnings on 1.2% higher revenue compares very favorably with expectations for a 6.2% earnings decline entering the Q2 earnings season. Actual earnings growth rates have come in better than pre-season expectations by about +2% to +3% in the last few quarters and there's nothing to suggest that this quarter will be any different.Moreover, excluding the energy sector, which is expected to decline 68.3% in Q3, total earnings for the S&P 500 would be up +0.3%. The stronger sectors are expected to be Construction (+6.3% earnings growth in Q3), Business Services (+7.1%), Retail (+4.4%), Utilities (+4.8%) and Finance (+4%). Tech earnings ex-Apple are expected to be up 3.0% on +0.5% higher revenues. Overall earnings growth for the S&P 500 is expected to be positive from the fourth quarter onward.Excluding the Energy sector, total earnings for the S&P 500 would be modestly in positive territory, up +0.3%.When market sentiments are turning negative, you can take advantage of the lower prices by investing in stocks with strong long-term growth potential.

And this is a good thing because it helps curb bubble-like prices and avoid the plunge that follows.After the depression in 2008-2009, companies have been conservative about increasing investments and have tried to supply to consumption. Investors too have jumped off stocks that appeared remotely risky. This has resulted in a conservative (and therefore, prolonged) rally.But in life and especially in the stock market, anything good soon appears to be too good to be true and over the past month or so, experts have been pointing to some negative signs. So let's take a quick look at what those are:In the words of HSBC technical analyst Murray Gunn, \"With the U.S. stock market selling off aggressively on October 11, we now issue a RED ALERT.\" His reason? \"The possibility of a severe fall in the stock market is now very high\" because volatility continues to increase since the end of the summer.Global equity strategist at HSBC, Ben Laidler says that high earnings expectations, economic-policy uncertainty, the upcoming U.S. election and the Italian referendum are a combination of risk factors for stocks.Citi's Tom Fitzpatrick (as reported in  ) sees great similarities between the current charts of the S&P 500 and the index in 1987 right before the crash. Other than the technical factors, concerns highlighted by him include:1. Europe-related: the UK beginning legal proceedings to exit the EU by Mar 2017 and Deutsche Bank's inability to lower the $14 billion fine by U.S. authorities.2. Most polarizing U.S. election in modern times.3. Reports that the central banks in Japan and Europe will be lowering their bond purchases, which can impact central bank policies worldwide.4. Market factors: a 16% move in  within a week; a 20-basis-point shift in U.S. 10-year yields in five days; and a $90 move in  in nine days. Plus, the Chinese yuan and British pound have made massive moves in a short period of time.HSBC's Gunn is looking for a Dow Jones Industrial Average of 17,992 or S&P 500 average of 2,116. Citi's Fitzpatrick is looking for a support level for the S&P 500 of 2,119. Below these numbers there will be greater volatility and continued declines in search of a new floor.Jim Cramer, in conversation with technical analyst and colleague Rob Moreno uncovered that when the market punishes yesteryear darlings like General Electric, Under Armour, Disney and Starbucks, it is a sign of bearish sentiment. Stunned that biotech stocks, particularly Gilead could slump so much because of Clinton's promise to control drug prices, Cramer is advocating investing in technology instead: primarily companies dominating in social, mobile, cloud, Internet of things (IoT), augmented reality (AR) or artificial intelligence (AI). in a Sep 2016 report mentioned several negative indicators: soft ISM readings at the beginning of September, some weaker-than-expected housing data for August (housing starts fell 5.8% and building permits dropped 2.3% according to the U.S. Census Bureau; existing home sales fell 0.9% according to the National Association of Realtors), some signs of weakening of the seemingly ever-growing auto market (percentage of banks tightening auto loan standards is 8% compared to negative in the first quarter according to Cornerstone Macro Research. Possible reason is the 17% year-over-year increase in the number of subprime loans that are now 60 days or more delinquent).In addition, possibilities of a rate hike remain although the Fed has already scaled back on its plans for 2016. Still, the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in September indicate that sentiments are moving in support of a rate hike in November although after the election in December. Of the ten voting members, three supported a rate hike while several others weren't opposed to it.Chairperson Janet Yellen has said that the Fed is looking for \"evidence\" of a stronger economy, jobs report, international trade factors, etc. Raising rates are a bit of a double-edged sword, since it will pull money out of the market while not raising them soon enough will lead to inflation (currently contained at under the targeted 2%). Jobs have increased steadily through the year but mostly because of new people entering the work stream (unemployment rate remains at around 5%, which is fine but the Fed may be waiting for this to go down further). : Initial jobless claims in October have declined to the lowest level since Nov 1973, marking 84 consecutive weeks of initial claims below 300,000, the longest streak since 1970. The trend line shows a continued decline since Jan 2015 indicating the likelihood of a more or less stable unemployment rate going forward. Since the unemployment rate of 5% is considered full employment, this is a huge positive for the economy. : The U.S. Consumer Confidence Index (CCI)), i.e. the degree of optimism on the state of the economy that consumers are expressing through their activities of savings and spending, is rising. In Sep 2016, the Index jumped to 104.1 (1985=100), up from 101.8 in August. The Present Situation Index rose from 125.3 to 128.5, while the Expectations Index improved from 86.1 last month to 87.8 this month. This is its \"highest level since the recession\" according to Lynn Franco, Director of Economic Indicators at The Conference Board. : A look at the  dated Oct 12 shows that we are entering a stronger period. While quarter three estimates for S&P 500 stocks were adjusted after second quarter earnings reports, the expected decline of 2.9% in Q3 earnings on 1.2% higher revenue compares very favorably with expectations for a 6.2% earnings decline entering the Q2 earnings season. Actual earnings growth rates have come in better than pre-season expectations by about +2% to +3% in the last few quarters and there's nothing to suggest that this quarter will be any different.Moreover, excluding the energy sector, which is expected to decline 68.3% in Q3, total earnings for the S&P 500 would be up +0.3%. The stronger sectors are expected to be Construction (+6.3% earnings growth in Q3), Business Services (+7.1%), Retail (+4.4%), Utilities (+4.8%) and Finance (+4%). Tech earnings ex-Apple are expected to be up 3.0% on +0.5% higher revenues. Overall earnings growth for the S&P 500 is expected to be positive from the fourth quarter onward.Excluding the Energy sector, total earnings for the S&P 500 would be modestly in positive territory, up +0.3%.When market sentiments are turning negative, you can take advantage of the lower prices by investing in stocks with strong long-term growth potential.

Last quarter, it posted a 9.76% positive surprise. The company has delivered positive earnings surprises in the last four quarters with an average beat of 8.66%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Our proven model shows that Lam Research is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of key factors. , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate of $1.78 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.77, is +0.57%. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for this company. Lam Research carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Lam Research's Zacks Rank #3 and +0.57% ESP make us confident of an earnings beat in the soon-to-be reported quarter.Lam Research continues to see robust strength in the areas of device architecture, process flow and advanced packaging technology inflections. The company has been improving on WFE market share significantly since 2013 and expects to continue making gains.In Sep 2016, the company also undertook some management shuffling, appointing Rick Tsai to its board. Tsai had earlier held key positions at companies like Chunghwa Telecom Co. Ltd., NXP Semiconductors N.V. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Limited.The company expected to close the merger with KLA-Tencor Corp.  in the to-be-reported quarter. However, the deal was called off following antitrust objections from the Justice Department. The Justice Department's antitrust division cited serious concerns over the deal as the combined company could have restricted competition. Nonetheless, the fact that the company will not have to shell out a merger termination fee is a positive. | Here are some stocks, which you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:CONE Midstream Partners LP  has an Earnings ESP of +2.70% and a Zacks Rank #1.

Last quarter, the leading OEM of analog and mixed signal semiconductors posted a positive earnings surprise of 1.89%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Linear's fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 earnings of 54 cents exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.Also, revenues of $373.8 million were up 3.5% year over year but down 1.5% sequentially. The figure was slightly below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $373.9 million and within the company's guided range. Margins remained strong.Linear's business is well diversified among core markets, such as industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure. It will soon be acquired by Analog Devices in a cash and stock deal worth $14.8 billion. The merger of these two companies will create an analog industry leader across a huge range of products, customer breadth and scale.However, weakness in PC and notebook markets could hit the computing business and dampen upcoming results.Our proven model does not show that Linear will beat on earnings this fiscal quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 54 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Linear has a Zacks Rank #4.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. | You could consider the following stocks with a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank:Intel Corporation  with an Earnings ESP of +1.39% and a Zacks Rank #1.

The deal would further reduce the number of suppliers in the semiconductor industry, leading to higher prices and hurting innovation.However, merger-termination fees will not be paid by either of the company.The deal was announced last October, when KLA-Tencor had agreed to be acquired by Lam in a cash and stock deal worth $10.6 billion. This August, the companies said they were still in talks with the Justice Department and a regulatory clearance for the deal may not be obtained.Had the deal turned out successful, the companies would have realized $250 million in annual ongoing pre-tax cost synergies within 1.5-2 years and $600 million by 2020.The merger would create an equipment powerhouse with a huge range of products, customer breadth and scale.The deal cancellation caught the market by surprise and reflected in the share prices of both the companies. Share price of Lam Research and KLA-Tencor fell 1.22% and 3.67%, respectively, in the after-hours trading.Notably, KLA-Tencor, the leading manufacturer of process control equipment, has announced its decision to hike quarterly dividend by 2 cents to 54 cents per share. This translates into a 4% increase from the prior dividend of 52 cents. This strength of KLA's business model is reflected in its strong cash generation capabilities and commitment to return value to its shareholders. |  urrently, KLA-Tencor carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Lam Research carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Source: But, as volatility increases, so do the chances that those gains could be compromised. That's why it's more important than ever to find stocks to buy that, even if they fall victim to a broad market or sector decline, will be the first to bounce back.That was my goal when I picked these seven elite information technology stocks to buy. All of them have established themselves in their particular markets, some really big, some smaller. But, all have strong moats around their businesses that will provide protection from market ups and downs in coming months.A couple are even potential takeover targets that would very likely sell at a premium. But, even if they never make it to the auction block, they will continue to expand their brands and grow revenue. (NYSE:  ) has been one of my favorite tech stocks for months now.The interesting thing about FICO is that, while it's having a pretty visible heyday as the go-to credit score measure - your FICO score is calculated and delivered by the company - it has been delivering technology to allow financial companies to better manage their operations and assets since 1956.To date, more than 100 billion credit scores have been sold, and 75% of U.S. home loan originations rely on FICO scores. And the thing is, the financial industry is much like the medical industry - very conservative and not very accepting of change.

So, as the Internet of Things expands, \"smart\" devices will be everywhere, and interconnected. Your car will tell the shop that it needs an oil change, and the shop will schedule an appointment for you and send an email confirmation, all without you doing anything but driving your car.This interconnected world will need a lot of chips, and those chips will have to be produced with stunning reliability. Well, that's what KLAC specializes in - helping chipmakers make the best chips possible, every time.

Its business has grown significantly over the past few years - 321% in the past five years and more than 100% year to date, to be exact.This impressive growth is sustainable because NVDA's chip sets are finding more markets than ever before.

(NASDAQ:  ) is the social media juggernaut that needs no introduction at this point. If you don't know what Facebook is by now, you likely are not online and likely think the Internet is made of tubes.For the longest time, FB struggled to build out its revenue as quickly as it was building out its daily (more than 1 billion) and monthly (over 1.7 billion) users. But, that has changed significantly in recent years and FB is on an advertising revenue tear.FB has also built out strategic businesses that can now cross-pollinate one another. Even its Oculus VR technology is going to be incorporated into its social media outlets. And, having the eyeballs of all these people means that advertisers are making FB one of the most compelling advertising spaces on the Internet.The company has also just launched its  collaboration platform for businesses.

But this has led to some really big players such that further consolidation may be difficult due to anti-trust hurdles.Earlier, Applied Material's  proposed acquisition of Tokyo Electron fell through on anti-competitive concerns and now there is a possibility that similar issues in China, Japan and Korea will work against the Lam Research  -KLA-Tencor  merger.Here is a brief analysis of the two market leaders in the backdrop of shrinking process nodes, 3D NAND production ramp up and an emerging Chinese semiconductor sector.Applied Materials remains the market leader in wafer level manufacturing equipment according to Gartner with a 19.1% share. The company has been the market leader for as far back as I can remember and it continues to take share (growing 1.3% in a market that shrank 1.0% in 2015).But Lam Research has seen more remarkable growth of 24.7% in 2015 to end the year with a 14.3% share of the market. Lam has grown through acquisitions, most notably that of Novellus Systems in Jun 2012.Unlike other markets, semi equipment includes lighting sources, process control equipment and other things with companies specializing in specific areas, so Gartner's top 10 aren't always directly comparable and share gains aren't necessarily indicative of competitive strength.Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International (SEMI) expects the WFE (wafer front end equipment) to grow 1.9% in 2016. Gartner expects the market to shrink by 2%.The two major technology inflections driving semiconductor engineering at the moment are shrinking process nodes and 3D NAND. Major design breakthroughs and innovations are very positive for equipment makers in particular because they involve increased complexities that can only be taken care of with new, specialized equipment. : Very simplistically, the CMOS manufacturing process for semiconductors involves the deposition of several layers of conductive and semiconductive materials on a silicon wafer and using laser light sources (now moving to extreme ultra violet or EUV) to implant the material in specific designs using stencil-like things called photomasks or reticles. The excess material on the surface of each layer is then cleaned or \"etched\" away using liquid or gaseous materials. What follows is a process of planarization, cutting, sorting and packaging the final wafers into \"chips\". So when these chips become smaller in size, each wafer yields more, leading to cost efficiencies. Increasing wafer sizes also does the same thing because the number of chips per wafer increases but this can involve more capital because new capacity or significant upgrade of existing capacity may be required. Moreover, the need to shrink is leading to materials innovation  announced carbon nanotubes) because of the limitations of using silicon at the wafer level. The bottom line is, semiconductor manufacturers are therefore keen on shrinking chip size or increasing wafer size and every time this happens, they will buy fresh equipment first for designing, and then for volume production and to manage yields. : As chip sizes shrink, there is the increased risk of electrostatic discharge, impacting yields and functionality. Semiconductor designing has therefore moved to three dimensional designs, thereby enabling both functionality and electrical stability in smaller areas. This again is leading to increased demand for new manufacturing equipment.Applied Materials recently announced that it has started shipping its PROVision ebeam inspection tool offering down to 1nm resolution inspection for foundry, logic, DRAM and 3D NAND customers. The company hasn't specified the number of machines sold to date but said that it was more than 12, that two important foundry and memory manufacturers have taken delivery and that orders at existing and new customers had been received. Last year, it launched the Centura Tetra Z for etching at 10nm and below and announced earlier this year that its Selectra etching tool for design and manufacture of 3D logic and memory chips was shipping to foundry logic and memory chipmakers.As far as Lam is concerned, the company recognizes that yield management in the more complex new processes will be linked to deposition and etch as materials used in these processes impact resistance and stress, which also affect yields. So it is trying to buy KLA-Tencor, which has historically led in process control and yield management equipment to integrate these functions in its equipment. As part of its Altus product line, the company announced that its new atomic layer deposition tool facilitating chip shrinking was already in use at several R&D sites as well as at leading 3D NAND and DRAM players. The company is particularly well positioned at memory manufacturers.Given China's growing importance in chip consumption and production, it is an important market for equipment suppliers. The Chinese government is aiming to domestically manufacture 40% of domestic consumption in the next five years. But while the government is doing all it can to grow the Chinese semiconductor segment, demand continues to outpace the output from these efforts. So the government is welcoming foreign players to fill the gap. For equipment suppliers this is positive because while it will try to rely on domestic companies as much as possible and even buy up U.S. technology, it will continue to buy equipment from international players as well.Applied Materials has for long been a major player in China, so it has important relationships and regular business from the region. China revenue has continued to grow in the last few years although the rate of growth appears to be slowing down. This could be because of the Chinese government's efforts or increased competition with Lam Research. It still accounts for around 17% of this market.Lam Research will see increasing strength in China as both Intel's Dalian fab and the Chinese company XMC (which has licensed 3D NAND technology from Cypress-owned Spansion) ramp up spending. Of these, Intel is in the tooling phase for 3D NAND, so its impact will be immediate. On the other hand, XMC just started construction, so equipping will likely be in 2017.However, real gains for these leading equipment makers come from market share wrested from each other or if the market itself expands as a result of new semiconductor applications. That's because even if manufacturing changes location (to China for instance), but chip volumes (and therefore capacity) doesn't increase, there is no change in equipment demand. Market expansion will likely become the most important factor over time, as growth in the Chinese semiconductor sector means gradual and growing competition from newer Chinese players that the current market leaders will increasingly be pitted against. Most of the Chinese fabs are trailing edge, so upgrading to leading edge will also be a driver.Applied Materials has topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters although the surprise percentage isn't that impressive at 5.05%. But given that revenues can be lumpy because of customer concentration and high order values obviated by the nature of the business, it isn't bad either. Moreover, estimates for this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company have jumped up since it last reported. So over a 30-day period, estimates for the next two quarters are up 35.4% and 33.3%, respectively with those for fiscal years 2016 and 2017 also up a respective 13.6% and 20.9%.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.69 per share, so guidance was weaker than expected. | Lam Research delivered strong fiscal fourth quarter 2016 results with both earnings and revenues outperforming our estimates.2016 has been pretty good for the company as it continues to see strong success in the areas of device architecture, process flow and advanced packaging technology inflections.In the quarter just ended, Lam's shipments, revenues and non-GAAP gross margins were above the mid-points and non-GAAP EPS were above the high-end of the guidance range.Lam Research has high hopes from KLA-Tencor Corp.  the merger with which close shortly. Management expects that the combined company will contribute significantly toward sustainable growth, generating cash and creating value.The company has been improving on WFE market share significantly since 2013 and expects to continue making gains, going forward.Lam Research continues to see increased adoption rates of 3D NAND technology, FinFETs and multi-patterning. The company has initiated cost reduction and density scaling for 3D NAND and new memory technologies.It is likely to continue as the market leader in dielectric etches as VECTOR Strata and ALTUS deposition and Flex and Kiyo etch products have been extremely successful products thus far. The company anticipates strong demand for leading-edge silicon in the enterprise market to continue, driven by the long-term move to the cloud, storage and networking applications.The company is also making good progress with its customer support business and anti-trust agency reviews.However, concerns persist in the form of volatility and lower growth expectations globally, with slow but steady improvement in some developed markets balancing the weakness in certain emerging economies. The Brexit impact cannot be ignored either.Lam Research currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors may also consider stocks like Mistras Group, Inc.  , VOXX International Corp.  and Texas Instruments Inc.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 15.00%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement. | While uncertainties about the timing of capital equipment purchases remain for this leading provider of process control equipment, its acquisition by Lam Research is a positive for investors.With reference to the proposed acquisition between the two companies, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) has requested for additional information and documentary material. Moreover, to arrive at the terms of a consent decree, executives from both the companies are working with the staff of the DOJ. Both the companies remain optimistic on securing necessary regulatory approvals and expect the transaction to close in the third calendar quarter.At present, both the companies have clearance from competition authorities in Germany, Ireland, Israel and Taiwan and are in talks with regulators in other jurisdictions.Given the expected increase in 3D NAND deployments this year and Lam's strength in the area, which can lead to synergies, FinFET transition at foundries is a positive.KLA-Tencor's management is upbeat about a relatively strong performance in the to-be reported quarter given the company's market leadership, new line of products, growing service revenues and a leaner cost structure.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, KLA expects shipments of $775-$855 million and revenues in the range of $810-$870 million. Non-GAAP EPS is expected in the range of $1.30 to $1.50.Our proven model does not conclusively show that KLA-Tencor will beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at $1.43. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. KLA-Tencor carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. But the company's 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies which you may consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:CDK Global, Inc  , with an Earnings ESP of +4.26% and a Zacks Rank #1. The company is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2016 earnings on Aug 3, 2016.LG Display Co., Ltd.  , with an Earnings ESP of +50.00% and a Zacks Rank #2.

Technology is a popular sector for growth investors, and the field continues to accelerate faster than ever before. If you invest right, you stand to make a nice profit. Tech companies will continue to change and reshape our world as the years pass. You don't want to be left behind, so make sure you're investing in quality tech stocks that aren't overpriced.A great way to find out if the price is right is by identifying companies with low price-to-earnings ratios relative to the growth expected of them over the next three to five years. There is a metric for this, known as the PEG ratio.Many tech companies have inflated PE ratios, and this is because they have high earnings growth expectations. The PEG ratio helps to put growth stocks into perspective, and they help with assessing the value present in a company based on expected growth. A PEG under 1 may suggest that a stock is undervalued, so tech companies with a low PEG may stand to see superior returns over the long run. If you are a believer in the power of technology, you won't want to overlook these five buy-ranked tech stocks.TDK Corp. has an array of technologies for its businesses involving electronic materials, components and devices, semiconductors, recording media, and data storage devices. TDK's stock is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and it has a PEG of 0.27. With such a low PEG, it's no wonder why this stock gets an \"A\" for value in our Style Scores. | Tessera Technologies develops semiconductor packaging technologies to meet the demands for miniaturization and increased performance of electronic products. Tessera is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), and it has a PEG of 0.76. Remember, a PEG under 1 may suggest that there is value present. TSRA doles out a 2.48% dividend, and it also has a score of \"B\" for growth and value in our Style Scores. | Sanmina Corporation engages in providing electronics contract manufacturing services. It focuses on engineering and fabricating complex components and also on providing complete end-to-end supply chain solutions to OEMs. SANM stock is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and for good reason. After all, the company has a VGM score of \"A\". This is really great to see, as the VGM is a great indicator for how well-rounded a stock is with regards to growth, value, and momentum metrics. Sanmina's PEG of just 0.68 should help to justify its case as a potential bargain opportunity relative to expected earnings growth the long run. | KLA-Tencor is a leading supplier of process control and yield management solutions for the semiconductor and related microelectronics industries. It has a comprehensive range of software, products, services, and expertise which help design integrated circuit manufacturers manage yield throughout the entire wafer fabrication process. KLA-Tencor is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and it has a PEG of 0.79. It's worth noting that the company doles out a 2.86% dividend to shareholders. KLAC is a big player in its industry, so it makes sense for the company to have a hefty market cap of $11.32 billion. | ARRIS is an IP, video and broadband technology company. It offers video infrastructure, delivery networks, home and business connectivity, devices, and other related products. ARRS is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company trades at a forward PE of just 9.83, and it also has a PEG of just 0.49. It's no wonder why this stock gets an \"A\" for value in our Style Scores. | Many argue that valuations in the tech market are inflated. While there is merit to that argument, one cannot deny the fact that there are still cheap tech stocks out there. Fundamental metrics such as the PEG ratio will help you to determine how a stock's current price is related to earnings growth expectations over the long run. It is a valuable tool for Wall Street, and it can also be helpful to every day investors like you.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

This is because this security in the Semiconductor Equipment Manufacturing - Wafer Fabrication space is seeing solid earnings estimate revision activity, and is in great company from a Zacks Industry Rank perspective.This is important because, often times, a rising tide will lift all boats in an industry, as there can be broad trends taking place in a segment that are boosting securities across the board. This is arguably taking place in the Semiconductor Equipment Manufacturing - Wafer Fabrication space as it currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 11 out of more than 250 industries, suggesting it is well-positioned from this perspective, especially when compared to other segments out there.Meanwhile, KLA-Tencor is actually looking pretty good on its own too. The firm has seen solid earnings estimate revision activity over the past month, suggesting analysts are becoming a bit more bullish on the firm's prospects in both the short and long term.In fact, over the past month, current quarter estimates have risen from $1.42 per share to $1.43 per share, while current year estimates have risen from $4.24 per share to $4.33 per share.

Moody's expects that the combined company will contribute significantly toward sustainable growth, generating cash and creating value.

The agency believes that its improving performance will continue in the future as well.Lam Research is one of the largest global manufacturers of semiconductor equipment.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  the  (  ),  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .U.S. stocks did manage to eke out gains in April, but still booked their worst weekly loss since February last week. Lackluster corporate earnings were primarily responsible for such a debacle. A flurry of weak economic reports also continues to add to the woes. Moreover, we are in May, which is predominantly a bad month for investment. Investors tend to offload their stock holdings this month and tend to reenter the markets in fall.However, it will be wise not to completely offload your portfolio during this phase. Instead, it's time to invest in companies that pay hefty dividends. Dividend stocks pay regular income irrespective of market movements. Moreover, the possibility of a rate hike ebbing in the near term makes dividend paying stocks more alluring.U.S. stocks ended April with a whimper, which raised doubts whether the mid-February rally is running out of gas. Sell-off in technology and healthcare stocks curtailed gains. Companies from both these space were hit hard by losses following a bout of weak earnings reports.This month, the broader markets did close the first-trading session higher. But let's not forget that the markets have entered a period from May to October where stocks suffer the most losses for the year. This period has given rise to the old adage \"Sell in May and go away.\" The strategy states that any investor who sells stocks in May and then gets back in November, thereby avoiding the volatile May to October period, make more moolah than those who remained steadfast throughout the year.With the corporate season winding down, all eyes will be on domestic economic data to determine the market's next move. However, on this front, things aren't looking bright either. The battered U.S. manufacturing sector did stabilize a bit, but is yet to regain full health. The ISM manufacturing index dropped to 50.8 in April from 51.8 in March.This data followed the U.S. economy's weakest quarterly growth in two years between January and March, as spending levels declined considerably. The U.S. economy expanded at an annualized rate of 0.5% in the first quarter, according to the Commerce Department. Business investment tumbled the most in almost seven years in the said quarter, while household purchases went up the least since early 2015. Retail sales, a key barometer of consumer spending, also dropped in March.On the housing front, things are also looking gloomy. While housing starts declined more than expected in March, building permits touched a one-year low. New home sales also fell in March suggesting some cooling in the housing market.U.S. inflation, on the other hand, barely rose due to lukewarm spending in the first quarter. This made it even less likely that the Fed will raise rates soon. The core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, increased 0.1%, below the consensus estimate of a 0.2% gain. This is also way below the Fed's desired target level of 2%.The Federal Open Market Committee had kept the interest rate flat within the 0.25 and 0.5 percent range in April. The Fed also said that it was in no hurry to hike rates further. It had hiked rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade.U.S. stocks not only failed to end in the green convincingly in April, but are also headed for a period of lull that will last until fall. A slew of weak economic data isn't helping matters either. As more volatility is in the cards and the economic outlook remains unstable, it is time to add top-notch  to your portfolio.Companies that pay consistent dividends put a ceiling on market declines. These companies generate consistent cash flows irrespective of market conditions. They are generally financially stable and mature companies, which helps their stock prices to increase steadily over a period of time . Moreover, dividends are also less taxed as compared to interest income. They help your portfolio to grow at a compounded rate and offer protection from earnings manipulation.As the possibility of an immediate rate hike has been ruled out, dividend payers are even more in demand. Dividend paying stocks suffer when rates are rising as investors focus on safe bonds. Most importantly, such stocks when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), are expected to boost your returns. The favorable Zacks Rank should help these stocks to continue gaining this year as well. (  ) through its subsidiaries owns and operates full-service restaurants in the United States and Canada.

(Symbol: KLAC) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 2.9% annualized dividend yield can sell the December covered call at the $72.50 strike and collect the premium based on the $2.45 bid, which annualizes to an additional 5.3% rate of return against the current stock price (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ), for a total of 8.2% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $72.50 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but KLAC shares would have to climb 1.1% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 4.5% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of KLA-Tencor Corp., looking at the dividend history chart for KLAC below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2.9% annualized dividend yield.Below is a chart showing KLAC's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $72.50 strike highlighted in red:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the December covered call at the $72.50 strike gives good reward for the risk of having given away the upside beyond $72.50.

(Symbol: KLAC) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $2.08), with the stock changing hands as low as $69.03 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. KLA-Tencor Corp. (Symbol: KLAC) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of KLA-Tencor Corp., looking at the history chart for KLAC below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.

The acquisition is expected to be accretive to earnings and cash flow in the first twelve months following the closure. The companies expect to realize $250 million in annual ongoing pre-tax cost synergies within 1.5-2 years and $600 million by 2020.The merger of these two companies creates an equipment powerhouse with a huge range of products, customer breadth and scale.

Source: I'm not saying you need to be a market timer, however. I'm talking about simply knowing how to look at the big picture - the fundamentals - and determine the time to buy into certain sectors.For example, we've heard from numerous sources that global growth, while not declining, isn't growing very fast. Domestically, the U.S. has already lowered its growth estimate for the year and the Federal Reserve's forecast for two rate hikes could crumble, as the market expects just one instance of rate tightening this year.That means slow growth stocks are the way to go. Solid companies that can endure this middling market are the way to go. It doesn't matter what sector they are in, it's simply a matter of how well they are managing to grow when growth is scarce to come by.These are A-rated stocks with great fundamentals that can form the bedrock of your portfolio. 18%It may be hard to believe, with all the turmoil in Asia, but  (  ), the world's largest mobile phone carrier, is up almost 15% year-to-date.That is a strong indicator that not all of Asia is linked to the fortunes of China. Actually, NTT seems more focused on the U.S. market now.It recently bought the Services division from  (  ) - an IT services provider group that delivers infrastructure and cloud services, application services, and business process outsourcing.Basically, NTT is looking to the U.S. cloud for growth. This is a big deal for Japanese companies. Traditionally, outside of media and automotive, the big firms simply focus on their regional and domestic market. Adding this new growth into the mix is likely why the stock is getting attention.This expansion also helps diversify its base. That's a good thing these days as well. 25% (  ) is the power company of South Korea. And it has been around for 116 years, which means it has seen its share of ups and downs - including its  . It was also succeeding when China wasn't the center of the world's attention, but a backward, isolationist Communist power.The point is, KEP is resilient. And after a rough go of it for the Korean economy, KEP is back on a growth track. Nothing spectacular, mind you, but solid and sustainable.It is also involved in markets outside of Korea, and is one of the top builders of nuclear power plants. New nukes are much more reliable than the older models and they can generate massive amounts of power with zero emissions.KEP is either operating or building thermal power plants from the Philippines to Mexico to China and Saudi Arabia. Simply put, it has a growing international market and will also benefit from a renewed Korean economy. 21% (  ) builds testing and measuring equipment for the semiconductor industry as well as the LED and data storage sectors.That means as long as businesses and people are buying devices with chips and chipsets, KLAC will be along for the ride.This is the boring underbelly of technology that we find indispensable. If you want reliability and consistency, which is absolutely essential in tech equipment, you need to make sure it is up and running. The industry has the \"five nines,\" which is basically a system has to be available 99.999% of the time in any given year.KLAC is one of key companies to ensure that the five nines are met.Even as many tech firms have slowed, KLAC has registered a 4% return year-to-date and it has a healthy 2.9% dividend as a cherry on top. 13.5% (  ) has been around for more than 50 years now, and this is likely the first time you have every heard of this 6,000-employee company that operates 90 offices around the world.That's because it's a behind-the-scenes player that builds analytical instruments for a vast array of industrial production processes. From microscopes to MRIs to metallurgy to manufacturing quality control, BRKR has a piece of equipment to help.But the most interesting space right now is its healthcare work. Every aspect of the healthcare sector is concerned about costs. That means testing and analyzing images are key factors in preparing doctors and healthcare professionals for an accurate diagnosis. And BRKR has plenty of products and equipment to help.And it looks like more people are spotting this hidden gem - it's up 18% year to date. 15% (  ) has been around in one form or another for more than 150 years. That includes  . It was the first company in the world to sell what we consider to be a modern handgun - a repeating fire weapon with self-encapsulated rounds.It has certainly seen feast and famine along the way. But it has only been relatively recently that gun control has taken center stage in U.S. politics in a significant way.After President Reagan was nearly killed by a mentally unstable man, both parties started to look at national gun control legislation. But that has picked up in earnest under President Obama.Interesting factoid: SWHC is up more than 800% since Obama took office. Why? Because gun buyers are worried that new legislation will restrict their ability to own one or multiple guns.The current presidential race - as well as a pending Supreme Court nomination - will only increase gun owners anxieties and boost sales.What's more, SWHC sold off in recent months and is now a bargain. 16.5% (  ) is a play on the cashless society. It is basically the middle man between merchants and consumers. The Visa stamp on your debit card means that Visa is providing the bridge for both sides of the transaction.While this isn't very ground-breaking in the U.S., it's the rest of the world where V will see its growth. Even in economic turmoil, emerging-market consumers see the value in having a form of secure cash, perhaps even more so during tough times.V is growing its base in Latin America, Europe, Africa and Asia. Both earnings and revenues were up for the first quarter, but the problem is growing consumer spending right along with the brand. This spend problem led V to readjust forward guidance for 2016 earnings down to between 7% and 8% on a constant currency basis.The best thing about that is, V is now a bargain. Even Goldman Sachs' analyst is still bullish on Visa over the long term. Get in while V is on sale. 14%Named after the goddess of victory,  (  ) was certainly named appropriately.

And for all the  (  ) is, Nike has 10 times the market capitalization.When you're looking for a bedrock stock, it's NKE that fits the bill, not UA. While UA has been growing rapidly, it has a current price-earnings of 60. It's going to be tough to keep that alive as global growth slows. NKE on the other hand, has a P/E less than half of UA's. A much better choice for a less predictable future.NKE recently rearranged its top-level management, which has shaken up some investors, but NKE has proven time and again it knows what it's doing.Get it while nobody's looking.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" reported third quarter fiscal 2016 non-GAAP earnings of $1.18 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents.

The company paid $47.5 million of cash dividends to stockholders during the Mar 2016 quarter.Lam Research provided guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.On a non-GAAP basis, the company expects revenues of approximately $1.525 billion (+/- $75 million).

Earnings per share are projected to be $1.63 (+/- 10 cents) on a share count of nearly 173 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.47 per share, so guidance was stronger than expected.Lam Research delivered mixed fiscal third quarter 2016 results with earnings outperforming our estimates but revenues lagging behind.So far, 2016 has been pretty good for the company as it continues to see strong success in the areas of device architecture, process flow and technology inflections.In the quarter just ended, Lam delivered revenues and shipments above the midpoints of the guidance. Gross margin, operating income and non-GAAP EPS were above the high-end of the guidance range.Lam Research has high hopes from KLA-Tencor Corporation  which it has acquired recently. Management expects that the combined company will contribute significantly toward sustainable growth, generating cash and creating value.Going forward, in 2016, the company sees increased adoption rates of 3D NAND technology, FinFETs and multi-patterning. It is likely to continue as the market leader in dielectric etch as Flex F and G Series dielectrics have been extremely successful products thus far. The company anticipates strong demand for leading-edge silicon in the enterprise market, driven by the long-term move to the cloud, storage and competition applications.However, concerns persist in the form of volatility and lower growth expectations globally, with slow but steady improvement in some developed markets balancing the weakness in certain emerging economies.The company believes that its strong position, combined with its commitment to customers and value-enhancing collaborations will help drive performance over the next several years.Other stocks worth considering in the technology sector are ASML Holding NV  and FEI Company  each carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Certainly, there are some sectors to avoid, but many stocks are doing far better than their earnings and the current economic forecast can support.Stock picking is crucial here. For example, buying tech stocks is a dicey game because the U.S. dollar is so strong that any sales outside the U.S. are going to be hurt when that revenue is converted back into dollars.The best approach at this point is to be choosy, looking to companies that will do well in a slow-growth climate, are domestically focused and are committed to their market.I have found seven A-rated stocks for the second quarter that will continue to grow well into 2016. Some throw off a bit of dividend and others don't. But they are all focused and ready for what's coming. (  ) is a company that builds testing and measuring equipment for the semiconductor industry, as well as the LED and data storage sectors.This certainly isn't sexy, but it's essential. Which is why KLAC has been around since 1997, working will all the industry leaders and establishing a strong industry foothold from the days before the dotcom boom. Its roots go back to the mid-'70s when KLA and Tencor were launched.That means KLAC has a strong foundation and has stood the test of time in a highly dynamic and competitive industry.Its new moves into LED and data storage reflect its ability to see ahead and steer to that course.The stock is up nearly 50% in the past six months, while still offering a nearly 3% dividend yield. There' plenty of gas left in this stock's tank. (  ) is Japan's largest mobile phone carrier. And in case you forgot, Japan boasts the third-largest national economy in the world.We don't hear too much about Japan in the news because China is now the big Asian country the talking heads smack their gums about, and it seems they can't manage to keep two competing ideas in their heads, or at least present them to their audiences.So much the better for us. It means we can buy in without having to worry about prices getting bid up as the herd comes in.For years, most of Asia analysis has been China focused, first on its growth, then on its lack of growth. But Japan has been chugging along and many Japanese companies are expanding beyond their national borders. Japanese firms own major U.S. whiskey brands as well as big insurers.But it has all flew under the radar. For example, did you know this major telecom is up 40%-plus in the past year? Can you imagine if a major U.S. carrier had those kind of returns? There would be a stampede into the stock. (  ) is the beneficiary of one ineluctable trend: the growing and shifting demand for healthcare services in the U.S.AHS provides staffing, recruitment and management services for healthcare companies and their facilities.Starting in San Diego 30 years ago, AHS has become a national force as it has been steadily acquiring local and regional players along the way.Now that the Affordable Care Act is law, big healthcare corporations and hospitals and private practices have to adjust their practices to maximize productivity. AHS allows them to do that by increasing their flexibility in hiring.AHS' released its latest earning in mid-February, illustrating why this stock is so attractive: Even in this sluggish economy, AHS posted a 44% earnings increase from the same quarter a year ago. Gross profit was up 56% and it blew the doors off of Wall Street's revenue expectations. (  ) sells skincare, beauty and lifestyle products both directly to consumers through e-commerce and through suppliers. It has operations in the U.S., China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and some parts of Europe.Part of the allure has been its foothold in Asia, where NHTC products are growing in demand thanks to the expanding middle class. These once small luxuries are now becoming the norm for many women in China, in particular. Buying higher quality products is also part of this trend.While China may be sluggish, Japan and South Korea are doing well, so NHTC doesn't live or die by mainland China.Even after a big selloff in January, the stock is up 75% for the past 12 months. The selloff has given it lots of headroom moving into 2016. (  ) is the power utility for South Korea, one of the main economic growth engines in Asia.While it is closely linked to the fate of its massive neighbor, China, South Korea is on a growth track from last year. It's expecting to see 3.1% GDP growth in 2016 vs. 2.6% in 2015. That's a good sign.Also in 2015, there was an outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory System virus, which kept people at home, afraid to venture out and risk infection.MERS is now behind the economy and there's a good chance the Korean central bank will lower interest rates this year to stimulate the economy. That's good for business and consumers. And that's good for KEP. (  ) is one of the leading handgun and firearms manufacturers in the U.S.One thing is certain, when politicians start talking about tightening gun control laws, gun sales go through the roof.And now that we're in the final stretch of the presidential election cycle (aka, the silly season), the gun control rhetoric is flying. It's no wonder SWHC rallied 17% just in February. It also helped that the company reported strong earnings for the quarter.The stock has come off its recent highs, but that's to be expected - SWHC has risen more than 100% in the past 12 months. This small pullback is a good chance to get in before the next leg up. (  ) celebrates it 150th year in business this year.What started as a small door and sash company out of St. Louis has become a national manufacturer and distributor of doors, millwork, building materials and wood products.It has 27 distribution centers that serve commercial homebuilders and contractors in 41 states.HBP only sports a $93 million market cap, but it certainly makes up in experience what it lacks in size. When you have been able to maintain a successful company in a highly competitive and volatile industry for 150 years, you're doing a lot of things right.HBP is up almost 30% in the past 12 months, and as the U.S. economy improves, so will HBP's prospects.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" reported second-quarter fiscal 2016 non-GAAP earnings of $1.57 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a good 15 cents.

(Symbol: KLAC) stock, but tentative about paying the going market price of $65.18/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2017 put at the $52.50 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.30. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.5% return against the $52.50 commitment, or a 2.5% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to KLAC's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $52.50 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless KLA-Tencor Corp. sees its shares fall 19.4% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $51.20 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.30 from $52.50), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 2.5% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for KLA-Tencor Corp., and highlighting in green where the $52.50 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2017 put at the $52.50 strike for the 2.5% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for KLA-Tencor Corp. (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $65.18) to be 30%.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  the  (  ),  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .U.S. stocks ended an awful January in which investors fled from stocks and invested in safe haven assets, including government bonds and gold. The S&P 500 shed 5.1% in January, its biggest monthly loss since Aug 15. The index also posted its worst January performance since 2009. Not only has it been a harrowing month for the index, investors have had to deal with a continuous slump in  that set the Federal Reserve doubting the health of the global economyAccording to Dow Jones data, it has been the choppiest January for the S&P 500 since 2008. In fact, the S&P 500 had at one point touched a loss of 11% last week before recovering on Bank of Japan's surprise decision to trim a key interest rate into negative territory to still end the month in the red. Additionally, China's economic growth losing momentum, concerns about domestic economic growth and lackluster corporate earnings results dampened investor sentiment.The very same factors are continuing to haunt the stock market in February. Renewed decline in oil prices and signs of sluggish Chinese economic growth compelled the S&P 500 to finish modestly in the red on Monday. Weak U.S. manufacturing data also weighed on investors' confidence.Considering S&P 500's drop from its earlier high it seems that the index is nearing a bear market. The S&P 500 is now 10% off its May 21 record high of 2,130.82 and would be in a bear market if it touches 1,706. The index is already in correction mode. Hence, in this scenario, it would be prudent to invest in top-shelf dividend companies. The recent sell-off has pushed their dividend yields up while the stock market downturn has dragged their share prices down.Let's look at the factors that plagued the markets last month.The slump in global oil prices mostly due to lower demand in an already oversupplied market affected the broader markets. Meanwhile, Iran prepares to add its barrels to a glutted global oil market and Russia continues to pump in oil to boost its ailing economy.On the other hand, jitters about China's weak economy following dismal economic reports raised concerns about the demand for oil. Through the end of January, U.S. crude dropped nearly 12%, which is almost 40% less than what it used to cost a year ago.Moreover, U.S. crude slipped 6.3% during the first trading day of February, under pressure from weak manufacturing data out of China, forecast of a mild weather and doubts about OPEC and non-OPEC countries coming to terms to curtail the rising global supply glut issue.Chinese manufacturing activity contracted at the fastest pace in January since Aug 2012. The purchasing managers' index (PMI) came in at 49.4 in January, lower than the previous month's reading of 49.7. The index contracted for the sixth consecutive month.The Chinese stock market crashed this year, frightening investors worldwide. Chinese stocks tanked around 40% from their June peaks. Chinese banks aren't accepting stocks as warranty for loans, while bank loans in China declined drastically indicating investors' lack of faith in the Chinese markets.China plunged into a bear market territory last month, while other nations throughout the world including United Kingdom, France, Germany and Japan also entered a bear market. This global meltdown is expected to have a significantly negative impact on the U.S. economy.U.S. exporters aren't the only ones to be affected by weak global economic growth; domestic commodity producers are also feeling the pain because of weak global demand and low commodity prices. So far, 207 S&P 500 members have reported fourth-quarter earnings. Total earnings for these companies are down 3.1% from the same period last year on 3.1% lower revenues.Meanwhile, the fourth-quarter GDP growth rate came in at 0.7%, lower than the 2% rate of growth in the third quarter. Lower consumer expenditures, falling exports and a decline in business investment were cited as the main reasons behind this slowdown. Moreover, U.S. manufacturing activity contracted in January for the fourth straight month.The International Monetary Fund also trimmed its 2016 forecast for U.S. economic growth to 2.6% from an earlier forecast of 2.8%. This discouraging financial and economic scenario compelled the Fed to keep the interest rate unchanged in January. The Fed also said that it will monitor global economic developments before deciding on a rate hike in March.History says don't expect stocks to move north in February after they had nose-dived in January.

Not only that, it had registered a meager gain of 1.18% in the remaining eleven months of that year.In this scenario, where the stock market is moving downward, it will be wise to invest in dividend paying stocks.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include the  (  ),  (  ),  ,  (  ) and  (  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .After logging a record performance in October, stocks have continued to rise higher. Markets gained significantly on Monday and stuck to their winning ways on Tuesday.Yesterday's highlight was the remarkable performance of the Nasdaq 100. The index gained 0.3% yesterday to reach 4,719.05, breaching the previous high set during the dotcom bubble in 2000. The technology-heavy index had set a record closing high of 4,704.73 on Mar 27, 2000.There are clear indications that markets may continue to move upward for the rest of the month. In this situation, betting on stocks which have made impressive price gains recently and have significant momentum may be a prudent move.Firstly, the index, which comprises the largest non-financial stocks listed on the Nasdaq Composite, has been lifted by broader market optimism. Construction spending increased 0.3% in September while the final Markit manufacturing PMI increased to 54.1, its highest level in six months.Apart from positive economic indicators, familiar fears about the economic situation in China have eased following last month's rate cut. Dovish signals from the European Central Bank have also boosted investor sentiment.While healthcare is on a rebound, it is the tech sector which has lifted the broader markets recently. This trend is likely to continue going forward, unless a December rate hike is announced. Even this is unlikely to faze investors, who may have already priced in such a situation.There are some fears that the Nasdaq 100 may slide lower, given that it has exceeded its dotcom bubble levels. Though valuations are high, they are not even close to those witnessed at the time of the millennial crash. Additionally, yesterday's intraday high of 4,735.31 was well short of the record intraday high of 4,816.35 attained on Mar 24, 2000.This is why it may be a good idea to latch onto the index's strong momentum and invest in some of its best performing stocks.

Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .In this 79-month old Bull market, the easy money has already been made. There is nothing quite cheap, unless it's justifiably so.Today, it's all about the next earnings beat story or the latest merger deal or even a brand-new CEO. Welcome to the new Wall Street world of fast markets, fast money and jam-packed trades - where a single piece of news can shoot a stock's price sky high or squash months of gains in a single day.In such precarious times, value, growth or income investing might just fall short of making sustained profits for your portfolio.There is another, time-tested winning strategy: simply bet on the frontrunner stocks that are galloping fast. One of the most successful strategies today is to get in on momentum stocks at the right time.In this market, in a sense, everyone is a momentum trader, scouring for the next hot sector or stock where they can turn a fast profit. This is because momentum stocks have proven to be high fliers in every market setting. But amid all the ups and downs, how will investors distinguish between companies that are just taking a breather before their next leg up from those running on a dead track?More importantly, how shall we separate the ones just running a sprint from those set for a marathon?When we scour for pacesetter stocks that are galloping ahead on strong momentum, we also need to make sure that we don't bet on those which seem off-the-bridle. For instance, small-cap stocks, with their comparatively deeper risk profile, tend to react much more aggressively to events. Thus, pullbacks or turnarounds also happen faster for these companies, and investors may not get out fast enough to avoid getting trapped.Hence, we will focus on large-caps, which are big, established companies in the stock market, and have been around for a while. By virtue of their dominant market position, global footprint and relatively consistent cash flow stream, these companies tend to be more reliable investments.And when these thoroughbreds, most of which are common household names, gain momentum on an upswing, it's safe to assume that there is some strong rationale for the move.Notwithstanding the captivating, time-proven strategy and robust fundamentals, the question remains: When to get in?Here we usher in our new  . The Zacks Momentum Style Score indicates when the timing is best to grab a stock and take advantage of its momentum with the highest probability of success. Back-tested results show that stocks with Style Scores of 'A' or 'B,' when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) handily outperform other stocks.A top Momentum Style Score knocks out a lot of the screening process as it takes into account several factors including volume change and performance relative to its peers.Flaunting a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 and a Momentum Style Score of 'A,' the following stocks are marching ahead, full steam, and still appear to have plenty of upside left. Further, these companies, with a market capitalization north of $10 billion, have been seeing positive analyst interest of late. (  )Headquartered in Redwood City, CA, Electronic Arts produces top-selling games and related content and services under the EA brand in various categories, including action-adventure, role playing, racing and first-person shooter games. This company is a leading video game developer that should benefit from not only the continuing rise in new console sales, but the rising trend of mobile gaming.With a market cap of $22.5 billion, EA currently holds a Zacks Rank #1. Over the past month, analysts have become increasingly bullish on the company. The company has seen a sharp spike in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2015, which now stands at $2.67, up from $2.50 a month back.

The company has a market cap of $294.6 billion and currently holds a Zacks Rank #2.Not only does the stock have impressive short-term momentum, it has been witnessing solid activity on the earnings estimate revision front as well. Analysts clearly see good things in the company's future, as the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2015 earnings has trended sharply up over the past month, from $1.52 to $1.79 per share, thanks to 8 upward estimate revisions versus just 4 lower. (  )KLA-Tencor designs, manufactures and markets process control and yield management solutions globally.

KLA-Tencor has seen 7 positive revisions over the past 4 weeks, resulting in its fiscal 2016 estimate climbing from $3.34 to $3.56.

That spread refers to the price of the refining outputs from a barrel of crude and the price of crude. When a barrel is much cheaper than the sum of its parts, refiners do very well.

(  )Texas Instruments Incorporated designs, manufactures and sells semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers globally. The chipmaker continues to prudently invest into several high-margin, high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets.

I simply looked at the stock market: \"It's getting hot in here!\"Following August's market rout and the slump in September, stocks staged a dramatic comeback in October turning the heat up.In fact, it was the \"hottest\" month in four years.Why?Because the U.S. stock indexes posted the highest monthly gain since 2011.Let's look at the major indexes for October-\n  \nWhat propelled the stocks? In our view, 3 things:Aided by strong earnings reports and continued consolidation in the semiconductor industry, the technology sector witnessed excellent returns during the period.Here is a list of 4 tech stocks that had a stellar October.We expect this trend to continue in the near term since all these stocks have a favorable Zacks Rank as well as an attractive Growth and Momentum Style score.Our Growth Style Score condenses all the essential metrics from the company's financial statements to achieve a true sense of quality and sustainability of its growth. Our research shows that stocks with Growth Style Scores of 'A' or 'B' when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) offer the best investment opportunities in the growth investing space.October Return: 34.24%Zacks Rank #2Growth Style Score: BMomentum Style Score: AKLA-Tencor's first-quarter fiscal 2016 earnings of 71 cents a share, topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents by 26.8%. Apart from this, what drove the shares higher was its decision to merge with semiconductor equipment maker, Lam Research Corp.  .The acquisition is expected to be accretive to earnings and cash flow in the first 12 months following the closure. The companies expect to realize $250 million in annual ongoing pre-tax cost synergies within the next one-and-a-half to two years and $600 million by 2020.The merger of these two companies will create an equipment powerhouse with a massive range of products, customer base and scale. The increased integration and efficiency of operations could also help the combined entity drive further extension of Moore's Law.October Return: 22.40%Zacks Rank #2Growth Style Score: AMomentum Style Score: AAmazon's stock was driven mainly by robust quarterly results. The company's adjusted EPS came in at 17 cents, much better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 10 cents. Revenues of $25.4 billion beat the consensus estimate of $24.851 billion and increased 23% year over year from $20.6 billion.In the recently reported quarter, AWS was the biggest positive. Its revenue share was steady, while operating profit margin expanded 1,660 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter, operating profit dollars skyrocketed 431.6% (511% ex-FX). Accounting for just 8% of revenues, AWS comprised more than 52% of profit.October Return: 33.50%Zacks Rank #2Growth Style Score: BMomentum Style Score: BFirst Solar reported adjusted third-quarter 2015 earnings of $3.38 a share sweeping past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.55 by 118.1%.First Solar is steadily expanding its global footprint. The company primarily caters to the North American market but is also keen on securing a larger market share. Like the other solar majors, such as Canadian Solar and SunPower, the company is looking to expand its operations in the Middle East, India, Japan, Australia and South America. Expansion into other geographies would lead to both top-line and margin growth.First Solar is able to develop economically sustainable businesses as it has established its expertise in PV generation solutions as well as in other areas of the solar-value chain, such as project development, EPC capabilities and O&M services. It continues to focus on retaining its competitive edge and aims to further consolidate its position in the market. The company's R&D investments are also proving beneficial.October Return: 18.50%Zacks Rank #2Growth Style Score: AMomentum Style Score: ACitrix Systems beat third-quarter earnings and revenue estimates and issued a bullish view.The cloud-computing company's earnings (excluding special items) came in at 87 cents per share, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 20 cents and up 53% from the year-ago quarter. Higher-than-expected revenues contributed to the earnings beat.Citrix expects revenues in the range of $3.24 billion to $3.25 billion for 2015. Earnings per share (on an adjusted basis) are projected in the range of $3.85 to $3.90. These projections are much higher than the 2015 Zacks Consensus Estimates of $2.97 per share in earnings on revenues of $3.23 billion.We believe that 2015 is playing out just as it should - easy profits from this 6-year bull market have already been earned and valuations are near fully engorged. Gladly, there is not much fear of a bear market, either.When you add it all up, it says the bull market is still on, only the pace is slowing down to around 5% per year.I agree that doesn't sound quite attractive. But compared with the subdued returns for cash, bonds and precious metals, it is a pretty fair deal.Though early in a bull market there are many hidden gems that can generate substantial returns, it has been six years and nearly every stone has been turned.So don't go looking for a needle in a haystack... it ain't there!

(Symbol: KLAC) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $2.08), with the stock changing hands as low as $69.21 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. KLA-Tencor Corp. (Symbol: KLAC) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of KLA-Tencor Corp., looking at the history chart for KLAC below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.    According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, KLAC makes up 3.05% of the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (Symbol: SOXX) which is trading lower by about 0.8% on the day Thursday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Technology ETF (Symbol: RYT) where we have detected an approximate $50.7 million dollar inflow -- that's a 6.8% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 8,100,000 to 8,650,000). Among the largest underlying components of RYT, in trading today SanDisk Corp. (Symbol: SNDK) is off about 0.7%, Autodesk Inc. (Symbol: ADSK) is off about 2.1%, and KLA-Tencor Corp. (Symbol: KLAC) is up by about 0.3%.  The chart below shows the one year price performance of RYT, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, RYT's low point in its 52 week range is $75.85 per share, with $95.69 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $90.98. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n this 79-month old Bull market, the easy money has already been made. There is nothing quite cheap, unless it's justifiably so.Today, it's all about the next earnings beat story or the latest merger deal or even a brand-new CEO. Welcome to the new Wall Street world of fast markets, fast money and jam-packed trades - where a single piece of news can shoot a stock's price sky high or squash months of gains in a single day.In such precarious times, value, growth or income investing might just fall short of making sustained profits for your portfolio.There is another, time-tested winning strategy: simply bet on the frontrunner stocks that are galloping fast. One of the most successful strategies today is to get in on momentum stocks at the right time.In this market, in a sense, everyone is a momentum trader, scouring for the next hot sector or stock where they can turn a fast profit. This is because momentum stocks have proven to be high fliers in every market setting. But amid all the ups and downs, how will investors distinguish between companies that are just taking a breather before their next leg up from those running on a dead track?More importantly, how shall we separate the ones just running a sprint from those set for a marathon?When we scour for pacesetter stocks that are galloping ahead on strong momentum, we also need to make sure that we don't bet on those which seem off-the-bridle. For instance, small-cap stocks, with their comparatively deeper risk profile, tend to react much more aggressively to events. Thus, pullbacks or turnarounds also happen faster for these companies, and investors may not get out fast enough to avoid getting trapped.Hence, we will focus on large-caps, which are big, established companies in the stock market, and have been around for a while. By virtue of their dominant market position, global footprint and relatively consistent cash flow stream, these companies tend to be more reliable investments.And when these thoroughbreds, most of which are common household names, gain momentum on an upswing, it's safe to assume that there is some strong rationale for the move.Notwithstanding the captivating, time-proven strategy and robust fundamentals, the question remains: When to get in?Here we usher in our new  . The Zacks Momentum Style Score indicates when the timing is best to grab a stock and take advantage of its momentum with the highest probability of success. Back-tested results show that stocks with Style Scores of 'A' or 'B,' when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) handily outperform other stocks.A top Momentum Style Score knocks out a lot of the screening process as it takes into account several factors including volume change and performance relative to its peers.Flaunting a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 and a Momentum Style Score of 'A,' the following stocks are marching ahead, full steam, and still appear to have plenty of upside left.

A whole lot, say experts. And it's generally a whole lotta good.With top-line growth scarce, chipmakers are finding that volume and scale line the path to higher profits. That's creating the perfect space for mergers and acquisitions, says Angelo Zino, a technology equity analyst for S&P Capital IQ.\"The best and quickest way to get more volume is via M&A,\" he said.IShares PHLX Semiconductor (  ) got a boost Wednesday from two mega deals:Western Digital 's (  ) $19 billion bid forSanDisk (  ) andLam Research 's (  ) $10.6 billion merger withKLA (  ).SOXX, which holds 30 stocks, allocates roughly 10% of assets to SanDisk, Lam and KLA combined.It also holdsIntel (INTC), which in June bid forAltera (ALTR) in a $17 billion deal, andAvago Technologies (AVGO), which in May said it would pay $37 billion forBroadcom (BRCM).Chip  should view M&A in the space favorably, Zino said. Stocks of target companies could see potentially significant upside by the time the deal's done.Acquirers tend to gain too.Western Digital, known for its hard-disk drives, could see its SSD-Nand revenue jump to 32% of total revenue from 6% by acquiring flash memory maker SanDisk.\"It allows them to buy growth,\" Zino said. \"They're buying diversification, they're buying scale.\"That's something chipmakers are hungry for. They're hurting from slowing demand for PCs and tablets in saturated markets globally, as well as what was until recently a key industry driver.\"The deceleration of growth is most significant from the smartphone end of things,\" Zino said.Chip stocks were mauled in the most recent quarter, which saw the broad market lose roughly 6%. SOXX tanked by 11% in Q3 andSPDR S&P Semiconductor (XSD), which skews toward smaller caps, 12%. Those steep losses were driven by soft guidance after Q2 results from key players such asTexas Instruments (TXN), said Neena Mishra, director of ETF research for Zacks .Investors also agonized over a slowing macro economy, especially in China, where consumers have a big appetite for electronic devices.But chip ETFs have rallied in October. SOXX is up 8%, XSD 10%. They're high-risk, high-reward bets for  .\"In the shorter term, any improvement in the China economic outlook and better-than-expected guidance will continue to support the rally,\" Mishra said.Signs that the worst may be over are emerging. Texas Instruments soared 12% on the  as the Dallas chipmaker raised its fourth-quarter outlook.And Intel handily beat estimates Oct. 13, with the chip giant reporting solid growth in its data center and Internet of Things units.Mishra, like Zino, views industry consolidation as a positive.\"In general, mergers can reduce price competition, trim costs and also support development of newer, better technologies in high-growth areas,\" she explained.The personal computer market is also stabilizing after a tough first half, which should benefit semiconductor companies, Zino said. Plus, the holiday season, a boom time for tech gift-buying, is approaching.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ast week,  reported first-quarter fiscal 2016 earnings of 71 cents a share, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents by 26.8%. The company also announced its merger with semiconductor equipment maker Lam Research Corp.KLA also announced that Lam Research  has agreed to acquire its business in a cash and stock deal worth $5.08 billion. The acquisition is expected to be accretive to earnings and cash flow in the first 12 months following the closure. The companies expect to realize $250 million in annual ongoing pre-tax cost synergies within 1.5 to 2 years and $600 million by 2020. The merger of these two companies creates an equipment powerhouse with a huge range of products, customer breadth and scale. The increased integration and efficiency of operations could also help the combined entity drive further extension of Moore's Law.Let's take a look at the fiscal Q1 numbers:KLA reported revenues of $642.6 million, down 15.0% sequentially and consistent with the year-ago quarter, above the guided range of $595-655 million.Products generated 72% of total revenue, down 20.5% sequentially and 3.3% year over year. Management said that the timing of capital investments at the leading edge and investments for capacity expansion at customers pushed out some product revenue related to the quarter. Services revenue comprised the remaining 28%, up 3.0% sequentially and 9.4% year over year. Services related to post-warranty- period installed systems drove revenue.The biggest contributor by geography was Taiwan, which accounted for 40% of revenue. This was followed by the U.S. (17%), Korea (11%), Japan (11%) and Europe & Israel 6%. Other Asian countries generated 15%. Taiwan (up 8.2% sequentially, 100.7% year over year) and other Asian countries (up 23.2% sequentially, 12.1% year over year) were the most significant geographies in terms of growth.KLA's gross margin expanded 19 basis points (bps) sequentially and 318 bps year over year to 58.7%, better than guided. Positive product mix and lower service charges and costs were almost totally offset by lower volumes and reduced manufacturing efficiencies in the sequential comparison while mix, manufacturing efficiencies and lower service costs were all positive in the year-over-year comparison.Operating expenses of $206.0 million were down 3.9% sequentially, 14.2% from a year ago due to restructuring actions taken earlier in the year. The operating margin shrank 353 bps sequentially but expanded 845 bps from last year to 26.7%.The pro forma net income was $112.2 million, or 17.5% of sales compared to $158.9 million, or 21.0% in the Jun 2015 quarter and $78.7 million, or 12.2% in the Sep quarter of last year. Including one-time restructuring and acquisition-related charges a on a tax-adjusted basis, the GAAP net income was $104.9 million ($0.66 a share) compared to $142.0 million ($0.89 a share) in the previous quarter and $72.2 million ($0.43 a share) in the year-ago quarter.KLA ended with a cash and short term investments balance of $2.27 billion, down $117.7 million from the previous quarter. During the quarter, the company generated $193.8 million of cash from operations, spending $7.3 million on capital expenses, $142.6 million on share repurchases and $101.7 million on dividends.While uncertainties about the timing of capital equipment purchases remain for the leading provider of process control equipment, its acquisition by Lam Research is a positive for investors.The biggest positive this calendar year (the company's fiscal year ends in June) will be 3D NAND deployments and the combination with Lam will further help in that respect. FinFET transition at foundries also remains a positive. Logic is unlikely to get exciting given Intel's (INTC) pushout.KLA shares currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better technology stocks to invest in at the moment are Facebook  and MeetMe  both of which have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Shares of  rose as much as 10.5% on Wednesday and  investors saw their stock make a 25% jump. The two moves share the same catalyst, as Lam is  KLA-Tencor in a blockbuster $10.6 billion deal. Lam's offer of $32 per KLA-Tencor share comes in a combination of cash and stock, so the final price tag will move along with Lam's share prices. The deal has been approved by the boards of both companies, awaiting approval from shareholders and the usual regulatory bodies. If all goes as planned, the merger should close in the summer of 2016.It's rare to see both partners in a freshly announced merger move up on the news, but that's exactly what happened here. The proposed pairing may be structured as a buyout of KLA-Tencor but is more of a merger of equals: The two market caps stand just 14% apart, though Lam's sales are about twice the size of KLA-Tencor's revenue streams.The new company plans to stick with the Lam Research name and ticker, adopting Lam Research CEO Martin Anstice as its first CEO.And with financial debt of just 1.5 times trailing EBITDA profits, Eros compares well with stateside rivals at 3.4 times EBITDA, or , whose ratio stands at 2.8. Lions Gate and CBS are also increasing their effective debt load, while Eros is reducing its own.Both companies also reported quarterly results alongside the merger news. KLA-Tencor saw flat year-over-year revenue growth while earnings jumped 51% higher, easily beating analyst estimates in the process. Lam Research met Wall Street's revenue targets while exceeding earnings targets, reporting 8% higher sales and 21% stronger adjusted earnings.So this was not a move born of desperation, but rather two strong competitors joining forces at a strategically sensible point.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Last quarter, it posted a 1.6% negative surprise. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.KLA-Tencor reported modest fourth quarter results with the top line missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate while the bottom line surpassed the same. Revenues were up 2.4% sequentially and 3% from the year-ago quarter and were above the guided range of $550-750 millionThe company remains focused on the memory side, particularly 3D NAND, with uncertainties continuing in other areas particularly logic.Uncertainties about the timing of capital equipment purchases are weighing on the company's results. The biggest positive this calendar year (the company's fiscal year ends in June) will be 3D NAND deployments by memory makers and FinFET transition at foundries. Logic will remain weak throughout.In this environment, we think management cut headcount at just the right time and also announced a higher dividend to shareholders, which speaks of good execution.For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, KLA expects orders of $450-650 million and shipments of $610-690 million. Quarterly revenues are expected to be between $595 million and $655 million. Non-GAAP EPS is expected in the range of 46 cents to 66 cents.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Texas Instruments will beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 56 cents. Therefore, the Earnings ESP for the stock is 0.00%.

So first let's take up the challenges.As outlined in the second part of this series, independent market research from IDC, Gartner and the CEA (U.S.) indicate weakness in tablets and slowdown in smartphone shipments this year. This is the single largest negative for manufacturers right now. The PC market decline is also expected to be greater than earlier expectations, which adds to the pressure.Most mobile devices use chips that are produced by specialized foundries in very large volumes. Moreover, since they have shorter lifecycles, their demand is more or less steady. Because of the very high cost of building, equipping and producing in these foundries, the large volumes are essential for generating profits. So when there is any reduction in demand, the foundries take it on the chin.Other segments involved in manufacturing are memory and logic makers, which are holding up better because of their broader application across markets.The industry is also highly cyclical because when demand enters a growth phase, manufacturing demands increase, which results in higher sales for equipment makers. And when they reduce spending, there is a backlash on equipment providers. Because of the increased discipline, recycling of existing equipment and relatively lower capacity additions by manufacturers in recent years, semiconductor equipment sales have also languished.Technology transitions are helping equipment makers however (although increasing cost pressures for manufacturers). These include:Because of the costs and degree of specialization involved, most of the equipment comes from a handful of suppliers. In fact, according to VLSI Research, the top 10 wafer fab equipment (WFE) suppliers accounted for 82% of the market in 2014. Applied Materials (  ), ASML, Tokyo Electron, Lam Research and KLA-Tencor (  ) remained the top five vendors of wafer fab and semiconductor equipment in 2014. It was a good year for equipment companies with Tokyo Electron and Applied Materials gaining share, KLA remaining strong in process control and Lam Research (  ) leading in ECP.Lam Research is a solid pick this year because its capabilities in deposition, etch, multi-pattering and TSV, and exposure to WFE and 3D NAND segments. The Zacks Rank #1 company has a good history of positive earnings surprises and its estimates for this year and the next are also up.The recent currency devaluation should have been a negative for semi equipment makers, but the fear seems unfounded because there is no abatement in the demand for chips. If anything, Chinese demand for semiconductors continues to increase. Yes, it's true that the Chinese government is trying to develop the domestic industry which can once done affect demand. But for now, any development activity will involve U.S. players.For instance, a Qualcomm (  ) subsidiary, Semiconductor Manufacturing International (SMI), and China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund Co., Ltd., (CICIIF) are looking to make a joint investment of $280 million in Chinese company SJ Semiconductor Corp to build out 12 inch capabilities slated for mass production next year. The goal is to make a facility of global standards indicating a reliance on U.S. equipment players.Chinese foundry SMI currently has a Zacks Rank #3, but given that it posted triple-digit positive surprises in the last two quarters and its 2015 and 2016 estimates up 40% and 21%, respectively, the stock could be worth tracking.Gartner says that foundries grew 16.1% last year, led by Taiwan Semiconductor (  ), United Microelectronics (  ), Globalfoundries, Samsung and SMI. Ultra mobile devices, wearables and Apple's iPhones, as well as more IDM revenue shift to foundries were the attributed factors driving demand. Intel didn't make the list partly because it doesn't broadly sell foundry services.But Intel (  ) and Samsung are the two largest spenders, followed by TSM. So when Intel and TSM decided to reduce capex for the year, equipment suppliers saw share prices slump. Samsung said little at the time it announced earnings, but is consuming more of its own chips. It has also won more semiconductor business from Apple and looks set to score other wins. Media reports indicate that it will spend $14 billion on equipment this year. TechNavio expects the global foundry segment to grow at a CAGR of 8.4% from 2014 to 2019.The semiconductor industry is made up of 10 sub-sectors within the Technology sector, which is one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors. The following table seeks to explain the position of companies in the semiconductor market in the context of the Zacks Industry Rank.We rank the 264 industries across the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. To learn more visit:  .The outlook for industries positioned #88 or lower is 'Positive,' between #89 and #176 is 'Neutral' and #177 and higher is 'Negative.'As indicated in the table above, the first two semiconductor segments are positive, the next one is neutral, while the rest are negative.The average rank of stocks in each sub-sector is indicated in the last column [Note: Zacks Rank #1 for individual stocks denotes Strong Buy, #2 is Buy, #3 means Hold, #4 Sell and #5 Strong Sell].Practically all of the companies in the broader Technology sector, of which Semiconductors constitute a part, have reported Q2 results.

(Symbol: KLAC) were yielding above the 4% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $2.08), with the stock changing hands as low as $51.55 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 4% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable.

(Symbol: KLAC) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of KLA-Tencor Corp., looking at the history chart for KLAC below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 4% annual yield.

Intel is a major customer for KLA.Since KLA sells process control equipment that improves efficiency of operations, it is particularly helpful for foundries. Management expects foundries to spend on FinFET as we move through the rest of the year, so this will be a positive for the company.Some time back, KLA started increasing exposure to the memory segment, which is proving to be a good decision in the current environment. The company saw a big jump in orders from this segment.Of course what all this boils down to is that WFE spending is unlikely to play to KLA's strengths this year. Management started the year with the announcement of a 10% reduction in headcount that they said were designed to streamline operations, align product development efforts to changing industry demand and also allow investment in new areas. But earlier in July, they raised the dividend by a couple of cents, so investors wouldn't be disappointed.A quick look at the numbers-KLA reported revenues of $756.3 million, up 2.4% sequentially and 3.0% from the year-ago quarter, above the guided range of $550-750 million and 1just short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Products generated 77% of total revenue, up 2.6% sequentially and 1.6% year over year. Services revenue comprised the remaining 23%, up 1.9% sequentially and 7.7% year over year.New orders in the fourth quarter were $672 million, down 2.9% sequentially, 25.2% year over year and better than the guided $550-750 million.Memory accounted for 62% of total orders in the last quarter, up 249.2% sequentially and 81.3% year over year. Foundry was next with a 33% share, down 58.4% sequentially and 67.4% from last year. Logic brought in a mere 5% of orders, declining 31.6% and 62.6%, respectively from the previous and year-ago quarters.Shipments were up sequentially and year over year to $739 million although not as strong as expected. Management attributed the weakness to the push out of a high-ASP reticle inspection system, adjustments at a foundry customer moving to a sub 20nm process and an accident at a customer's fab that also pushed out some shipments.Backlog was down 7.7% sequentially and consistent with the year-ago quarter. Backlog excluding the value shipped but not recognized as revenue was also down 7.7% sequentially.KLA's gross margin expanded 155 basis points (bps) sequentially and 264 bps year over year to 58.5%, in the middle of the guided range. Management said that mix was the strongest factor affecting the gross margin in any quarter.Operating expenses of $214.3 million were down 1.8% sequentially, 7.2% from a year ago due to restructuring actions taken earlier in the year. The operating margin expanded 278 bps sequentially and 574 bps from last year to 30.2%.The pro forma net income was $158.9 million, or 21.0% of sales compared to $137.4 million, or 18.6% in the Mar 2015 quarter and $133.2 million, or 18.1% in the Jun quarter of last year. Including one-time restructuring and acquisition-related charges a on a tax-adjusted basis, the GAAP net income was $142.0 million ($0.89 a share) compared to $131.6 million ($0.81 a share) in the previous quarter and $128.7 million ($0.77 a share) in the year-ago quarter.KLA ended with a cash and short term investments balance of $2.34 billion, down $27.0 million from the previous quarter. During the quarter, the company generated $242.4 million of cash from operations, spending $10.3 million on capital expenses, $168.7 million on share repurchases and $82.3 million on dividends.For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, KLA expects orders of $450-650 million and shipments of $610-690 million. Quarterly revenues are expected to be between $595 million and $655 million, gross margin of 56-57% and opex 212 million. The tax rate is expected to be 22% and yielding non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.46 - $0.66, an extremely wide range and missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.90 by a wide margin. The weak guidance is mainly because of increased uncertainties related to the timing of orders and weak demand, which is having an effect on order shipments, revenue and therefore, margins.KLA-Tencor reported a moderate quarter dampened by a very weak guidance. Uncertainties about the timing of capital equipment purchases are weighing on the company's results. The biggest positive this calendar year (the company's fiscal year ends in June) will be 3D NAND deployments by memory makers and FinFET transition at foundries. Logic will remain weak throughout.In this environment, we think management cut headcount at just the right time and also announced a higher dividend to shareholders, which speak of good execution.KLA shares currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but considering the weak guidance, we expected estimates to come down, which could push it to a lower rank.Better technology stocks to invest in at the moment are LendingClub  and Healthstream  both of which have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), or Google  , which has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

This translates into a 4% increase from the prior dividend of 50 cents.The increased dividend will be effective with KLA-Tencor's quarterly dividend to be declared in Aug 2015.The strength of KLA's business model is reflected in its strong cash generation capabilities and commitment to return value to shareholders. We believe that the continued increase in dividends will inspire investors' loyalty through higher returns.KLA's strong balance sheet and cash flows provide financial flexibility required for dividend hikes, share repurchases and strategic acquisitions.

So first let's take up the challenges.As outlined in the second part of this series, independent market research from IDC, Gartner and the CEA (U.S.) indicate weakness in tablets and slowdown in smartphone shipments this year. This is the single largest negative for manufacturers right now. The PC market decline is also expected to be greater than earlier expectations, which adds to the pressure.Most mobile devices use chips that are produced by specialized foundries in very large volumes. Moreover, since they have shorter lifecycles, their demand is more or less steady. Because of the very high cost of building, equipping and producing in these foundries, the large volumes are essential for generating profits. So when there is any reduction in demand, the foundries take it on the chin.Other segments involved in manufacturing are memory and logic makers, which are holding up better because of their broader application across markets.The industry is also highly cyclical because when demand enters a growth phase, manufacturing demands increase, which results in higher sales for equipment makers. And when they reduce spending, there is a backlash on equipment providers. Because of the increased discipline, recycling of existing equipment and relatively lower capacity additions by manufacturers in recent years, semiconductor equipment sales have also languished.Technology transitions are helping equipment makers however (although increasing cost pressures for manufacturers). These include: Because of the costs and degree of specialization involved, most of the equipment comes from a handful of suppliers. In fact, according to VLSI Research, the top 10 wafer fab equipment (WFE) suppliers accounted for 82% of the market in 2014. Applied Materials (  ), ASML, Tokyo Electron, Lam Research and KLA-Tencor (  ) remained the top five vendors of wafer fab and semiconductor equipment in 2014. It was a good year for equipment companies with Tokyo Electron and Applied Materials gaining share, KLA remaining strong in process control and Lam Research (  ) leading in ECP.Lam Research is a solid pick this year because its capabilities in deposition, etch, multi-pattering and TSV, and exposure to WFE and 3D NAND segments. The Zacks Rank #1 company has a good history of positive earnings surprises and its estimates for this year and the next are also up.The recent currency devaluation should have been a negative for semi equipment makers, but the fear seems unfounded because there is no abatement in the demand for chips. If anything, Chinese demand for semiconductors continues to increase. Yes, it's true that the Chinese government is trying to develop the domestic industry which can once done affect demand. But for now, any development activity will involve U.S. players.For instance, a Qualcomm (  ) subsidiary, Semiconductor Manufacturing International (SMI), and China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund Co., Ltd., (CICIIF) are looking to make a joint investment of $280 million in Chinese company SJ Semiconductor Corp to build out 12 inch capabilities slated for mass production next year. The goal is to make a facility of global standards indicating a reliance on U.S. equipment players.Chinese foundry SMI currently has a Zacks Rank #3, but given that it posted triple-digit positive surprises in the last two quarters and its 2015 and 2016 estimates up 40% and 21%, respectively, the stock could be worth tracking.Zacks \"Profit from the Pros\" e-mail newsletter provides highlights of the latest analysis from Zacks Equity Research.  .

In recognition of the Nasdaq-100\u2019s 30th anniversary, the Nasdaq () research team took a detailed look at this iconic index. The findings are outlined here.The index includes 100 of the largest domestic and international non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market based on market capitalization. Considered a premier large-cap growth index, the Nasdaq-100 plays a crucial role informing the investment community of performance trends for leading non-financial companies and perhaps, more importantly, provides a basis for numerous investable products. Approximately $50 billion in exchange traded products (ETPs) are benchmarked to the Nasdaq-100.Throughout the past three decades the Nasdaq-100 has evolved from the industry\u2019s \u201cTechnology Index\u201d into a leading barometer for strong, growth companies at the forefront of innovation. Companies included in the Nasdaq-100 have helped drive the modern economy and the evolution of the Index, and is a reflection of how the business world has shifted in the 21st century.When launched in 1985, the Nasdaq-100 was intended primarily to showcase the top stocks listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. It was one of two indexes launched at that time (the other being the Nasdaq Financial-100) intended to create a subset of the Nasdaq Composite Index to better support creation of derivative trading instruments such as options and futures.The Nasdaq-100 was designed as a market capitalization-weighted index, meaning the weight of a given component or company is proportional to its market cap. As indicated by the index name, the number of companies is set at 100. Since inclusion is based on rankings tied to ever-changing market capitalization, the components are periodically reconstituted. In its early years, the addition and removal of components was carried out at various points in time. That changed in 1998, when rebalancing started occurring on an annual basis in late December of each year. The additions and deletions are wholly determined by the market cap rankings, which is why many experts have stated that \u201cinvestors determine the membership of the Nasdaq-100.\u201d There is no committee making membership determinations, as is the case with other well-known indexes.From the launch of the Index on January 31, 1985, to the end of 2014, a total of 448 stocks have been members of the Nasdaq-100 at one time or another. Of the original members at launch, seven are still in the current index: Apple (), Costco (originally Price Club) (), Intel (), KLA-Tencor (), Micron Technology (), PACCAR (), and Seagate Technology (). In recent years, on average, between seven and 15 stocks are added or removed from the index each year, most of which occur at the annual rebalance date.Today\u2019s Nasdaq-100 is considered a large-cap index; however, that was not always the case. Taking a look back at the market cap of index components, one can clearly see the rapid growth in company size from 1985 to today.Since the index is made up of 100 companies, it is easy to calculate the average size of each. At launch, this figure was only about $580 million, compared with an average value of about $48 billion as of December 31, 2014, approximately an 80-fold increase. In the early days, Nasdaq was in the process of moving beyond a trading utility for non-listed OTC stocks into a distinctly recognized and branded stock market. Companies listed on Nasdaq tended to be fairly new and smaller in size, compared to the companies on NYSE or AMEX. Nasdaq's largest component was a relatively new company, Intel (IPO in 1980), with a market cap of $3.5 billion. The second and third largest were MCI and Apple, with market caps of $2.3 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. The smallest components had market caps in the range of $200 million. (By contrast, the smallest issuers in the index as of December 31, 2014 had market caps exceeding $7 billion.)It is no secret that the Nasdaq-100 is commonly viewed as the \u201cTechnology Index.\u201d In 1985, Technology was the largest, single Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB) in the Nasdaq-100, but the 23 Technology components only made up 25% of the market cap of the index. Technology was followed by Consumer Services at 21% and Industrials at 15%. The following table shows the percentage of index weight made up by Technology stocks, as well as the second largest industry by weight over the years.At the beginning of the 1990s, the Technology weight had increased to 31%, and by the middle of the decade, when the tech boom was well underway, it was up to 57%. November 1998 is noteworthy for two reasons: the continued acceleration of the bull market and the special rebalance of index weights mentioned above. At that time, Technology stocks accounted for 70% of the market cap of the index. The rebalancing reduced that weight to 61%, the value shown in the table. By the start of 2003, the market bubble had burst, but the weighting of Technology stocks remained high. The sector that saw a major decline was Telecom, which experienced a dramatic shift from about 15% down to 2% of the total weighting.The current index is still solidly Technology weighted, led by issuers such as Apple, Microsoft (), Google (), Intel and Facebook (). Still, the Nasdaq-100 is by no means a pure technology index. In fact, the current technology weight is comparatively low by historical standards. Some of the top non-technology components include:\u00a0\u00a0Nasdaq, itself a relatively new market, is generally thought of as the home for younger, growth-oriented companies. For example, 25% of the index weight for the Nasdaq-100 is from components incorporated before 1985. Half the index weight is from components incorporated after 1993, and 25% of the weight is from companies incorporated after 2000. The following table shows summary statistics for the three-year average revenue growth. The sales growth of the Nasdaq-100 components is higher on average than that of the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), but there is much more variability among these components.But, what does this all mean for the end investor? While the Nasdaq Composite Index is more widely cited in the media as a standard benchmark, the Nasdaq-100 is much more widely used as the basis for tradable products. The index has been specifically structured to promote the creation of tradable products in two ways. First, the index has a comparatively small number of components, each of which is a highly liquid security compared with indexes of 500 or 2000 components. Second, to meet diversification standards, the weighting system uses an as-needed modified market cap approach to prevent a single stock or group of stocks from having too much weight.In the late 1990s, Nasdaq began to consider the possibility of developing an exchange traded fund (ETF) patterned after the successful SPDR S&P 500 ETF that was launched in 1993. Following a slight change in the index\u2019s methodology due to tax regulations to support financial products, Nasdaq introduced the  in March 1999. At launch, the Nasdaq Stock Market was the ETF sponsor, a role that would be transferred to Invesco PowerShares in 2007. The QQQ ETF experienced astonishing growth during its first few months of operation, a clear sign showcasing investor demand for accessing a highly-liquid basket of Nasdaq companies as well as a harbinger of the forthcoming growth in the number of exchange traded products.On March 10, 1999, QQQ was launched with a per-share net asset value of about $100. At the close of that day, the fund had about $15 million in assets. By the end of March that figure had risen to $658 million. \u201cThe Qs,\u201d as it had become known, surpassed $1 billion by the middle of April and rapidly grew to over $2 billion by the middle of August. By the time of the market peak in March 2000, fund assets reached $10 billion. The ETF did a 2-for-1 split at that time, an interesting irony in light of the forthcoming market drop.The fund grew rapidly from fall 2000 through spring 2001 in spite of the market meltdown occurring at the time. It may be conjectured that the demand from investors for the ETF was far beyond that as a buy-and-hold investment vehicle. The ETF ended up being used as a hedging or speculation vehicle for traders wanting exposure to \u201ctech\u201d stocks. Evidence in this regard can be seen by looking at the \u201cturnover,\u201d defined as the dollar value of trading divided by the value of the fund. From September 2000 through April 2001, the daily turnover of the ETF averaged about 17%, an astonishingly high number for a single security. (By comparison, the daily turnover of the most active common stocks may average only 1-2%.) It is clear that QQQ, as has been the case for some other ETFs, has become a useful trading vehicle as well as investment vehicle.Currently, there are 46 ETPs tracking the Nasdaq-100 accounting for approximately $50 billion in assets. These products support a wide variety of investment objectives and range from using different index weightings, leveraged strategies, and derivatives and can be found in 13 countries including China and Singapore. The index has truly become a global staple of the financial markets, showcasing the enduring relevance of a rules-based benchmark that tracks innovative, growth-oriented companies.Going forward, investors can expect to see new products that are tied to the index, particularly as the ETF industry continues on a path of rapid expansion to one day potentially rivaling the asset base of mutual funds. And, just as the index has evolved into the world\u2019s preeminent large cap growth index over the past 30 years, the Nasdaq-100 will continue to be home to companies at the very forefront of their industries for decades to come.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ast week, I  a rumor floating that  is set to move its chip manufacturing business over to  at the 14/16-nanometer generation. Interestingly enough, Ian Ing, from MKM Partners, asked the following during the question and answer session on NVIDIA's most recent :Here is the relevant bit from NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang's response:Huang's comments, coupled with NVIDIA's  of  's 16 FinFET+ in which Senior Vice President Jeff Fisher explicitly praised the technology for both future stand-alone graphics processors  Tegra system-on-chip designs, make me doubt NVIDIA will move significant production quantities to Samsung anytime soon. Some argue NVIDIA could move its production to Samsung based on the fact that the South Korean tech giant is scheduled to begin production on 14-nanometer earlier than Taiwan Semiconductor will go into production on 16-nanometer FinFET+.Specifically, Samsung claims it is ramping 14-nanometer production this quarter, while Taiwan Semiconductor should start around July of this year.However, capacity for leading-edge technology is not just put in overnight, and many semiconductor equipment vendors -- such as  ,  , and  -- have all indicated the foundries will ramp up their FinFET technologies more in the second half of the year.While NVIDIA is a relatively large consumer of leading-edge technology (at least in discrete GPUs), it is unlikely to be first in line at the Samsung foundry while big dogs such as  ,  , and Samsung's own internal teams are all reportedly queuing up for those initial wafers.In my view, by the time NVIDIA gets ready to ramp next-generation stand-alone GPUs and the follow-on to the recently released Tegra X1, Taiwan Semiconductor should be well into production of its 16-nanometer technology. Samsung's relatively early time to market likely isn't material to NVIDIA's FinFET choice. Taiwan Semiconductor Chairman Morris Chang had the following to say in January regarding 14/16-nanometer FinFET market share in 2015-2016: \"We have a smaller market share [at the 14/16-nanometer generation] in 2015, in a smaller market; next year we'll have a larger share, in fact much larger share in a much larger market./If Chang has this kind of confidence that the market for 14/16-nanometer devices is set to rise sharply in 2016, and that his company's share within that market will increase significantly as well, this suggests a steep ramp, likely from multiple customers.I wouldn't be surprised if a next-generation Tegra after the recently announced Tegra X1, coupled with a bunch of large graphics processors from NVIDIA in that time frame, were meaningful contributors to TSMC's confidence in its FinFET share in 2016.Apple forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering Apple's brand-new gadgets.

That's why I also have a set of rules when it comes to determining if these kinds of investments will become lucrative.In fact, there are three tell-tale signs that can help you find these big-profit stocks.Let's take a look...To succeed at turnaround investing, you have to be willing to put your hard-earned money into companies with steep losses. So, the five rules I talk about so much have to go right out the window.Take the case of  (Nasdaq: FORM). This supplier of specialized test equipment to the semiconductor industry has a market cap of $509 million and trades at about $9 a share.However, the true cost of buying a share of FormFactor is closer to $6.15, because the firm has $164 million cash on hand and no debt. That gives it net cash per share of $2.75, lowering your \"true cost\" by about 30%. (If the firm were to liquidate, $6.15 is how much per share you'd be entitled to receive.)Why the discount? The company's stock sank in late 2009, after the International Trade Commission ruled that two competing firms had not infringed FormFactor's patents. It then reported losses amid a weak economy.Now, I've been \"screening\" FormFactor for a while, and after doing this math, I knew now was the time to take a closer look.I wanted to see if the Livermore, Calif.-based company triggered all three signs I use to judge whether a company is a solid turnaround candidate.It did, indeed, and that's why I'm recommending it to you today.Let's see how that works.I never even consider investing in a turnaround until I take a good look at management.I like to see fresh blood at the top for a simple reason: When companies get into trouble, it often follows from a series of bad decisions by senior management. So, if the company needs to go in a new direction, that requires execs who will bring in new ideas and approaches with them.I've been a turnaround investor ever since the early 1980s. That's when I met with Lee Iacocca, the CEO behind Chrysler Corp.'s turnaround. And as he explained to me then, if a board of directors isn't willing to change leaders, it isn't serious about righting a sinking ship.To get FormFactor moving forward, the company hired a savvy new CEO back in 2010. Thomas St. Dennis had served two stints at chip industry leader Applied Materials Inc. (Nasdaq: AMAT), where he ran the division that makes machines for semiconductor manufacturing.He had also held senior positions at a leading maker of silicon wafers and a privately held firm that makes semiconductors embedded in cars, jets, and medical products.So, he brought in a bird's-eye view of the entire global chip industry.St. Dennis immediately started installing new managers in FormFactor's executive suites. Of his six top lieutenants, four assumed their jobs since St. Dennis became CEO. In other words, he surrounded himself with proven leaders who share his goals and vision.And he recently moved one of those new hires into the top slot. Fortunately for FormFactor's investors, St. Dennis will now serve as chairman of the board, meaning we'll still have a steady hand at the top.St. Dennis's replacement previously served as CEO of MicroProbe Inc., which FormFactor acquired in late 2012.Mike Slessor, who earned a Ph.D. in aeronautics and physics at Caltech, is a seasoned semiconductor leader. Before joining MicroProbe in 2008, he held management positions at mid-cap semiconductor leader KLA-Tencor Corp. (Nasdaq: KLAC).To convince key customers, lenders, and investors that it has embarked on a new direction, a once-troubled firm has to offer more than just lip service. It must have something fresh to deliver. This can be new products, markets, or ways of doing business.In FormFactor's case, the company did all three at once by pulling off a big merger. In late 2012, it agreed to acquire MicroProbe for $100 million in cash and roughly $16 million in stock.The merger made FormFactor the semiconductor industry's largest supplier of probe cards. These are printed circuit boards specially designed to check the quality of circuits contained in the large wafers used to make silicon chips.Picking up MicroProbe moved FormFactor into the markets for checking the quality of memory systems used in computers and other electronic gear. In addition, it picked up a line of systems-on-a-chip products, which are used for advanced semiconductor testing.The MicroProbe acquisition also moved FormFactor into the rapidly growing mobile market. Right now, smartphones and tablets are outselling desktops and laptops by a factor of nearly 5-to-1. Mobile devices are on pace to capture more than one-third of the global tech economy.Fortunately for FormFactor, mobile chips are significantly simpler than the ones that go into PCs. That allows the firm to build less complex and, therefore, cheaper test cards for this fast-growing market.In other words, we only want to invest in turnarounds that meet Rule No. 4 of my five-part strategy for building wealth through high tech. And that says to \"Focus on growth.\"In all the years that I've analyzed turnaround firms and their stocks, I've yet to see one that didn't need at least some improvement in its balance sheet.Of course, we like to see lots of new sales. But if the firm can't improve its cost structure, sooner or later it's going to end up in financial trouble.Here, FormFactor is on the right track. It still has plenty of work ahead, but its financials have greatly improved over the last several quarters.Just take a look at the results of 2014's fourth quarter. For the period ended Dec. 27, year over year revenue jumped some 47% to $71.3 million.And earnings improvements were just off the charts. FormFactor reported earnings per share $0.11. During the same quarter in the previous year, the company posted a loss of $0.20 per share.In other words, earnings are improving by wider margins than sales, a sign of a true improvement in operations.During 2013's fourth quarter, FormFactor had a negative cash flow of ($5.2 million) - a drain. But a year later, it had cash flow of $9.5 million. That's a nearly $15 million improvement.Investors are waking up to the great turnaround story at FormFactor. Over the last year, the stock is up 37.1%. But I still see plenty of upside ahead.As I figure it, the company is on track to double its earnings in just three years. And if the price only tracked half that amount, we'd be looking at gains of 50% over the same period - and 27% or more in the next year.My five Tech Wealth Rules still hold. But there are exceptions.And FormFactor is one of them - clearly, it's making all the right moves.

However, management tone was conservative, impacted by yield and other issues at customers, which continue to impact orders in its vital foundry and logic markets.A quick look at the numbers-KLA reported revenues of $676.4 million, up 5.2% sequentially, but down 4.1% from the year-ago quarter, above the guided range of $590-650 million and 2.2% over the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Products generated 74% of total revenue, up 5.7% sequentially and down 7.4% year over year. Services revenue comprised the remaining 26%, up 3.7% sequentially and 7.2% year over year.As usual, management didn't discuss the revenue breakup by category and geography on the call, so the data won't be available until the company files its quarterly report.New orders in the second quarter were $865 million, up 52.6% sequentially, 18.8% year over year and higher than the guided $620-700 million. Sub-20nm investments at foundry and logic customers and 20nm conversions in DRAM were the main drivers of orders in the quarter.Management was optimistic about market growth trends for the year, saying that stronger demand for leading edge devices and improved profitability at customers would lead to a 5-10% increase in wafer fab equipment investment in 2015.But KLA did see some order pushouts as well. Some sub-20nm orders expected in the current quarter are now expected for later in the year. Management said that yield and process stability issues were leading to delays.Shipments grew sequentially but remained below year-ago levels. The extended lead times are resulting in lower shipment comparisons in the near term, but as indicated by KLA management during the third quarter, they were up nearly 40% sequentially in the fourth quarter. So some of the long-lead time business is beginning to kick in.Backlog grew 8.3% and 5.9% from the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively. Backlog excluding the value shipped but not recognized as revenue grew 1.1% sequentially and 26.6% from year-ago levels.Overall, the order contribution by segment was as follows: foundry customers 49%, memory 44% and logic 7%.Management has said that foundry contribution will jump to 62% in the December quarter, so results were somewhat lower than expected due to the yield issues discussed above.All product lines grew both sequentially and year over year. The wafer inspection, reticle inspection and metrology product lines generated 47%, 11% and 20% of quarterly revenue, with reticle inspection growing the strongest sequentially (459.4%), followed by metrology (103.4%) and wafer inspection (46.3%). Other products brought another 2%. Services accounted for the remaining 20%.KLA's gross margin expanded 295 basis points (bps) sequentially and shrank 130 bps year over year to 58.5%. The better-than-expected gross margin was due to a favorable mix of products and services, factory efficiencies related to higher volumes and a favorable currency impact at offshore factories.Operating expenses of $231.4 million were up 3.6% sequentially, 1.4% from a year ago and lower than guided. The operating margin expanded 606 bps sequentially and increased 316 bps from last year helped by cost management.The pro forma net income was $112.8 million, or 16.7% of sales compared to $78.7 million, or 12.2% in the Sep 2014 quarter and $143.1 million, or 20.3% in the December quarter of last year. Including one-time restructuring, acquisition-related and other charges as well as the loss of extinguishment of debt on a tax-adjusted basis, the GAAP net income was $20.3 million ($0.12 a share) compared to $72.2 million ($0.43 a share) in the previous quarter and $139.2 million ($0.83 a share) in the year-ago quarter.KLA ended with a cash and short term investments balance of $2.37 billion, down $575.7 million from the previous quarter. During the quarter, the company generated $11.1 million of cash from operations, spending $12.8 million on capital expenses, $141.5 million on share repurchases, $2.80 billion on dividends and $877.4 million to retire its debt. The last two items were related to the leveraged recapitalization during the quarter.For the third quarter of fiscal 2015, KLA expects orders of $500-700 million. Quarterly revenues are expected to be between $685 million and $765 million, gross margin of 56.5-57.5% and opex in a range of $227-229 million.The tax rate is expected to be 22%, yielding non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.63 - $0.87, an extremely wide range and well below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.03. The weak guidance is mainly because of increased uncertainties related to the timing of orders and extended lead times, which is having an effect on order shipments, revenue and therefore, margins.KLA-Tencor reported a strong quarter dampened by a rather conservative guidance. Note that since each system is high-valued, customer concentration is obviated, which results in great fluctuations in revenue/orders in times of uncertain demand. KLA is still highly dependent on foundries, where orders and revenues are expected to rebound driven by the transition to 20nm and below.However, underlying demand remains strong given the high demand for more efficient manufacturing processes and the preference for mobile. The technical complexity of manufacturing semiconductors and increasingly challenging yield issues remain revenue drivers for this leading manufacturer of process control equipment.Considering the weak outlook and commentary, estimates are likely to come down, which would further pressure this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell)-rated company.But you may instead consider these better-ranked stocks: Intel (  ), Altera (  ) or Avnet (  ), all of which have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

(Symbol: KLAC) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $2.00), with the stock changing hands as low as $65.59 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. KLA-Tencor Corp. (Symbol: KLAC) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of KLA-Tencor Corp., looking at the history chart for KLAC below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.    According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, KLAC makes up 4.80% of the PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors Portfolio ETF (Symbol: PSI) which is trading lower by about 0.6% on the day Tuesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n early trading on Friday, shares of Starbucks (  ) topped the list of the day's best performing components of the Nasdaq 100 index, trading up 6.0%.

Management offered very limited commentary on the quarterly results saying that the trends remain largely the same. The discussion instead focused on the leveraged recapitalization, which sent shares soaring.The leveraged recapitalization is intended to raise capital to return value to shareholders and entails a special cash dividend of $16.50 per share, (23% of share price on Oct 22) or an aggregate value of $2.75 billion to be paid by year-end. This is in addition to the regular cash dividend. It will also repurchase up to 3.6 million additional shares for $250 million in aggregate.A quick look at the numbers:KLA reported revenues of $642.9 million, down 12.5% sequentially, 2.3% from the year-ago quarter, within the guided range of $590-650 million and 3.4% over the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Products generated 74% of total revenue, down 16.4% sequentially and 5.0% year over year. Services revenue comprised the remaining 26%, up 1.5% sequentially and 6.2% year over year.Defect inspection and services were clearly the points of strength in the last quarter, growing a respective 85.6% and 86.6% sequentially and a respective 8.7% and 6.2% year over year. Metrology and other products were down a respective 59.2% and 87.4% from the Jun 2014 quarter. They also declined 28.7% and 65.9% year over year. The defect inspection, metrology and other products generated 58%, 15% and 1% of quarterly revenue, respectively. Services brought in the rest.The U.S., Taiwan, Europe & Israel were notably weaker, down 2.8%, 45.6% and 20.4%, respectively from Jun 2014. Europe & Israel and Korea declined 54.6% and 10.3% from last year while all other regions grew. The strongest growth came from Japan (up 25.9% sequentially, 37.8% year over year). Revenue share by region was as follows- the U.S. 30%, Taiwan 20%, Japan 17%, Korea 11%, Other Asia/Pacific 13% and Europe & Israel 9%.New orders in the second quarter were $567 million, down 36.9% sequentially, 28.2% year over year and short of the guided $600-800 million. Management attributed the decline to a foundry customer, which pushed out orders during the quarter.Shipments declined both sequentially and from year-ago levels. The extended lead times are resulting in lower shipments in the near term, but KLA management expect a 40% increase in the current quarter. Backlog was consistent with both the previous and year-ago quarters. Backlog excluding the value shipped but not recognized as revenue grew 10.3% sequentially and 8.2% from year-ago levels.Overall, the order contribution by segment was as follows: memory customers 46%, logic 28% and foundry 25%.Foundry orders were impacted by the push-out of an order worth $100 million at a single customer. In the June quarter, management mentioned a large 20nm order, shipments related to which will not start until later this year and will continue through 2015, which is why it will not have an impact on near term revenue. Management has said that foundry contribution will jump to 62% in the Dec quarter.20nm and below processes accounted for 66% of orders in the last quarter.The decline in orders was broad-based across product lines but reticle inspection and metrology suffered the most in the year on year comparison. The wafer inspection, reticle inspection and metrology product lines generated 49%, 3% and 15% of quarterly revenue. Other products brought another 3%. Services accounted for 30%.KLA's gross margin shrank 35 basis points (bps) sequentially and 266 bps year over year to 55.6%. The better-than-expected gross margin was due to a favorable mix of products and lower-than-expected parts costs related to the services business.Operating expenses of $240.0 million were up 4.0% sequentially, 5.3% from a year ago and higher than guided. The operating margin shrank 624 bps sequentially and 536 bps from last year due to the significant decline in revenue and higher employee-related costs.The pro forma net income was $78.7 million, or 12.2% of sales compared to $133.2 million, or 18.1% in the Jun 2014 quarter and $114.9 million, or 17.5% in the Sep quarter of last year. Including one-time restructuring and acquisition-related charges on a tax-adjusted basis, the GAAP net income was $72.2 million ($0.43 a share) compared to $128.7 million ($0.77 a share) in the previous quarter and $111.2 million ($0.66 a share) in the year-ago quarter.KLA ended with a cash and short term investments balance of $2.94 billion, down $210.1 million from the previous quarter. The company generated $34.9 million of cash from operations, spending $13.4 million on capital expenses, $124.8 million on share repurchases and $82.4 million on dividends during the quarter.For the first quarter of fiscal 2015, KLA expects orders of $620-700 million. Quarterly revenues are expected to be between $590 million and $650 million, gross margin of 56-57% and opex in a range of $236-238 million. The tax rate is expected to be 24%, yielding non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.46 - $0.70, an extremely wide range and well below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.91. The weak guidance is mainly because of extended lead times on its recent orders, which is having an effect on order shipments, revenue and therefore, margins.KLA-Tencor reported a weak quarter and provided disappointing guidance. Note that since each system is high-valued, customer concentration is obviated, which results in great fluctuations in revenue/orders in times of uncertain demand. However, the business is expected to recover in the Dec quarter, as some longer-lead time orders are converted. KLA is still highly dependent on foundries, where orders and revenues are expected to rebound driven by the transition to 20nm and below.However, underlying demand remains strong given the high demand for more efficient manufacturing processes and the preference for mobile. The technical complexity of manufacturing semiconductors and increasingly challenging yield issues remain revenue drivers for this leading manufacturer of process control equipment.Considering the weak outlook and commentary, estimates are likely to come down, which would further pressure this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company. Although, share prices are likely to remain buoyant because of the special dividend and share repurchase program.But you may also consider these better-ranked stocks -- Intel (  ), Micron (  ), or even Ecommerce China Dangdang (  ), all of which have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Rumors recently swirled that Apple had already begun the production of the A9 semiconductor that is supposed to power next year's editions of the iPhone and iPad. This story not only affects Apple and the smartphone OEMs Apple influences. It also holds significant financial implications for the downstream companies like  and  that produce the innards of Apple's iDevices.To be clear, I'm raising an eyebrow at these reports, and I think you should too. Originally broken by a publication called  , a South Korean tech news site, the story gained more traction when  also reported it late last week.Although I have little personal experience with  or knowledge of its journalistic standards, the publication cites unspecified \"industry insiders\" as the source. We've seen this kind of unsubstantiated industry gossip come from other, more established rumor mills like the Taiwanese  as well. More often than not, these reports prove false, so the sourcing alone makes me inclined to dismiss the storyline. However, the sourcing isn't the only problem.The companies most likely to build the Apple A9 probably don't even have all the necessary equipment on hand to fabricate the chip right now. In a recent research note, boutique semiconductor research firm, Semiwatch Advisors, created a reverse production timeline for the Apple A9.The idea was to connect two things: 1) when Apple will likely need to have the A9 under production to meet its own iPhone release schedule and 2) Apple's downstream partners and their suppliers to get a sense of the likely revenue cycle for those downstream companies. This allows us to understand not only how the next 12 months' sales might unfold at Apple fabrication partners, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor, but also how the upcoming financial performance of the fab companies might unfold, including lesser-known names like  and  . Take a look.According to this timeline, Apple's fabrication partners for the A9, be they Samsung or Taiwan Semiconductor, will only begin taking delivery for some of the advanced equipment they'll need to manufacture the A9 around the beginning of the first quarter. So even if you moved the possible delivery date up by a month, Apple's chipmakers would only have just recently received their newest equipment -- having Apple's A9 well into production is so unlikely as to be virtually impossible. I'm calling this rumor patently false.However, this does bring attention to anther important aspect of Apple's upcoming chip cycle. Which company will fabricate them?Apple's utter disdain for Samsung is well documented by now. As the two compete head-to-head in the smartphone market, Apple has shifted much of its component production away from Samsung over the past several years. Taiwan Semiconductor has been  from Apple's corporate hardball, so much so that it was estimated to have produced roughly 60% of the A8 chips for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.Rest assured, Apple will once again keep as much of its A9 business away from Samsung as possible in the upcoming production cycle. That being said, Samsung will likely receive some portion of Apple's A9 fab business for one key reason: Apple is widely expected to incorporate a cutting-edge semiconductor technology into the A9 known as FinFET. Without delving too deeply into the technical side of things, this new design and manufacturing process will hopefully enable Apple and other leading smartphone chipmakers to continue to pack more performance into increasingly smaller chipsets. Sounds pretty good, right?Things grow more opaque, though, when taking into account recent rumors that the FinFET production process yields (an important measure of quality) have been abysmal at virtually all major chipmakers, including Taiwan Semiconductor, Samsung, and even  . This has led many to argue that Apple will likely take a more \"hedged\" approach than it might prefer in awarding its A9 production business. The company will likely spread its bets among several large fabrication partners, Taiwan Semiconductor  Samsung in this case, in order to maximize its ability to procure enough A9 chips for its late-2015 iPhone and iPad refresh cycle. So although I'm confident Apple's A9 has not yet entered production, the exact details regarding the rollout are far from certain as we head into the New Year.Apple recently revealed the product of its secret-development \"dream team\" -- Apple Watch. The secret is out, and some early viewers are claiming its everyday impact could trump the iPod, iPhone,  the iPad. In fact, ABI Research predicts 485 million of this type of device will be sold per year. But one small company makes Apple's gadget possible.

(Symbol: KLAC) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $2.00), with the stock changing hands as low as $66.34 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. KLA-Tencor Corp. (Symbol: KLAC) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company.

The company's share repurchase program, which is now valued at over $1 billion, is expected to be completed over the next 12 to 18 months.The strength of KLA's business model is reflected in its strong cash generation capabilities and commitment to return value to shareholders. We believe that continued share buybacks and dividend hikes will inspire investors' loyalty through higher returns from the stock.KLA's strong balance sheet and cash flows provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, share repurchases and strategic acquisitions. During the last concluded quarter, KLA spent $59.9 million on share repurchases and $74.8 million on dividends. The cash and short-term investments balance was $3.03 billion, flat with the previous quarter. The debt to total capital ratio, including long-term liabilities and short-term debt, was 17.0%. We remain encouraged by KLA's strong cash position and its ability to service its long-term debts.KLA reported decent third-quarter results, with both revenues and earnings surpassing our expectations.

TSMC's management remarked on its July  that it would not begin mass production on its next-generation 16-nanometer manufacturing technology until late 2015. This would be too late for the successor to the iPhone 6, which is likely to launch in the fall of 2015. now reports, though, that TSMC \"will advance volume production on its 16nm process to the first quarter of 2015 with monthly output of 50,000 wafers in order to meet demand for Apple's A9 processors.\"A question that may be on investors' minds, then, is whether TSMC can actually achieve this rumored production schedule, and if so, what doing so might mean from a financial perspective. Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor are moving to a fundamentally new transistor structure known as a FinFET for their respective 14/16-nanometer technologies. This transistor type, according to  -- which has been successfully mass-producing FinFET-based chips since late 2011 -- offers significant performance improvements and power reductions over more traditional \"planar\" transistors.The light gray line represents the performance of a hypothetical 22-nanometer \"planar\" transistor. The black line represents the performance Intel's 32-nanometer transistor, and the blue one the performance of Intel's 22-nanometer FinFET transistor. Source: IntelUnfortunately, these FinFETs seem to be proving very difficult for the foundries to bring into high volume production. , a major semiconductor equipment vendor, offered investors some insight into this issue on its April .Now, notice that KLA-Tencor's CEO cited \"significant yield losses,\" which means that when a chip wafer is produced, a large portion of the chips that come out aren't suitable for sale. The reason that good yields are so important is that yields directly affect cost. If a chip wafer costs $3,000 to make and from that one can get 300 good chips, the cost to produce those chips is $10 each. However, if due to yield losses, one can only get 150 good chips, then the cost per chip balloons to $20.Now, according to an  piece, TSMC shifted to charging customers on a  basis rather than a  basis over the last several years.Given this context, what could \"advancing production\" of 16-nanometer, particularly if yields are proving challenging, mean economically for both Apple and TSMC? To provide some background, according to a 2009  wafer agreement between IDT and TSMC published on the SEC's website, TSMC and IDT agree to a \"minimum\" or \"standard\" yield. This standard yield is \"based on the average Yield of the first three hundred (300) Wafers of each Product manufactured using Qualified Processes and passing all production tests.\"The agreement further stipulates, \"Any Wafer manufactured by TSMC that yields less than sixty five percent (65%) of the standard Yield for such Product shall, if sorted by TSMC, be scrapped, or, [...] be deemed defective and returnable for replacement.\"While the agreement between TSMC and IDT is unlikely to be identical to the one between TSMC and Apple, the basic idea is probably similar.The next question to ask, then, is if TSMC and Apple are really gunning to get 16-nanometer chips into the 2015 iPhone, who will eat the cost of the low yields, should they persist?Will TSMC, in a bid to keep Apple's business, offer really cheap wafers to offset the relatively low yield per wafer (and keep this business away from arch-rival, Samsung)? Or will Apple, in a bid to minimize its reliance on Samsung, be willing to buy more, \"full-price\" wafers from TSMC and agree to a lower yield requirement? Only time will tell which chip manufacturer will  wind up with Apple's business for the 2015 iPhone/iPad devices. But given that  has claimed on separate occasions that both Samsung  TSMC have \"won\" this business, the \"behind-the-scenes\" battle is extremely interesting.Apple recently recruited a secret-development \"dream team\" to guarantee its newest smart device was kept hidden from the public for as long as possible. But the secret is out, and some early viewers are claiming its everyday impact could trump the iPod, iPhone,  the iPad.

Japanese factory output data helped support speculation that the Japanese economy will weather the government's April tax hike without much damage as it showed a 0.5 percent rise in output. The data supports the Bank of Japan's optimistic expectations that the nation's economy will recover from its second quarter slump in the summer. Outrage has been the response to news that Facebook manipulated the news feeds of its users to determine whether or not the number of positive or negative posts had an effect on their emotions. The study, conducted on around 700,000 unsuspecting users, has revived concerns about privacy issues as Facebook's user agreement allows the company a lot of leeway in how it treats its customers.

Services revenue comprised the remaining 22%, up 1.5% sequentially and 9.5% year over year.New orders in the second quarter were $898 million, up 27.9% sequentially, 25.9% year over year and better than the guided 625-825 million. The strength in the last quarter was related to foundry demand in the sub-20nm category. DRAM is also picking up.Shipments declined both sequentially and from year-ago levels. Backlog increased 9.1% from both periods. Backlog excluding the value shipped but not recognized as revenue grew 17.6% sequentially and 12.3% from year-ago levels.Overall, the order contribution by segment was as follows: foundry customers 68%, memory 23%, and logic 9%. Foundry orders were helped by a large 20nm deployment that was pushed out from the March quarter. However, shipments related to this order will not start until later this year and will continue through 2015, which is why it will not have an impact on near term revenue.The DRAM strength was related to 2X technology transitions with NAND demand remaining moderate. 3D NAND deployments were negigible. The decline in logic demand was largely as expected. Since Intel (  ) is a major customer in this segment, its product ramps have an impact on KLA's business.All product lines grew strong double-digits from the year-ago quarter. On a sequential basis, wafer inspection, reticle inspection and metrology grew 52.9%, -1.6% and 19.4%, respectively. This is the strongest growth rate for the wafer inspection business since the second quarter of fiscal year 2012.KLA's gross margin shrank 310 basis points (bps) sequentially and 188 bps year over year to 55.1%. Management attributed the weaker-than-expected margin to an unfavorable mix of products and higher-than-expected costs related to the services business.Operating expenses of $230.9 million were up 2.3% sequentially and 3.6% from a year ago. The operating margin shrank 740 bps sequentially and 237 bps from last year as all except SG&A expenses increased substantially as a percentage of sales. SG&A was up significantly from the previous quarter but was flattish with the year-ago quarter.The pro forma net income was $133.2 million, or 18.1% of sales compared to $206.2 million, or 24.8% in the Mar 2014 quarter and $138.6 million, or 19.2% in the June quarter of last year. Including one-time restructuring and acquisition-related charges on a tax-adjusted basis, the GAAP net income was $128.7 million ($0.77 a share) compared to $203.6 million ($1.21 a share) in the previous quarter and $134.8 million ($0.80 a share) in the year-ago quarter.KLA ended with a cash and short term investments balance of $3.15 billion, down $125.8 million from the previous quarter. The company generated $248.6 million of cash from operations, spending $13.1 million on capital expenses, $60.2 million on share repurchases and $74.5 million on dividends during the quarter.For the first quarter of fiscal 2015, KLA expects orders of $600-800 million (70% in foundry and logic) and shipments of $800 million. Quarterly revenues are expected to be between $590 million and $650 million, gross margin of 54-55% and opex in a range of $230-235 million. The tax rate is expected to be 22%, yielding non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.34 - $0.54, well below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.90. The weak guidance is mainly because of extended lead times on its recent orders, which is have an effect on order shipments, revenue and therefore, margins.KLA-Tencor reported a weak quarter and provided disappointing guidance. However, orders were up strongly, benefiting from new business that was pushed out from the March quarter. Management says that this business has longer lead times (they usually provide 6-month backlog). KLA is still highly dependent on foundries, where order momentum is expected to continue. But management said that there was some uncertainty about the timing of foundry spending, which could delay shipments and revenue and thereby tell on its margins as well.Considering the weak outlook and commentary, estimates are likely to come down, which would then push down the Zacks Rank #2 on KLA shares. This would however better reflect sentiments across the industry, where peers like Lam Research (  ) has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and Applied Materials (  ) has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).We also note that since each system is high-valued, customer concentration is obviated, which results in great fluctuations in revenue/orders in times of uncertain demand.However, underlying demand remains strong given the high demand for more efficient manufacturing processes and the preference for mobile. The technical complexity of manufacturing semiconductors and increasingly challenging yield issues remain revenue drivers for this leading manufacturer of process control equipment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

That is because KLAC is now in overbought territory with an RSI value of 72.44.RSI stands for 'Relative Strength Index' and it is a popular indicator used by technically focused investors. It compares the average of gains in days that closed up to the average of losses in days that closed down; readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought, while an RSI below 30 suggests undervalued conditions are present.Yet KLAC's high RSI value isn't the only reason for investors to be concerned, as there has been some decidedly negative earnings estimate revisions in KLA-Tencor's stock as of late. This is especially true when investors dive into some of these revisions in order to get a better picture of KLAC's prospects for the near term.Over the past two months, investors have witnessed 6 earnings estimate revisions lower compared to just none higher for the current year. The consensus estimate for KLAC has also been on a downward trend over the same time period too, as the estimate has fallen from $3.83/share two months ago to just $3.63/share today.If this wasn't enough, KLA-Tencor also has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) which puts it into unfortunate company among its peers.

Revenue from North America and Europe & Israel remained below year-ago levels, while other regions grew. Overall, North America, Taiwan, Japan, Europe & Israel, Korea and Other Asia/Pacific generated 21%, 29%, 12%, 5%, 10% and 22% of quarterly revenue, respectively.New orders in the second quarter were $702 million, down 3.6% sequentially and 4.9% year over year. Management said that the weakness versus expectations was on account of temporary weakness at leading edge fabs.Shipments also declined sequentially, but remained above year-ago levels. Backlog increased 2.3% sequentially and 12.5% from last year. Backlog excluding the value shipped but not recognized as revenue declined 10.0% sequentially but was consistent with year-ago levels.Overall, the order contribution by segment was as follows: foundry customers 56%, memory 23%, and logic 21%. Foundry demand was weaker than expected because one large customer delayed 20nm deployment, while another delayed capacity addition. New capacity by NAND makers and technology purchases by DRAM makers will drive memory demand.Logic demand was in line with expectations and management stated that deployments for 20nm and below were already 63% of orders in the last quarter. KLA's most important logic customer is  (  ).Metrology products had a particularly bad quarter, with revenue declining 34.3% and 28.7% from the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively. Wafer inspection grew 3.2% and -14.2% from the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively. Reticle inspection products however saw extreme strength growing 14.0% sequentially and 106.1% from the year-ago quarter. Products were 77% of total orders with services accounting for the balance.Europe, Korea and Other Asia/Pacific declined. Overall, the order contribution by geography was as follows: North America 36%, Europe 10%, Japan 11%, Korea 5%, Taiwan 25% and Other Asia/Pacific 13%. The relatively higher concentration in Asia is due to the presence of a larger number of foundries and memory manufacturers in the region.KLA's gross margin was down 80 basis points (bps) sequentially and up 109 bps year over year to 59.0%. KLA saw lower-than-expected installation, warranty and retrofit costs in the quarter.Operating expenses of $225.7 million were down 1.1% sequentially and up 6.0% from a year ago.

Quarterly revenues are expected to be between $700 million and $760 million, gross margin of 57-58% and opex in a range of $225-230 million. The tax rate is expected to be 23%, yielding non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.75 - $0.95, well below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.12.KLA managed to beat expectations, but the guidance was very weak, given order pushouts into the second half of 2014. We should bear in mind that these are not orders lost but orders delayed due to yield issues and other production concerns as most customers transition to smaller geometries.

Its customers include chipmakers that produce everything from memory to microprocessors, for use in electronics.The stock has surged this year; since Lam Research reported quarterly earnings April 23, shares have risen about 27% to trade around 67. Jefferies Group analysts initiated coverage this month with a \"buy\" rating and a 75 stock-price target.Lam Research should see rising product-pricing power, Jefferies analysts say, as chipmaking customers reach a peak in terms of reducing costs and bolstering performance by minimizing the size of transistors. The thinking goes that customers such asIntel (  ) and Samsung will seek advancements from suppliers such as Lam Research to fill a performance-improvement void, via alternative materials and manufacturing process enhancements.Lam Research is forecast to nearly double its annual earnings per share this year. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters on average expect $4.40, up from $2.22 last year.For its third quarter of fiscal 2014 ended March 30, Lam Research logged $1.23 billion in revenue, up 45% year over year and atop analyst views for $1.22 billion.Profit came in at $216.4 million, or $1.26 a share, on an adjusted basis. That excluded some costs tied to the 2012 acquisition of Novellus Systems and some other special items. The result came in ahead of analyst estimates for $1.17, and compares with EPS of 44 cents a year earlier and $1.10 a quarter earlier.For the current quarter, the Fremont, Calif.-based firm expects revenue between $1.19 billion and $1.29 billion, and adjusted EPS of $1.14 to $1.28. Analysts in the Thomson Reuters poll anticipate EPS of $1.23 on revenue of $1.25 billion.Lam Research is the fourth company in size, by market cap, in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Equipment industry group, afterASML Holding (  ),Applied Materials (  ) andKLA Tencor (  ) . The group is currently ranked No. 72 of 197 that IBD tracks.SEMI, the global semiconductor industry association,  will jump 24% to $35.7 billion this year and another 11% in 2015. Such a development would follow double-digit percentage declines logged the last two years.SEMI's research chief Chris Dieseldorff says the rise of mobile devices, in lieu of PCs that require more semiconductor content, coupled with global economic uncertainty influenced the declines in investment levels the past two years.\"The overall sentiment had an impact on the semiconductor industry,\" Dieseldorff said in an interview. \"Companies just didn't have the confidence to invest.\"But now, Dieseldorff says, confidence in the economic vigor of the U.S. and Asia, along with belief in a European recovery, is mounting.The kind of companies Lam Research caters to are eager to capitalize on cutting-edge processes and willing to make investments in order to boost performance of a range of equipment used to outfit everything from computers to flat-screen televisions.\"We are in the right place at the right time,\" CFO Bettinger said in an interview.Dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) equipment spending, for instance, is projected by SEMI to grow 40% this year. Lam Research has a strong position in the memory market. The company's memory segment accounted for about two-thirds of its shipments in the March quarter, and Bettinger says DRAM upgrades developed in collaboration with customers are driving new business.The DRAM example is just one of many, he says. Demand for tech upgrades is developing on \"multiple fronts.\" And it is coming from regions around the globe.SEMI predicts that, in 2014, fab equipment spending will surge 36% in the Americas, 69% in China, 79% in Europe and the Mideast, 23% in Korea, and 11% in both Taiwan and Japan.In its latest reported quarter, Lam Research generated 10% of its revenue in the U.S., 28% in Korea, 22% in China, 19% in Taiwan, 11% in Japan and 6% in Europe.For all the anticipated momentum, Ng of Morningstar notes that Lam Research is in a historically cyclical industry. Investors, he says, tend to push up stocks such as Lam Research when conditions are favorable and expectations are high.\"But when things are bad, everyone runs out the door,\" he said, noting that Lam Research traded around 35 a share just two years ago and around 25 in mid-2009.Bettinger says that Lam Research \"is not immune\" to cyclical shifts.\"The macroeconomic environment is always something we need to be monitoring,\" he added.But operating conditions globally range from stable to growing and, against that backdrop, there is likely to be strong and ongoing demand for new electronics, from smartphones to wearable devices, he says. And to satiate that demand, Lam Research's customers are likely to continue to invest in new equipment to develop more and better products for consumers.\"We have a very strong business,\" Bettinger said.In addition to a new stock buy-back program, he notes, Lam Research recently announced a 18-cent-per-share dividend slated for July 2. Bettinger calls it a show of confidence by the company's board.\"It will be an ongoing dividend,\" he said. \"It really does reflect confidence in our future business.\"The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["xpected Earnings Release: 04/24/2014, After-hoursAvg.

Last quarter, the company posted a 7.6% positive surprise. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.KLA's second-quarter earnings of 85 cents exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6 cents on higher revenues and impressive expense management. Revenues were up sequentially due to a strong demand environment. Also, gross margins expanded in the last quarter due to a favorable product mix, improved manufacturing and stronger volumes.For the third quarter of fiscal 2014, KLA expects revenues in the range of $790-$850 million,orders of $700-$900 million and shipments of $720-$780 million. Non-GAAP EPS is expected in the range of $1.00-$1.20.Our proven model does not conclusively show that KLA will beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at $1.10. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. KLA's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), when combined with a 0.00% ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.You could consider other stocks with a positive earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 such as: (  ), with Earnings ESP of +12.00% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Revenues were more or less in line, beating by 1.4%.Applied reported revenue of $2.19 billion, up 10.2% sequentially and 39.2% year over year, at the high end of the guidance range.The  segment contributed 68% of revenue, up 19.4% sequentially and up 53.1% from the year-ago quarter. NAND and foundry sales helped segment sales in the last quarter, with logic and DRAM remaining weak.The second largest segment was  with a 23% revenue share. Segment revenue was down 5.8% sequentially and up 7.6% year over year. AGS revenues are correlated to system sales and benefited from stronger equipment sales in the last quarter.The  segment saw a 2.5% sequential decline although sales were still 82.8% above year-ago levels. Segment contribution dropped from 8% to 7%. Management stated that the segment performed better than expected due to share gains. Higher demand for bigger TV screens remains a driver of segment revenues.Demand for mobile devices (high-resolution mobile displays for tablets and touch panels for ultrabooks) also continues to increase, which is complementing the resurgence in the TV market. Applied's expanding product line is partly responsible for the increased total available market (TAM).The  segment accounted for 2% of total quarterly revenue, declining 9.1% sequentially and 13.0% from last year. The weakness in solar (due to overcapacity) is a prevailing condition in the market and management continues to cut investment in the segment to align the cost structure with sales.Around 80% of Applied's quarterly revenue came from the Asia/Pacific region, with the largest contribution from Taiwan, which generated 32% and followed by China with 27%, Korea with 9% and Japan with 7%. Japan and Europe were the weakest in the last quarter, declining 40.6% and 32.2%, respectively on a sequential basis. China was the strongest region (up 188.7% sequentially), which along with Taiwan (up 19.7%) were the only regions to have seen positive growth.Total orders were up 9.2% sequentially and up 8.1% year over year. SSG and AGS orders were up 12.9%, and 8.9%, respectively. Display orders declined 30.7%, with EES coming in flat. SSG and AGS also increased on a sequential basis although the other two segments declined.Backlog for the quarter increased 16.7%, with SSG building the most, followed by AGS, Display and then EES. The BTB was 1.04.Applied generated a gross margin of 42.5%, up 248 basis points (bps) from the previous quarter's 40.0%. A lower mix of EES sales were beneficial for the gross margin in the last quarter and will likely remain so through 2014. Applied's gross margin improvements may be traced to its improving mix of higher-value products in semiconductor and display, as well as material cost efficiencies. The gross margin was up 267 bps from the year-ago quarter.Applied's operating expenses of $512 million were down 4.9% from the Oct 2013 quarter. All expenses declined as a percentage of sales from both the previous and year-ago quarters. As a result, the operating margin of 17.9% expanded 371 bps sequentially and 1,083 bps from last year.On a pro forma basis, Applied Materials had a net income of $276 million, or a 12.6% net income margin compared to $228 million, or 11.5% in the previous quarter and $69 million, or 4.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.The fully diluted pro forma earnings were 23 cents a share compared to earnings of 19 cents in the previous quarter and 6 cents in the comparable prior-year quarter. Our pro forma estimate excludes restructuring, acquisition-related, impairment and other charges as well as tax adjustments in the last quarter.On a fully diluted GAAP basis, the company recorded a net profit of $253 million ($0.21 per share) compared to income of $183 million ($0.15 per share) in the previous quarter and profit of $34 million ($0.03 per share) in the year-ago quarter.Inventories increased 8.5% during the quarter, with inventory turns down slightly from 3.4X to 3.3X. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) went from 75 to 63. The cash and short-term investments balance was $2.29 billion at quarter-end, having increased $398 million during the quarter. Goodwill was 27.0% of total assets in the last quarter.The company generated $372 million of cash from operations, spent $48 million on capex and $120 million on dividends. At quarter-end, Applied had $1.95 billion of debt on its balance sheet, with a net cash position of $343 million. However, the debt cap ratio including long term liabilities and short term debt was just 25.5%.Applied provided guidance for the fiscal second quarter. Revenue for the quarter is expected to be up 3-10%, with the non GAAP EPS coming in at 25-29 cents a share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Apr 2014 quarter was 27 cents when the company provided guidance, within the guided range.Applied beat estimates in the last quarter entirely on account of the strength in semiconductor-related sales. This strength may be expected to continue through the year, spurred by the increasing demand for mobile devices. The proliferation of mobile devices is leading foundries to expand capacity with the transition to 20nm further boosting sales.Spending on NAND and 3D NAND is also expected to increase this year although logic sales will not be that exciting. The overall market should be highly positive for a broad-based supplier such as Applied Materials.The traditional computing market is also looking up, which is a positive for all major players from  p (  ) to  (  ).Applied has a very strong product line and management has stepped up investments here in preparation for the on-going transitions to larger wafer sizes and smaller process nodes. Management expects significant share gains through 2014.The merger with Tokyo Electron will further improve innovation on the materials side, thereby helping sales and providing the company a competitive advantage.There is also scope for share gains on the Display side of the business on the back of the company's PVD tools. The drivers of this business are larger TV screens and better mobile displays that involve more complicated production processes and new tools.Applied shares currently have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), similar to peer  (  ).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking at the universe of stocks we cover at  , on 2/13/14, National Instruments Corp.

(Symbol: KLAC) has taken over the #336 spot from Entergy Corp. (Symbol: ETR), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true \"apples-to-apples\" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of KLA-Tencor Corp. (Symbol: KLAC), the market cap is now $11.65 billion, versus Entergy Corp. (Symbol: ETR) at $11.56 billion.Below is a chart of KLA-Tencor Corp. versus Entergy Corp. plotting their respective size rank within the S&P 500 over time (KLAC plotted in blue; ETR plotted in green):    Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of KLAC vs. ETR:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and \"tosses out\" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller \"up-and-comers\" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at  find value to putting together these rankings daily.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, KLAC and ETR collectively make up 2.95% of the WisdomTree Dividend ex-Financials Fund ETF (  ) which is up by about 0.4% on the day Thursday.At the closing bell, KLAC is up about 1.9%, while ETR is up about 0.3% on the day Thursday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) reported second quarter fiscal 2014 non-GAAP earnings of $1.10 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 cents.Revenues of $1.12 billion increased 10.0% sequentially and 29.6% year over year. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.10 billion. The year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by continued strength in the foundry segment.Region-wise, North America contributed 13% of fiscal second quarter 2014 revenues (14% in the last quarter). Europe's share was 5% (9% in the prior quarter) while Japan brought in 17% (13% in the last quarter) of the revenues.

Asia Pacific was the largest contributor with 25% (19% in the previous quarter) of total shipments while Taiwan accounted for 22% (21% in the prior quarter).Non-GAAP gross profit was $510.8 million, or 45.8% of revenue, compared with non-GAAP gross profit of $456.7 million, or 45.0% of revenue in the prior quarter. Higher revenues coupled with favorable customer mix were the main reasons for the margin increase.Total operating expenses were $302.1 million, up from $291.9 million in the prior quarter. Operating margin was 18.7%, up 250 bps from 16.2% recorded in the prior quarter.Non-GAAP net income was $188.7 million compared with income of $139.1 million in the prior quarter and $77.2 million in the prior-year quarter.Exiting fiscal second quarter 2014, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash and investment balances was $2.7 billion compared with $2.6 billion in the prior quarter. This increase was primarily the result of approximately $129 million in cash flow from operating activities during the reported quarter, partially offset by $48 million of stock repurchases.Deferred revenue and deferred profit balances increased to $405.0 million and $224.4 million, respectively, compared with $334.0 million and $188.4 million, respectively, in the prior quarter. Long term debt, convertible notes, and capital leases amounted to $803.3 million compared with $796.4 million in the prior quarter.For the third quarter of fiscal 2014, Lam Research expects revenues to be in the range of $1.215 billion-$1.245 billion.

The company's fiscal second-quarter earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate but guidance was disappointing. KLA's comprehensive product line, cost reduction initiatives and strong balance sheet remain positives that will generate growth whenever cyclical pressures permit. Though the competition and concentrated customer base increases execution risk, the increasing process control spending across foundry, memory and logic players through 2015 will enable KLA to deliver stronger results. We are therefore maintaining our Neutral rating on KLA shares.San Jose, California-based KLA-Tencor Corporation (KLAC) is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of process diagnostics and control (PDC) equipment and yield management solutions required for the fabrication of semiconductor integrated circuits (ICs) or chips. The firm has a comprehensive portfolio of products addressing each major PDC subsegment photomask (reticle) inspection, wafer inspection/defect review and metrology. In fiscal year 2013, the company generated 71% of sales from products, with the balance coming from services.Reticle production is vital to the semiconductor device formation process. Reticles are used to control the precise deposition of materials onto the wafer, which ultimately change its chemical characteristics, imparting specific functionalities to the ICs thus created. Inspection and metrology tools measure the quality of the reticles, helping to improve reticle production yields. As a result of the broader applicability of semiconductors, shrinking form factors and increasing functionalities of individual chips, reticle design and production are growing in importance. Metrology is required at every stage of the IC manufacturing process, since it ensures that the chips display the functionalities they were intended to, thus reducing wastage and improving yields. KLA-Tencor's software combines its expertise in inspection and metrology to provide complete yield management solutions to customers. Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor were the largest customers in the last three years, accounting for more than 10% of total sales in each year.The two main product lines are defect inspection and metrology. KLA's defect inspection tools have very broad application in chip, wafer, reticle, storage, compound semiconductor and MEMS manufacturing. Metrology tools are used to gather critical dimension measurements of the wafer and process dimensions such as film thickness, lithography overlay and surface profiling. The company's metrology products are used in chip, wafer, reticle and solar device manufacturing. KLA also offers other products and services.

Revenues were particularly strong, beating by 16.2%.There have been both upward and downward revisions to estimates since the company reported, but the net impact has been slightly negative to expectations for the next quarter.It appears that Applied continues to benefit from the proliferation of mobile devices, but is also impacted by slowing sales in China.Applied reported revenue of $1.99 billion, flat sequentially and up 20.8% year over year, in line with the guidance.The  segment contributed 63% of revenue, down 2.3% sequentially and up 42.9% from the year-ago quarter. Segment revenue benefited from growth in logic and DRAM that was partially offset by negative seasonality in the foundry business. Foundries typically lower spending to ramp production for the holiday season.The second largest segment was  with a 27% revenue share. Segment revenue was up 8.2% sequentially and down 13.4% year over year. AGS revenues are correlated to system sales and benefited from stronger equipment sales in the last quarter.The  segment saw a 1.2% sequential and 75.3% year-over-year increase in revenue, making it the only segment to have grown from both periods. Segment contribution remained at 8%. Government stimulus-driven spending in China slowed down, but other regions grew, driven by demand for bigger TV screens.Demand for mobile devices (high-resolution mobile displays for tablets and touch panels for ultrabooks) continues to increase, which is complementing the resurgence in the TV market. Applied's expanding product line is partly responsible for the increased total available market (TAM), which will spur growth in the following quarters.The  segment accounted for 2% of total quarterly revenue, down 2.2% sequentially and 29.0% from last year. The weakness in solar (due to overcapacity) is a prevailing condition in the market and management continues to cut investment in the segment to align the cost structure with sales.Around 70% of Applied's quarterly revenue came from the Asia/Pacific region, with the largest contribution from Taiwan, which generated 30% and followed by Japan, which generated 14% and Korea with 12%. China and Japan were the weakest in the last quarter, declining 25.3% and 17.1%, respectively on a sequential basis.Taiwan was the strongest region (up 65.4% sequentially), which along with Europe (up 7.6%) were the only regions to have seen positive growth. The revenue distribution by geography was as follows: the U.S. 18%, Europe 12%, Taiwan 30%, Japan 14%, Korea 12%, China 10% and South East Asia 4%.Total orders were up 4.9% sequentially and up 42.8% year over year. SSG, AGS and EES orders were up 15.5%, 6.0% and 110.5%, respectively. Display orders declined 55.5%, following a However, the 7.5% and 31.3% sequential increases in AGS and Display partially offset these 282% increase in the preceding quarter.The net result was a BTB of 1.05, with SSG and AGS positive, and Display and EES were negative.Applied generated a gross margin of 40.0%, down 82 basis points (bps) from the previous quarter's 40.8%. A lower mix of EES sales were beneficial for the gross margin in the last quarter and will likely remain so through 2014. However, the gross margin was impacted by a $20 million charge for a customs duty assessment in the AGS segment as well as a $10 million inventory charge in the Display business. The gross margin was up 159 bps from the year-ago quarter.Applied's operating expenses of $512 million were down 4.3% from the Jun 2013 quarter. While all expenses declined year over year as a percentage of sales, G&A alone declined sequentially. As a result, the operating margin of 14.2% expanded 51 bps sequentially and 731 bps from last year.Management has been diverting costs related to the solar business to R&D expenses for SSG. Therefore, overall R&D has been growing as a percentage of total opex, because of these actions taken by management.On a pro forma basis, Applied Materials had a net income of $228 million, or a 11.5% net income margin compared to $223 million, or 11.3% in the previous quarter and $70 million, or 4.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.The fully diluted pro forma earnings were 19 cents a share compared to earnings of 18 cents in the previous quarter and 6 cents in the comparable prior-year quarter. Our pro forma estimate excludes restructuring, acquisition-related, impairment and other charges as well as tax adjustments in the last quarter.On a fully diluted GAAP basis, the company recorded a net profit of $183 million ($0.15 per share) compared to income of $168 million ($0.14 per share) in the previous quarter and loss of $525 million ($0.43 per share) in the year-ago quarter.Inventories increased 4.1% during the quarter, with inventory turns flat at 3.4X. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) went from 54 to 75. The cash and short term investments balance was $1.89 billion at quarter-end, having dropped $84 million during the quarter. Goodwill was 27.4% of total assets in the last quarter.The company generated $19 million of cash from operations, spent $50 million on capex, $47 million on share repurchases and $120 million on dividends. At quarter-end, Applied had $1.95 billion of debt on its balance sheet, with a net debt position of $55 million. However, the debt cap ratio including long term liabilities and short term debt was just 26.2%.Applied provided guidance for the fiscal first quarter. Revenue for the first quarter is expected to be up 3-10%, with SSG increasing 15-20%, AGS down 5-10%, display down 15-30% and EES roughly flat.The non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $540 million (+/- $10 million) with the EPS (excluding 4 cents of acquisition-related charges) coming in at 20-24 cents a share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Oct 2013 quarter was 23 cents when the company provided guidance, within the guided range.The last quarter was a moderately good one for Applied. Although SSG remained sluggish, it was not worse than expected. The display side was impacted by slowdown in China, but strength in other areas compensated. Also, diversion of funds locked in EES continued.The PC market remains a dampener, which has impacted all major players from  (  ) to  (  ). However, longer-term drivers for the foundry business remain very strong since mobile devices are dependent on them. Applied has a very strong product line and management has stepped up investments here in preparation for the on-going transitions to larger wafer sizes and smaller process nodes. Management expects significant share gains through 2014, which should generate strong growth.There is also scope for share gains on the Display side of the business, as the company's PVD tools are doing extremely well. The drivers of this business are larger TV screens and better mobile displays that involve more complicated production processes and new tools.Applied shares currently have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), similar to peer  (  ).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) reported first-quarter 2014 earnings of 68 cents a share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents, or 6.8%.KLA reported revenues of $658.3 million, down 8.6% sequentially, 8.7% from the year-ago quarter, within the guided range of $600-750 million and in line with our estimate.KLA-Tencorremains an equipment supplier in a weak demand environment, which is probably the worst spot to be in. Customers are making the most of existing inventory, and maintaining low utilization rates. Additionally, since each system is high-valued, customer concentration is obviated, which results in great fluctuations in revenue/orders in times of weak demand. All these factors were evident in KLA's fourth-quarter results.Products generated 76% of total revenue, down 12.0% sequentially and 12.6% year over year. Revenue declined across product lines, with most notable weakness in defect inspection, followed by metrology. Other revenues were also down significantly off a much smaller base.Services revenues comprised the remaining 24%, up 4.6% sequentially and 6.8% year over year.North America, Taiwan and Korea declined 30.4%, 43.9% and 9.0%, respectively on a sequential basis, while Japan, Europe & Israel and Other Asia grew. Revenue from Taiwan and Japan remained below year-ago levels. Europe & Israel was the strongest, growing triple digits from both the previous and year-ago quarters. Overall, North America, Taiwan, Japan, Europe & Israel, Korea and Other Asia/Pacific generated 27%, 18%, 12%, 18%, 12% and 12% of quarterly revenue, respectively.New orders in the first quarter were $790 million, up 10.8% sequentially and 56.1% year over year. On the other hand, shipments declined from both the previous and year-ago quarters. As a result, the backlog increased 9.1% sequentially and 17.0% from last year.Overall, the order contribution by segment was as follows: memory 47%, foundry customers 45% and logic 8%.KLA's fortunes are tied to the foundry segment, first because the company is more exposed to this market and second, because its process control equipment is in higher demand at foundries that are always looking to improve efficiencies in order to drive down costs.Historically, KLA has had low exposure to the memory segment, but management's focus on the area and declines in other segments have made it a more significant contributor. The relative softness in the logic segment was expected because the company's largest logic customer,  (  ) had been equipping for 14nm production that was completed in the last two quarters.Both wafer and reticle inspection product lines grew strongly from the year-ago quarter. However, while wafer inspection also grew on a sequential basis, reticle inspection dropped off slightly. Other product orders declined from both the previous and year-ago quarters, while service orders grew from both periods. Products were 80% of total orders with services accounting for the balance.North America, Japan and Other Asia/Pacific saw significant declines with Europe, Korea and Taiwan offsetting this weakness. Overall, the order contribution by geography was as follows: North America 22%, Europe 8%, Japan 10%, Korea 18%, Taiwan 26% and Other Asia/Pacific 16%. The relatively higher concentration in Asia is due to the presence of a larger number of foundries and memory manufacturers in the region.KLA's gross margin was up 43 basis points (bps) sequentially and 160 bps year over year to 58.2%. A favorable product mix and lower inventory charges offset the negative impact of lower volumes in the last quarter.Operating expenses of $227.9 million were up 2.3% sequentially and 7.8% from a year ago. The operating margin shrank 324 bps sequentially and 368 bps from last year due to higher R&D and SG&A as a percentage of sales that more than offset the stronger gross margin in both comparisons.The pro forma net income was $114.9 million, or 17.5% of sales compared to $138.6 million, or 19.2% in the Jun 2013 quarter and $142.4 million, or 19.8% in the Sep quarter of last year.

However, revenues were down sequentially due to a weak demand environment. Also, gross margins were limited in the last quarter on account of lower revenues.For the first quarter of fiscal 2014, KLA provided a weak outlook, with revenues anticipated to be in the range of $620-$680 million, down 9.7% sequentially at the midpoint. Non-GAAP EPS is expected in the range of 53-73 cents.Our proven model does not conclusively show that KLA will beat earnings this quarter.

Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. KLA-Tencor Corp. (Symbol: KLAC) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of KLA-Tencor Corp., looking at the history chart for KLAC below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.

Services revenues comprised the remaining 20%, an increase of 7.1% year over year.New orders in the fourth quarter were $713 million, down 3.4% sequentially. The last quarter was not a good one for KLA in terms of orders, although the memory side of the business was quite strong.Overall, the order contribution by segment was as follows: foundry customers 33%, logic customers 23% and memory customers accounted for 44% of new orders in the last quarter.KLA's fortunes are tied to the foundry segment, first because the company is more exposed to this market and second, because its process control equipment is in higher demand at foundries that are always looking to improve efficiencies in order to drive down costs. Historically, KLA has had low exposure to the memory segment, but management's focus on the area and declines in other segments have made it a more significant contributor. KLA's strength in the logic segment is tied to its relationship with  (  ), which is ramping its 14nm production.The wafer inspection product line saw new system orders increase of 5.9% on a sequential basis. Reticle Inspection was up 50.0% sequentially, Metrology was down 30.0% sequentially, Non-semi businesses were down 33.3% sequentially, while Service was up 5% sequentially.U.S., Japan and Other Asia/Pacific drove the increase in orders. Overall, the order contribution by geography was as follows: The U.S. 38%, Europe 6%, Japan 12%, Korea 10%, Taiwan 10% and Other Asia/Pacific 24%. The relatively higher concentration in Asia was due to the presence of a larger number of foundries and memory manufacturers in the region.KLA's gross margin was down 10 basis points (bps) sequentially and 210 bps year over year to 57.4%. The decrease was on account of lower revenues.Operating expenses of $225.9 million were up 6.3% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin was 26.1%, down 960 bps year over year. Higher research and development (R&D) and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses as a percentage of sales were responsible for the contraction from last year.The quarter's GAAP net income was $134.8 million or earnings per share of 80 cents compared with net income of $247.9 million or $1.46 in the comparable quarter last year. Excluding the impact of acquisition-related and restructuring charges on a tax-adjusted basis, pro forma net income came in at $138.6 million or 82 cents per share compared to $253.4 million or $1.49 per share in the year-ago quarter.KLA ended with cash and short-term investments balance of $2.92 billion, up $39.4 million during the quarter. Accounts receivables were $524.6 million versus $454.2 million in the prior quarter.The company generated $175.6 million in cash from operations, spending $18.9 million on capital expenses, $68.3 million on share repurchases and $66.2 million on dividends during the quarter.For the first quarter of fiscal 2014, KLA expects orders of $600-$750 million and shipments of $620-$680 million. Quarterly revenues are expected to be between $620 million and $680 million, gross margin between 56%-57.5%, and opex in a range of $218-$222 million. The tax rate is expected to be 23%, yielding non-GAAP EPS in the range of 53 - 73 cents, below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 87 cents.KLA's fourth quarter results and first quarter guidance indicate that the key foundry segment remains under pressure.However, underlying drivers (process node transition and strong demand for smartphones and mobile computing devices) should increase capex spending in the second half of the year.The technical complexity of manufacturing semiconductors and increasingly challenging yield issues are long-term revenue drivers for this leading manufacturer of process control equipment.Currently, KLA shares have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Revenues were also ahead, beating by 3.5%. Increased demand in the SSG and Display segments and effective cost control helped results.Applied reported revenue of $1.97 billion, which was up 25.4% sequentially and down 22.4% year over year, better than the guided range of a 15-25% increase. The outperformance versus expectations was on account of better-than-expected results in the SSG and Display segments, as offset by the worse-than-expected results in the EES segment.The  segment contributed 65% of revenue, growing 33.2% sequentially and declining 27.3% from the year-ago quarter. Foundry and DRAM spending helped the revenue increase in the last quarter, with NAND orders finally picking up. Considering order trends, the revenue concentration at a few large foundry customers should continue. (  ) Ultrabook partners and  (  ) Windows 8 adopters may be expected to help demand through 2013. Applied generally sees seasonal strength in the second and third quarters of its fiscal year, with weakness in the fourth and first.The second largest segment was  with a 26% revenue share. Segment revenue was up 9.8% sequentially and down 6.2% year over year, at the high end of Applied's expectations of 0-10% sequential increase. While revenues came in at the high end of guidance, lower-than-expected wafer starts and utilization rates impacted orders.The 46.0% sequential increase and 5.2% year-over-year decline in the  segment was much better than the broad guidance range of a sequential increase of 0-25%. Segment contribution remained at 6%. Demand for mobile devices (high-resolution mobile displays for tablets and touch panels for ultrabooks) continues to increase, which is complementing the resurgence in the TV market. Applied's expanding product line is partly responsible for the increased total available market (TAM), which will spur growth in the following quarters. Order growth was attributed to share gains and TV capacity adds in China.The  segment accounted for 2% of total quarterly revenue, down 17.4% sequentially, 51.9% from last year and significantly lower than management's expectations of sequentially consistent revenues. The weakness in solar (due to overcapacity and weaker-than-expected demand) continued in the last quarter, while other parts of the business did better.Around 74% of Applied's quarterly revenue came from the Asia/Pacific region, with the largest contribution from Taiwan, which generated 42% and followed by China, which generated 9%. The only softness in the last quarter was in the U.S., which declined 9.7% sequentially. Applied saw double-digit sequential increases across all other geographies, with Japan, Taiwan and China growing the strongest. The revenue distribution by geography was as follows: the U.S. 18%, Europe 7%, Taiwan 42%, Korea 11%, China 9%, Japan 8% and South East Asia 4%.Total orders were up 7.2% sequentially and down 18.0% year over year. AGS and EES orders were down 11.6% and 42.6%, respectively. However, SSG and Display more than made up, growing 13.8% and 41.3%, respectively from the Jan 2013 quarter. Display was the only segment that grew from last year (up 132.1%), with all other segments declining double-digits.The net result was a positive BTB across all except the AGS segment, with Display coming in strongest, followed by SSG and then EES.Orders were up sequentially across all Asian countries except Taiwan, which was down slightly. The U.S. was also sluggish, growing a mere 1.8%, but Europe was strong, jumping 29.1%.Applied generated a gross margin of 43.2%, up 339 basis points (bps) from the previous quarter's 39.8%, helped by higher volumes and lower inventory charges. The gross margin was up 107 bps from the year-ago quarter.Applied's operating expenses of $567 million were up 10.3% from the Dec 2012 quarter. However, all expenses declined as a percentage of sales, which resulted in the 732 bp sequential expansion in the operating margin. The operating margin was still well below the 19.2% posted in the year-ago quarter, with higher R&D being the most significant driver and SG&A also increasing substantially as a percentage of sales.On a pro forma basis, Applied Materials had a net income of $199 million, or a 10.1% net income margin compared to $69 million, or 4.4% in the previous quarter and $348 million, or 13.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2012.The fully diluted pro forma earnings were 17 cents a share compared to earnings of 6 cents in the previous quarter and 27 cents in the comparable prior-year quarter. Our pro forma estimate excludes restructuring, acquisition-related, impairment and other charges as well as tax adjustments in the last quarter.On a fully diluted GAAP basis, the company recorded a net loss of $129 million ($0.11 per share) compared to income of $34 million ($0.03 per share) in the previous quarter and income of $289 million ($0.22 per share) in the year-ago quarter.Inventories increased 3.1% during the quarter, with inventory turns increasing from 3.0X to 3.4X. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) went from 64 to 59. The cash and short term investments balance was $1.77 billion at quarter-end, having increased $17 million during the quarter. Goodwill was 28.2% of total assets in the last quarter.The company generated $224 million of cash from operations, spent $51 million on capex, $100 million on share repurchases and $108 million on dividends. At quarter-end, Applied had $1.95 billion of debt on its balance sheet, with a net debt position of $176 million. The debt cap ratio including long term liabilities and short term debt was just 27.3%.Applied did not provide expectations for each individual segment as it usually does and instead said that there would be a slight sequential increase in revenue.The non-GAAP EPS (excluding 4 cents of acquisition-related charges) is expected to come in at 16-20 cents a share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Jul 2013 quarter was 20 cents when the company provided guidance, at the high end of the guided range.Applied's results in the last quarter reflect improvements in its core semiconductor and display markets. However, AGS orders indicate that customers remain cautious and management also stated that the strength at foundries (the biggest driver of SSG revenues) remains concentrated in a few hands. Therefore, any recovery is likely to be slow. The EES business is a drag due to multiple issues and over capacity in that market. While management initiatives to cut segment costs are encouraging, the segment will continue to pull down overall results at Applied.Additionally, since Applied is a company with significant fixed costs, the bottom line has also taken a beating. Therefore, the strength in mobility platforms, increased TV capacity and cost diversion from EES to more profitable areas will have a positive impact on its growth and profitability going forward.Applied shares currently have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), similar to other equipment suppliers, such as  (  ) and Lam Research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["lon Musk's Tesla (NASDAQ:  ), the electric car maker whose shares have more than tripled this year, is going to be found in more  after NASDAQ OMX Global Indexes announced the stock will replace Oracle (NASDAQ:  ) as a member of the Nasdaq 100.Enterprise software maker is leaving the Nasdaq 100 because it is switching to a listing on the New York Stock Exchange.

The official announcement is likely to be made next week.Google launched its high speed Internet service named Google Fiber in Kansas City, Mo in Sep 2012 and recently expanded the service to Olathe, a Kansas City suburb.Google provides the service under three plans. In the first one, the residents pay $70.0 a month solely for the Internet connection. The second plan comes at a price of $120.0 and offers TV service, a digital video recorder and a set-top box along with a tablet-computer remote control. The third option offers seven years of free Internet access at slower speeds for which the customer needs to pay a one-time installation fee of $300.Google is banking on its speed to attract users. This can open another growth avenue for the company as speed has been the limiting factor for increased consumption of video and other data-heavy activities through the Internet. Whether Google can make it commercially viable is still not clear because others (Verizon and AT&T) have previously tried and failed. However, if it is successful, Google TV could catch on fast.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, Google's gross revenue (including TAC) touched a record $14.4 billion, representing sequential and year-over-year increases of 2.3% and 36.2%, respectively. Excluding the $1.5 billion contribution from Motorola, revenues were up 21.9% from the year-ago quarter.Google has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The weak guidance sent share prices down 5.0% in extended trading.KLA reported revenue of $729.0 million, which was up 8.3% sequentially and down 13.3% from the year-ago quarter. This was better than the mid-point of the guidance range.KLA remains an equipment supplier in a weak demand environment, which is probably the worst spot to be in. Customers are making the most of existing inventory, and maintaining low utilization rates. Additionally, since each system is high-valued, there is a natural customer concentration, which results in great fluctuations in revenue/orders in times of weak demand. All these factors were evident from KLA's third-quarter results.Products generated 80% of total revenue, a 10.8% sequential increase and 17.3% year-over-year decline. Services revenue comprised the remaining 20%, flattish sequentially and up 7.1% year over year.The two main product lines grew sequentially although growth rates were lower than the March quarters of the last two years. Defect inspection was up 16.4% sequentially and Metrology 16.1%. The two product lines were a respective 9.8% and 26.9% below the year-ago level.The U.S., Taiwan and Korea grew revenue 58.5%, 1.8% and 40.2% on a sequential basis, while Japan, Europe & Israel, and Other Asia declined 34.1% and 8.5% and 47.8%, respectively. All except the U.S. and Taiwan declined double-digits from the year-ago quarter.The last quarter was not such a good one for KLA in terms of orders, although the memory side of the business was quite strong.The 2.9% sequential decline in sales was the net effect of a 59.9% increase at memory customers, 51.7% increase at logic customers and a 31.9% decline at foundries. Memory was the only segment to have grown from the year-ago quarter, but the 51.1% increase was not enough to offset the 25.6% decline in logic and 26.2% decline in foundry. Foundry, memory and logic customers contributed 47%, 28% and 25% of quarterly orders, respectively.KLA's fortunes are tied to the foundry segment, first because the company is more exposed to this market and second, because its process control equipment is in higher demand at foundries that are always looking to improve efficiencies in order to drive down costs. Historically, KLA has had low exposure to the memory segment, but management focus on the area and declines in other segments have made it a more significant contributor. KLA's strength in the logic segment is tied to its relationship with  (  ), which is en route to ramping its 14nm production.The wafer inspection product line saw new system orders increase 3.2% on a sequential basis, while declining 16.3% year over year. Reticle Inspection was down 41.7% sequentially and 11.4% from a year ago. Metrology was up 2.2% sequentially and down 6.7% from last year. Solar, storage, HB LED and other products were down 2.9% sequentially and 33.6% from last year.Europe, Japan and Other Asia/Pacific drove the increase in orders. Overall, the order contribution by geography was as follows-The U.S. 17%, Europe 17%, Japan 9%, Korea 10%, Taiwan 35% and Other Asia/Pacific 12%. The relatively higher concentration in Asia is due to the presence of a larger number of foundries and memory manufacturers in the region.The six-month backlog at quarter-end was $1.10 billion, up 0.8% sequentially and down 17.9% from the year-ago quarter.KLA's gross margin expanded 279 bps sequentially while shrinking 37 bps year over year to 57.9%. The sequential increase was on account of higher revenues and lower reserves. The incremental gross margin stayed well above the targeted 60-70%.Operating expenses of $212.9 million were up flat sequentially. The operating margin was 28.7%, up 532 bps sequentially and down 593 bps year over year. The sequential expansion in the operating margin was almost equally attributable to the stronger gross margin and lower R&D (as a percentage of sales) although SG&A was also slightly lower. Higher R&D and SG&A as a percentage of sales were responsible for the contraction from last year.Excluding the impact of acquisition-related and restructuring charges on a tax-adjusted basis, the pro forma net income came in at $171.3 million, or 23.5% of sales, compared to $106.0 million, or 15.7% in the previous quarter and $215.8 million, or 25.7% of sales in the year-ago quarter.Including the special items, the GAAP net income was $166.5 million ($0.98 per share) compared to income of $106.6 million ($0.63 per share) in the Dec 2012 quarter and $205.3 million ($1.21 per share) in the Mar quarter of last year.Inventories were down 1.9% during the quarter, with inventory turns flat at 1.9X. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) went from 82 to around 57. KLA ended with cash and short term investments balance of $2.88 billion, up $301.3 million during the quarter. The company generated $4148 million of cash from operations, spending $18.3 million on capital expenses, $68.3 million on share repurchases and $66.6 million on dividends during the quarter.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, KLA expects orders of $625-775 million and shipments of $740-800 million. Quarterly revenue is expected to be between $670 million and $730 million, gross margin 56-57.5%, opex to increase by $3-7 million, Other expense of $10 million and a tax rate of 24% yielding a non-GAAP EPS of between $0.66 and $0.86, below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.86.KLA's third quarter results and fourth quarter guidance indicate that the key foundry segment remains under pressure. Consequently, despite the improvement in the rest of the business, the sluggishness in its most important segment will contain growth. However, underlying drivers (process node transition and strong demand for in smartphones and mobile computing devices) should drive increased capex spending in the second half of the year.The technical complexity of manufacturing semiconductors and increasingly challenging yield issues are long-term revenue drivers for the leading manufacturer of process control equipment.KLA shares currently carry a Zacks Rank #3, but peers  (  ) and  (  ), both carrying a Zacks rank #2 appear to be better investments at this time.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["-commerce giant  (  ) announced the expansion of its X-Ray for movies feature to TV shows viewed on Kindle Fire HD tablets through Amazon Instant Video.Amazon Instant Video is a digital video streaming and download service that lets users rent, buy or subscribe to a range of video content.

It has been expanding its video offerings to compete with  (  ), Huluand other rivals. It has not only inked exclusive deals for shows like \"Justified,\" but is also starting to create original content. Amazon also allowed users to subscribe to its Prime service on a monthly basis instead of its original annual subscription.The tablet market is extremely competitive and Amazon cannot afford to miss out on any opportunity to grow its still-small customer base. As per a report by IDC, 52.5 million units of tablets were shipped in 2012, which witnessed a 75.3% jump from the year-ago quarter. Apple led the market followed by Samsung, Amazon and others.Amazon's Kindle Fire still has a long way to go. However, Amazon is more concerned with the sale of digital goods (books, video and so on) through its Kindle platform. Unlike the other tablet makers, Amazon is primarily a retailer.Therefore, its Kindle strategy is first and foremost intended to help product sales (primarily digital goods). Its Kindle platform is intended to protect and grow these sales and the strategy has proved successful thus far.Amazon's fourth quarter revenues of $21.3 billion were up sequentially as well as from the year-ago quarter.

The second one is for $120.0, which offers TV service, a digital video recorder and a set- top box along with a tablet-computer remote control. The third option offers seven years of free Internet access at slower speeds and the customers need to pay a one-time installation fee of $300.Google is banking on its speed to attract users. This can open further avenues for other new online services and can help Google to expand its online offerings.According to Global Industry Analysts, Inc.

This flexibility makes the devices more expensive compared to regular programmable logic devices (PLDs), so their use is relatively restricted.Lattice has developed its ultra-low density FPGA by keeping in mind the requirements of hardware designers, which are faster data processing speeds at lower power. The Lattice solution not only offers power and cost advantages over ASSPs, but also includes reference designs and application notes that speed up the entire development process including the time to market.The iCE40 LP384 FPGA can be used in a wide range of applications, such as portable medical monitors, smartphones, digital cameras, eReaders and compact embedded systems. It will be available in packages as small as 2.5 mm x 2.5 mm with a migration path to 2.0 mm x 2.0 mm and at prices less than 50 cents per unit in multi-million unit quantities.According to a Research and Markets report, the global FPGA market is poised to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.4% from 2011 to 2015 driven by the growing demand for customizable integrated circuits (ICs).Demand for FPGAs are increasing since they allow increased flexibility in terms of creating designs and enable electronic device manufacturing companies to minimize their research and development (R&D) costs. The bright prospects in the FPGA space can prove to be a long-term growth driver for Lattice.Lattice Semiconductor designs, develops and markets high performance programmable logic devices and related development system software.

Prior to this announcement, KLA had been paying a quarterly dividend of 40 cents per share.The strength of KLA's business model is reflected in the company's strong cash generation capabilities and its commitment to return value to shareholders. We believe that continued increase in dividends will inspire investor loyalty through higher returns from the stock.KLA's strong balance sheet and cash flows provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, share repurchases and strategic acquisitions. During the last concluded quarter, KLA spent $68.3 million on share repurchases and $66.6 million on dividends.

The lower end of the earnings outlook range has also been raised to 28-32 cents per share from the previous guidance of 24-32 cents. The earnings guidance includes acquisition and restructuring charges and tax benefit of 6 cents per share.Management stated that it is seeing improving demand for its chips from industrial customers and better-than-expected wireless chip sales. TI said that the demand for chips used in tablets and handsets was better-than-expected, but revenue from the Wireless segment would still decline in the first quarter as it is gradually defocusing the mobile business (and transferring the remaining wireless business to the Other segment).However, the company admitted that it was still seeing weakness in the notebook and communications infrastructure markets.Like other chip makers, TI has struggled in recent quarters due to a slow global economy and weak consumer spending. To maintain momentum, the company responded in part by cutting costs and trying to expand the use of its application processors on embedded solutions for the automobile, industrial and other non-consumer markets, which have a longer life cycle.Last month, the company increased its quarterly dividend by 33% and authorized the repurchase of additional shares worth $5 billion. Management said that the company is witnessing improving order backlog for the first time in several quarters due to improving demand from end-users rather than chip inventory restocking.

The outperformance versus expectations was on account of better-than-expected results in the SSG segment. segment revenue grew 11.4% sequentially, which was however down 27.9% from the year-ago quarter. Strength at foundries drove the outperformance in the last quarter that was partially offset by softness in the NAND segment. Management stated that there was great revenue concentration in the last quarter with most of the revenue coming from the top three customers. (  ) Ultrabook partners and  (  ) Windows 8 adopters may be expected to help demand through 2013. Applied generally sees seasonal strength in the second and third quarters of its fiscal year, with weakness in the fourth and first.The second largest segment was  with a 30% revenue share. Segment revenue was down 24.2% sequentially and 11.8% year over year, at the low end of Applied's expectations of a 15-25% sequential decline.The sequential comparison was more difficult because of the $10 million contribution from the thin film line in the preceding quarter. Segment weakness was related to lower wafer starts and lower utilization rates at semiconductor fabs for the second straight quarter, as customer spending patterns remained cautious.The 6.5% sequential and 16.3% year-over-year declines in the  segment was within management's very broad guidance range of a sequential decline of 0-30%. Segment contribution remained at 6%. Demand for mobile devices (high-resolution mobile displays for tablets and touch panels for ultrabooks) continues to increase, which is the main reason that the rate of revenue decline is going down.Management also stated that there was evidence of TV demand coming back. Applied's expanding product line is partly responsible for the increased total available market (TAM), which will spur growth in following quarters.The  segment accounted for 3% of total quarterly revenue, down 25.8% sequentially, 77.8% from last year and better than management's guidance of at least a 30% sequential decline. The weakness in solar (due to overcapacity and weaker-than-expected demand) continued in the last quarter, while other parts of the business did better.Around 67% of Applied's quarterly revenue came from the Asia/Pacific region, with the largest contribution from Taiwan, which generated 36% and followed by China, which generated 11%. Applied saw double-digit sequential declines in South East Asia, China and Japan. Taiwan and Korea were up strong double-digits due to the strength at foundries. The U.S. also grew though not as strongly. Europe disappointed.Total orders were up 44.2% sequentially and 5.2% year over year. Orders grew across all except the AGS segment (in line with normal seasonality). SSG and Display were up 83.9% and 66.3%, respectively on a sequential basis with EES growing 4.6% and AGS declining 5.6%. Display and EES jumped 245.0% and 106.1%, respectively from last year, with AGS growing 5.2% and SSG down 3.9%.The net result was a positive BTB across all segments, with Display coming in strongest, followed EES, SSG and then AGS.Orders grew very strongly across all Asian countries except Japan. They were down, however, in Japan, the U.S. and Europe.Applied generated a gross margin of 39.8%, up 140 basis points (bps) from the previous quarter's 38.4%, as a higher mix of SSG revenue offset the impact of weaker volumes. The gross margin was down 86 bps from the year-ago quarter.Applied's operating expenses of $514 million were flattish with the Sep 2012 quarter, which helped the 19 bp sequential expansion in the operating margin. The operating margin was still well below the 15.7% level posted in the year-ago quarter. Lower volumes impacted results, with all expenses increasing as a percentage of sales.On a pro forma basis, Applied Materials had a net income of $69 million, or a 4.4% net income margin compared to $70 million, or 4.3% in the previous quarter and $240 million, or 11.0% in the first quarter of fiscal 2012.The fully diluted pro forma earnings were 6 cents a share compared to earnings of 6 cents in the previous quarter and 18 cents in the comparable prior-year quarter. Our pro forma estimate excludes restructuring and acquisition-related, as well as tax adjustments in the last quarter. Our pro forma estimate may not match management's presentation due to the addition/exclusion of some items not considered by management.On a fully diluted GAAP basis, the company recorded a net income of $34 million ($0.03 per share) compared to loss of $525 million ($0.43 per share) in the previous quarter and income of $117 million ($0.09 per share) in the year-ago quarter.Inventories increased just 0.5% during the quarter, with inventory turns dropping from 3.2X to 3.0X.

Goodwill was 30.0% of total assets in the last quarter.The company generated $16 million of cash from operations, spent $49 million on capex, $48 million on share repurchases and $108 million on dividends. At quarter-end, Applied had $1.95 billion of debt on its balance sheet, with a net debt position of $193 million. The debt cap ratio including long term liabilities and short term debt was just 26.8%.Applied expects a stronger second quarter. It currently expects SSG revenue to be up 20-25% sequentially, AGS to be up 0-10%, Display to be up 0-25% (due to strength in mobile platforms and TV capacity additions) and EES to be relatively flat. The net effect will be a 15-25% sequential increase in revenue.The non-GAAP EPS (excluding 4 cents of acquisition-related charges) is expected to come in at 9-15 cents a share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Apr 2013 quarter was 11 cents when the company provided guidance, within the guided range.Applied's results in the last quarter were better than expected, with both revenue and earnings projections for the next quarter more or less in line with expectations. Order growth was also encouraging and it appears that the company is past the bottom.However, Applied's results have been impacted by caution at customers stemming from a weak demand environment. Since Applied is a company with significant fixed costs, the bottom line has also taken a beating. Therefore, the strength in mobility platforms and increased TV capacity will have a positive impact on its profitability going forward.Applied shares currently have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), similar to other equipment suppliers, such as  (  ) and Lam Research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ccording to  , the largest CFO sells during the past week were: Danaher Corporation, Jefferies Group Inc., SanDisk Corp., KLA-Tencor Corporation and Autodesk Inc.Executive Vice President and CFO  sold 90,460 shares of DHR stock on 01/31/2013 at the average price of $60.31.

The backlog growth and better-than-expected guidance drove share prices up 2.4%.KLA reported revenue of $673.0 million, which was down 6.6% sequentially and up 4.8% from the year-ago quarter. This was much better than the mid-point of the guidance range and also exceeded our expectations of around $635 million.KLA remains an equipment supplier in a weak demand environment, which is probably the worst spot to be in. Customers are making the most of existing inventory, and maintaining low utilization rates.Additionally, since each system is high-valued, there is a natural customer concentration, which results in great fluctuations in revenue/orders in times of weak demand. All these factors were evident from KLA's second-quarter results.Products generated 78% of total revenue, an 8.9% sequential decline and 4.5% year-over-year increase. Services revenue comprised the remaining 22%, up 2.3% sequentially and 5.8% year over year.The two main product lines declined sequentially. Defect inspection declined 7.4% sequentially and grew 7.1% year over year. Metrology was down 13.0% and 11.5% from the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively.The U.S., Japan, and Europe & Israel regions grew revenue 13.1%, 4.7% and 1.0% on a sequential basis, while Taiwan, Korea and Other Asia declined 19.1% and 18.5% and 8.2%, respectively. All except the U.S. and Taiwan declined from the year-ago quarter.The last quarter was a good one for KLA in terms of orders, as strong demand for tablets and other mobile devices kept the pressure on foundries, which in turn increased their orders with KLA.The 50.2% sequential increase in orders was mainly because of the foundry segment, which grew 114.2% to 67% of total new system orders. Memory customers grew 83.4% for a 17% share, with logic declining 7.9% to a 16% share. Foundry, memory and logic customers saw order declines of 12.8%, 21.1% and 56.0%, respectively from the year-ago quarter. Non-semi and service orders also increased sequentially.KLA's fortunes are tied to the foundry segment, first because the company is more exposed to this market and second, because its process control equipment is in higher demand at foundries that are always looking to improve efficiencies in order to drive down costs. KLA's strength in the logic segment is tied to its relationship with  (  ), which is en route to ramping its 14nm production.The wafer inspection product line saw orders jump 41.4% on a sequential basis, while declining 20.0% year over year. Reticle Inspection grew 1,401.9% sequentially and dropped 38.5% from a year ago. Metrology was up 90.3% sequentially and down 30.9% from last year. Solar, storage, HB LED and other products were up 12.6% sequentially and down 20.0% from last year.Taiwan and the U.S. drove most of the increase in orders. Overall, the order contribution by geography was as follows-U.S. 33%, Europe 1%, Japan 7%, Korea 13%, Taiwan 39% and Other Asia/Pacific 7%. The relatively higher concentration in Asia is due to the presence of a larger number of foundries and memory manufacturers in the region.The six-month backlog at quarter-end was $1.09 billion, up 6.3% sequentially and down 22.1% from the year-ago quarter.KLA's gross margin shrunk 149 bps sequentially and 322 bps year over year to 55.1%, due to inventory reserves and adjustments related to product transitions at customers. The incremental gross margin stayed above the targeted 60-70%.Operating expenses of $213.5 million were up 1.0% from the previous quarter's $211.5 million. The operating margin was 23.4%, down 387 bps sequentially and 280 bps year over year. The sequential decline in the operating margin was mainly because of a weaker gross margin and higher R&D (as a percentage of sales) although SG&A also increased. The decline from last year was entirely on account of the weaker gross margin.Excluding the impact of acquisition-related expenses on a tax-adjusted basis and discrete tax items, the pro forma net income came in at $106.0 million, or 15.7% of sales, compared to $142.4 million, or 19.8% in the previous quarter and $121.9 million, or 19.0% of sales in the year-ago quarter.Including the special items, the GAAP net income was $106.6 million ($0.63 per share) compared to income of $135.4 million ($0.80 per share) in the Sep 2012 quarter and $110.8 million ($0.66 per share) in the Dec quarter of last year.Inventories were down 3.9% during the quarter, with inventory turns flat at 1.8X. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) went from 68 to around 82. KLA ended with cash and short term investments balance of $2.58 billion, down $59.8 million during the quarter. The company generated $77.4 million of cash from operations, spending $17.1 million on capital expenses, $68.3 million on share repurchases and $66.5 million on dividends during the quarter.For the second quarter of fiscal 2013, KLA expects orders to be $700 to $850 million, revenue of between $690 million and $750 million and non-GAAP EPS of between $0.76 and $0.96, well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.73.KLA's second quarter results and third quarter guidance indicate stronger demand although the guidance range appears wide. The backlog growth was encouraging however, as it followed three quarters of decline. The fact that it was driven by growth across all segments (semi, non-semi and services) is particularly encouraging.The technical complexity of manufacturing semiconductors and increasingly challenging yield issues are long-term revenue drivers for the leading manufacturer of process control equipment.KLA shares currently carry a Zacks Rank #3, similar to peer  (  ) but better than  (  ), which has a Zacks Rank #4.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) has announced an advanced version of its superjunction power Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs), MDmesh II Plus\u2122 Low gate charge (Qg) for consumer appliances, computing and telecom systems, lighting controllers and solar energy equipment.The new device, MDmesh II Plus\u2122 Low Qg, features low gate charge as well as low input, which helps in efficient switching without power loss. The device helps to save energy in resonant-type power supplies that are widely used in LCD TVs. Additionally, the device is highly stable in environments with significant voltage fluctuations, which saves transistors from sudden breakdown.The superjunction MOSFETs have extremely fast switching characteristics and, therefore, reduce switching losses. The superjunction technology allows power transistors to combine small size and high voltage capacity to improve energy efficiency when turned on.According to the Multimedia Research Group, the superjunction MOSFET market is expected to grow at 10.3% per year to $1 billion by 2018. Consumer remains the main application segment for superjunction MOSFET and accounts for two third of its total market. Currently, the superjunction MOSFET market stands at less than $5 million.The superjunction MOSFET market will continue to expand steadily given increasing concerns about protecting the global environment. In the IT sector, green IT has been attracting attention as a way to achieve power savings. In order to reduce power loss in IT equipment, it is necessary to make the power converters used with IT equipment more efficient. Hence, there is a strong demand for energy-efficient MOSFETs. STMicro is therefore likely to be one of the beneficiaries of this growth.STMicroelectronics is one of the pioneers in the field of high efficiency solutions with its superjunction power MOSFETs. The companyprovides cutting-edge solutions to meet the growing demand for high-performance devices with low voltage consumption in today's wireless telecommunications and consumer electronics applications.In the recently concluded fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, the company's total revenue of $2.16 billion was down 1.3% from the year-ago period. Net loss was 11 cents per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9 cents loss per share on lower volumes and lower gross margins.STMicroelectronics carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). However, other semiconductor stocks that have been performing well and are worth considering include  (  ),  (  ), and  (  ), all carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) is set to report second quarter fiscal 2013 results on Jan 24. Last quarter, it posted a negative earnings surprise of 3.45%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Just like other technology companies, KLA has also been affected by the slump in the PC market due to a sluggish economy. The slowing end markets and caution at customers led to weak sales growth rates at KLA in the first quarter of 2013. Customers made the most of the existing inventory and maintained low utilization rates. Weaker volumes also impacted margins in the last quarter.Orders declined across all customers, with foundries being the worst impacted. With the improvement in 28nm yields, the demand for process control equipment has declined, thus impacting foundry orders.According to a recent report from Gartner, worldwide wafer fab equipment (WFE) spending is forecasted to total $27 billion in 2013, a 9.7% decline from 2012 due to overall market weakness. We believe that significant growth in KLA's business is not likely until semiconductor demand gains momentum.Our proven model does not conclusively show that KLA-Tencor is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP (Read:  )and a Zacks Rank #1, #2 or #3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 57 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. KLA-Tencor's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) lowers the predictive power of ESP because the Zacks Rank #3 when combined with a ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult. We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and #5 (Sell rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: . (  ), with Earnings ESP of +14.82% and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) (  ), with Earnings ESP of +3.64% and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) .

Revenues were partly responsible, beating consensus expectations by 4.2%.Applied reported revenue of $1.65 billion, which was down 29.7% sequentially and 24.6% year over year, at the low end of the 25-40% decline. The outperformance versus expectations was on account of better-than-expected results in the SSG segment, which offset the worse-than-expected results in the other segments.The  segment revenue slid 43.7% sequentially and 18.5% year over year to 53% of total revenue. The decline was broad-based across foundry, memory and logic customers. Logic appears to be the most steady at the moment, though foundry is also expected to be up in the next quarter. (  ) Ultrabook partners and  (  ) Windows 8 adopters may be expected to help demand. The transition to smaller geometries will continue to drive demand in fiscal 2013. Applied generally sees seasonal strength in the second and fourth quarters of its fiscal year, with weakness in the fourth and first.The second largest segment was  with a 38% revenue share. Segment revenue was up 7.3% sequentially and down 1.3% year over year, missing the mid-point of Applied's expectations of a 5-15% sequential increase, despite a $10 million outperformance in the thin film line. Segment weakness was related to lower wafer starts and lower utilization rates at semiconductor fabs.The 34.5% sequential and 45.6% year-over-year declines in the  segment was within management's very broad guidance range of a sequential decline of 25-40%. Segment contribution remained at 6%. Demand for mobile devices (high-resolution mobile displays for tablets and touch panels for ultrabooks) were again the driver for the segment in the last quarter, which was however offset by weakness on the TV side.However, management appeared optimistic about resurgent TV demand in the next quarter. Applied's expanding product line is partly responsible for the increased total available market (TAM), which will spur growth in following quarters.The  segment accounted for 4% of total quarterly revenue, down 19.5% sequentially, 80.3% from last year and more or less in line with management's guidance of a 10-30% sequential decline. The weakness in the last quarter was because of protracted weakness in solar (due to overcapacity and weaker-than-expected demand), which had management write down EES goodwill by $425 million.Around 73% of Applied's quarterly revenue came from the Asia/Pacific region, with the largest contribution from Taiwan, which generated 28% and followed by China, which generated 12%. Applied saw double-digit sequential declines across all regions in Asia. North America also declined 15.4%. Europe was the bright spot, growing 47.3%.Total orders were down 18.6% sequentially and 8.2% year over year. Orders grew across all except the SSG segment (in line with normal seasonality). SSG was down 36.4% sequentially and 19.9% year over year.The AGS, Display and EES segments increased 8.5%, 23.9% and 85.7%, respectively on a sequential basis, while growing 2.1%, 315.0% and -24.4%, respectively from last year. The net result was a negative BTB across all except the EES segment, with SSG coming in weakest, followed by Display and then AGS.Orders declined across all geographies except Japan and North America, which were up sequentially by 43.8% and 3.6%, respectively.Applied generated a gross margin of 38.4%, down 317 basis points (bps) from the previous quarter's 41.6%, hurt by weaker volumes. The gross margin was down 125 bps from the year-ago quarter.Applied's operating expenses of $518 million were down 4.6% from the June 2012 quarter, but not enough to prevent the operating margin sliding 1,147 bps sequentially (1,067 bps year over year) to 6.9%. Lower volumes impacted results, with all expenses increasing as a percentage of sales.On a pro forma basis, Applied Materials had a net income of $70 million, or a 4.3% net income margin compared to $300 million, or 12.8% in the previous quarter and $271 million, or 12.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.The fully diluted pro forma earnings were 6 cents a share compared to earnings of 24 cents in the previous quarter and 20 cents in the comparable prior-year quarter. Our pro forma estimate excludes restructuring, acquisition-related, goodwill impairment and other charges and tax adjustments in the last quarter. Our pro forma estimate may not match management's presentation due to the addition/exclusion of some items not considered by management.On a fully diluted GAAP basis, the company recorded a net loss of $515 million (-$0.42 per share) compared to income of $218 million ($0.17 per share) in the previous quarter and $466 million ($0.35 per share) in the year-ago quarter.Despite the 7.8% decline in inventories, inventory turns dropped from 4.0X to 3.2X. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) went from 60 to 67. The cash and short term investments balance was $1.94 billion at quarter-end, having dropped $227 million during the quarter. Goodwill was 29.1% of total assets in the last quarter.The company generated $411 million of cash from operations, spent $41 million on capex, $516 million on share repurchases and $111 million on dividends. At quarter-end, Applied had $1.95 billion of debt on its balance sheet, with a net debt position of $9 million. The debt cap ratio including long term liabilities and short term debt was just 26.5%.Applied expects revenues and orders to bottom in the fiscal fourth quarter unless there is further weakening of the global economy. It currently expects SSG to be up 0-10% sequentially, AGS to be down 15-25% (as the $85 million contribution from the thin film solar line will be absent in the next quarter), Display to be down 0-30% (due to the TV capacity ramp being pushed out another quarter) and EES to be down more than 30%. The net effect will be a 0-15% sequential decline in revenue.The non-GAAP EPS (excluding 5 cents of acquisition-related charges) is expected to come in at 0-6 cents a share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the October quarter was 10 cents when the company provided guidance, much above the high end of the guided range.Applied's results in the last quarter were better than expected, although both revenue and earnings projections for the next quarter were well below expectations. While management did show optimism about a turnaround and order rates do look positive (especially in Display), growth is likely to remain muted for another quarter.The last two years have seen revenue decline across all segments, as the company continues to battle with the cyclical industry, as well as caution and increased efficiency at customers. Since Applied is a company with significant fixed costs, the bottom line has also taken a beating.Additionally, the solar business has shrunk 90.3% from over 22% of its revenue in the January quarter of 2011 to a little over 4% in the last quarter. If the solar business had taken off, it would have been a competitive edge for Applied, but in the current environment, it is actually turning into a negative for the company.In contrast, companies like  (  ) and  (  ) are not weighed down by solar exposure. KLA in particular has gained from the demand for increased efficiency in the soft demand environment. These Zacks #3 Rank stocks are therefore better plays on the equipment sector.The fact that guided numbers were below expectations will tell on Applied's earnings estimate revisions, which will therefore keep the Zacks Rank under pressure Applied shares currently have a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell rating in the next 1-3 months).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["emiconductor manufacturer, KLA-Tencor Corporation(  ) has reported a decrease in quarterly earnings, missing analysts expectations.The Milpitas, CA based company reported third quarter profit of $135 million, or 80 cents a share, compared with $192 million, or $1.13 a share from last year.Revenue was reported at $721 million, compared with $796 million from last year. On average, analysts expected $740 million.The decline in profit is due to a decrease in demand for memory chips for PCs, as the entire PC industry slows down. Increased sales of smartphones and tablets have increased activity in the mirco chip industy, but it is not enough to offset the decline in PC sales.Micro Chip manufacturers have decreased their investments in new next technology due to the decline in demand, and the current economic conditions.KLA-Tencor shares were down 24 cents, or 0.51% during premarket trading Friday.Shares of KLA-Tencor (  ) have a 3.39% dividend yield, based on last night's closing stock price of $47.14.

We witness only one downward revision in analyst estimates in the few days before the release.Applied's third quarter 2012 pro forma earnings were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate due to lower-than-expected operating expenses.Revenue of $2.34 billion was down 7.8% sequentially but better than management's revised guidance of at least a 10% sequential decline. Improvement in the Display business and in-line performance of the Applied Global Services (AGS) segment led to better-than-expected revenue.Orders in the quarter were down 34.9% sequentially due to weak orders across all segments. Gross margins also decreased sequentially to 41.6% mainly on account of weaker volumes.Applied expects revenues and orders to hit the bottom in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 unless the global economy deteriorates further. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to come in at 0-6 cents a share. For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 3 cents, at the midpoint of the guided range.(Detailed earnings results can be viewed in the blog titled: Out of the 15 and 17 analysts providing estimates for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2012, respectively, there was one downward revision each in the last 30 days.A few analysts expect a decent fourth quarter with earnings in line with the midpoint of the guidance of 0-6 cents due to cost cutting measures taken by the new management. They believe that SSG and AGS segments will likely benefit from the Varian acquisition, partially offset by the uncertainties in the core business.On the contrary, a few analysts remain concerned about the continued weakness in the semi capex spending trends. They expect weak fourth quarter revenue due to likely push outs and timing-related issues due to uncertainties in both foundry and memory capex spending. They also expect the LCD and touch panel equipment market to remain extremely weak in the upcoming quarter.However, the analysts remain encouraged by solid execution from the new management and believe that the introduction of new products in 2013 will likely increase revenue in the near future. They believe that though new product development will increase research and development (R&D) costs, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses will likely decrease, benefiting gross margins in the coming future.Additionally, the analysts believe that foundry spending will remain robust in 2013 and Applied will likely benefit from it.In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged for the fourth quarter at 3 cents but was down by a penny to 72 cents for fiscal 2012.Over the 90-day period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate witnessed a decline of 9 cents for the fourth quarter and 8 cents per share for fiscal 2012.The recent weakness in semi cap orders and shipments could be the reason for the decrease in estimates.We expect the company to report weak fourth quarter revenue due to slower overall semiconductor equipment spending levels. Though we believe there is potential in the solar energy market over the long term, we remain cautious about the company's efforts since management has already missed several targets to bring its solar division to profitability.Applied, which competes with other large equipment makers, such as  (  ) and  ,holds a Zacks #4 Rank that translates into a short-term 'Sell' rating.Nevertheless, we remain positive on Applied's strong position in the semiconductor market, the solar business in China, a vast portfolio and strategic relationships.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ven though the markets sold off fairly hard last week, buyers appeared to remain on strike as we had a quiet start to the new trading week.

Jefferies Group (  ) was also up, but they are actually the company being acquired in a financial services deal. The tough thing for longer-term shareholders of JEF is the shares are being bought well off the company's all-time highs of about $34. The acquisition price of $16 and change is less than half of JEF's high.Finally, cautious Wall Street commentary had shares of Garmin (  ) and Johnson & Johnson (  ) trading in the red. On the flip side, shares of KLA Tencor (  ) and Citigroup (  ) gained on positive analyst mentions.I was sitting at the gas station the other day waiting for a fill-up when I couldn't help but notice a person working endlessly on giving his car's rims (at the car wash that was attached) that new-car shine. I'm certainly all for things to look immaculate, but in the back of my mind I wondered if this individual was as meticulous with his own finances as well. I guess it's the financial services person in not admiring the effort so much in making the tire rims look new again, and instead wondering what this person's finances were like.I am of the belief that one who works tirelessly in one aspect of his life has the DNA to do so in many other aspects of their lives. Now we all know there is a difference between working hard and working smart, but if you at least have shown the desire to roll up your sleeves, you will sooner or later find better ways to make your job/life easier.Looking at it from another angle, we all know people who simply can't seem to prioritize their lives correctly. Maybe the person cleaning those rims just cares about how his car looks to others and puts endless amounts of time and monies into that particular pride and joy. Now if it was a antique/classic car, that's one thing, but that wasn't the case in the vehicle I witnessed getting the royal treatment.At some point, most people \"get it\" when it comes to all things money.

While at work, she mentioned she'd forgotten her lunch money at home. She asked if she could go to the ATM machine to withdraw money (she just recently opened her first bank account and has never used an ATM before).I know the inevitable day will come where she'll need to use an ATM for an unexpected emergency, or simply when she is not carrying enough money to cover an underestimated expense. Still, I'd like her to avoid that process for as long as possible, so my solution was to ask her manager for a same-day loan, which she would pay back when my wife picked her up from work later in the day. She followed my advice and the trip to the ATM was avoided.You see, I want my daughter to think about her day a bit more carefully. She should not be simply running out of the house without considering what she might need that day, money-wise. This process is part of establishing a daily budget for herself, even when she goes back to school next week. Also, the ease at which you can use credit cards or ATM machines tends to lead to one taking out a bit more money than would otherwise be the case.With college soon approaching, I want my daughter to be cognizant of common money mistakes. Focusing her spending power on monthly necessities and avoiding splurging on extras is a good habit to get into. A bit of sacrifice early on will get you into a good mindset to eventually looking to pay yourself as part of your monthly expenses. Now that I have my personal finance hat on, let me add some other points to consider affecting most families today.For most people, the biggest aim should be to get any high-interest payments off your plate before doing anything else. So, if you're sitting with credit card debt, for example, I'd attack that area first. Once you have that dragon slayed, I'd consider building an emergency fund for 6-12 months of expenses in case of any job losses, etc. Keep that money in a high-yielding money market account (not that any accounts offer actual attractive yields these days) so you can access it very quickly. Your next priority should be saving for retirement and/or college - these two options are equally important.Again, the most important thing is to get your high-interest debt off the table first and foremost. That process will help get put money on offense, not on defense. From that point on, you can begin to gain some serious ground when it comes to accumulating assets that produce income.At Dividend.com, we maintain our focus on the best income-producing investments the markets have to offer during time of heightened volatility.

We see some downward movement in analyst estimates in the build-up to the release.Applied's second quarter 2012 pro forma earnings were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate due to higher revenue and lower-than-expected operating expenses.Revenue for the quarter was up sequentially, driven by strength in the silicon business. The Display business also rebounded, with revenues coming in much higher than management's expectations. However, revenue growth was weak in the Energy and Environmental Systems (EES) segment due to excess capacity at customers.Orders in the quarter were up 37.7% sequentially as orders improved across all segments. Gross margins also improved sequentially to 42.1%, mainly on account of the richer mix of SSG.Detailed earnings results can be viewed in the blog titled Applied now projects third quarter revenue to be down 0-10% sequentially, with Silicon Systems Group (SSG) decreasing 5-10% sequentially and Applied Global Services (AGS) increasing 0-10%. Display and EES segment revenues are expected to be in the range of flat to +/-20%. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to come in at 21-29 cents a share.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is currently 22 cents, at the lower end of the company's guided range and down 4 cents since the second quarter earnings announcement. The downward revision was due to the company's announcement at Semicon West that third-quarter revenue would decline by at least 10%.Out of the 15 analysts providing estimates for the third quarter, none made any revision in the last 30 days. For fiscal 2012, 4 out of 18 analysts made downward revisions over the same 30-day time period.The majority of analysts now expect revenue to decline 10% sequentially, with the SSG segment revenues declining 15%. However, the SSG segment is expected to rebound once there is an improvement in the broader demand environment.They also expect non-semi (solar, display) segments to remain weak due to overcapacity in the market and subsidy cutbacks. As a result, they believe that the current bookings momentum is unsustainable in the second half of 2012.In the past 30 days, there was no change in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter, but the estimate for fiscal 2012 was down 4 cents.Over the 90-day period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate decreased 4 cents to 22 cents for the third quarter and by 14 cents to 80 cents for fiscal 2012.We do not expect strong third quarter results, consistent with management's commentary at Semicon West that sales will decline sequentially by 10% or more. Though we believe that there is potential in the solar energy market over the long term, we remain cautious about the company's efforts since management has already missed several targets to bring its solar division to profitability.Nevertheless, we remain positive on Applied's strong position in the semiconductor market, the solar business in China, a vast portfolio and strategic relationships.Competition from large equipment makers, such as  (  ) and  . (  ) are as strong as ever. We believe that Applied's shares are unlikely to see much appreciation this year and retain a Zacks #5 Rank on the shares, which translates to a short-term Strong Sell rating.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2012 results on July 26. We see upward movements in analyst estimates leading up to the release.KLA-Tencor's third-quarter earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17 cents. The quarter's results were driven by higher revenue and solid opex management, partially offset by a decline in orders.Revenue of $840.5 million was up 30.8% sequentially, 0.8% year over year, and better than the guided range of $770-$830 million. The improvement was backed by improvement in overall demand.Gross margin was 58.3%, down 6 bps sequentially, as revenue growth was more than offset by unfavorable product mix and product transition-related inventory reserves. However, operating margins were up 845 bps sequentially to 34.7% due to lower-than-expected operating expenses.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, KLA expects orders to be down 7.0% to up 14.0%, revenue of between $840 million and $900 million, opex to be slightly up sequentially, other income/expense to be a net expense of $10 million, a tax rate of 26% and a share count of 171 million, resulting in a non-GAAP EPS of $1.20-$1.38.Detailed earnings results can be viewed in the blog titled Out of the 14 analysts providing estimates for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2012, 2 made upward revisions to their estimates for both periods.The analysts expect a decent fourth quarter, with revenue and earnings at the top end of management's guidance. The analysts believe that with continued yield challenges at the foundries and incremental process steps, KLA will continue to benefit from this trend.They believe that the eventual shift to 3D device structures in the memory space will also benefit KLA-Tencor over the next few years. The analysts believe that the challenges involved in these new device structures will spur additional process control sales.In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate was up by a penny to $1.31 for the fourth quarter and by 2 cents to $4.47 for fiscal 2012.Over the 90-day period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate witnessed an increase of 7 cents for the fourth quarter and a significant jump of 26 cents for fiscal 2012. Therefore, positive sentiments appear to have outweighed the negative, post third quarter earnings.KLA-Tencor is a supplier of process control and yield management systems for the semiconductor and related microelectronics industries.In the near term, we believe that KLAC will benefit from the process technology changes occurring in the industry, since many of the ongoing changes, such as FinFET transistors, 3D vertical devices, advanced wafer level packaging, and EUV are increasing the need for process control.Recently, KLAC held its Analyst Day, wherein it announced the increase of its quarterly dividend to 40 cents (up from 35 cents). We believe that dividend hikes are a good way of encouraging investor confidence as it returns shareholder value.However, we cannot ignore the excess capacity that already remains at foundries that could make any improvement in the market short-lived. Hence, we believe that significant growth in KLA's business is not likely until semiconductor demand gains momentum, driving foundries to capacity expansion.Although KLA-Tencor is a leader in process control, it faces competition from other large equipment suppliers, such as  (  ) and Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation.KLA-Tencor shares carry a Zacks #3 Rank, implying a Hold rating in the near term (1-3 months).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) first quarter earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents, as increased caution at customers impacted all areas of its business.KLA reported revenue of $720.7 million, which was down 19.2% sequentially and 9.5% from the year-ago quarter. This was below the mid-point of the guidance range and was short of the consensus estimate of $740.0 million.KLA was impacted by the same macro concerns that have hurt the entire technology sector. However, being an equipment supplier in a weak demand environment is probably the worst spot to be in. Customers are making the most of existing inventory, and maintaining low utilization rates.Additionally, since each system is high-valued, there is a natural customer concentration, which results in great fluctuations in revenue/orders in times of weak demand. All these factors were evident from KLA's first quarter results.Products generated 80% of total revenue, a 23.0% sequential and 11.7% year-over-year decline. Services revenue comprised the remaining 20%, more or less consistent with both the previous and year-ago quarters.Both defect inspection and metrology products declined double-digits from the previous and year-ago quarters. Specifically, defect inspection declined 30.3% sequentially and 10.5% year over year. Metrology revenue dropped 22.3% sequentially and 26.4% from the year-ago quarter.The U.S., Japan and Other Asia regions grew revenue 14.4%, 13.8% and 10.8% on a sequential basis, while Korea and Europe & Israel declined 74.1% and 18.4%, respectively. All except Taiwan and Other Asia declined double-digits from the year-ago quarter.The caution at customers also led to a 38.8% sequential decline in orders to $506 million. Despite the weaker sales, the decline in orders also resulted pulled down the backlog.The decline in orders was broad-based across customers, although foundries were the worst impacted (as may be expected), dropping 56.9% from the June 2012 quarter. Memory was down 44.6%, while logic declined 22.2%. However foundry and logic revenue increased 10.1% and 58.5% from last year, compared to an 11.4% decline in memory revenue.KLA's fortunes are tied to the foundry segment, first because the company is more exposed to this market and second, because its process control equipment is in higher demand at foundries that are always looking to improve efficiencies in order to drive down costs.Memory customers reined in purchases because of uncertain PC demand, both with respect to the onslaught of tablets on the core computing market and the adoption of new ultra-thin and ultra-light computing systems.Despite the significant decline in the last quarter, foundries remain KLA's most important customers, accounting for 54% of its quarterly revenue. Logic brought in another 30% with the balance coming from memory.KLA's strength in the logic segment is tied to its relationship with Intel (INTC), which is en route to ramping its 14nm production.The wafer inspection product line saw orders drop 35.0% on a sequential basis, while growing 89.6% year over year. Reticle Inspection was down 93.2% sequentially and 94.2% from a year ago. Metrology was down 58.3% sequentially and up 11.6% from last year. Solar, storage, HB LED and other products were down 18.4% sequentially and 53.7% from last year.The decline in orders was on account of a Taiwanese customer, with orders increasing across all other geographies. Overall, the order contribution by geography was as follows: The U.S. 43%, Europe 13%, Japan 13%, Korea 20%, Taiwan 7% and Other Asia/Pacific 4%. The relatively higher concentration in Asia is due to the presence of a larger number of foundries and memory manufacturers in the region.The six-month backlog at quarter-end was $1.03 billion, down 16.9% sequentially and 6.7% from the year-ago quarter.KLA's gross margin shrunk 337 bps sequentially and 143 bps year over year to 56.6%, due to lower volume. The incremental gross margin stayed above the targeted 60-70%.Operating expenses of $211.5 million were up 0.6% from the previous quarter's $210.1 million. The operating margin was 27.3%, down 917 bps sequentially and 593 bps year over year. All expenses were significantly higher as a percentage of sales from both the previous and year-ago quarters because of weak revenue in the quarter.Excluding the impact of acquisition-related expenses and restructuring charges on a tax-adjusted basis, the pro forma net income came in at $142.4 million, 19.8% of sales, compared to $254.8 million, or 28.6% in the previous quarter and $198.1 million, or 24.9% of sales in the year-ago quarter.Including special items, the GAAP net income was $135.4 million ($0.80 per share) compared to income of $247.9 million ($1.46 per share) in the June 2012 quarter and $191.9 million ($1.13 per share) in September of last year.Inventories grew 6% during the quarter, with inventory turns down to 1.8X. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) went from 72 to around 68. KLA ended with cash and short term investments of $2.64 billion, up $103.6 million during the quarter. The company generated $245.4 million of cash from operations, spending $20.3 million on capital expenses, $68.3 million on share repurchases and $66.6 million on dividends during the quarter.For the second quarter of fiscal 2013, KLA expects orders to be $550 to $750 million, revenue of between $600 million and $660 million and non-GAAP EPS of between $0.45 and $0.65, well below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.93.The technical complexity of manufacturing semiconductors and increasingly challenging yield issues are long-term revenue drivers for the leading manufacturer of process control equipment.However, KLA's first quarter results and second quarter guidance indicate slowing end markets and caution at customers that could continue for a couple of quarters at least.The non-semi business also weakened in the last quarter and solar market issues are also impacting the company. Of course, the segment still generates a very small percentage of its orders, so the impact is relatively small.Estimates for 2013 have moved down over the last 30 days, although they are trending up for 2014. Therefore, there could be some weakness in the next few quarters, with demand picking up thereafter.KLA shares currently carry a Zacks Rank of #3, implying a short-term Hold recommendation. Market conditions are clearly telling on other equipment makers as well, as seen from the Zacks Ranks of #3 and #4 (Sell), respectively on equipment makers  (  ) and  (  ).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["LA-Tencor is trying to make a higher low, and one investor is using an unusual strategy to get long.optionMONSTER's Heat Seeker tracking program detected the purchase of 1,900 August 50 calls for $0.44 and the sale of an equal number of July 44 puts for $0.34. Volume was more than 5 times open interest at each strike.The trade cost $0.10 and is similar to owning shares in the maker of semiconductor equipment but has an unusual risk/reward profile because of the different expiration months at play. It has downside risk for the next 1-1/2 weeks and upside potential in the next 5-1/2 weeks.KLAC is up 0.44 percent to $45.69 in afternoon trading. It's is down 14 percent in the last three months but is trying to make a higher low than the $44 area where it bounced at the beginning of June.Today's option trade is carefully tailored around the next quarterly report, which will probably occur during the last week of the month. The July  will have expired by then, eliminating downside risk, but the investor will still have upside exposure thanks to the August  . (See our  section)Earnings and revenue beat expectations the last time results came out in April. Management also issued strong guidance, citing demand from smart-phone makers.Overall option volume in KLAC is twice the daily average so far today, according to the Heat Seeker.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ), an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of process diagnostics and control (PDC) equipment, recently launched its first 450mm process control equipment. The Surfscan SP3 System as it is called is a tool for inspecting the wafer surface with the ability to detect surface quality after deposition and/or etching and create maps of the surface that could facilitate correction.The drive toward 450mm wafers is increasing, with  (  ) putting $4 billion into  (  ) for the research and development of 450mm technology. The transition of larger wafer sizes is a big positive for the chip industry, since it enables significant cost reduction, thereby facilitating the move toward the mobile and emerging markets.Surfscan SP3 450 is the upgraded version of Surfscan SP2/SP2XP. The latest version has thrice the data processing capacity and better sensitivity, as well as higher resolution.All these qualities make it ideal for manufacturers to deliver superior quality wafers to meet the chip manufacturer's strict guidelines. The inspection equipment can be used at the chip level, or substrate level.To survive the cutthroat competition in the semiconductor industry, companies are scrambling to come out with sleeker and smarter devices at lower cost. Chipmakers are therefore under great pressure to provide increasingly complex devices at lower costs. This is playing into KLA's sweet spot, because its equipment is used to increase the efficiency of the manufacturing process.In the third quarter of 2012 and in fiscal 2011, KLAC earned 56.0% and 64.0% of revenue respectively from the defect inspection segment alone. As may be expected, the segment is more insulated from ups and downs in the market, because of the increased efficiency.As per U.S. research firm Gartner, the semiconductor industry is expected to generate $312.0 billion in 2012. IHS iSuppli is even more optimistic, estimating total revenue of $324.6 billion this year.KLA reported revenue of $840.5 million in the third quarter of 2012, which was up 30.8% sequentially, 0.8% year over year, better than the guided range of $770-830 million and well ahead of the consensus estimate of $802.0 million.Currently, KLA-TENCOR Corporation has a Zacks Rank of #3, implying a short-term Hold recommendation.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) fourth quarter earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 18 cents, but investors remained unexcited, as orders remained sluggish.KLA reported revenue of $892.5 million, which was up 6.2% sequentially but consistent with the year-ago quarter. Revenue did, however, exceed the mid-point of guidance and was also ahead of the consensus estimate of $874.4 million.The technical complexity of manufacturing semiconductors and increasingly challenging yield issues remain revenue drivers for the leading manufacturer of process control equipment. Additionally, despite  (  ) efforts to speed up EUV technology development, adoption is likely to remain slow.Therefore, the increase in yield issues and demand for better yields will remain positive influences on KLA in the near-to-medium term.Products generated 84% of total revenue, an increase of 6.3% sequentially and 0.3% year over year. Services revenue comprised the remaining 16%, up 5.4% sequentially and down 1.3% year over year. Services are likely to grow in importance, as the company strives to maintain its large installed base.As usual, KLA did not provide category-wise and region-wise revenue breakup on the call and the performance by category and geography will only be available when the company files its Form 10Q.KLA's orders were flat sequentially and down 3.0% year over year to $827 million in the last quarter. We note that the quarter benefited from the pull-in of one big order from the March quarter, without which there would have been a substantial order decline on a sequential basis.While order trends indicate conservatism at customers, management assured that significant yield issues remained at 28nm and below. Therefore, it appears that the current pause is driven by end-market concerns as consumers tighten their purse strings.Foundry was the only segment to have grown from both the previous and year-ago quarters. Since KLA generates a major chunk of its revenue (65% in the last quarter) from the segment, this strength was sufficient to offset the weakness in memory and logic.KLA's fortunes are tied to the foundry segment, first because the company is more exposed to this market and second, because its process control equipment is in higher demand at foundries that are always looking to improve efficiencies in order to drive down costs. However, KLA cited weaker expectations by \"industry observers\" that now expect a 10-15% capex growth in 2012. The weaker outlook is the result of increased caution at foundry and memory makers.The memory segment (15% of total orders) was down 6.9% and 50.3%, respectively from the previous and year-ago quarters. Overall demand drivers weakened with weaker expectations for the mobile segment, which impacted production in the quarter.Logic brought in the remaining 20% of orders, down 31.5% sequentially and 26.3% from the year-ago quarter. We note that logic demand in the March quarter was attributable to 28nm builds, as well as R&D for production at even lower geometries. With  (  ) as a major customer, the decline was not totally unexpected, since Intel's investment is tapering off.There is considerable lumpiness in KLA's semiconductor business, since individual units are of high value and there are a few large customers accounting for the bulk of revenue/orders.The wafer inspection product line saw orders drop 11.8% on a sequential basis, while growing 10.8% year over year. Reticle Inspection was up 48.9% sequentially and down 48.7% from a year ago. Metrology was up 15.0% sequentially and 18.5% from last year. Solar, storage, HB LED and other products were down 25.5% sequentially and 51.5% from last year.Taiwan and the U.S. saw order increases, while other geographies declined. Overall, the order contribution by geography was as follows-The U.S. 26%, Europe 3%, Taiwan 55%, Korea 8%, Japan 6% and Other Asia/Pacific 2%. The relatively higher concentration in Asia is due to the presence of a larger number of foundries and memory manufacturers in the region.The six-month backlog at quarter-end was $1.23 billion, down 7.9% sequentially and 11.9% from the year-ago quarter.KLA's gross margin jumped 169 bps sequentially, to 60.0%, due to higher volume and favorable product mix. It also shrunk 74 bps from the year-ago quarter. The incremental gross margin was well over the targeted 60-70%.Operating expenses of $210.1 million were up 5.7% from the previous quarter's $198.7 million. The operating margin was 36.4%, up 179 bps sequentially and down 364 bps year over year. ER&D as a percentage of sales was up slightly on a sequential basis and more significantly from the year-ago quarter. SG&A was flattish compared with both quarters.Excluding the impact of acquisition-related expenses on a tax-adjusted basis, the pro forma net income came in at $254.8 million, or 28.6% of sales, compared to $215.8 million, or 25.7% in the previous quarter and $254.4 million, or 8.5% of sales in the year-ago quarter.Including the special item, the GAAP net income was $247.9 million ($1.46 per share) compared to income of $205.3 million ($1.21 per share) in the March 2012 quarter and $245.0 million ($1.43 per share) in the June quarter of last year.Inventories were flat sequentially, with inventory turns also flat at 2.2X. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) went from 69 to around 72. KLA ended with cash and short term investments of $2.53 billion, up $164.7 million during the quarter. The company generated $273.3 million of cash from operations, spending $16.3 million on capital expenses, $66.9 million on share repurchases and $58.5 million on dividends during the quarter.For the first quarter of fiscal 2013, KLA expects orders to be down 24.4% to 6.3%, revenue of between $700 million and $760 million, gross margin of 56.5-57.5%, opex to be slightly up sequentially, other income/expense to be a net expense of $11 million, a tax rate of 24% and a share count of 170 million, resulting in a non-GAAP EPS of between $0.75-$0.95, well below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.15.KLA's fourth quarter results and first quarter guidance indicates slowing end markets and caution at customers. While the company's technology increases the efficiency of semiconductor manufacturing, leading to relatively stronger demand than other equipment makers, there will be the inevitable slowdown in capital equipment purchases.The market environment has turned adverse for KLA because of the sudden weakness in demand for mobile devices that usually drives demand for higher volumes at foundries and memory manufacturers.The non-semi business also weakned in the last quarter and it appears that the issues in the solar market have started impacting the company. Of course, the segment still generates a very small percentage of its orders, so the impact is relatively small.There have been no changes in estimates over the last few months and expectations for fiscal 2013 remain higher than those for fiscal 2012, indicating improving trends.KLA shares currently carry a Zacks Rank of #3, implying a short-term Hold recommendation.

We witness only one downward movement in analyst estimates in the build-up to the release.Applied'sfirst quarter 2012 pro forma earnings were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate due to higher revenue and lower-than-expected opex.Revenue growth was weak in the Applied Global Services (AGS) segment, while all other business segments did better than expected. The softening at 200mm was the main reason for the decline in theAGS segment, and Applied expects this to continue through the first half of 2012.Orders in the quarter were up 25.9% sequentially due to order improvement in the SSG and Display segments. The higher demand for TVs and mobile devices in SSG and Display were the main reasons for the increase. Gross margins also improved sequentially to 40.7% mainly on account of the richer mix of SSG.Applied now projects second quarter revenue to be up 5-15% sequentially, with SSG (including Varian) increasing 15-25% sequentially,AGSto be up 5-10%, Display being flat to down 25% and EES to be down more than 40%. The non-GAAP EPS is expected to come in at 20-28 cents a share. For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 24 cents, below the guided range.(Detailed earnings results can be viewed in this blog: Out of the 17 analysts providing estimates for the second quarter, none made any revisions in the last 30 days. For fiscal 2012, only 1 analyst made a downward revision over the same 30-day time period.A few analysts expect a decent second quarter with revenue and earnings in line with guidance of $2.4 billion and $0.24, respectively. They believe that pressure in both Display and Solar will be partially offset by growth in Silicon and a modest improvement in Service, helping results to match the guidance.Also, a few analysts expect revenue to come in modestly above the mid-point of guidance, consistent with its peers including  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).Additionally, the analysts believe Applied is benefiting from continued strength in the foundry market, as many of the key players have maintained or increased their levels of spending. In particular,  (  ) has increased its capex guidance by more than 30% for 2012 at its 1Q12 .With TSMC likely employing multiple patterning at its 28nm ramp, the analysts believe Applied's CMP tools will be in high demand, given the additional steps and layers required in the chip manufacturing process. According to Gartner, Applied is the market leader in CMP equipment, with approximately 67% of the total market in 2011.In the past 30 days, there was no change to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter and fiscal 2012.Over the 90-day period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate increased 7 cents to 24 cents for the second quarter and 13 cents to 94 cents for fiscal 2012.The recent strength in semi-cap orders and shipments could be the reason for the increase in estimates.We expect a decent second quarter due to higher overall semiconductor equipment spending levels. Though we believe there is potential in the solar energy market over the long term, we remain cautious about the company's efforts since management has already missed several targets to bring its solar division to profitability.Nevertheless, we remain positive on Applied's strong position in the semiconductor market, the solar business in China, a vast portfolio and strategic relationships. The semiconductor business appears to be improving, both on account of strengthening end markets and the Varian acquisition.Applied, which competes with other large equipment makers, such as KLA-Tencor, Lam Research and Novellus Systems, holds a Zacks #3 Rank that translates into a short-term Hold rating.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["arket jitters surrounding Greece and the potential for further money coming out of the country's banks cast a cloud over the late-day session, pushing the indices to close in the red.The early money flow didn't go into any of the earnings plays today, with stocks like Abercrombie & Fitch (  ), Staples (  ), and Deere & Co.

Be sure to  if you haven't already.I was reading a CNN Money article recently titled \"Seniors Clamoring to Get into Facebook IPO.\" With a headline like that, I simply had to read it.Well, the article went exactly as I expected it to go. Retired individuals are looking to roll the dice on the biggest new tech IPO in several years. People interviewed in the piece were retired doctors, engineers, etc., and all seemed to be in good shape financially. Is it wrong to take a shot at buying Facebook shares on the IPO debut? It's difficult to say.On one hand, Facebook could eventually go the way of MySpace and die a slow painful death. Or, the company could emulate Google, aggressively buying new technologies and innovating in its core businesses to solidify its spot atop the social media landscape. Being the dividend lovers we are, we aren't paying much attention to Facebook since it won't pay a dividend. However, we realize the new IPO is a \"big deal\" for a lot of investors.Just yesterday, General Motors (  ) announced it would stop its marketing initiatives on Facebook, failing to see results to justify the ad spend. Relying simply on advertising (as Facebook does) is a dangerous spot to be in any economic environment. My gut tells me Facebook will attack several revenue opportunities that its large audience provides, but until they do so successfully, the only monetization strategy is indeed in-page advertising for now.If you have aspirations to buy Facebook shares on Friday, we wish you luck and hope it works out for you. Like I said, it may work for a bit, but then again, it may not. As a trader in my earlier life, when the edge wasn't there, I'd tend to look elsewhere. Fast forward to less stressful days of long-term dividend investing, and we'll stick to looking at consistent and dependable dividend-paying businesses that will support our more reliable wealth-building strategy.How many times have we seen a baseball player who's traditionally a singles and doubles hitter try and change his approach to hit more homers? These players often suffer both statistically (lower batting average) and financially (when it comes time to sign a new contract, the underperformance weighs down teams' offers).Investors encounter similar dangers when changing their time-tested strategies. Whether it's trading more frequently or struggling to manage larger share amounts, when people don't stay in their lanes, underperformance usually ensues.Just look at the last real estate bubble, when free-flowing capital allowed many investors to get in way over their heads. Even some of the most disciplined and responsible home builders got caught up in the euphoria of runaway home prices. Eventually, so many homes were built that a glut of inventory formed, pulling down the market further and putting plenty of builders out of business.Today's investors have much more data at their fingertips, so you'd think they'd make less mistakes. With more knowledge comes more success, right? Well, not necessarily.

Additionally, delays in EUV adoption are likely to increase yield issues and the demand for better yields, which will be a positive for KLA.Products generated 83% of total revenue, an increase of 40.1% sequentially and 1.4% year over year. Services revenue comprised the remaining 17%, down 1.7% sequentially and up 2.4% year over year. Services are likely to grow in importance, as the company strives to maintain its large installed base.As usual, KLA did not provide category-wise and region-wise details on the call, so they would not be available until the company files its Form 10Q.KLA's orders were down 12.3% sequentially and 2.3% year over year to $833 million in the last quarter. The decline in the last quarter was related to the push-out of one big order into the June quarter. Foundry, memory and logic were all down sequentially. However, while foundry and memory were also down year over year, logic jumped a whopping 88.8%.KLA's fortunes are tied to the foundry segment, first because the company is more exposed to this market and second, because its process control equipment is in higher demand at foundries that are always looking to improve efficiencies in order to drive down costs.In the last quarter, KLA benefited from strong demand at leading edge foundries, which are seeing supply constraints due to a very strong demand environment. As a result, the segment continued to make up the largest chunk of orders (55%) in the last quarter, down 15.4% sequentially and 7.4% year over year. It appears that the order pushout was in the foundry segment (although management chose not to give details).The memory segment (16% of total orders) was down 12.3% and 42.1%, respectively from the previous and year-ago quarters. Overall demand drivers remain extremely strong with the ongoing push to mobile driving strong demand for NAND production.The DRAM side of the business, although soft at present, is expected to look up in the back half of the year. However, while NAND demand is strong enough to encourage capacity adds right now, the spending on DRAM is likely to be in the nature of technology transitions.Logic brought in the remaining 29% of orders, down 5.8% sequentially and up 88.8% from the year-ago quarter. KLA stated that logic demand in the last quarter was attributable to 28nm builds, as well as R&D for production at even lower geometries. With  (  ) as a major customer, KLA should see continued growth in this segment through the rest of the year.There is considerable lumpiness in KLA's semiconductor business, since individual units are of high value and there are a few large customers accounting for the bulk of revenue. However, management commentary was extremely positive for 2012, where they expect KLA to significantly exceed the expected industry growth rate of 0 to -5%.The wafer inspection product line saw orders drop 1.4% on a sequential basis, while growing 9.9% year over year. Reticle Inspection was down 59.5% sequentially, and 41.4% from a year ago. Metrology was down 24.3% sequentially and 2.3% from last year.Solar, storage, HB LED and other products were up 16.9% sequentially and down 34.9% from last year. Wafer inspection and metrology were up triple digits in the December 2011 quarter, so the sequential declines are illustrative of typical lumpiness in the business that we don't think is anything to be concerned about.Taiwan was the only region to have declined in the last quarter. Overall, the order contribution by geography was as follows: U.S. 22%, Europe 8%, Korea 39%, Taiwan 13%, Japan 11% and Other Asia/Pacific 7%. The relatively higher concentration in Asia is due to the presence of a larger number of foundries and memory manufacturers in the region.The six-month backlog at quarter-end was $1.34 billion, up 4.3% from both the previous and year-ago quarters.KLA's gross margin dropped 6 bps sequentially, remaining at 58.3%, as the higher revenue was more than offset by unfavorable product mix and product transition-related inventory reserves. It also shrunk 306 bps from the year-ago quarter. Incremental gross margins remained just below the targeted 60-70%.Operating expenses of $198.7 million were up 3.8% from the previous quarter's $206.5 million. The operating margin was 34.7%, up 845 bps sequentially and down 395 bps year over year. Both ER&D and SG&A as a percentage of sales were significantly higher than in the December quarter.Excluding the impact of acquisition-related expenses on a tax-adjusted basis, as well as some discrete tax items, the pro forma net income came in at $215.8 million, or 25.7% of sales, compared to $121.9 million, or 19.0% in the previous quarter and $224.8 million, or 26.9% of sales in the year-ago quarter.Including the special items, the GAAP net income was $205.3 million ($1.21 per share) compared to income of $110.8 million ($0.66 per share) in the December 2011 quarter and $209.8 million ($1.22 per share) in the March quarter of last year.Inventories were up 1.7%, with inventory turns going up slightly from 1.7 X to 2.2X. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) went from 77 to around 69. KLA ended with cash and short term investments of $2.37 billion, up $193.1 million during the quarter.The company generated $262.1 million in cash from operations, spending $14.3 million on capital expenses, $66.9 million on share repurchases and $58.5 million on dividends during the quarter.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, KLA expects orders to be down 7.0% to up 14.0%, revenue of between $840 million and $900 million, opex to be slightly up sequentially, other income/expense to be a net expense of $10 million, a tax rate of 26% and a share count of 171 million, resulting in a non-GAAP EPS of between $1.20-1.38.KLA reported a good quarter and provided encouraging guidance. Although orders were soft in the last quarter, this was on account of a pushout, which management said had already materialized after the end of the quarter.The market environment remains extremely positive for KLA because of the strong demand for mobile devices that is driving demand for higher volumes at foundries and memory manufacturers. Moreover, the devices being manufactured today are getting increasingly more complex. Both these factors are driving the need for improved yields, which is KLA's sweet spot.The non-semi business also did well in the last quarter despite the issues in the solar market, which makes this difficult. Of course, the segment still generates less than 10% of its orders, so the impact is relatively small.There have been no changes in estimates over the last few months and expectations for fiscal 2013 remain higher than those for fiscal 2012, indicating improving trends.KLA shares currently carry a Zacks Rank of #2, implying a short-term Buy recommendation.

The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Russell 2000, on the other hand, remained trapped below their 2007 highs.This is a big deal, and investors need to pay attention if they're serious about making money. We now face the prospect of a run back to the old bubble highs, which could entail almost a doubling of the index before it's done.I have to admit that I've been a little slow to catch this trend. But as I take a long-term view of the NDX, there is no denying how bullish the chart is. Consider these points:In contrast, the SPX's 200-day moving average is still falling, and its 100-day average remains below its 200-day.The weekly chart also paints a more bullish picture for the NDX because its 200-week moving average has been rising since early 2010. The SPX's is still dropping, while the DJI's only started rising in recent weeks, which means they're still licking their wounds from the 2008 crash.It's also interesting that the NDX bounced at 2034 during the August 2011 selloff, its old resistance level from April 2010. The SPX and DJI, meanwhile, fell below those corresponding levels on their charts. And one final point is that the NDX made a higher low in October 2011 than it did in August, once again contrasting with the performance of the DJI and SPX.You'll notice in this analysis a complete absence of certain words that have dominated public awareness in recent months. No mention of \"Greece,\" \"recession,\" or \"China hard landing.\" No discussion of \"multiples,\" \"buybacks\" or \"dividends.\" Just highs and lows, relative performance and moving averages.Maybe if I had been paying more attention to the charts and less to all those other distractions, I could have brought you this news five months ago when it would have been even more useful. That's a lesson for all of us.One word that must be mentioned in any NDX discussion is Apple, because the consumer-electronics giant is a major force pulling the index higher. But there are plenty of other good stocks in the index.I will close by listing a few stocks that look interesting. Because I am focusing on charts today, I won't mention their businesses or their fundamentals. Except for Endo, all are in the NDX. Once again, treat these as opening suggestions rather than outright recommendations. Trending higher with a decent pullback in the last week. It's now finding support at its 50-day moving average and the same level where it peaked in November and December. Gapped down last month but holding above its 200-day moving average. It's also now above its 10-day, which could signal a short-term bullish reversal. A rebound back to the recent highs around $53 seems completely doable. Trending higher but had a nice pullback in the last two weeks. Shares are trying to find support at their 50-day moving average but may test down to support around $30.50 before rebounding. Pulling back to its 50-day, its 200-day, and the level that was resistance in December. And it had a bullish call roll on Feb. 14.

Following the news, the shares fell 2.72% to $10.71 after the market closed yesterday.The chip-fab equipment maker expects full-year net sales and adjusted earnings to be below the previous forecast of $9.1-$9.5 billion and 85-95 cents, respectively. Though management did not provide any explicit new guidance range, it did mention that full-year earnings could go down by 15 cents to 20 cents due to slowing demand.Additionally, management now expects worldwide spending on wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) in the range of $30-$33 billion, down from its previous estimate of $32-$35 billion.According to the market research firm, Gartner, WFE spending will total $33 billion in 2012, down 8.9% from 2011. But it will increase in 2013 to more than $35.4 billion, up 7.4% from 2012.Management said that the guidance cut was on account of lower-than-expected demand in its semiconductor equipment business, primarily among foundry customers.For the upcoming third quarter, the company expects earnings on the lower end of the previously announced guidance range of 21 cents to 29 cents per share.Applied Materials is the global leader in providing manufacturing solutions for the semiconductor, display and solar industries, and we remain positive about its strong position in the semiconductor market. In the second quarter, Applied posted decent numbers, with both revenue and earnings surpassing our expectations.The company is expected to update its annual sales and earnings guidance on August 15, when it reports its third quarter results.This marks yet another guidance reduction in the semiconductor industry. Recently, chip maker  (  ) slashed its sales forecast for the second quarter due to weaker-than-expected sales in China and Europe. Advanced Micro's shares fell 11.2% to $4.99 following the guidance revision.Applied, which competes with other large equipment makers, such as  (  ) and  (  ), holds a Zacks #3 Rank that translates into a short-term Hold rating.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["fter reporting an encouraging first quarter last month,  (  ), the leading producer of chip making equipment, has authorized the repurchase of shares up to an additional value of roughly $3.0 billion over the next three years. The company has less than $1.0 billion available under the existing buyback plan which was started in 2010.Additionally, the company also announced its decision to hike quarterly dividend by one cent to 9 cents per share. This translates into a 13% increase from the prior dividend. The increased dividend will be paid on June 14, 2012, to stockholders of record on May 24, 2012. Prior to this announcement, Applied had been paying a quarterly dividend of 8 cents per share.We believe that continuous share buybacks and a hike in dividend will inspire investor loyalty through higher returns from the stock.During the recently concluded first quarter, Applied spent $200 million on share repurchases and $104 million on dividends. The cash and short-term investments balance was $2.0 billion at quarter-end, having declined $4.2 billion during the quarter due to the cash paid for the Varian acquisition during the quarter. The debt cap ratio including long-term liabilities and short-term debt was just 22.1%. We remain encouraged by Applied's strong cash position and its ability to service its long-term debts.Applied reported decent first quarter results, with both revenue and earnings per share surpassing our expectations. The company provided a strong revenue outlook for the second quarter, which was up 5-15% sequentially. Applied's strong position in the semiconductor market, improving business, both on account of stronger end markets and the Varian acquisition, the solar business in China, its huge portfolio and strategic relationships are all positives.The regular share buybacks and dividend hikes are a good way of encouraging investor confidence as it returns shareholder value. The company expects to post better results in the second quarter than estimated by the analysts. The increase in dividend indicates that the company is heading toward strong future growth.Applied, which competes with other large equipment makers, such as  (  ),  (  ) and  ,holds a Zacks #3 Rank that translates into a short-term 'Hold' rating. ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) is scheduled to announce its fiscal first-quarter 2012 results on February 16, 2012. We witness only one upward movement in analyst estimates in the build-up to the release.AMAT's fourth quarter 2011 pro forma earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate as lower revenue and margins were partially offset by strong opex management and a lower-than-expected tax rate.Revenue growth was weak across the Display and EES (solar) segments, with the Silicon Systems Group (  ) performing in line with expectations. However, AMAT's penetration in Asiadeepened significantly, helping the Applied Global Services (AGS) segment exceed expectations.Orders in the quarter were down 33.0% sequentially due to order declines in display (-91% sequentially) and EES (-3% sequentially). The lower demand for TVs and mobile devices in the Display segment and excess capacity in the EES segment were the main reasons for the decline. Gross margins also declined sequentially to 39.6% aslower volumes impacted cost absorption.AMAT now projects first quarter revenue to decrease 5-15% sequentially, with SSG (including Varian) increasing 5-20% sequentially,AGS declining 10-20% (the combined effect of lower 200mm sales, lower utilization rates and the absence of thin film revenue), and Display and EES also falling 40-60%.The non-GAAP EPS is expected to come in at 8-16 cents a share. For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 12 cents.(Detailed earnings results can be viewed in the blog titled:  ).Out of the 17 analysts providing estimates for the first quarter, none made any revisions in the last 30 days. For fiscal 2012, only 1 analyst made an upward revision over the same 30-day time period.A few analysts expect a decent first quarter with earnings and revenue at the high end of the guidance but remain concerned about gross margins due to the increased exposure to Samsung.The analysts believe that Display and EES sales will fall, but be in line with guidance, due to the ongoing solar and LCD panel inventory glut. They believe that pressure in both Display and EES will partially be offset by growth in Silicon, helping revenue to come in modestly above the mid-point of guidance, consistent with its peers including  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).Additionally, though analysts see upside potential for Silicon orders, they do not anticipate an order recovery in Display or EES segments in the to-be-reported quarter, indicating continued sluggishness in these markets for some time.However, a handful of analysts believe that the display business will improve in the upcoming quarter, banking on investments in LCD/OLED that they expect will enable recovery.In the past 30 days, there was no change to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter but it increased a penny to 80 cents for fiscal 2012.Over the 90-day period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate fell 6 cents to 12 cents for the first quarter and 22 cents for fiscal 2012.The significant decline of 22 cents in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2012 clearly indicates the uncertainties in the semiconductor business and echoes the general pessimism for both display and solar in 2012.We do not expect a strong first quarter due to limited visibility and lower overall semiconductor equipment spending levels. Though we believe that there is potential in the solar energy market over the long term, we remain cautious about the company's efforts since management has already missed several targets to bring its solar division to profitability.We remain positive about Applied's strong position in the semiconductor market, the solar business in China, a vast portfolio and strategic relationships, which will however be less effective in the current market scenario.Applied, which competes with other large equipment makers, such as KLA-Tencor, Lam Research and Novellus Systems,holds a Zacks #3 Rank that translates into a short-term Hold rating. ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) first quarter pro forma earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6 cents or 50%. Revenues were partly responsible, beating consensus expectations by 11.1%.Applied reported revenue of $2.19 billion, which was flat sequentially and down 18.5% year over year. Varian's full-quarter contribution came in at $202 million. All except the AGS business did better than expected. remains Applied's largest segment, with a 61% revenue share. Segment revenue was up 26.0% sequentially and down 10.2% year over year. Management had expected segment revenue to be up 5-20% sequentially, so revenue was well above expectations.Applied saw very strong growth in the foundry segment, where revenue increased 75%. foundry manufacturers are ramping production strongly because of the strong demand for mobile devices. Applied currently expects mobile phones and tablets to grow 35% and 60%, respectively in 2012. We think that the investment is likely to be front-end loaded. NAND manufacturers are benefiting from the growth in mobile phones and tablets, but they are also investing with a view to help the production transition to smaller geometries. DRAM on the other hand is not capacity constrained, so is likely to remain soft through 2012.The second largest segment was  , which generated 24% of total revenue. Segment revenue was down 15.1% sequentially and 5.8% year over year, in line with Applied's expectations of a 10-20% sequential decline. The softening in 200mm continued in the last quarter and Applied expects this to continue through the first half.The  segment made a 9% contribution to quarterly revenue, representing a sequential decline of 34.3% (guidance was a 40-60% decline) and a year-over-year decline of 56.5%. The weakness in the last quarter was expected, since there is significant excess capacity. However, Applied's market position remains strong due to customers picked up earlier in the year.Applied is now focused on the crystalline silicon business, which has started to prove beneficial for the company. Applied expects panel demand to increase 4-30% in 2012 and installations to touch 28-35 gigawatts. Increasing competition is driving down module prices, which is driving manufacturers to cost-efficient technologies. These are the secular forces driving demand in all the big solar markets, such as the U.S., Germany, Italy, China and Japan.Performance in the  segment was slightly better than Applied's expectations of a 40-60% sequential decline. The Display business was down 39.2% and 29.3% from the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively. The segment dropped from 8% to just 5% of revenue in the last quarter. The softness in display is on account of the over-capacity in the market that should keep the lid on growth through most of the year. However, customer transition to new technologies, such as metal oxide transistors and low-temperature polysilicon for OLED and high-resolution LCDs is expected to expand the SAM by 30%, which is a positive.Around 73% of Applied's quarterly revenue came from the Asia/Pacific region, with the largest contribution from Korea, which generated 29% and followed by Taiwan and Japan, which generated 22% and 10%, respectively. While China dropped 55.9% sequentially to 8%, Korea and Taiwan grew very strongly at 73.0% and 38.5%, respectively. North America and Europe were down 3.9% and 33.9%, respectively to 19% and 8% of revenue.Total orders were up 25.9% sequentially and down 32.4% year over year. All segments declined on a year-over-year basis. However SSG and Display orders grew 53.3% and 100.0%, respectively. However, the BTB was negative in all except the SSG segment (1.06). Display and EES were particularly weak at 0.38 and 0.16, respectively. As may be expected, backlog declined doube-digits.Japan, South East Asia and China drove the decline in orders, with other regions growing. Korea saw a triple-digit increase, followed by the North America and Taiwan, both of which were up double-dgits.Applied generated a gross margin of 40.7%, up 102 basis points (bps) from the previous quarter's 39.6%, mainly on account of the richer mix of SSG. The gross margin was down 212 bps from the year-ago quarter.Applied's operating expenses of $546 million were up 13.5% from the September quarter, with the operating margin of 15.7% shrinking 188 bps sequentially and 882 bps year over year. All expenses were up as a percentage of sales, compunding the effect of higher cost of sales.On a pro forma basis, Applied Materials had a net income of $240 million, or a 11.0% net income margin compared to $271 million, or 12.4% in the previous quarter and $484 million, or 18.0% in the first quarter of fiscal 2011.The fully diluted pro forma earnings were 18 cents a share compared to earnings of 20 cents in the previous quarter and 36 cents in the comparable prior-year quarter. Our pro forma estimate excludes restructuring, acquisition-related and other charges and tax adjustments in the last quarter. Our pro forma estimate may not match management's presentation due to the addition/exclusion of some items not considered by management.On a fully diluted GAAP basis, the company recorded a net income of $117 million ($0.09 per share) compared to $466 million ($0.35 per share) in the previous quarter and $506 million ($0.38 per share) in the prior-year quarter.Inventories were up 4.2% sequentially, with inventory turns dropping from 3.1X to 2.9X. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) went from 64 to 66. The cash and short term investments balance was $2.0 billion at quarter-end, having declined $4.2 billion during the quarter due to the cash paid for the Varian acquisition during the quarter. Goodwill was 28.5% of total assets in the last quarter due to the acquisition.The company generated $181 million of cash from operations, spent $37 million on capex, $200 million on share repurchases and $104 million on dividends. At quarter-end, Applied had $1.95 billion of debt on its balance sheet, with a net cash position (excluding short and long term debt) of $48 million. The debt cap ratio including long term liabilities and short term debt was just 22.1%.Applied provided guidance for the second quarter. With SSG (including Varian) to be up 15-25% sequentially, AGS to be up 5-10%, Display flat to down 25% and EES to be down more than 40%, total revenue is expected to be up 5-15% sequentially. The non-GAAP EPS is expected to come in at 20-28 cents a share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the next quarter was 17 cents when the company provided guidance, below the guided range.Applied did not update guidance for 2012. Accordingly, we assume that guidance remains the same, with SSG and AGS segments expected to benefit from the Varian acquisition, despite uncertainties in the core business. The LCD and touch panel equipment market is expected to remain extremely weak next year, pulling down Display sales by 10-20%. The EES business is expected to decline at least 50%.The Zacks Rank for Applied Materials shares is #3, signifying a short term Hold recommendation. Given the positive results and outlook, we expect upward revision to estimates that could improve the rank.The weakness in the display and solar markets continues to plague the company. Not only did the two segments perform dismally in the last quarter, but the outlook into 2012 remains weak. However, the semiconductor business appears to be improving, both on account of strengthening end markets and the Varian acquisition. The positive trend in semi orders looks similar to other equipment companies, such as  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).We are also positive about Applied's strong position in the semiconductor market, the solar business in China, the huge portfolio and strategic relationships. ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Chicago, IL - February 16, 2012 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog.

This is why some traders look to such phenomena as divergences between the behavior of semiconductor stocks compared to technology as a whole for potential clues as to whether the larger sector, or even the larger economy, is due for a surprising move.Here our take on semiconductor stocks is in many ways more pedestrian. Many of these stocks have had great runs. And many traders who have benefitted from those runs appear to be at least starting the process of taking profits. And if that profit-taking continues, many of these semiconductor stocks could be available at their lowest, most  levels in weeks if not months.The semiconductor stock that is most interesting in this regard right now is  (  ). Shares of NVLS rallied to new, 52-week highs late last week, and have pulled back over the past two days as traders have locked in gains and taken profits. Down more than 2% and trading midway between recent, short-term highs and recent,  , NVLS has a positive edge of more than three-quarters of a percent and neutral ratings of 6 out of 10.Other semiconductor stocks that have begun to sell off significantly as the week gets underway are  (  ), whch pulled back by more than 2% to finish at its lowest level in a week. KLAC has a positive edge of half a percent in the short-term, and has earned a two-point ratings upgrade based on Monday's selling alone. Additional weakness in the stock could help KLAC earn another two-point upgrade which would put Kla-Tencor in our \"consider buying\" category in the near-term.Sellers have already appeared to take control of  (  ).

We see upward movement in analyst estimates in the build-up to the release.KLA-Tencor's second-quarter earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6 cents. The quarter's results were driven by better-than-expected gross margins and a lower tax rate, partially offset by revenue decline.Revenue was down 19.3% sequentially but up 16.2% year over year. The sequential decline was due to overall market softness.Gross margin was 58.3%, up 31 basis points (bps) sequentially, as the lower revenue was almost totally offset by lower inventory-related charges. The operating margins were down 700 bps sequentially to 26.2% due to higher-than-expected operating expenses.For the third quarter of fiscal 2012, KLA expects orders to be down 13.2% to up 2.6%, revenue of between $770 million and $830 million, opex to be flat sequentially, other income/expense to be a net expense of $10 million, a tax rate of 26% and a share count of 169 million, resulting in a non-GAAP EPS of between $1.00-1.18.For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.09.(Detailed earnings results can be viewed in the blog titled: Out of the 15 analysts providing estimates for the third quarter, none revised the estimate in the last 30 days. Over the same period, 1 analyst made an upward revision for fiscal 2012.The analysts expect a decent third quarter, with revenue and earnings coming in line with management's guidance. They believe that KLA-Tencor will benefit from the pickup in foundry capex spending in the near term, as  (  ) and Global Foundries increase their proposed spending on process control tools.Additionally, the eventual shift to 3D device structures in the memory space will also benefit KLA-Tencor over the next few years. The analysts believe that the challenges involved in these new device structures will spur additional process control sales.Analysts also believe that spending on 28nm technology, particularly for yield improvement, is benefiting KLA-Tenor more than its peers. They expect orders to come in at the high end of the guidance range (down 13.2-2.6% sequentially) due to strength at foundries (where the company has 70%+ market share).In the past 30 days, there was no change in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter, but it was up by a penny to $4.21 for fiscal 2012.Over the 90-day period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate witnessed an increase of 29 cents for the third quarter and a significant jump of 66 cents for fiscal 2012. Therefore, positive sentiments appear to have outweighed the negative, post-second-quarter earnings.KLA-Tencor is a supplier of process control and yield management systems for the semiconductor and related microelectronics industries.In the near term, we believe thatKLAC will benefit from pickup in foundry capex spending and the process technology changes occurring in the industry.However, we cannot ignore the excess capacity that already remains at foundries, which increases the risk that any improvement in the market could be short-lived. Hence, we believe that significant growth in KLA's business is not likely until semiconductor demand gains momentum, driving foundries to capacity expansion.Although KLA-Tencor is a leader in process control, it faces competition from other large equipment suppliers, such as  (  ),  (  ) and Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation.KLA-Tencor shares carry a Zacks #2 Rank, implying a Buy rating in the near term (1-3 months). ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ne investor apparently thinks that KLA Tencor is on solid ground.optionMONSTER's monitoring systems detected the sale of about 3,000 January 47 puts for $2.65 and $2.70 against open interest of 2,218 contracts.KLAC is up 1 percent to $46.42 in morning trading.

The technical complexity of manufacturing semiconductors and increasingly challenging yield issues remain revenue drivers for the leading manufacturer of process control equipment.Additionally, delays in EUV adoption are likely to increase yield issues and the demand for better yields, which will be a positive for KLA.Products generated 78% of total revenue, a decline of 23.0% sequentially and 20.3% year over year. Services revenue comprised the remaining 22%, down 3.0% sequentially and up 2.4% year over year. Services are likely to grow in importance, as the company strives to maintain its large installed base.As usual, KLA did not provide product-wise and geography-wise details on the call, so they would not be available until the company files its Form 10Q.KLA's orders were up 95.5% sequentially and 31.0% year over year to $950 million in the last quarter. Logic customers generated the strongest growth in the last quarter, followed by foundry and then memory. March quarter orders are expected to be softer however, as the spurt in logic and foundry spending may be expected to moderate.KLA's fortunes are tied to the foundry segment, first because the company is more exposed to this market and second, because its process control equipment is in higher demand at foundries that are always looking to improve efficiencies in order to drive down costs. In the last quarter, KLA benefited from the continued ramp up of 28nm processes, as well as capacity builds at 32nm. As a result, the segment continued to make up the largest chunk of orders (57%) in the last quarter.The memory segment (16% of total orders) was up 48.9% and 4.8%, respectively from the previous and year-ago quarters, mainly on account of increased technology-driven spending. The NAND side remains the major driver of growth in memory and KLA stated that NAND spending overtook DRAM for the first time in the last quarter.Logic brought in the remaining 27% of orders, up 139.9% sequentially and 342.2% from the year-ago quarter, driven mostly by a diversified chip manufacturer looking to increase its leading edge logic capacity.There is considerable lumpiness in KLA's semiconductor business, since individual units are of high value. However the last quarter's performance indicates that the market is recovering.The wafer inspection product line saw orders jumping 235.1% on a sequential basis and 109.7% year over year. Reticle Inspection grew 41.2% sequentially, while declining 34.5% from a year ago. Metrology was up 207.2% sequentially and 44.1% from last year. Solar, storage, HB LED and other products were down 34.8% sequentially and 21.4% from last year.All except Europe and smaller Asian countries grew orders in the last quarter. Korea and Taiwan saw the biggest increases, followed by Japan and the U.S. Overall, the order contribution by geography was as follows-The U.S. 19%, Europe 2%, Taiwan 39%, Korea 28%, Japan 9% and Other Asia/Pacific 3%. The relatively higher concentration in Asia is due to the presence of a larger number of foundries and memory manufacturers in the region.The six-month backlog at quarter-end was $1.4 billion, up 27.3% sequentially and flat year over year.KLA's gross margin expanded just 31 bps sequentially to 58.3%, as the lower revenue were almost totally offset by lower inventory-related charges. It also shrunk 177 bps from the year-ago quarter. Incremental gross margins dropped to just below the targeted 60-70%.Operating expenses of $206.5 million were up 4.4% from the previous quarter's $197.8 million. The operating margin was 26.2%, down 700 bps sequentially and 997 bps year over year. While except cost of sales increased sequentially as a percentage of sales, although the increase in ER&D was the most significant. ER&D was also the most significant contributor to the decline from the year-ago quarter (57%), followed by SG&A and then cost of sales.Excluding the impact of acquisition-related expenses and restructuring costs on a tax-adjusted basis, as well as some discrete tax items, the pro forma net income came in at $121.9 million, or 19.0% of sales, compared to $198.1 million, or 24.9% in the previous quarter and $187.2 million, or 24.4% of sales in the year-ago quarter.Including the special items, the GAAP net income was $110.8 million ($0.66 per share) compared to income of $191.9 million ($1.13 per share) in the September 2011 quarter and $185.5 million ($1.09 per share) in the December quarter of last year.Inventories were up 4.4%, with inventory turns going down slightly from 2.2 X to 1.7X. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) went up from 53 to around 77. KLA ended with cash and short term investments of $2.18 billion, up $76.5 million during the quarter. The company generated $187.2 million of cash from operations, spending $14.9 million on capital expenses, $63.6 million on share repurchases and $58.1 million on dividends during the quarter.For the second quarter of fiscal 2012, KLA expects orders to be down 13.2% to up 2.6%, revenue of between $770 million and $830 million, opex to be flat sequentially, other income/expense to be a net expense of $10 million, tax rate 26% and a share count of 169 million, resulting in a non-GAAP EPS of between $1.00-1.18.KLA reported a good quarter, although the guidance was not very exciting. Management's optimism is based on the fact that foundry orders appear to be coming back, mainly on account of yield issues at 28nm and the fact that process control equipment is expected to remain an important investment area.Additionally, KLA has been recording some wins at NAND manufacturers that have done better than other memory makers this year and are likely to remain stronger. Therefore, although KLA's position in the segment is below desirable levels, the increasing penetration is a positive.We are not surprised by the softer order guidance for next quarter, since we cannot ignore the excess capacity that remains at foundries. We think that significant growth in KLA's business is not likely until semiconductor demand gains momentum, driving foundries to capacity expansion. This could happen in the back half of calendar 2012 if economic pressures alleviate.While the non-semi business could have provided something of a buffer in these trying times, there are issues in the solar market as well, which makes this difficult. Additionally, the segment still generates less than 10% of its orders, so the impact is relatively small.There have been limited changes in estimates over the last month or so and expectations for fiscal 2013 remain higher than those for fiscal 2012, indicating improving trends.KLA shares currently carry a Zacks Rank of #2, implying a short-term Buy recommendation. We are also positive about other equipment providers, such as  (  ), although we are slightly less positive about  (  ) given its exposure to solar. ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["emiconductors have not been the brightest star in the tech constellation in recent months.

Revenues were slightly more positive, beating consensus expectations by 1.5%.Applied reported revenue of $2.18 billion, which was down 21.7% sequentially, 24.4% year over year and within the guided range of a 15-30% sequential decline.Only the SSG segment performed in line with expectations in the last quarter. AGS exceeded expectations, while the other two segments fell short. remains Applied's largest segment, with a 49% revenue share. Segment revenue was down 23.7% sequentially and 28.1% year over year. Management had expected segment revenue to be down 20-30% sequentially, so revenue was within expectations.Management stated that given the strength in tablets and smartphones, NAND manufacturers could be encouraged to spend on capex through the rest of the year. DRAM on the other hand is not capacity constrained, so spending would remain sluggish.Applied expects foundry spending to pick up next quarter and through the rest of the year, driven by strength in mobile devices that continue to push up utilization rates. Logic remains strong for Applied. Management stated that Applied had a few big wins at important logic and foundry customers.The second largest segment was  , which generated 29% of total revenue. Segment revenue was up 4.3% sequentially and 21.9% year over year, better than Applied's expectations of a 5-10% sequential decline. The softening in 200mm continued in the last quarter, with some customers also transferring portions of their capacity to 300mm instead.However, Applied's penetration in Asia increased significantly, helping revenue. Applied expects that both utlization rates and wafer starts bottomed in the last quarter after three quarters of decline. The December quarter is now expected to be stable.The  segment made a 14% contribution to quarterly revenue, representing a sequential decline of 44.0% (guidance was at least a 30% decline) and a year-over-year decline of 48.0%. The weakness in the last quarter was expected, since there is significant excess capacity. However, Applied's market position remains strong due to customers picked up earlier in the year.Applied is now focused on the crystalline silicon business, which has started to prove beneficial for the company. Solar panel installations are expected to be up 25% this year to the 22-24GB range. Applied currently expects panel demand to increase 10-30% in 2012.Increasing competition is driving down module prices, which is driving manufacturers to cost-efficient technologies. These are the secular forces driving demand in all the big solar markets, such as the U.S., Germany, Italy, China and Japan.Performance in the  segment was much worse than management expectations. Applied's Display business was down 23.3% and 39.1% from the previous and year-ago quarters. The segment remained at just 8% of revenue in the last quarter. Softness in display is primarily on account of considerable capacity in the LCD TV market, where the 10% expected growth rate for 2011 is not enough to drive capex spending.Therefore, demand will remain weak until growth returns in both the developed and emerging markets. Capacity adds in other display markets, such as mobile is also weak, since capacity added earliler in the year remains under-utilized.Around 68% of Applied's quarterly revenue came from the Asia/Pacific region, with the largest contribution from China, which generated 19% and followed by Korea and Taiwan, which generated 17% and 16%, respectively. However, while China dropped 45.7% sequentially, the declines in Korea and Taiwan were smaller at 16.0% and 22.2%, respectively. Japan was down 10.2% and North America 3.8%. Europe (up 4.6%) was the only region to have grown sequentially.Total orders were down 33.3% sequentially and 47.3% year over year. All segments declined both sequentially and year over year. The order declines were most significant in the Display and EES segments. Therefore, while the BTB was negative in all segments, it was most disappointing in the Display (0.12) and EES (0.27) segments.Other than Korea and North America, which saw high single-digit declines, all other regions were down double digits. The softness was greatest in Japan (down 53.5%) and lowest in Korea (down 8.8%). Korea and Japan were the strongest regions in the preceding quarter, growing 44.5% and 36.5%, respectively.Applied generated a gross margin of 39.6%, down 284 basis points (bps) from the previous quarter's 42.5%, as lower volumes impacted cost absorption in the last qurter. The gross margin was down 299 bps from the year-ago quarter.Applied's operating expenses of $481.0 million were down 4.0% from the June quarter, with the operating margin of 17.6% shrinking 691 bps sequentially and 702 bps year over year. All expenses were up as a percentage of sales, compunding the effect of higher cost of sales.On a pro forma basis, Applied Materials had a net income of $271 million, or a 12.4% net income margin compared to $467.0 million, or 16.8% in the previous quarter and $475.8 million, or 16.5% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010.The fully diluted pro forma earnings were 20 cents a share compared to earnings of 35 cents in the previous quarter and 36 cents in the comparable prior-year quarter. Our pro forma estimate excludes restructuring charges, acquisition-related charges and tax adjustments in the last quarter. Our pro forma estimate may not match management's presentation due to the addition/exclusion of some items not considered by management.On a fully diluted GAAP basis, the company recorded a net income of $466.0 million ($0.35 per share) compared to $476.0 million ($0.35 per share) in the previous quarter and $468.0 million ($0.36 per share) in the prior-year quarter.Inventories were down 8.0% sequentially, with inventory turns dropping from 3.5X to 3.1X. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) went from 59 to 64, reflecting poorer collections. The cash and short term investments balance was $6.24 billion at quarter-end, having increased $486 million during the quarter. The recent increase in debt was with the intention of funding the Varian acquisition that closed in the last quarter.The company generated $698 million of cash from operations, spent $73 million on capex, $175 million on share repurchases and $106 million on dividends. At quarter-end, Applied had $1.95 billion of debt on its balance sheet, with a net cash position (excluding short and long term debt) of $4.30 billion. The debt cap ratio including long term liabilities and short term debt was just 20.5%.Management provided guidance for the first quarter. With SSG (including Varian) to be up 5-20% sequentially, AGS to be down 10-20% (the combined effect of lower 200mm sales, lower utilization rates and the absence of thin film revenue), and Display and EES to be down 40-60%, total revenue is expected to be down 5-15% sequentially.The non-GAAP EPS is expected to come in at 8-16 cents a share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the next quarter was 18 cents when the company provided guidance, above the guided range.Applied provided limited guidance for 2012 due to the significant uncertainties in the market. While they did not comment on the total revenue expectations, they did explain the conditions across the served markets. Accordingly, the SSG and AGS segments are expected to benefit from the Varian acquisition, although the performance of the core business remains uncertain.The LCD and touch panel equipment market is expected to remain extremely weak next year, pulling down Display sales by 10-20%. The EES business is expected to decline at least 50%.The Zacks Rank for Applied Materials shares is #5, signifying a short term Strong Sell recommendation.The main factor driving share prices right now is the weakness in the display and solar markets. Not only did the two segments perform dismally in the last quarter, but the outlook into 2012 remains extremely weak. Add to this the uncertainties in the semiconductor business, which is however expected to benefit from the Varian acquisition.The one positive appears to be that the semiconductor business is expected to see the same December quarter order increase as other equipment companies, such as  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) .Of course, we remain positive about Applied's strong position in the semiconductor market, the solar business in China, the huge portfolio and strategic relationships, which will however be less effective in the current market scenario. ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he bulls rediscovered technology yesterday.As the overall market soared, optionMONSTER's Heat Seeker monitoring program showed especially heavy activity in companies such as  ,  and  .LLTC saw buyers early, with money flowing into its January 31 calls for $1.15.  , which provides chip-making equipment, followed in the early afternoon with bulls snapping up its December 47 calls for $0.85.Then in the final minutes of trading, the attention shifted to BCSI and CVLT, with the December 20 calls and the January 55 calls bought in each, respectively.All four stocks rallied 4-6.5 percent, and all the calls purchased were  .

The latest American giant to warn was Intel (  ), the chip producing colossus that thoroughly dominates the market. The company warned that it would miss its previous forecast thanks to weather problems in Thailand, taking the wind out of the company's sails just a few days after the Santa Clara-based firm hit its 52 week high in stock price.The cause of the decline was largely due to the supply disruption that resulted from some of the worst flooding that the Southeast Asian country experienced in more than half a century. This pushed exports sharply lower and set Intel back in terms of hard disk drive inventories as some reports suggested that the national output of this key computing component were down more than 52% from the year ago period (also see  ).Thanks to this, quarterly revenue is expected to be down close to $1 billion from the previous forecast of $14.7 billion for the quarter while non-GAAP gross margin is expected to decline by fifty basis points, down to 65.5%. If this wasn't bad enough, reports also seemed to suggest that the problem wouldn't be going away in the next few weeks and that the situation could take months to resolve. In fact, Intel went on to  \"expects hard disk drive supply shortages to continue into the first quarter, followed by a rebuilding of microprocessor inventories as supplies of hard disk drives recover during the first half of 2012\". (read  )Unsurprisingly, Intel shares were hard hit by the news as the stock price fell by over 5% in mid-day Monday trading. This report also had a pretty severe impact on the rest of the tech space pushing a variety of ETFs down sharply on the news. The worst was in the semiconductor ETF space and especially so in the following four ETFs:Like all HOLDRs, this product doesn't track an index but does offer extremely concentrated exposure to its industry. In this case, the fund allocates nearly 23% of its assets to Intel while also giving Texas Instruments (  ) and Applied Materials (  ) weights of 21% and 10%, respectively. This ensures that SMH offers investors a highly-concentrated bet on large caps, meaning that broad exposure will not be achieved but the underlying securities will be extremely liquid.The fund tracks the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index offering exposure to 31 companies in total. The fund gives its top weighting to Intel, allocating 9.5% to the company. In addition to INTC, other top weightings go to Texas Instruments and Taiwan Semiconductor (  ), giving the fund a slice of international exposure in the semiconductor space (also read  ).For a slightly larger and more spread out portfolio, XSD could be the way to go as the product holds just over 50 securities in total. This is done by tracking the S&P Semiconductor Select Industry Index which represents the Semiconductor sub-industry portion of the S&P Total Markets Index. The index also uses a modified equal weighting system, ensuring that small caps aren't forgotten. Unlike the first two funds on this list, XSD doesn't give the top portion to Intel, instead allocating higher weightings to NetLogic Microsystems (  ) and Silicon Labs (  ).For a slightly more 'active' approach in the industry, PSI could be an intriguing choice. The fund tracks the Dynamic Semiconductors Intellidex Index which is designed to provide exposure to the semiconductor space by thoroughly evaluating companies based on a variety of investment merit criteria, including fundamental growth, stock valuation, investment timeliness and risk factors. Intel makes up the second biggest allocation in this fund at 4.9%, trailing only KLA-Tencor (  ) which makes up 5.2% of assets (also read  ).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The reason for the negative revisions may be traced to the weak results and outlook, particularly for the Display and Energy and Environmental Systems (  ) segments that is expected to continue well into 2012.Applied'spro forma earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate as lower revenue and margins were partially offset by strong opex management and a lower-than-expected tax rate.Revenue growth was weak across the Display and EES (solar) segments, with the Silicon Systems Group (  ) performing in line with expectations. However, Applied's penetration in Asiadeepened significantly, helping the Applied Global Services (AGS) segment to exceed expectations.Orders in the quarter were down 33.0% sequentially due to order declines in display (-91% sequentially) and EES (-3% sequentially). The lower demand for TVs and mobile devices in the display segment and excess capacity in the EES segment were the main reasons for the decline. Gross margins also declined sequentially to 39.6% aslower volumes impacted cost absorption.Estimate revisions for the upcoming quarter indicate declining sentiments, with 15 out of 17 analysts making downward revisions in the last 30 days. Also, for fiscal 2012, 15 out of 20 analysts made downward revisions, with only 1 analyst moving upward in the last 30 days.Analysts, by and large, continue to expect additional semi equipment order weakness in 2012. They believe that significant pressure in both Display (due to slow large TV sales growth) and EES (due to overcapacity and subsidy cutbacks) will weigh on Applied's core fundamentals.The analysts believe that both these segments will likely remain under pressure over the next several quarters with the timing of a recovery being uncertain, given the overcapacity issues and macro headwinds.Very few analysts believe that the display business will improve in the upcoming quarter, banking on investments in LCD/OLED that they expect will enable recovery.Applied now projects first quarter revenue to be down 5-15% sequentially, with SSG (including Varian) to be up 5-20% sequentially,AGSto be down 10-20% (the combined effect of lower 200mm sales, lower utilization rates and the absence of thin film revenue), and Display and EES to be down 40-60%.As the majority of analysts have lowered their estimates over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has fallen 6 cents for the upcoming quarter to 12cents and 16 cents for fiscal 2012 to 84 cents. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate fell 19 cents for the upcoming quarter and 49 cents for fiscal 2012 to 84 cents.The significant decline of 48 cents in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2012 clearly indicates the uncertainties in the semiconductor business and echoes the general pessimism for both display and solar in 2012.Though we believe there is potential in the solar energy market over the long term, we remain cautious on the company's efforts since management has already missed several targets to bring its solar division to profitability. Additionally, limited visibility and lower overall semiconductor equipment spending levels are the reasons our Sell rating on the stock.However, we remain positive about Applied's strong position in the semiconductor market, the solar business in China, the huge portfolio and strategic relationships, which will however be less effective in the current market scenario.Applied, which competes with other large equipment makers, such as  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ),holds a Zacks #5 Rank that translates into a short-term Sell rating. ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Analyst ratings are a great guide to what the market is thinking about a company\u2019s outlook, but finding groups of analysts that have a history of predicting stock performance is even better.When those analysts become more optimistic about a company, it\u2019s a signal to take a second look.Using analyst ratings from Reuters that are presented on a linear scale (with 1 = \u201cStrong Buy\u201d and 5 = \u201cStrong Sell\u201d), we sliced the ratings data of stocks paying dividend yields above 1% and sustainable payout ratios below 50% into three monthly time periods, and identified the groups of analysts that have shown predictive value over two consecutive time periods.We further narrowed down the list by only focusing on those stocks that have seen bullish trends in recent analyst opinion.Although past performance is no guarantee of future results, the recent accuracy of these analyst ratings suggests their opinions may be a helpful starting-off point for your own analysis.Do you think these analysts will continue to accurately predict these stocks\u2019 movements?Use this list as a starting-off point for your own analysis.1.  of all companies mentioned2.  mentioned below3.  mentionedList sorted by dividend yield.

If a company is paying a 4% dividend yield today, and you want to keep receiving that yield in the future, be sure that the company meets certain criteria and has a positive outlook to keep funding its dividend.There are several things to consider:This is measured by the payout ratio (dividends/earnings), and a ratio above 35-40% can be considered unsustainable. If a company takes a hit in profits one year, it may find itself strapped to keep up its high payouts. Dividend yield (dividend per share/share price) above 7% may also be considered unsustainably high.Debtholders are always paid before dividends. When debt grows out of control, so do interest payments, which cut into the cash that can potentially be paid as dividends. If a company\u2019s total debt/total assets ratio is below 0.20, the company\u2019s debt is relatively low.To illustrate these concepts, we ran a screen on stocks seeing rises in their dividend per share, comparing the current year estimate to the trailing-twelve-month dividend.

The quarter's results were impacted by a broad-based revenue decline, supported by a lower tax rate.Revenue was down 10.8% sequentially, but up 16.7% year over year. The sequential decline was due to market softness, as well as significant order decline from the previous quarter.Gross margin was 58.0%, down 268 basis points (bps) sequentially and 412 bps year over year. The sharp decline from both the previous and year-ago quarters resulted from significantly lower volumes and higher excess inventory reserves.For the second quarter of fiscal 2012, KLA expects orders to be up 25-45%, revenue of between $600 million and $650 million, gross margin of 57-58%, opex of $200-205 million, other income/expense to be a net expense of $10 million, tax rate of 26% and a share count of 169 million, resulting in non-GAAP earnings in the range of 56 cents to 72 cents.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter is currently pegged at 66 cents.(Detailed earnings results can be viewed in the blog titled: Out of the 15 analysts providing estimates for the second quarter, none have revised in the last 30 days. Over the same period, one analyst made an upward revision for fiscal 2012.Analysts expect a decent second quarter, with revenue and earnings coming in line with management's guidance. They believe that KLA-Tencor will benefit from the pickup in foundry capex spending in the near term. Given Samsung's doubling of foundry capex year over year, analysts expect  (  ) and Global Foundries to increase their proposed spending toward process control tools, leading to an increase in foundry orders.As per the analysts, KLA will gain from most of the process technology changes occurring in the industry. The yield issues faced by the foundries will drive increased orders and sales of process control tools.Additionally, the eventual shift to 3D device structures in the memory space will also benefit KLA-Tencor over the next few years. Analysts believe that the challenges involved in these new device structures will spur additional process control sales.In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter did not change, but it was up by a penny to $3.55 for fiscal 2012.Since the first quarter earnings announcement, the Zacks Consensus Estimate witnessed a significant decline of 28 cents for the second quarter and 38 cents for fiscal 2012. Therefore, negative sentiments appear to have outweighed the positive post first-quarter earnings.KLA-Tencor is benefiting from early 28nm technology capex from Foundries, particularly for yield improvement, but such orders may not be sustainable, given the overcapacity that exists in the Foundry segment. Additionally, the lack of visibility and low utilization rates at Foundries could be the primary reasons for the expected decrease in estimates.KLA-Tencor is a supplier of process control and yield management systems for the semiconductor and related microelectronics industries.In the near term, we believe that KLAC will benefit from the pickup in foundry capex spending and the process technology changes occurring in the industry.However, we cannot ignore the excess capacity that already remains at foundries, which increases the risk that any improvement in the market could be short lived. Hence, we believe that significant growth in KLA's business is not likely until semiconductor demand gains momentum, driving foundries to capacity expansion.Although KLA-Tencor is a leader in process control, it faces competition from other large equipment suppliers, such as  (  ) and Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation.KLA-Tencor shares carry a Zacks #2 Rank, implying a Buy rating in the near term (1-3 months). ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" The following is a list of stocks that have reached a new 52-week high during recent sessions.

But I had no idea how cheap. When  announced plans to buy a rival, an apples-to-apples comparison revealed a massive gap in how investors are assessing these firms. After a closer look, I'm betting Axcelis could double or even triple with just a few breaks.I'm  , as I've noted before. The chip equipment maker has such a broad array of products that it routinely snares some of the best contracts in the business. Applied Materials' move this week to acquire  for a hefty $4.9 billion looks like a wise move. Not just because it's added a $1 billion revenue stream to itsincome statement , but also because the company can now offer customers an even broader range of chip equipment in just one place. That makes life even more difficult for rivals such as  and  .Varian is also a leader in its field. The company's machines are used to stimulate ions in an electric field, a key process in the building of semiconductors out of large wafers. To gain access to Varian's technology and customer base, Applied Materials is paying a hefty five times trailing sales. To justify that price, Applied Materials notes Varian is in the midst of a heavy growth spurt -- sales are expected to rise roughly 50% this year. Varian's gross margins -- in the 50%-range -- are also quite impressive.-- David StermanAxcelis is a distant No. 2 in this field. But the company also has strong technology and a solid customer base. Yet  trade for just a fraction of their potential worth -- at least in relation to what Applied Materials is paying for Varian Semi. Shares trade for just 0.6 times trailing sales on an  basis. A lower multiple than Varian is warranted, especially in light of the company's weaker gross margins, but the  gap (shown in the table above) can largely be explained away by a lower level of absorbed  . Rising sales should push gross margins back into the low 40%-range in a year or two, as was the case in the middle of the past decade.Applied Materials'  has kicked off a game of musical chairs. As we've often seen in the world of high-tech, once a specific niche technology provider is acquired, a frenzy ofconsolidation begins where all other players are snapped up. Said another way, if Applied Materials will now have a strong grip on the ion implantation market, rivals like Novellus and KLA-Tencor need to have a similar offering to retain or lure customers.Axcelis surely is no gem. The company's stock has fallen from the $6-8 range during the last upswing of the semiconductor equipment cycle and now trade for just $2 (even after a 13% spike on Wednesday, May 4). Axcelis released weak fourth quarter results in early February, causing shares to drop 23% in just one day. Fourth-quarter sales were up more than 100% from the year-ago period, but they still lagged forecasts by more than 10%. The subsequent selloff led a group of seven insiders to purchase a collective 144,000 shares at an average price of around $2.60. The insiders were premature with their bullishness: shares slid well lower in subsequent weeks.-- David StermanFirst quarter sales of $93 million were flat sequentially but were below forecasts again. Yet even if the company can simply maintain that quarterly sales pace, annual revenue should still be up more than 30% from a year ago. That spike is coming from a pair of freshly-introduced product lines that hit the market in late 2010. Shares of Axcleis trade for around 12 times projected 2012 profits. If the company is acquired, a buyer could lop off a good chunk of overhead, pushing profitability even higher. While Applied Materials paid nearly five times trailing sales for Varian, Axcelis, with its laggingmarket share and still subpar gross margins, could fetch at least two times trailing sales in a  . This means shares have anywhere from 150-250% upside from here.That recent spate of insider buying may turn to be a wise move after all. Insiders likely know that Axcelis can boost sales on its own -- a clear panacea for the lagging stock price -- or the company can shop itself to the highest bidder.

Short sellers, however, lose money when the share price rises.And because share prices could rise to infinity, a reckless short position could lead to incredibly large losses.Because short selling requires borrowing, an individual or institution must meet several requirements (including background checks) to engage in short selling. Thus, in general, short sellers are more sophisticated than the average investor.In general:When there is an INCREASE in short selling - Short sellers seem to think the names will DROP in value. When there is a DECREASE in short selling - Short Sellers seem to think the names will RISE in value.All of the names mentioned here are stuck in a downtrend, but short-sellers seem to think most of the bad news is priced into these stocks--do you agree?1.  of all companies mentioned2.  mentioned below3.  mentioned Distributes, and installs home improvement and building products for home improvement and new home construction markets principally in North America and Europe.
