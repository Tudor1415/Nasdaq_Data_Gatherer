{"Content": ["April was a pretty good month for shares in automotive related stocks. According to data provided by\u00a0\u00a0auto parts retailers   and   rose 28.3% and 20.6%, respectively, over the month, and aftermarket automotive parts company  followed suit with a 27.5% increase. What's going on and why might these stocks be worth buying?AutoZone and O'Reilly are auto parts retailers and are often seen as recession-resistant options for investors, since their sales are largely dependent on the mileage and the average age of an automobile -- factors that don't necessarily depend in the economy.\u00a0Older cars require more replacement parts. And more miles driven implies more accidents -- a key factor in repair demand. And the sweet spot for auto repair is seen as somewhere between seven to ten years. In this range, a car is old enough to start needing replacement parts, but not too old that its owner stops maintaining it properly. LKQ, a leading provider of alternative parts to automotive repair shops, can be seen in a similar vein to the auto parts retailers.Image source: Getty Images.In a recession, consumers will likely defer purchasing a new vehicle and run an older vehicle longer. Indeed, the evidence from 2008-2009 is that auto parts retailers can continue to grow same-store sales even in a severe recession.Data source: Company SEC filings. YOY = year over year.Although the amount of miles driven will be reduced by a recession, it's worth noting that there's another factor that could push miles driven higher, even in a recession.Specifically, gasoline prices are much lower right now than they were entering the last recession. As you see in the chart below, oil was around $100 a barrel in the early stages of the 2008-2009 recession. Also note that miles driven increased markedly after the price of oil slumped in 2014.Data by Putting all of this together, you could view matters based on two different scenarios: if the pandemic is contained or if lockdowns are extended.\u00a0What happened with all three stocks in April was that market sentiment shifted toward the pandemic being contained. As you can see below, even in that situation, all three stocks should be able to benefit, whether the resulting economy is weak or strong. Throw in a relatively low price of oil (and therefore low gasoline prices) and you have favorable outcomes in both weak and strong economies.Weak EconomyStrong EconomyPandemic containedMiles driven improve moderately, average car age increases, supply-chain pressure easesMiles driven are much higher, average car age declines as new cars are sold, supply-chain difficulties easeExtended lockdownsMiles driven are reduced, average car age increases, difficulties with the supply chain*N/A*A strong economy is unlikely under extended lockdowns.Supply chain difficulties refer to the problems of sourcing auto parts when factories are closed during containment measures.Of course, there's no guarantee that extended lockdowns won't be in place, and that would certainly be bad news for all three stocks. But the interesting thing about the car parts retailers and LKQ is their potential to remain in growth mode even if the economy is relatively weak in a post-COVID-19 world. That's not something you can say about many stocks if the pandemic is contained and a weak economy follows.During LKQ's recent , CFO Varun Laroyia said China reported that 2 1/2 to 3 months after hitting its peak in virus infections, miles driven in individual vehicles had returned to 80% of pre-crisis levels. But he also said that in the U.S., \"We think it's going to be much more of a gradual return.\" Investors should keep a close eye on the miles-driven data and the shape of the economic recovery. Both look likely to improve from the perspective of these three companies, and low gasoline prices will surely encourage more traffic.As such, these three stocks provide a useful balance and diversification to a portfolio, particularly for investors holding too many cyclical stocks.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

For more details on this strategy, About Warren Buffett: Warren Buffett is considered by many to be the greatest investor of all time. As the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 for decades, and in the process has become one of the world's richest men.

His primary residence remains the gray stucco Nebraska home he purchased for $31,500 nearly 50 years ago, according to Forbes, and his folksy Midwestern manner and penchant for simple pleasures -- a cherry Coke, a good burger, and a good book are all near the top of the list -- have been well-documented.

However, it makes sense not to go overboard and start predicting wholesale changes to society. A better idea would be to look at the possibility that certain trends, already in place, will see accelerated development as a consequence. In this context, here are five ideas for investors to consider.The fear of getting an infection in a public place may well change consumer attitudes toward using a car rather than public transport for travel. Indeed, early indications from China are suggesting that car sales are receiving a boost from this. Image source: Getty Images.That said, there's still the tricky issue of new car sales being linked with employment gains, and overall economic growth conditions. In this context, it might make more sense to favor stocks that make money from more miles being driven than new vehicles sold. Examples include the auto parts retailers like  ,  , and \u00a0. They make money when, and ultimately need servicing -- something that's likely to happen in the recovery phase as economic activity picks up.\u00a0Throw in low gasoline prices encouraging drivers to rack up mileage and ongoing air travel restrictions, and the outlook is good for the auto parts retailers.It's no secret that e-commerce sales are already in a long-term uptrend, but it seems the COVID-19 pandemic is only going to encourage an uptick in it. Indeed,   has already reported a spike in demand for e-commerce deliveries. That's good news for e-commerce-related companies in the near term. However, it's also good in the long term, as it might create a structural shift in some consumers' behavior.If so, then it's likely to benefit the usual suspects such as  \u00a0It's also going to benefit a business like   Intelligrated, a manufacturer of  machinery.\u00a0\u00a0Data by The trend toward the increased use of  is already in place, and the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to give it a boost. Not only does automation help reduce costs, it also helps companies avoid some of the extended shutdowns put in place by the pandemic. In addition, the increased use of automation could make it more viable for industrial companies to invest in bringing back manufacturing to the U.S.That's probably the reason why industrial automation company   and its industrial software partner   have outperformed the S&P 500 and the industrial sector this year. Rockwell still faces issues in the near term -- full-year organic sales are expected to decline by 6.5% to 9.5% -- but it's a company whose .\u00a0Meanwhile, PTC, alongside other , is a beneficiary of the shift toward digitizing factories through the adoption of the \u00a0(IoT).The PTC/Rockwell strategic partnership aligns PTC's augmented reality, IoT, and digital connectivity solutions with Rockwell's industrial automation platforms and should serve to boost growth for both companies.Data by The explosion in demand for personal protective equipment is obviously benefiting some companies, like  in the near term, but it can also be a long-term driver as well. For example, food safety, clean water, and hygiene company  has an opportunity to benefit due to its market leadership in sanitation.There is a . After all, the hospitality and food service industries are key customers, and bears will see this as a potential issue. However, if you think that people will eventually start going back to hotels and restaurants as they did before -- except with a heightened sense of awareness around sanitation -- then Ecolab is an attractive stock.Image source: Getty Images.The pandemic is also likely to raise the awareness of commercial and institutional building owners on the subject of health climate in buildings.

Earnings have risen at a compounded annual rate of 12.3%\u00a0from fiscal 2014 through fiscal 2019. In fact, 2019 was the company's 27th consecutive year of same-store sales growth. During the last five years, diluted shares outstanding have decreased more than 26%. This is extremely advantageous, as it boosts the per share earnings applicable to existing shareholders. Although the buyback program was temporarily suspended in March\u00a0because of the coronavirus pandemic, it's always good to partner with a management team focused on utilizing free cash flow to reduce share count.

This raises the need for maintenance and repair parts, . However, a robust economic environment is good for business as well. As new automobile sales climb, the total population of vehicles on the road goes up.While it's no surprise that a growing and aging vehicle fleet is beneficial to O'Reilly Automotive, probably the most important factor to the company's success is the number of miles driven in the U.S. With the country under stay-at-home orders since the onset of the pandemic, this metric has declined substantially. Comparable store sales fell 13% during the four-week period from mid-March through mid-April. Deemed an essential business, the company has kept stores open and maintained operations to support those people who still need to get from one place to another.With restrictions easing in various states across the country, driving could be making a huge comeback.

Why risk my family's health and safety by flying in an airplane or taking public transportation when I have the safety, protection, and convenience of my own shelter-on-wheels?It's a very interesting perspective to think through when analyzing O'Reilly Automotive's investment merits going forward. Clearly Americans are planning on traveling again, but this time with a . If the number of miles driven in the U.S. begins ramping up in the next few months, we will know exactly why. Greg Johnson mentioned that even though \"the lasting impact of economic damage could persist well after the more restricted stay-at-home measures are lifted, we are well positioned to rebound quickly and return to solid growth, even if the broader economy is still under pressure.\"When looking back throughout history we've seen great companies make it through some difficult times.

It's far from certain whether a post-COVID-19 world will usher in a gradual recovery in the auto sector, or a protracted downturn. So fir investors, it makes sense to prepare for a range of scenarios.However, I think three automotive stocks have the potential to snap back after the coronavirus pandemic is contained. Here's why.Probably the two most important factors determining revenue growth at auto-parts retailers are the average age of vehicles on the road in the U.S., and the average number of miles driven. Older cars tend to require more repair, and the more cars are driven, the more they also require repair -- both good signs for auto-parts sellers.Image source: Getty Images.Unfortunately for O'Reilly, the number of miles driven will clearly be lessened by the economic shutdown imposed to contain the pandemic. That's part of the reason that management withdrew its full-year guidance in its recent results presentation.However, the \"miles driven\" figure is likely to bounce back given a gradual resumption in the economy -- something that can't necessarily be said about, say, commercial aviation, or traveling on cruise ships.As for vehicle age, the sweet spot for auto-parts retailers comes with cars that are seven to 10 years old. There are two points to consider. First, in a recession, consumers tend to defer buying a new automobile in favor of keeping an older vehicle running. This is why auto-parts retailers are seen as recession-resistant. Second, the big jump in auto sales that occurred in 2010-2015 means that until 2025, there should be a lot of vehicles coming up on their 10-year anniversaries. Both trends can be seen in the chart below.Data by .All of this means that O'Reilly is nicely set up to do well when the economy recovers. And if a recession occurs, then falling new-car sales will likely increase the average age of cars in the U.S. down the line.Like O'Reilly, Snap-on is an  that does well when the average age of a vehicle is on the rise. The company's diagnostic and repair tools are used in the repair market, so it normally does well when older vehicles are being driven more.It's not quite as recession-resistant as the auto-parts retailers, because it also sells to a broad range of commercial and industrial customers. Moreover, Snap-on counts dealer repair shops as part of its customer base, and those are obviously negatively impacted when car sales are in decline.In addition, Snap-on's sales fell 17.2% in 2009 as the last recession weighed heavily on the company. Another factor to consider comes from the fact that its products are known to be priced at a premium in the sector. Given a recession, there could be a trading down effect where customers shift to using, say Craftsman tools instead. Indeed, \u00a0is  in developing Craftsman's sales to new markets.\u00a0However, as you can see below, the majority of the company's revenue comes from vehicle repair. For reference, the Snap-on tools group sells to vehicle-repair technicians, and the repair systems and information group sells to vehicle-repair shop owners and managers:Data source: Snap-on presentations. Chart by author.All told, Snap-on will be negatively impacted by the curtailment of economic activity -- its organic sales fell 6.9% in its recently reported first quarter -- but given a combination of economic stability and a period of flat auto sales, the company can do well.I recently ran a screener to find stocks with  capable of withstanding a recession, and it was a pleasant surprise to see three automotive stocks among the final seven. Like Snap-on, Gentex was on the list; the third was  .As you can see below, Gentex and Snap-on have low debt-to-equity ratios, and very low debt-to-EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) levels. They are both well-placed to handle a slowdown:Data by .That said, Gentex is also well-placed to handle any  in auto sales or production. The company is a supplier of automotive rearview mirrors and electronics, and holds 94% of the market share for automatic-dimming rearview mirrors.As such, its growth prospects are tied to global auto production, and to increased penetration of auto-dimming mirrors -- a premium option that's likely to be adopted by more models down the line. As of August 2019, management believed that only 31.3% of interior mirrors and 12.6% of exterior mirrors were auto-dimming, so Gentex has the potential to grow more than the light-vehicle production market overall.As you can see below, Gentex actually managed to grow sales and earnings in 2019 despite a decline in light-vehicle production. However, the slump in production in 2020 is expected to send its sales growth into negative territory:Total light-vehicle production (units)79.1 million75.2 million59.8 million*Net sales$1.83 billion$1.86 billion$1.58 billion to $1.67 billion*EPS$1.62$1.66$1.39**Data source: Gentex. * = Estimated by Gentex. ** = Yahoo! Finance consensus analyst forecast. EPS = earnings per share.If 2020 is a trough year and Gentex hits the analyst consensus EPS of $1.39, then, based on the current price, it will trade at 17 times estimated future earnings. That's a pretty good valuation for a stock with a lot of upside potential should auto sales recover and then grow in line with an improving economy.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Right now, the extent of the damage that coming is still hard to accurately predict.But, assuming that a long downturn is imminent (or has already begun) investors can get some protection against it by buying stocks of companies that have proved resilient during previous recessions.\u00a0In this context, auto parts retailer  , contact lens manufacturer , and animal health company   are worth a look.Auto parts retailers are traditionally seen as . Consumers are more likely to defer purchases of new vehicles during economic downturns, which means they have to keep their older ones running. And the longer those older cars are kept on the road, the more they will need repairs and replacement parts.Protect your portfolio from a recession by buying stocks that can increase earnings in a downturn. Image source: Getty Images.During the 2008-2009 recession and its aftermath, O'Reilly's same-store sales growth accelerated.\u00a0Data source: O'Reilly Automotive. YOY= year over year. Chart by author.That said, it might seem somewhat puzzling that shares of the major auto-parts retailers are down significantly in 2020. That's possibly down to concerns that the sudden cessation in economic activity caused by social isolation measures -- and the steep drop-off in the number of miles being driven -- will heavily impact their sales.That's certainly true in the near term. However, given the likelihood that the COVID-19 pandemic will ultimately be contained, it's highly likely that light vehicles will be back on the road, and at that point, O'Reilly's sales could recover -- recession or no recession. As such, the recent drop in the share prices of auto parts retailer has created what appears to be some good buying opportunities for investors.Data by People still need to drive their cars in a recession. They also still need to see, which means that those who wear contact lenses have to keep buying them. That's clear from the results Cooper delivered during the last recession -- the company grew sales and earnings all the way through it.  This makes Cooper an attractive stock to look at if you are looking to hedge against a poor economy.However, buying Cooper for the long-term isn't just a defensive play. In fact, the company has a number of long-term earnings drivers that make its stock worth looking at. For example, an aging U.S. population is likely to lead to higher demand for eyesight correction products. In addition, Cooper is seeing strength in sales of its silicone hydrogel lenses -- more technologically advanced lenses that allow more oxygen to reach the eye.There's also an opportunity for  Cooper to grow sales of its 1-Day  modality lenses in the Americas. The 1-Day modality only accounts for 46% of the frequent-replacement market in the Americas (the rest goes to two-week or monthly modality) compared to 54% globally.Intriguingly, there's even a possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic will lead to a shift in consumer preference toward the 1-Day modality as those rapid disposables are seen as a cleaner option compared to two-week and monthly disposable lenses, which must be cleaned on a regular basis. Perhaps on the next , management might report whether they are seeing signs of such a trend.Data source: The Cooper Companies. Chart by author.Zoetis was spun out of pharma giant  in 2013, so it's not as easy to get a clear picture of how its components performed during the last recession. In addition, Pfizer added the animal health business of Wyeth to its portfolio with its acquisition of the company in 2008. Nevertheless, digging into Pfizer's SEC filings shows that its legacy animal health product sales were flat on a currency-adjusted basis in 2009 and increased 4% in 2010. That's a good result during a major recession.\u00a0To be fair, the animal health business isn't completely recession-resistant. High unemployment could result in people taking their pets to veterinarians less often, and if farmers are financially constrained, they could reduce investment in livestock. That said, the evidence from Pfizer/Zoetis during the last recession is that animal health spending is not cyclical --\u00a0 so it's still a good industry to hedge with during a recession.Moreover, Zoetis has powerful long-term trends propelling it forward. The combination of a growing global population, increased urbanization, and growing middle classes in developing countries is adding up to a significantly higher demand for protein. That's good news for the company's livestock-focused sales such as anti-infectives, vaccines, feed additives, and parasiticides. Meanwhile, companion-animal-focused sales can grow thanks to the increasing willingness of consumers to spend on their pets.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Participating on the call with me this morning are Jeff Shaw, our chief operating officer and co-president; and Tom McFall, our chief financial officer. David O'Reilly, our executive chairman; and Greg Henslee, our executive vice chairman, are also present on the call.Since we reported our fourth-quarter 2019 results and set our full-year 2020 guidance on February 5, it would be an understatement to say that the world has experienced a dramatic change with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As I begin my comments today, it's appropriate to start our discussion on the impact we have felt facing this uniquely challenging time in both the life of our country and for our customers and team members. First and most importantly, I want to express the profound gratitude I have for our dedicated team of hard-working professional parts people. Never have our culture values of dedication, hard work and professionalism meant more.Simply put, the parts and services we provide to our customers are absolutely crucial, whether that means healthcare providers, first responders, people working in essential industries or everyday customers who rely on their vehicles to meet their family's basic needs. Our dedicated team members in our stores, distribution centers and offices have demonstrated extraordinary commitment, flexibility and resilience in responding to the COVID-19 crisis by adjusting how we operate our business to keep all of our stores open to take care of our customers in the safest way possible. I want to thank each member of Team O'Reilly for your unwavering commitment to providing excellent customer service during these challenging times. We've undertaken many measures during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic to promote the continued health and safety of our customers and team members, while keeping all of our stores open to service our customers.From the beginning of the response to COVID-19, our industry was deemed to be an essential service in the executive orders that have been issued by the various governmental entities, including the federal memorandum issued March 16. Since that time, we have closely monitored and adapted to the evolving information, recommendations and requirements issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization and state and local governmental agencies. The extensive actions we have taken companywide include significantly increased cleaning and sanitation efforts, the implementation of social distancing practices and the ongoing adjustments of those practices as new recommendations and regulatory guidelines have been issued. We're providing our team members with necessary personal protective equipment and are working hard to continue to replenish supplies, despite challenges in sourcing these products.We have also put in place programs to relax attendance policies as well as advanced sick time to help team members who are sick or need time away to support family members. In addition to all these steps, we have also implemented measures to change how we interact with our customers in our stores, which Jeff will cover in more detail in his prepared comments. As a result of these efforts, all of our stores remain open with only limited disruptions for temporary closures in a few instances where we have determined more extensive cleaning was warranted. Now I'd like to provide a little more color on the cadence of our sales in the first quarter and the impact we began to see as a result of COVID-19.As noted in our earnings release, sales in January were below our expectations due to the mild winter weather with headwinds in categories such as batteries and antifreeze and that weather headwind persisted in February. As we entered March, sales results strengthened in conjunction with the onset of spring weather, and we were anticipating a solid finish to our quarter. We saw these solid sales trends until the COVID-19 stay-at-home recommendations and orders began to be issued in the middle of March. Within a short period of time, these orders took effect across virtually all of our market areas, resulting in a somewhat similar headwind throughout our store base.As we noted in our release yesterday, the negative impact caused by COVID-19 beginning in the middle of March and extending through the first two weeks of April resulted in a decrease in comparable store sales of 13% for that four-week time period. The lack of beneficial harsh weather and the significant impact of COVID-19 in the last two weeks of March drove our comparable store sales decline of 1.9% in the first quarter. Sales over the past week have reflected a benefit from the receipt of our customers of economic impact payments under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security or CARES Act. However, we are uncertain as to the magnitude and duration of this benefit we will receive from these onetime stimulus payments and as a result are being cautious on how we plan for our business moving forward.The composition of our comparable store sales growth for the first roughly 2.5 months of the quarter was similar to the trend we have seen for several quarters with our professional business outperforming our DIY business, driven by continued strong performance in key undercar hard part categories. Likewise, average ticket increases continue to drive our comp results, in line with our expectations as ticket counts were pressured in January and February as a result of the mild winter weather. As we began to face the headwinds from COVID-19 in the middle of March, we saw pressure on both sides of our business as consumers sheltered at home and miles driven was pressured. However, the impact was more severe for our professional business as we believe the demographics served by our professional customers is more likely to accommodate working from home than a typical DIY customer.The escalation of the COVID-19 crisis and the severity of the slowdown in demand in our business at the time of our first quarter was obviously unanticipated. I'm sorry, at the end of our first quarter was obviously unanticipated, and a significant impact on our operating profit and earnings per share results, both of which fell below our guided ranges. However, with an operating profit in excess of 17% of sales, we remain solidly profitable. As the duration of this challenging environment is unknown, we have taken prudent steps to ensure the continued stability and financial flexibility of our company, including appropriate actions to reduce costs, preserve cash and ensure adequate liquidity, which Jeff and Tom will discuss in more detail in their prepared comments.We are confident in our ability to protect the financial health of our company as we navigate through the current challenging environment. But we also recognize that we operate a business with a high fixed cost structure, and we'll continue to see pressure to SG&A and operating results in the short term. For the quarter, our gross margin of 52.3% was below our expectations as we saw deleverage of fixed distribution cost and a negative mix impact from the sluggish sales of higher-margin cold weather items. Outside of mix differences, product margins continue to be as expected and the pricing environment remains rational.As we reported in our press release last night, we have withdrawn our 2020 operating cash flow and capital expenditures guidance as we continue to evaluate and adjust to the current environment. This isn't a step we've taken lightly. But simply put, we just don't know how long the current crisis will last or what the road ahead will look like as each of the communities we serve navigates the ongoing crisis and begins to plan the reopening process. While we feel that withdrawing our guidance is the prudent decision because of the significant uncertainty of the current environment, we believe even more strongly that our industry and our business will rebound successfully and return to robust growth as we exit this crisis.The challenges presented by COVID-19 are unique and that they have temporarily changed consumer behavior. However, these changes are not structural or permanent, and we will come out of this public health crisis position for future success. While the lasting impact of economic damage could persist well after the more restricted stay-at-home measures are lifted, we are well positioned to rebound quickly and return to solid growth, even if the broader economy is still under pressure. A significant majority of the demand in the automotive aftermarket is nondiscretionary in nature as the parts we supply to our customers are necessary for the operation of their vehicles.Historically, we have performed well in different macroeconomic environments as consumers defer the purchase of new automobiles and invest in maintaining and repairing their existing vehicles at higher mileages. And we believe our ability to keep all of our stores open and operating positions us well as the economy begins to reopen. As I wrap up my prepared comments, I want to again thank Team O'Reilly for their resolving commitment to our customers. This current crisis is unlike anything any of us have seen in our careers, but I am extremely proud of the resilience of our team and their willingness to go the extra mile to take care of our customers, especially now when it matters so much.I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Shaw. Jeff? -- Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin my comments today by echoing what Greg has already said about the great contributions of our team over the last several weeks in responding to the COVID-19 crisis. Our team of professional parts people in our stores, DCs and headquarters have a long track record of selflessly responding quickly in times of natural disasters, including hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires and many, many other challenging situations. While this is certainly an unprecedented public health crisis, I see the same resolve and steadfast commitment in all the efforts our team has taken to respond to COVID-19 and keep taking care of our customers.I'm extremely proud and grateful of the sacrifices our team members have made to keep our stores open and operating to meet our customers' critical needs during this crisis. Excellent customer service has always been at the core of our culture. And if you've ever spent much time in one of our stores, it's easy to see how we highly with you rolling up our sleeves, interacting with our DIY customers at the parts counter or with our professional customers in their shops. In light of the information and recommendations by the CDC, WHO and other public agencies, we've taken extensive actions to adjust our operations to make sure our interactions with our customers are as safe as possible.Inside our stores, we've added signage, counter markers, floor markers and other measures to facilitate maintaining the recommended distance. We're leveraging our omnichannel investments by enhancing our Buy Online, Pick Up In-Store functionality to include curbside pickup, which has been very well received by our customers. We've also modified store services, such as battery and check engine light testing to ensure appropriate social distancing. For sure, the changes we've made to our business to protect the health and safety of our customers and team members has changed the way we interact with our customers, but we're extremely pleased with how well our teams have adapted to the guidance and still provided excellent customer service.Just as we made adjustments to how we interact with our customers, we've also begun to take the difficult steps to adjust our operations and reduce costs to respond to the lower level of business we've seen as a result of COVID-19. As we began to see the impact across our markets in March, we started to more aggressively manage our store payroll and staffing levels. We also implemented a reduction of store operating hours and began closing most stores at 7:30 p.m. versus the normal closing time of 9 or 10:00 p.m.While we don't like the inconvenience to our customers of an earlier closing time, we felt this was an appropriate move to more effectively deploy payroll and operating costs, given the changes we saw taking place broadly across retail. We've also reduced distribution and headquarter expenses to bring them more in line with the lower sales volumes. The combined steps we took in March to prudently manage our expenses resulted in keeping our SG&A per store flat, after excluding the impact of an extra day in the quarter from week day and a positive year-over-year benefit related to deferred compensation expense. However, the combination of the significant sales shortfall occurring late in the quarter and the degree of fixed cost in our cost structure drove a deleverage of first-quarter SG&A expenses of 61 basis points versus the first quarter of 2019.We saw this pressure despite the deferred comp benefit of 33 basis points, which has an offsetting headwind in other expense. As we've discussed many times in the past, we do everything we can to manage our business for the long run to ensure we're providing the exceptional customer service and building strong relationships with our customers, which pays off in repeat business in good times and bad. We will not change these core fundamentals of our business, and the consistency of our service to our customers has been and will continue to be the driver of robust growth and profitability for our company. However, as the current crisis has extended well into April, we've continued to take aggressive steps to manage our cost structure in response to the sales pressure we're experiencing.While these steps may not prevent us from seeing continued deleverage of SG&A expenses, if current conditions persist, we remain highly confident the adjustments we're making both preserve our company's financial strength and position us to return to our long track record of industry-leading profitable growth. We're also reviewing our capital expenditure plans in all areas of our business to ensure both continued stability and financial flexibility as well as strong returns on our investments. Through the first quarter, we opened 73 net new stores, and we're well on our way to our target of 180 net new stores in 2020. As the measures to combat the spread of COVID-19 have been implemented, including restrictions on travel and various other services, we've begun to see delays in the development schedules of new store properties slated for opening in 2020.Additionally, we're being very judicious about how we're proceeding forward on new store development in a period of such significant economic uncertainty. Both of these factors make it unlikely we will open our previous target of 180 net new stores. So at this time, we're also withdrawing our 2020 new store guidance. Our No.1 priority in opening a new store is to be able to identify a great store team and equip that team to provide excellent customer service from day one. We will monitor conditions in our planned development markets and make adjustments as we move forward to ensure that we're achieving that priority. On the DC expansion front, we successfully opened our newest distribution facility in 11 in Lebanon, Tennessee, an eastern suburb of Nashville on March 9. Nashville and its surrounding markets have been very strong growing markets for us, and the additional capacity in the new 408,000 square foot facility will allow us to take advantage of continued profitable growth in the region and accommodate a broader SKU capacity to provide an even better breadth of hard to find parts to our stores in this market.The Nashville team did a great job getting up and running without missing a beat, and we're extremely proud of the excellent team we have in place, providing outstanding, enhanced customer service. As we have with our new store development, we're continuing to evaluate the development schedule for our other major distribution project, our new facility in Horn Lake, Mississippi, just south of Memphis, which was slated to open in the fourth quarter of 2020, but will now likely be pushed into 2021. At this stage, it's too early to tell what impact or potential delay we'll see as we move forward, but we will make the appropriate adjustments as conditions change to ensure we have a successful completion of this project. Outside of new store and DC growth, we're also taking a cautious approach in scrutinizing other planned capital projects for 2020.As we discussed when we outlined our plan for capital investments on our last earnings call, we have several exciting projects and initiatives, which will enhance the service we provide to our customers and drive strong returns. The ultimate opportunities presented by these projects hasn't been diminished, and we will continue to move forward, where appropriate, including our initiative to convert the hardware that runs our stores. In other instances, we will monitor our business and resource needs, and we're electing to defer certain projects for a period of time to ensure a successful rollout. The strength of our business and the consistency of the cash flows we generate allows us the ability to weather a storm like the one we're in right now.without having to make drastic and severe cuts to our operating and capital plans. This type of financial flexibility puts us in a solid position. But we remain committed to being good managers of our shareholders' capital, and we'll make prudent decisions to ensure continued financial strength. To close my comments, I'd like to again express my deep appreciation to Team O'Reilly for your hard work, dedication and commitment to meeting our customers' needs during these challenging times.Now I'll turn the call over to Tom. -- Thanks, Jeff. I would also like to thank all of Team O'Reilly for their hard work and dedication to taking care of our customers in the midst of this extremely difficult environment. Now we'll take a closer look at our quarterly results. For the quarter, sales increased $66 million, comprised of $44 million decrease in comp store sales, a $52 million increase in noncomp store sales, a $34 million increase from Leap Day, a $26 million increase in noncomp nonstore sales and a $2 million decrease from stores permanently closed in line with our 2020 plan.For clarification, these store closures were planned and are broken out consistent with our past reporting practices. As Greg previously discussed, we have withdrawn all 2020 guidance. Our first-quarter effective tax rate was 20.9% of pre-tax income, comprised of a base rate of 21.8%, reduced by a 0.9% benefit for share-based compensation, both of which were better than our expectations. This compares to the first quarter of 2019 rate of 22.5% of pre-tax income, which was comprised of a base tax rate of 24.5%, reduced by a 2% benefit for share-based compensation.The first quarter of 2020 base rate as compared to 2019 benefited from solar tax credits, which were in line with our expectations in total dollars, and drove a lower effective tax rate on pre-tax income that was below our expectations. Changes in the tax benefit from share-based compensation can create fluctuations in our quarterly tax rate, and we continue to expect our rate for the remainder of 2020 to be lower in the fourth quarter as a result of the totaling of certain tax periods. Now we'll move on to free cash flow and the components that drove our results for the quarter. Free cash flow for the first quarter of 2020 was $227 million versus $279 million in the first quarter of 2019, with the reduction driven by lower pre-tax income and investments in solar projects, offset in part by lower credit card receivable balances compared to the same time in 2019.The investment in solar projects generate investment tax credits, which will benefit cash taxes paid in the remainder of 2020, but the timing of these investments can create unevenness in our quarterly cash flows. Inventory per store at the end of the quarter was $643,000, which was up 1.6% from the beginning of the year and up 5.6% from this time last year. The increase reflects the additional inventory investments we have planned for 2020 as well as increases resulting from soft first-quarter sales. Our AP to inventory ratio at the end of the first quarter was 105.7%, which was above our expectations and the 104.4% we finished 2019.Finally, capital expenditures for the first three months of the year were $133 million, which was down $20 million from the same period of 2019, driven by the prior year level of investment in new distribution projects versus the first quarter of 2020. As Jeff previously discussed, we continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 and will adjust our capex plans as appropriate given the environment. As the COVID-19 crisis worsened and we began to see pressure to our operations in the middle of March, we took appropriate steps to preserve capital and liquidity, including drawing down $250 million on our line of credit and holding that balance in cash. We were also very pleased to further strengthen our liquidity position through the successful issuance of a $500 million 10-year senior note at a rate of 4.2% on March 25, in the midst of a market challenge by the COVID-19 crisis.We finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR ratio of 2.59x as compared to our ratio of 2.34 times at the end of 2019 and above our stated leverage target of 2.5 times. Excluding the incremental borrowings, we elected to hold in cash at March 31, our leverage ratio was 2.49 times. As a further step to conserve liquidity, in the middle of March, we temporarily suspended our share buyback program. Our year-to-date repurchases prior to this decision totaled 1.5 million shares at an average share price of $386.71 for a total investment of $574 million.As of yesterday, we had $1.1 billion of total liquidity in cash and available borrowings under our $1.2 billion revolving credit facility, and we feel we have ample liquidity under this existing facility. As we evaluate our liquidity, leverage, use of capital and share repurchase program moving forward, we'll continue to prioritize maintaining our strong financial position, including the investment-grade rating on our public debt. We have a long history of conservatively managing our balance sheet, and we'll continue to take prudent steps to ensure the long-term health and stability of our company. Before I open up our call to your questions, I'd like to thank the O'Reilly team for the resilience they've shown over the last several weeks and for their continued dedication to our company and our customers.This concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I'd like to ask Latif, the operator, to return to the line, so we'll be happy to answer your questions.Thank you. [Operator instructions] Greg Melich from Evercore ISI is on line with a question. -- Thanks. Good morning, guys. Great job getting through all this. My core question is on the actions to both reduce costs and position the business to help customers and associates.How should we think about the variable margin of the business as you are getting into that position? I'm thinking that it's probably around 40%, if we look back to prior downturns. I just want to see if you still think that's a fair benchmark. And then I had a follow-up. -- Tom, do you want to take that one? -- Greg, this is a situation that we haven't seen before with miles driven significantly down, people staying at home, something very unusual and the sales are down much more than we've experienced in the past. As Greg talked about in prepared comments, we have a very high fixed model when you look at multi locations opened from 7:30 in the morning till 7:30, 8, 9, 10 at night. We have to staff all of those hours. So given that, we have a high fixed model, and we're seeing a pretty significant reduction in sales.We would expect to have more pressure and more of a negative \u2014 less of a positive flow through on those sales. So we'd expect it to be a more restrictive number. -- Got it. So more than 40% would be reasonable just given the nature of this downturn being so unique? -- Yes. -- Got it. And then the follow-up would be on the uniqueness of this. What are you guys seeing in terms of? You mentioned that geographically across the stores, it's pretty similar. Have you seen any change in terms of potentially less urban or more rural stores behaving differently? I'm just thinking about where there might still be movements of activity given that miles driven are probably down 40% or 50%.Anything on that would be helpful. -- Jeff, do you want to take that? -- Yes. Greg, as we mentioned in the prepared comments, we really didn't have much of a winter in January and February. So our cold weather market started off pretty slow. And then business picked up in the first half of March that we talked about, and then the COVID pandemic really hit.And with 90% of the population really all across the country understand home areas, impact was fairly widespread across all of our chain. The one thing that I would say in general is that the large metro markets appear to have been impacted to a greater degree than the rest of the markets in our chain, and we assume that would be driven by the better adherence to the stay-at-home orders. -- Now. That's helpful. Good luck, guys. Thanks.We have a question on line from Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. -- Good morning, guys. Thank you for the question. Are you guys able to provide us with at least a general range of what your profitability was during that four-week period where you posted a negative comp of about 13%, I guess kind of a derivative on Greg's question? -- Well, first of all, it bridges accounting periods, but we don't give profitability metrics on short periods of time. What we would say to echo the comments we made regarding Greg's question is that the negative flow through will be higher because we have to staff the stores for the hours open, and we'll see quite a bit of SG&A headwind given a negative 13% comp run rate. -- OK. All right. I got it. I'm sorry.That's OK. -- Obviously, that depends also on what the sales look like for the rest of the quarter and how many miles are driven. But given that rate, it will be a significant headwind. -- Got it. OK. And then I guess a follow-up question then is, just given kind of the magnitude of impact on your industry with the miles driven being down, you think this could lead to a more aggressive M&A posture from O'Reilly? Or is that just not where your heads are at, at this point, given the current downturn in business? -- Scot, as a company, we always look for strategic acquisitions. And right now, it's really no different. I wouldn't say we're focusing any more or any less on looking at strategic acquisitions. Frankly, we've been really business.We're all really busy running the business and coping with what's going on, but we would certainly be open to looking at strategic acquisitions, if any of them presented themselves. -- Understood. OK. Good luck, guys.Our next question on line is from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. -- Thank you, everyone. Good morning. My first question, first, more of a housekeeping. Through mid-April data point that you provided, does that include the stimulus period? And then the minus 13% broadly, it sounds like the back half of March was weaker, and we've seen improvement.Can you share how different the weeks in April have been so we can have a sense to glean on how to think about the world going forward? -- Yes. We're not going to quantify that, but I'll kind of walk you through the quarter with a little more color than what I did in prepared comments, Simeon. As we said, we started the quarter very similarly to where we commented back in February. January, mild winter that led into February.Comps for both January and February were positive. Although they didn't meet our expectations, they were both positive. Then we moved into March and in the first couple of weeks of March, things improved. Weather improved.Sales were more typical of what we would expect to see with normal weather patterns in our business. So we saw improvement in the first two weeks. And then the middle of March, when COVID really started to present itself and stay-at-home and shelter-in-place orders were issued. For that next four-week period, we saw consistent negative comp trends fairly consistent across all four of those weeks.And then over the past week, once the stimulus checks have started coming out, checks and electronic payments, we've seen improvement over those prior four weeks. -- Simeon, this is Tom. To add to that, the reason we picked the last two weeks of March and the first two weeks of April were the performances were pretty consistent. Stay-at-home orders and companies converting people to working at home was pretty consistent. We want to give you what the baseline was.As Greg talked about, we have done better since the stimulus checks were issued, but we are uncertain the duration of that benefit. -- Got it. Yes, that's really helpful. I guess I'll put my question and just maybe a reaction to that, if I understood it properly, because miles driven, seems like it's down significant, not to be able to figure it out by market, but who knows maybe 40%, 50%. It implies that pre stimulus then your business was run rating at a much, much healthier rate than that.I think you're implying minus 13% before stimulus, which is quite decent. So I know, Greg, it is prudent to be cautious, which is how you laid it out. And it's hard to think about pent-up demand here versus what stimulus is going to do. But does the minus 13% inform you at all relative to the degree of miles driven that there is maybe more insulation here than you would have thought? Or I don't know how you think about it. -- Yes. Well, what we're uncertain now is how much of the improvement is related specifically to the stimulus. We feel like a significant amount of the improvement we saw over the prior four weeks was stimulus related. As time goes on and these stimulus checks and the money runs out, we'll just have to see how our performance does over the next few weeks.And it's unknown what future stimulus will hit and the timing of that. So we're being very cautious and conservative as we look forward. -- To add to Greg's comment, the stimulus checks hit, in essence, a week or 10 days ago. We didn't want to include that in our comments because we're not sure of the duration. From a miles driven standpoint, we haven't seen the national data on that yet. I know there's a lot of assumptions out there on the gas usage of calculating miles driven, but that hasn't been always a great indicator for us.What we also tell you is that there are a lot of auto parts that are sold by somebody that's not O'Reilly. And our opportunity is to go out and make long-term relationships with customers and gain more market share. Our goal has always been to never settle for what the industry growth rate is, but to go out and earn additional market share growth beyond that. -- And I want to add word on that is that's why we've done our best to keep all of our stores open in all of our local markets. And maybe that was with the skeleton crew, but at least we kept the doors open to be there for our customers. -- Yes. I appreciate all the color, and good luck. Thanks.Our next question on line comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. -- Good morning. Thanks a lot. So the large aftermarket players have put a lot of emphasis on miles driven as a key factor that drives the industry. As you look out over the next nine months, what's going to be more important to determining demand for the aftermarket, miles driven or the fact that many consumers are going to be under economic pressure and new car sales are likely to be weighed down, which matters more? -- Yes. Michael, great question. I think it's all of the above. The biggest driver in our industry continues to be miles driven.That's what causes breakage, wear and tear, more maintenance cycles on vehicles. So I would add more weight to that. Obviously, this period that we're approaching more so than normal. There are other factors that you mentioned that would impact that.But I would say that miles driven would be the most significant. As I said in prepared comments and we comment on frequently, most of our purchases in our industry are nondiscretionary. Most of the people come into our stores to buy parts, to repair or maintain their vehicle. They just really don't have a choice.Whether it's getting their kids to school or getting themselves to work, they have to have their vehicle. So because of being nondiscretionary in nature, economics definitely plays into this, but consumers have historically done a good job of prioritizing their spending on a weak economy, and our industry has performed well. So I think the single most important factor would continue to be miles driven. -- If you look back to the recession in 2008, 2009, what categories did you see the biggest acceleration? And would those be the leading indicators for how the next few quarters could unfold? And also, could you add a comment on what you expect inflation or deflation for the auto aftermarket is going to be through the back half of the year? Thank you. -- So when we look back at 2008, not surprising as people determine they were going to keep their vehicles longer, want to maintain their roadworthiness, key drivers were hard parts. People want to keep their vehicle, maintaining it on the road well. It wasn't a dress up, wasn't in performance. It was those key hard parts.The second question was \u2014 can you repeat the second question? I'm sorry, Michael. -- What's the outlook for inflation or deflation as you move through the next few quarters, Tom? -- Sorry about that. Yes. So our expectation is unchanged. We had anticipated no inflation, no new inflation, and that we would be anniversarying increases from the tariffs from last year.So same expectation. -- Thank you very much. Good luck.Thank you. Our next question on line comes from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. -- Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So the first question I have, I guess, a relatively simple one, but you had mentioned in your prepared comments not surprising that the DIY business here is performing better than the commercial DIFM business.Could you give us some more details as on how large of spread between the two sides of your business is currently tracking? -- Yes. What we said is that, first of all, we're not going to break out what the spread is between those 2. But we have seen less pressure on the DIFM side over the past week or so, as we called out in our comments. And we think a lot of that is because of the consumer that is the typical DIFM customer is probably more able to work from home and driving fewer models than perhaps that DIY customer might be.Tom, do you want to add to that? -- In the last week or 10 days since we've seen the stimulus checks, we've seen both sides of the business improve. We would tell you that the DIY over this period of time since the significant outbreak and the crisis has gotten worse has performed markedly better. -- OK. Got it. And the second question I have, going back to echo the comments someone else made in their question, which was, if you look across retail, down 13%. You talked about the mid-March to mid-April while not consistent with normal O'Reilly practices is actually not bad at all relative to a lot of retailers out there.As you look at the makeup of your business, to what extent is O'Reilly benefiting right now from new traffic, new customers coming to the store, potentially reflecting dislocations within the broader retail landscape? And to the extent that it is happening, how do you think about the retention of these customers, once the pandemic or the crisis begins to abate? -- So I guess the first thing I'd say is any time we put up a negative comp quarter, it happened so rarely, it doesn't feel very good, despite the comparisons. On the traffic, it's very hard to determine. We can look at some of our O'Rewards data because, and we can look at that over a period of time to see how many new customers we sign up. And when we look at our shops because their business is suffering, it's hard to know if you're losing more or less than the other numbers they have on the line and whether you're moving up the call list or not.Ultimately, we feel good that we've been able to keep our stores open and perform comparatively well. Over time, we feel like those customer interactions where we get a new customer in the door because the parts store that they normally go to hasn't been open that we're going to provide great customer service, and that's going to be sticky. Same thing on the professional side, which we know for sure from past experience. -- Yes. Brian, I would add one thing to that. Most of our e-commerce business does result in that customer coming to our store as Buy Online, Pick Up In-Store. Over the past several weeks, we have increased functionality there to roll out buy online ship to store functionality, which opens up our supply chain to provide often same-day service to our stores, either from a distribution center or a hub store nearby.So we've added that functionality and our e-commerce sales have picked up, especially on the pick up in-store side. -- Thank you very much.Thank you. Next question on the line comes from Chris Horvers of JP Morgan. -- Thanks. Good morning, guys. So my question is on the gross margin line. So can you talk a little bit about how lapping tariff price increases played out? Did that end up being a headwind and related to that LIFO? And did Mayasa end up being a headwind to your gross margin rate? And while you've pulled guidance, as you think about all the puts and takes of what you're seeing so far, any comment on the gross margin going forward? -- Well, I've seen the tariffs has played out as we expected. On our last call, when we laid out our gross margin guidance at the time, LIFO was more of a headwind. This year, we're not seeing as much of a benefit as we saw last year. But that, again, is tracking as we'd expect.As we talked about on the call last time, Mayasa runs a big independent jobber business. So they're selling to other part stores. So they have a lower operating cost, but also lower gross margins. So that's a drag also.When we look at our gross margin for the first quarter versus our expectations, it's really less high-margin winter items and then we have a relatively high, we have quite a bit of high fixed cost in our distribution center, when you look at management, occupancy and routes that we run transportation. So when our volume is down, that's going to be a drag. -- Yes. To add a little more color in distribution to what Tom said. The fixed cost, as Tom said, they are going to be a drag on low volume. One of the uniquenesses of the timing of the impact of the virus to us is it's in a period of time where we're ramping up for spring volume.So if you look at a distribution center and you look at the labor in the distribution center, you got to look at the inbound side, inbound volume as well as the outbound volume. So over the past several weeks, our inbound volumes have been higher as a result of ramping up for the spring season, while our outbound volumes have been softer. So the DCs have been impacted and you would think that they would be able to reduce hours and cut some labor. They haven't been able to do that as much as you might think because of the inbound volume in keeping up the spring inflow of product. -- Got it. So basically the 1Q gross margin played out as your thought sans the sort of top line impact. And so it's a good guide going forward. And two quick follow-ups, two follow-ups.One is, what was the inflation impact the comp in the first quarter? And then just big picture, the 2009 analogy. How would you compare the puts and takes to what occurred back then? The peak repair factor seems like weather was better, the new car sales dropped off, sort of, sustained dropped off was much bigger. But then on the other hand, you've got higher share now. Your smaller players are probably suffering capital pressures, and there's 15,000, 16,000 small shops out there to take share from, but you don't have the dealers closing.So a lot of puts and takes. How are you thinking about that in comparison to that '09 time frame? -- Yes. So I'll take the first part and then I'll let Tom speak to the inflation question. Chris, a lot of things are similar, and then there are some things that are definitely different. When we went through '08, '09, there was a lot of things we called out that were drivers.We talked about the SAAR. We talked about miles driven. We talked about Hispanic hibernation and other things. The one thing that's unique about the situation we're in now is the fact that the potentially dramatic impact to miles driven so far.With all of the stay-at-home orders, consumers have just not been driving their vehicles at all in a lot of markets. So miles driven we feel like is going to be significantly drawn down. We think that was a driver of a lot of the negative impact to our first-quarter results. And it really just depends on how this thing plays out.Miles driven is going to be a key factor in what our business does going forward. And it really just depends on the timing of when the stay-at-home orders are released and people are able to go back to work and get back to their normal lives. -- On the inflation, it was a little over 2.5%, which is pretty much exactly where we expected it to be, all driven by anniversarying sale price increases from last year, really to last year's tariffs. We'd expect that to be the highest number of the year and to decline as we anniversary the last year's tariffs. -- Thanks so much. Best of luck, guys. Thanks.Our next question on line comes from Bret Jordan of Jefferies. -- Good morning, guys. Quick question. I guess when you think about the payables programs and, I guess leverage ratio is likely to go up as EBIT comes down in the coming miles driven contraction. Do the banks get any more, I guess, or less credit available or higher rates on the payables programs in the next couple of quarters? Or is that pretty well understood if you want off and worked out? -- So our vendor financing program is primarily akin to what our rating is. And our expectation is that, that will not change, and we'll be very conservative in our balance sheet, although we will see pressure from a operating standpoint, given the current environment. We generate a significant amount of cash, and we expect to be able to very effectively manage our leverage ratios. -- Great. And then I guess a question as far as the broader industry. Obviously, a lot of doors, when you think about independent distributors and all. Do you think that we're going to see meaningful contraction in the total number of doors, just given the magnitude and the abruptness of this decline, independents or buying group members that may go away? -- Bret, I really don't think we've got a good feel for that yet. When you look at the shops that are out there, a lot of those shops are strong financially. When you look at a layer above that, the WDs, those guys are strong financially. I think it would be naive to think that there wouldn't be some doors closed throughout all this.But I just don't think at this point, we've got an idea of the scope or the magnitude of that. -- Great. Thank you.Thank you. Next question on line comes from Daniel Imbro of Stephens\u00a0Inc. -- Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking our questions. I wanted to ask, and apologies.I hopped on late. Sorry if you discussed this in your remarks. But have you seen an uplift in sales through your online channels relative to the last few quarters as we've seen this work-from-home environment? And if so, has it exposed any weaknesses or area that need investment in your infrastructure? Has it given you guys any new learnings around where future investments could drive incremental sales on the online side? -- Yes, Daniel. So I did say earlier that we have seen improvement in e-commerce sales, although it's still a very, very small percentage of our total sales. Throughout the last several weeks, the stay-at-home orders clearly have driven more consumers to shop online. The one thing that hasn't changed during that process is how those customers are buying from us.Consistently, over the years, customers have erred to the side of even to forgo discounts to Buy Online, Pick Up In-Store, and that just speaks to the urgency of need in our industry. And we've seen an uptick in sales, but we haven't seen a change in those buying habits. And that most of those purchases do resolve in the team or the customers coming to our stores. We have advertised our curbside delivery.And I think that's been very popular with a lot of consumers that just are not comfortable going in and socializing with people during this pandemic. So we have done a lot of business through that channel. But most of our volume continues to be, our e-commerce volume continues to be Buy Online, Pick Up In-Store. -- Got it. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on the working capital question earlier. Tom, as we look at the balance sheet, inventory did grow pretty meaningfully.Can you help us parse out how much of that was the proactive $100 million inventory investment you had planned for this year? And any early signs that, that is helping gain incremental share? Can you parse out the impact that's having on the rest of the P&L? Thanks. -- So about half of it was the additional growth that we planned for this year and half of it was \u2014 we just didn't move as many winter goods and end of spring, as Greg talked about, the inbound keeps coming. So we're planning for business, and it was very rough going the last two weeks. As far as are the additional SKUs making a difference, that will take time to determine. And there is so much disruption out there in the market right now that clouds everything else from a testing perspective. -- Got it. Thanks, guys.We have reached our allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Greg Johnson for closing remarks. -- Thank you, Latif. We'd like to conclude our call today by thanking the entire O'Reilly team for their continued selfless dedication to our customers. I'd like to thank everyone for joining our call today, and we look forward to reporting our second-quarter results in July.

For example, on the recent , CEO Garry Ridge argued that the sales decline during the recession in 2008 \"was primarily because of the strengthening of the US dollar against the pound\" with CFO Jay Rembolt adding, \" Actually, we had a shortfall in the US. We actually -- in local currency or in source currency, we were -- we had growth in EMEA. But it was wiped out because of the headwind from foreign currency exchange.\" Image source: Getty Images.Moreover, the auto parts retailers through which WD-40 sells a lot of product, like   and , are traditionally seen as recession resistant. Consumers tend to hold off buying new cars in a recession in favor of running older ones that need more servicing.As for the argument that costs could come down, WD-40 has previously outlined that  33% of the cost of a can manufactured in the U.S. comes from \"petroleum-based specialty chemicals,\" with 19% from plastic and 33% from the cost of the can itself. You could argue that all three of these components could see cost reductions in the current environment.Finally, the company has an excellent track record of growing sales, generating good operating margins, and an enviable return on equity rates. All of these things stand it in good stead to hit its long-term aims.Data by The bears are probably willing to accept some of these arguments, but the points made need to be put into context.First, WD-40 may well have some recession resiliency attached to its products, but that doesn't justify the valuation premium the market is still giving it. For example, here's a look at a common valuation metric, namely enterprise value (market cap plus net debt), or EV, to earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, and amortization, or EBITDA.For reference, the total market EV/EBITDA multiple (excluding financials) in January was 13.8 times EBITDA.\u00a0Not only is WD-40's multiple significantly in excess of that figure, it's also at a massive premium to the auto parts retailers (O'Reilly and AutoZone are also arguably recession-resilient businesses) and hardware stores that it sells through.Data by Second, the recent second-quarter earnings report came with a very disappointing gross margin performance. Chief operating officer Steve Brass noted that WD-40 buys \"custom formulated petroleum-based specialty chemicals, which have complex cost drivers, including the manufacturing region, fixed production costs and distinctive supply and demand characteristics,\" and argued that \"we estimate only a small amount of the total costs to produce a can of the WD-40 Multi-Use Product directly correlates to the price of a barrel of crude oil.\" In addition, gross margin was negatively impacted by an unfavorable sales mix.Finally, , the compound annual growth rate (2019 to 2025) of revenue needed to hit the company's aspiration of $700 million in sales in 2025 is around 9.2%. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic hit WD-40's ability to distribute in the Asia-Pacific region,  on a consistent basis in the last couple of years.\u00a0Ridge appeared to back off these targets on the , blaming the COVID-19 crisis by saying, \"The timing of our 2025 aspirations may be delayed,\" but the reality is WD-40 looked to be behind these targets anyway.Data source: WD-40 presentations. YOY= year over year. Chart by author.All told, WD-40 stock trades at a significant premium that doesn't appear to be justified considering how it's tracking toward its 2025 aspirations. The idea that lower commodity prices will boost gross margin is questionable, and there are other recession-resilient candidates that trade on significant valuation discounts to WD-40.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Italy, France, and Spain all reported a deceleration in deaths from COVID-19. And New York State announced Monday its deaths were flat from the previous report, but also noted that even if this is the plateau, it's still a very high and stressful level for the healthcare system.Expect the markets to remain volatile on both good and bad news surrounding COVID-19. The virus and its harm to the U.S. economy have clobbered many retail, transportation, and entertainment stocks, but the automotive aftermarket retailers have fared a bit better.  data by Generally,  such as AutoZone, Advance, and O'Reilly when a recession is on the horizon. When consumers tighten their budgets, they opt to do more small maintenance and repairs themselves to save a few bucks. And during recessions, consumers often put off purchasing new vehicles, which increases the average age of vehicles on the road, creating more demand for repair parts.But this is no traditional downturn, and as many consumers have taken social distancing to heart, and many Americans are working from home, miles driven have declined and the need for do-it-yourself repairs has also slowed, for the moment. LKQ, which sells parts to collision shops and mechanics, among other business segments, will also suffer with fewer discretionary miles driven and less collision-repair demand.Image source: Getty Images.With uncertainty on how quickly the economy will rebound once COVID-19 is under control, and how quickly consumers respond with purchasing, the important thing for companies is to bolster their cash positions and liquidity to survive the uncertainty.One example is when Advance Auto announced in late March it would draw $500 million of its $1 billion credit facility to help fund ongoing operations and general purposes. It's also important for companies to improve their offerings to help offset lower foot traffic; AutoZone began offering free curbside pickup starting on March 24. There's no question that COVID-19 will cause significant economic impact , and the outbreak adds immense uncertainty in the near term. But for these auto retailers, as long as they can handle the near-term speed bump and improve their liquidity, the medium- and long-term business should be boosted with rising vehicle age and a bounce back in discretionary and work-related miles driven.Take these large swings in stock price with a grain of salt as the broader markets will react to both good and bad news, often with no direct company news.

The stimulus agreement set the stage for the  and  to log solid gains throughout most of Wednesday, adding to Tuesday's surge, before giving back some gains near the end of the trading session. Rebounding stocks included a group of auto parts retailers. They are a part of the broader automotive industry that has been brutally sold off thanks to plants shutting down, less discretionary miles traveled, and a likely big decline in global vehicle sales as uncertainty makes consumers a little more cautious about big-ticket purchases. More specifically, fewer Americans on the road thanks to social distancing and/or quarantining means less demand for a supplier such as LKQ, which sells parts to collision shops and mechanics.\u00a0  noted in its recent quarterly report that COVID-19 could negatively affect not only demand for its products, but also store hours and workforce availability. And it could magnify the risks with its global sourcing of merchandise, not a good recipe for investors or businesses. Image source: Getty Images.The good news, in addition to the broader stimulus deal, is that these companies could possibly boost their cash position similar to Advance Auto Parts, which announced it is borrowing $500 million under an existing $1 billion credit agreement. These stocks are rebounding temporarily thanks to the stimulus bill, but how will these companies rebound in the months ahead? Savvy investors likely know that Advance Auto Parts, O'Reilly, and AutoZone all tend to perform well during downturns and/or recessions. That's because consumers looking to save a buck during hard times turn to do-it-yourself solutions, which increases foot traffic at aftermarket auto retailers. Downturns also mean that consumers put off big-ticket purchases and the average age of vehicles rises, which spurs demand for replacement parts.But investors have to consider that these retailers might react differently this time. One reason the stocks could trade differently is because COVID-19 is forcing many consumers to purchase only necessities, which will cause  to suffer until the outbreak is under control. And if the economy snaps back, consumers may not need to save a buck with do-it-yourself options in the near term, although a strong economy would still be a positive for these auto parts retailers.There's still plenty of uncertainty surrounding the outbreak and its economic damage, and it will get worse before it gets better.

Gutman writes, \u201cDIY Auto has long behaved counter-cyclically as a weak economy depresses new car sales, which results in an aging of the car fleet and period of outsized same store sales.\u201dGutman believes ORLY is due for better times, noting, \"We view ORLY as a best-in-class operator in a fundamentally healthy sub-sector of Retail.

The company has responded to the COVID-19 epidemic in a clever way \u2013 by announcing a \u2018full mobilization\u2019 of services for cleaning and disinfecting both homes and offices.The company\u2019s stock has underperformed in the recent market slide, and is down 33% year-to-date. And these losses come after SERV finished up 2019 with some mixed numbers for Q4. The quarterly results, reported in early March, saw revenues just miss the forecast, although the $507 million reported was up 11% YoY. EPS edged just over the estimates, and grew 16% year-over-year. The year-over-year growth didn\u2019t boost the stock, as SERV shares are down 22.5% over the past year, which compares poorly to the 11.8% loss among its industry peers., covering SERV for Morgan Stanley, sees the company with a clear path to weather the current storms. Kaplan writes, \u201cWe view SERV as somewhat hedged to the ongoing pandemic, as 80% of revenue is recurring, residential customers still have a need for pest control services, and commercial customers \u2026 will also have a need to keep facilities serviced for when workers return\u2026 We think SERV is well positioned for the immediate fallout from COVID-19, and the potential upcoming economic recession.\u201dKaplan upgrades SERV shares from Neutral to Buy, and sets a $35 price target that shows confidence in a robust 36% upside potential. (To watch Kaplan\u2019s track record, )Overall, ServiceMaster\u2019s Moderate Buy analyst consensus rating is based on an even split among the stock\u2019s reviews: 3 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell. The stock sells for an affordable $26.15, a low entry point that helps to mitigate forward risk. The average price target, $36.43, shows the possible reward: a 42% upside potential for the next 12 months. () UDR is a real estate investment trust, focused on the residential apartment sector. The company is among the largest apartment owners in the US, and operations brought in over $1.15 billion in revenue for 2019. The company\u2019s earnings were strong enough that management increased the dividend, with the new quarterly payment of 36 cents taking effect this month.UDR\u2019s dividend deserves note. The annualized payment, $1.44, gives a yield of 4.1%, on the low end for an REIT, but still more than double the average dividend found on the S&P 500. The company also has an 11-year history of reliably keeping up the payments.However, as Morgan Stanley analyst  points out, apartment-based residential REITs are more likely to take a cyclical hit in a recession. As job losses grow, more people will have trouble paying their rent \u2013 and with apartment dwellers more likely both to fit the demographic profile of those facing layoffs, and less likely to possess adequate savings to see them through a time of dearth, the apartment-owning REIT\u2019s are primed to see a decline in income.This makes the big question for UDR, Is a recession on the way, or are we looking at a V-shaped recovery?Hill believes that we are looking at a probably recession, along the lines of the one following 9/11, or the 2008 financial crisis. With that in mind, he has downgraded his stance on UDR shares, rating the stock a Sell. His price target, $33, suggests a likely downside of 7% this year. (To watch Hill\u2019s track record, )Backing his stance, Hill writes, \u201cUDR has the most downside risk in our FCF yield analysis, as we think their strengths (portfolio diversity, NextGen operating platform, predictive analytics, and capital allocation) are already reflective in the price\u2026 we see the risks skewed to the downside if job growth slows in the Company\u2019s West Coast-focused markets.\u201dAll in all, UDR shares have received 5 Holds and 1 Sell rating in recent weeks, making the analyst consensus view here a Hold. The stock sells for $35.39, and at $45.17 the average price target still shows a 27% upside potential for the year.

That's right -- they\u00a0think these 10\u00a0stocks are even better buys.At this time, I'd like to introduce Greg Johnson.  -- Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts fourth-quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning are Jeff Shaw, our chief operating officer and co-president; and Tom McFall, our chief financial officer. David O'Reilly, our executive chairman; and Greg Henslee, our executive vice chairman, are also present.To begin today's call, I would like to congratulate all of our team members on their solid results in 2019. As a result of your commitment to our dual market strategy and the O'Reilly culture values, we generated full-year comparable store sales growth of 4%. In a difficult macro environment of rising selling prices, rising acquisition costs and rising expenses, your focus on profitable growth while maintaining expense control resulted in full-year sales growth of 6.4% and an increase in operating profit of 5.8%. For 2019, we generated our 27th consecutive year of comparable store sales growth, record revenue, and operating income every year since becoming a public company in 1993.And I'd like to thank Team O'Reilly for your many contributions to support our growth and success in 2019. Before I get into the results, I would like to call out our press release from August 20, announcing we entered into an agreement to purchase Mayasa Auto Parts headquartered in Guadalajara, Mexico. And report to you that the transaction has closed and Mayasa became a part of Team O'Reilly at the end of November. Mayasa is an amazing family run business, founded over 65 years ago and has a very similar history and culture to O'Reilly.They currently operate 21 Orma branded auto part stores and supply over 2,000 jobbers through their six distribution centers. Because of their current mix of business, they run at a lower margin than the O'Reilly U.S. stores, so they are slightly diluted to our operating metrics in the fourth quarter but did not have a material impact on our earnings per share results for the year. 2020 will be a learning and planning year as we work with the experienced Mayasa leadership team to develop our future expansion plans, and as a result, our Mexico operations will be dilutive to our operating metrics in 2020, but will not have a material impact on our earnings per share.That said, we're very excited about the addition of the 1,100-plus Mayasa team members, and we have a great opportunity to grow our footprint in Mexico over time. Now, we'll cover our fourth-quarter results and key expectations supporting our 2020 guidance. Our comparable store sales for the fourth quarter grew at 4.4%, which was in line with our expectations as both DIY and professional contributed strongly to our comparable store sales growth with professional continuing to outperform DIY. From a comp store sales progression standpoint, sales of our key undercar categories remain strong all quarter, in line with the trends we saw throughout 2019.However, the lack of winter weather in most of our markets in December resulted in below expected levels of sales for cold weather categories. This marks the second year in a row that December sales have been below our expectation. Now, we'll move on to the impact of inflation on our 2019 results, how we anticipate it will affect 2020 and the other drivers of sales we expect in 2020. For the fourth quarter, same SKU inflation was at 3.5% for the full year -- I'm sorry, it was a 3.5%.And for the full year, inflation was 3%, which was above our beginning of the year estimate of 2% as additional rounds of tariff increases went into effect. This higher-than-expected rate of inflation didn't affect our comparable traffic, which came in slightly above our expectations, but it did have a marked effect on the composition of our average ticket. Because of the increasing complexity of replacement parts on newer, more advanced vehicles, we historically have seen robust growth in our base average ticket without the benefit of same SKU inflation. In 2019, we experienced meaningful same SKU inflation and some consumers reacted by buying down the value spectrum and consciously limiting the number of items per ticket, resulting in a lower-than-expected growth in the base average ticket.The combination of higher-than-expected same SKU inflation and lower base ticket growth resulted in total average ticket growth slightly below our expectations. For 2020, we expect same SKU inflation to be 1% as we annualize last year's price increases and are not planning for changes in the current tariff structure. With the lower year-over-year selling price increases, we expect traffic count to improve and average ticket to remain a steady contributor to comps as the diminishing tailwind from same SKU inflation is mitigated by a return of the base underlying growth in average ticket to a more historical growth rate. Historically, we focused on growing our per store inventory slower than comparable store sales we generate.We're going to change that for 2020. Ongoing SKU proliferation and the inflation related to increases to acquisition costs, we feel we have an opportunity to improve our store-level inventory position and build upon our industry-leading parts availability. In addition to the growth in inventory we would normally see in 2020 from new stores and product additions, we'll be adding through the course of the year just over $100 million of additional inventory to our store and hub network. And from past experience, we know this will enhance the service we provide to our customers and drive sales.From a macro perspective, we anticipate that the demand drivers for the automotive aftermarket industry will remain solid as the robust SAAR years beginning after the great recession, continue to roll into our more addressable market and miles driven continues to grow at a moderate pace, supported by continued record high levels of employment and stable gas prices. Based on our team's ability to provide industry-leading customer service and gain market share and the impact of inflation, our inventory initiatives and the overall outlook for the aftermarket, we are establishing our full-year comparable store sales guidance at 3% to 5%. Our current business trends thus far in the first quarter continue to reflect solid growth in our core undercar and underhood categories. However, the lack of cold weather has been a significant drag on seasonal sales.So, at this point in the quarter, we're behind where we would like to be. As a result, we are establishing our first-quarter comparable sales guidance at 2% to 4%. For the fourth quarter, gross margin was 53.3% of sales which was lower than expected due to the acquisition of Mayasa and lower-than-expected sales of cold weather categories. For the full year, gross margin came in at 53.1%, which was toward the top end of our guidance range.As we discussed on last quarter's conference call, our gross margin benefited from sell-through of on-hand inventory that was purchased prior to tariff-driven acquisition price increases, which have gone into effect in stages, starting in the second half of 2018 and continuing throughout 2019 and the corresponding retail and wholesale price increases. During the past month, several of our key categories have received partial tariff exceptions. This will reduce the level of benefit we had expected to see in the first half of the year as we sell through the own merchandise. However, the reduction of replenishment acquisition costs will benefit us throughout the year as we anticipate current higher selling prices will remain in effect as we and others in our industry maintain rational pricing in the face of continued SG&A pressures.In aggregate, for 2020, we expect our gross margin to be in the range of 52.5% to 53%, with the year-over-year decrease due to dilution from Mayasa and less tailwind for merchandise purchase before the tariff-related acquisition cost increases. Operating profit for the fourth quarter came in at 17.8% of sales, which is below expectations based on how we expected gross margins on a weak cold weather sales pressure on SG&A, which Jeff will discuss and dilution from Mayasa. For the full year, operating profit was 18.9%, which was slightly below the midpoint of our guidance due to the shortfall in the fourth quarter. For 2020, we expect operating profit to be in the range of 18.4% to 18.9%.The decline from prior year is due to lower gross margin, as I discussed, pressure on SG&A, which, again, Jeff will discuss and the dilution from Mayasa. For the fourth quarter, earnings per share of $4.25 represented an increase of 14% as the shortfall in operating profit was more than offset by a lower tax rate, which Tom will cover in his comments. For the full year, earnings per share were $17.88, which represents an 11% increase over 2019. For the first quarter of 2020, we are establishing earnings per share guidance of $4.37 to $4.47, and for the year, our guidance is $19.03 to $19.13.Our quarterly and full-year guidance includes an estimate for the excess benefit from stock options and the impact of shares repurchased through this call but does not include any additional share repurchases. Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I'd like to briefly discuss our recent leadership conference. Two weeks ago, in Dallas, we held our annual leadership conference attended by each of our store managers, sales team members, field management and distribution management, totaling over 7,000 O'Reilly team members in the hall. The theme of this year's conference was every customer counts, and we spent a lot of time talking about focusing on the fundamentals even more, rolling up our sleeves and outhustling and out-servicing the competition.Team O'Reilly left Dallas extremely motivated, and I'm very confident in our team's ability to provide excellent customer service and gain market share in 2020 and beyond. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Shaw. Jeff? -- Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I'd also like to thank Team O'Reilly for delivering another record-breaking year. Your hard work and commitment to excellent customer service has always been the strength of our company and will continue to be our strength in the future. As Greg mentioned earlier, our SG&A for the fourth quarter came in higher than expected, with average per store SG&A growing 4.7%.The primary driver of these unexpectedly high results was nickel cost, with claims coming in much higher than expected. Also contributing to the above expected SG&A was store payroll where we continue to see ongoing pressure from near-full employment and statutory increases to minimum wages. For the full year, per-store SG&A increased 3.4%, which exceeded our beginning of the year guidance at 2.5% to 3%. The main drivers that took us above our guidance were wage pressures from near-full employment, delays in new store openings earlier in the year, health benefit cost, cost of insurance, primarily auto-related, and a larger-than-expected charge for deferred compensation, although the offsetting benefit for that item shows up in other income.Looking forward to 2020, we expect SG&A per store to grow in the range of 2.3% to 2.8%, which is above our historic run rate of 1.5% to 2%. We will be above our historic rate due to continued pressure on wages, continued pressure on the cost to cover our large vehicle fleet and ongoing technology investments, offset in part by the expectation that we will return to a more normal run rate for health benefit cost. Our capital expenditures for the year were $628 million, which was at the bottom end of our full-year guidance of $625 million to $675 million but substantially higher than the previous three years, which averaged $480 million. We had a very busy year in 2019, opening 200 net new stores, converting 20 acquired Bennett Auto Supply stores to O'Reilly stores, opening a new distribution center in Twinsburg, Ohio during the fourth quarter and developing our other DC projects, including substantial progress on our new Nashville DC, which will open early second quarter of 2020 and our Horn Lake DC, just south of Memphis, which will open in the fourth quarter of 2020.Also, during the fourth quarter, we were able to acquire existing distribution space contiguous to our Springfield, DC and corporate campus. With fewer distribution projects and lower net store additions based on our target of 180 net new stores, we would normally expect our capital expenditures to come down. Now, we are going to again set our capital expenditure guidance at $625 million to $675 million for 2020. A part of the reason for the elevated level are the 2019 projects that roll into 2020.However, the more exciting reasons are the projects we have slated for this year. We have a large number of exciting projects and initiatives, but let me add some color to the more capital-intensive ones, which include, first, converting the hardware that runs our stores. Currently, our store systems run partially on a Linux server and partially on our IBM AS/400. Both pieces of equipment are a single point of failure for our stores.In 2020, we will convert all of our store systems to run on redundant Linux servers, which will eliminate the times the store computer system is down, and the store teams are forced to use paper catalogs and right manual sales tickets. This project also puts pressure on our SG&A as we must fully depreciate all of the store AS/400s by the end of the year. Second, we will aggressively modernize our fleet of semitrucks in 2020. The enhanced safety features, improved fuel economy and maintenance savings on the project yields a great return on our investment.We're also planning to increase our spend on investments that drive energy savings in our stores. Over the past few years, we have steadily converted our store lighting to LED technology. We've been so pleased with the savings from lower electricity usage and maintenance, combined with the superior image in the stores that we're accelerating this project. Now, one byproduct of this conversion is that the LEDs shine a bright light on some of the wear and tear in our high-volume more core stores.As a result, we will be remodeling more store interiors this year than is typical in our capital plan. As I mentioned earlier, ensuring our substantial vehicle fleet continues to put pressure on our SG&A. We continue to have a very good accident rate. However, the cost of each accident continues to grow significantly for all large fleet operators.To better protect the safety of our team members and others while working to minimize our losses, we're testing a variety of crash equipment and monitoring tools to improve the accident rate of our store-based fleet, and those projects are included in our capex plan for 2020. The last item I'll mention is our omnichannel efforts. We will continue to invest heavily in enhancing our omnichannel capabilities to meet our customers on their terms with solutions that meet their specific needs, whether they visit us to work, call, or click. This initiative puts pressure on our expenses, as well as our capital expenditures.As Greg mentioned earlier, 2020 will be a learn and plan year as it relates to Mayasa, so we don't expect a meaningful capital spend this year, but that will change in future years. We have always geared our business model to generate long-term sustainable growth that is solidly profitable. We're very confident our SG&A spend, our additional inventory investment and our capital investments in 2020 will put us in a great position to continue our history of success. However, we're an extremely proactive and detail-orient company, and should situations change or additional opportunities arise, we will make changes to our investment strategy on a store-by-store, project-by-project basis.As I conclude my comments, I'd like to again thank the entire O'Reilly team for a solid year in 2019. And as we preached at the conference and talk about every day, when we focus on the fundamentals of customer service and consistently execute our business model, Team O'Reilly truly makes every customer count. And I'm confident our team will do that again in 2020. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom. -- Thanks, Jeff. Now we'll take a closer look at our quarterly results and our guidance for 2020. For the quarter, sales increased to $168 million, comprised of $100 million increase in comp store sales, a $58 million increase in non-comp store sales and a $10 million increase in non-comp, non-store sales. For 2020, we expect our total revenues to be between $10.7 billion and $11 billion.Our fourth-quarter effective tax rate was 20.6% of pre-tax income, which was lower than expected based on a larger-than-expected benefit from share-based compensation, and was comprised of a base rate of 23.8%, reduced by a 3.2% benefit for share-based compensation. This compares to the fourth quarter of 2018 rate of 23.6% of pre-tax income, which was comprised of a base tax rate of 24%, reduced by 0.4% benefit for share-based compensation. For the full year, our effective tax rate was 22.3% of pre-tax income, comprised of a base rate of 23.8%, reduced by 1.5% benefit for share-based compensation. For the full year of 2020, we expect an effective tax rate of 23.2%, comprised of a base rate of 23.6% reduced by a benefit of 0.4% for share-based compensation.We expect the first- and fourth-quarter rates to be lower than the second and third due to solar tax credits in the first and tolling of certain tax periods in the fourth. Also, variations in the tax benefit from share-based compensation will create fluctuations in our quarterly tax rate as a percent of pre-tax income. Now, let me add some color to our free cash flow and the components that drove our results for the year and our expectations for 2020. Free cash flow for 2019 was $1 billion, which was $170 million decrease from the prior year.The decrease was driven by higher net inventory investment, cash taxes and capital expenditures, offset in part by increased operating profit. In 2020, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, with the year-over-year increase due to increased operating profit and lower cash taxes, offset in part by higher investments in capital expenditures. Inventory per store for the U.S. stores only at the end of the quarter was $631,000, which was a 3.1% increase from the end of 2018.The increase above our expected range of 2% to 2.5% was due to acquisition price increases and slow December sales. As Greg mentioned earlier, we're going to make additional inventory investments in 2020 and expect our per store inventory to grow 5%. Our AP-to-inventory ratio for our U.S.-based business at the end of the fourth quarter was 104.6%, which was below our expectations and below the 105.7% where we ended 2018. For 2020, we expect slightly more and finish the year at 104% based on the inventory initiatives Greg discussed.Moving on to debt, we finished the fourth quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.34 times as compared to our ratio of 2.23 times at the end of 2018. The increase in our leverage ratio reflects our May bond issuance and borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility. We're below our stated leverage target of 2.5 times, and we'll approach that number when appropriate. We continue to execute our share repurchase program, and for 2019, we repurchased 3.9 million shares at an average share price of $369.55 for a total investment of $1.4 billion.Subsequent to the end of the year during the date of our press release, we repurchased 0.2 million shares at an average price of $428.29. We remain very confident that the average repurchase price is supported by expected discounted future cash flows of our business, and we continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning excess capital to our shareholders. Finally, before I open up our call to your questions, I'd like to thank the O'Reilly team for their dedication to the company and our customers. This concludes our prepared comments.And at this time, I'd like to ask Zenara, the operator, to return to the line, and we'll be happy to answer your questions.Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Baker from Nomura. Please go ahead. Your line is open. -- Hi, thanks. I just wanted to ask a follow-up on the gross margin outlook. You said one of the reasons why it won't be as strong is due to some tariff relief, which, I guess, means that that won't lead to as good of gross margin because you don't expect to be able to increase retail prices as much. Is that right? And then as part of that, you go on to say that you still expect a benefit from lower acquisition costs throughout the year, so I'm just trying to square those two.Is it that you expect the benefit, but it just might not be as big of a benefit as you had previously thought? I'll start there. -- Sure. Mike, this is Tom. So, two pieces to that question. So, first, we expect to see a LIFO benefit mainly in the first half of the year.Our LIFO calculation is a total pool. So, as these costs of acquisitions come in, they immediately reduce the total pool. So, that's the first part of the question. The second is these lower acquisition costs on these specific product lines is as the sale prices remain high will generate more gross margin.So, we'll gain that initial charge back over the turn of the good, which is why we'll see in the second half of the year, more benefit than less benefit in the first half. -- OK. And one quick follow-up. If not for the Mayasa acquisition, would the gross margins still be down? I guess we're trying to figure out how much of an impact that is. I think you said slight.So, just trying to figure, I guess, how slight. -- So, we discussed this on last quarter's conference call that the lower benefit from products purchased before the tariffs would abate during 2020, and we'll see that in the second half. We didn't quantify the amount, but that's the main driver that -- combined with Mayasa are the drivers for a lower gross margin. -- OK. Thanks for the color.Thank you. Our next question comes from Greg Badishkanian from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open. -- Hey, guys. Good morning. David Bellinger on for Greg. So, I just want to follow-up on the improving traffic of late.Can you give us some more color on the DIY side of the business? Was that still negative in Q4 in terms of traffic? What are the underlying drivers here? As you mentioned, some improvement baked into the 2020 guidance in terms of traffic. Are you expecting that to build throughout the year? Or should we see from you any type of competitive pricing actions on your part to try to help drive that improvement? -- Yes. So, the first part of your question, what was the makeup of traffic. What I would tell you is that traffic for the second quarter in a row, overall was positive. The cash traffic was slightly negative, which was more than offset by the charge traffic.Tom, do you want to take the... -- Yes. Our expectation for 2020 is that as we anniversary the pressure on DIY ticket count, which those customers are more susceptible to rising prices, as we annualize those price increases and annualize the pressure on the ticket count, that we will see growth in that ticket count. -- Got it. OK. -- And then a negative swinging to slightly positive. And your answer is, yes, it should improve over the years, we anniversary more of the tariff-related price increases. -- Understood. And then my follow-up, a bit more near term in nature for Q1 the guidance there. You're up against your easiest comparison of the year. We're still looking for comps in that 2% to 4% range.So, is that all weather-related? Are you currently within that range now, or is there some acceleration embedded in the back half of the quarter? -- What I would tell you is, obviously, first quarter is always a volatile quarter for us that can be significantly impacted by weather. We're very early in the quarter. There's a lot of the quarter remaining. The drivers, the fundamental drivers of the categories are performing well.When you look at the undercar, underhood categories, we're pleased with how we're performing there. We're really missing on the weather-related categories because of the atypical weather that we've had thus far in the quarter. -- The thing that I would add to that is as we move through the quarter, and it starts to warm up, south to north, those drivers of our business, historically, the weather-related categories become less of a portion of our total sales. And January is a low volume month for us, more than two-thirds of the quarter are still in front of us. -- All right. That's very helpful. Thanks, guys, and good luck. -- Thanks. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Liz Suzuki from BoA. Please go ahead. Your line is open. -- Thank you. I was just curious why you think you won't be able to leverage SG&A on a 3% to 5% same-store sales growth number. It just seems like the operating margin outlook is a bit lighter than what we were modeling. And I get that there's going to be some dilution from Mayasa, although it seems like it's such a small business that maybe I'm surprised that it's been called out as such a margin headwind.And then we would have expected that some of your previous investments are starting to lap, and there should be an opportunity to drive more dollars to the bottom line. So, I was just hoping you could break out some of that operating margin pressure. -- This is Tom. let me start, and I'll turn it over to Jeff. When we look at our SG&A, we're continuing to see benefits as we lap these inflationary price increases. As a small unit, especially retail, our No.1 expense is payroll. And that continues to be an area where both low unemployment and statutory rates continue to push that number up. So, in Jeff's comments, we talked about the fact that SG&A would be above our historic norms. We do continue to see efficiencies, but it's being offset by those pressures, and we continue to invest heavily in our technology, and that continues to pressure SG&A as it has over the last few years. -- Well, I would just add that we always -- you have to pay what the market bears. And there's a lot of pressure on wages and has been for a couple of years, also with the statutory minimum wage increases. But we always do our best to leverage that by trying to increase team member productivity through additional team member training, additional technology, which is why we're investing in the technology initiatives. -- OK, great. And just on Mayasa, I mean, is there, perhaps, some conservatism in these estimates, just accounting for unknown factors, given that this is your first venture abroad? And maybe you're trying to bake in a certain level of conservatism there just to account for the fact that it's a new venture for you. -- So, when we look at Mayasa, it's relatively small in comparison. And when we look at this acquisition, it's really about developing a footprint that we can expand. So, we will be in there working on buying synergies and cost synergies that you would expect, but we'll also be investing to build the team and the processes to build a much larger organization. So, we're going to add expenses to accelerate our ability to grow out there. -- All right, great. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. -- Hey, good morning, guys. -- Good morning. -- Talk a little bit more about the tariff exceptions you mentioned in some key categories. I guess is that something that you could expect to receive rebates from past tariffs paid? -- Yes. So, Brett, we really got three primary categories that we've seen some exception in, and it's not across the board. For example, rotors has an exception, but the exception is only on a certain diameter or circumference rotor. So, the larger rotors didn't get the exception, the smaller rotors did.Most of the exceptions that have been granted are retroactive, and we would expect to get the tariffs paid to date back as well. -- OK. Any sort of sizing of those? -- No. We really don't have anything we want to disclose there, Bret. -- All right. And then a question on the inventory expansion adding $100 million-plus. Is that existing coverage of the inventory you currently carry, or are you going to be expanding branded or private label SKUs to sort of new pieces of the parts mix? -- Yes. So, here's kind of what we're doing. We've been successful for years with our inventory deployment strategy and the strength of our supply chain is one of our greatest strengths. Markets continue to change.The marketplace continues to change, and we're trying to make sure that we're adapting accordingly. We're not changing anything related to depth or breadth of inventory in our distribution centers. What we're looking at is, as the consumer, especially the professional customer, as their expectations continue to increase on prompt delivery time, in-stock position from all of our stores, even though we replenish our stores daily and they get multiple deliveries in markets where we have a distribution center or through our hub store network where we don't, we're trying to push more individual SKUs down to the spoke store level and the hub store level. So, what we're doing is adding not depth but more so breadth of SKUs at our hub-and-spoke stores, and it's not specific to private label or national brands.It's just trying to get more inventory out there available to drive sales. -- Bret, this is Tom. I'd like to add something to the first question on tariff exceptions. I'd highlight to yourself and others on the call that we work very hard at making sure that we didn't take the full tariff increases through looking at the currency, through other sourcing, through sharing those increases with our suppliers. So, the aggregate price increases were quite a bit less than the actual headline tariff number. -- Great, great. Yes, sure. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question is from Daniel Imbro from Stephens. Please go ahead. Your line is open. -- Thanks. Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to start on the comp outlook.Understanding you guys have talked about a few initiatives today, and obviously, traffic getting better through the year seems to be implied. But the full-year guide seems to imply an acceleration on the two-year stack as we move through the year as comparisons get tougher. Could you just maybe help us think through the buckets in more detail? Is that an assumed sales uplift from remodels? Is that just the traffic getting better? Can you talk about what gives you confidence that the two-year stack should improve as we move through the year? -- Yes. I'll start that and then let Tom add on. I think it's a combination of everything you said there. I mean, I think the appearance will help, the store appearance package changes will help.I think the inventory availability initiatives we have under way will help. I think all the things that we're talking about from a capex perspective that would help drive sales is going to help our comps for the year in our two-year stack. As I said earlier, we're not overly disappointed with how we're performing in our key categories undercar, underhood categories that you expect to sell throughout the year. The softness in the first quarter is primarily related to those seasonal items.It's the batteries. It's the wiper blades. It's the categories, antifreeze and washer fluids, the things that you sell during the winter when you have extremely cold weather that causes breakage in wear and tear. And we just haven't seen that thus far in the year.Again, it's very early in the year. And then there's still an opportunity to have a lot of cold weather in the remaining weeks of February, and we certainly hope we do, and sales for those categories pick up. But we're optimistic about the categories that drive our business day in and day out from an underhood, undercar perspective. -- To add to Greg's comments, we finished 2019 with a 7.8% two-year stack. And at the midpoint of our guidance, at the end of 2020, we would get 8%. So, what we would say is that we expect the underlying dynamics of the automotive aftermarket and our execution of our business model will remain robust and will be consistent. Now, we expect to see some improvement in traffic, less inflation, but a different composition of our average ticket.So, we would view our outlook for 2020 to continue to be solid based on those trends. -- That's helpful. And then as a follow-up to an earlier question, on the expense side, I think we get that payroll is a pressure, but I thought your commentary in the prepared remarks was that the industry was remaining rational and that you were passing through some of that SG&A pressure through higher prices. Are you just seeing an inability to pass-through that level of inflation to offset the SG&A pressure, or can you help us understand the moving pieces there a little bit more? Thanks. -- So, we do continue to pass on prices, although we would tell you right now our view for 2020 is they'll remain static and the benefit will be from pre-anniversary of price increases that went on. When we look at those SG&A pressures, our opportunity, I think, is less on the pricing side, more on returning to normal growth in our base average ticket and improving customer counts. But we, as Jeff talked about, need to make sure that we're staffing our stores appropriately at market rates. And we have a very technical workforce that makes all the difference at the store level. -- Got it. Thanks. Best of luck guys.Thank you. Our next question comes from Zack Fadem from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. -- Hey, good morning. With the warmer start to January, we're hearing a lot of comparisons to 2017. Hoping you can walk us through some of the differences today versus three years ago, why you think the setup this time around could be different, particularly from a non-weather perspective. -- Yes. Zac, if you think back to 2017, some of the things that we called out in 2017 are not applicable or less applicable today than they were then. 2017, we called out not only weather, but we also called out where we were with the SAAR years of vehicle, vehicle populations that were entering our market, the aftermarket post warranty, and we talked about Hispanic hibernation, post election, some of those things. And when you look back at the average age of vehicles today that are coming out of the great recession, you're well into the years that are better for our industry even than they were two years ago.So, I would say that those are some of the differences. -- Got it. That's helpful. And then just to put the Mexico P&L impact to rest, could you walk through your expectation for top-line impact? And then just to confirm the margin pressure, sounds like it's roughly half Mexico, half core business. Could you just confirm that that's right and maybe walk us through the moving parts there? -- As we have with other smaller acquisitions, we're not going to break out the economics of that acquisition. I think the key thing to know about the Mexican business is that the vast majority of their business, they are only run at 21 stores, and most of their business is independent jobber business and that has a different operating metric profile than company-owned stores. What you're going to see is you're going to share the gross margin with the independent jobber store you're selling to, so significantly lower gross margin, but you're also not bearing the expenses at the store level, so a lower SG&A. -- OK, got it. I appreciate the time. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Kate McShane from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. -- Hi. This is Chandni Luthra on behalf of Kate McShane. I guess my first question is, so you guys gave a 1% same SKU inflation expectation for 2020. But how does that vary from 1Q where you've guided a 2% to 4% comp versus say, into 3% and 5% regime into the back half of the year? Just trying to assess where the same SKU inflation more in the first half of the year.Or how does that vary? -- Definitely more in the first half of the year, very little or much less in the third quarter, and virtually none in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter of this year, we were slightly higher than we expected, and that was on base commodities. -- And I would say the guide was more so based on weather-related demand and the impact of inflation between the first quarter and the remaining three quarters. -- Got it. That's very helpful. And if I could get a follow-up question on your supply chain. So, obviously, a lot of retailers have been talking about coronavirus.Just trying to assess, are you seeing any impact on your supply chain from that part of the world? -- Not yet. One of the differences in us and a lot of our competitors in the industry is we all bring a lot of product in from China. That's no secret. The timing of this coronavirus kind of correlated with Chinese New Year, so we had already all product in advance, planning for the shutdown from Chinese New Year.One of the advantages that we have is there's not a lot of product that has a demand cycle that warrants bringing it from China directly into our individual DCs. So rather we negotiate with our suppliers to keep a number of days of inventory on hand in their distribution facilities within the U.S. So, we've got built up inventory within the U.S. that will keep us for probably two to three months that before we would see the impact from product coming from China. -- Great. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Leary from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. -- Hey, guys. This is Jake Moser on for Chris. So, first, could you just talk a little bit more about the health benefit expense in the quarter? I think you said it would normalize as the year goes on. So, is this like a one-time true-up? Or if not, like what drove such a large one-time expense? -- So, we're fully self-insured for health benefits. And they have not a very long time from initial claim to when you know the full extent of the claim, particularly about six months. So, what we saw was our third quarter mature in a way that was much higher than we thought, and fourth quarter come in a lot higher. But health benefits have a fluctuation, and we've had good years and good quarters, and we've had rougher years and rougher quarters.And some of it is just statistics and odds. What we looked at was a few really big claims and more medium to larger claims than we'd expect. Impossible to predict fully, but we would expect this to be more of an outlier and expect 2020 to follow more historical medical trends for our population. -- Got you. And then secondly, can you just talk about the timing of the 2020 DC openings? And is there anything we should be thinking about in terms of cost pressures or comp lift as these are built out and opened? -- Jeff, do you want to take that? -- As far as timing, the 11 in DC will roll in the second quarter. And then the Horn Lake or Memphis DC will roll in, in the last quarter of the year. From a cost perspective, we would expect to feel some cost pressures. Distribution is included in our gross margin, but it's not a huge number, which is why we didn't call it out separately. -- All right. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lasser from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. -- Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. In the past, the aftermarket has seen a prolonged impact from the lack of cold weather particularly in the spring from the lack of corrosive material that's put on the road and from path holes. It seems like looking at your guidance, you're assuming that that won't be the case this year.Why would this year be different? And as part of that question, as you do look at your full-year comp guidance, do you see more risk in the front half of the year from the weather or in the back half of the year from the lack of tariff-related inflation? -- Yes. Mike, I'll take the first part of that, and then let Tom talk about the first half versus back half of the year. As I said earlier, our softness has been more in weather-related categories. And the fact that our sales have remained strong on those typical wear and tear categories, such as undercar steering, chassis, things like that.Through the first few weeks of the year and the tail end of 2019, that gives us confidence that those repairs and those hard part categories will still perform well for us. -- So, to take out the rest of the question, Michael. As we get near the end of the season, people will defer true seasonal purchases whether that's air conditioning season or, in this case, cold weather. We'd expect the rest of the winter to be normal. Precipitation is really what creates the rough road.So, we'd expect that to be normal, and that hasn't been as different. If you remember last year, we had the polar vortex, which that cold weather really drives the seasonal. So, between that and a better vehicle dynamic as opposed to 2017, where we were going to get the harder vehicle dynamic gives us confidence. And as Greg said, our underlying core categories have been good.As far as the risk to comps throughout the year, what we would tell you is that we're not in an underserved market. We need to continue to go out and execute better than our competitors and grow our market share every day, whether it's the first quarter or the fourth quarter, and it will be the same next year. When we look at our comps, and we continue to perform very consistently. A lot of it driven by the vehicle dynamics by reasonable gas prices by high levels of employment, and we expect that to continue throughout the year.So, our expectations for comps will be relatively consistent in the second, third and fourth quarter, first quarter or by January lack of cold weather categories. -- And your gross margin guidance for this year has caused a lot of conversation and debate. Should we expect that once you get past this inventory accounting dynamic that your gross margin should be stable to growing over the long term? -- Well, what we would tell you is that our focus is on comp gross margin dollars. And as we saw this year with same SKU inflation, we're able to generate more comp gross margin dollars at a similar rate. So, we always try to improve our acquisition costs and the efficiency of our distribution and squeeze out those costs to drive better gross margins. So, our expectation is that it will be stable to slightly growing. -- Thank you very much.Thank you. Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman for Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. -- Hi. This is Josh Kamboj for Simeon. It sounds like a larger than usual number of store and technology projects are coming to fruition this year. Combined with the increase in the DC openings in the recent Mayasa acquisition, it looks like there is a greater sense of urgency around investing than in the recent past.Is that a fair assumption? And if so, can you talk about what might be driving that and potential areas of mis-execution that you might be monitoring especially closely? -- Yes. I mean, you can break it down by categories and some categories, there's a greater sense of urgency, some have just been ongoing initiatives. An example of a greater sense of urgency would be the replacement of our store point-of-sale systems. Over the past year, we've been working on making our systems more stable in our stores, and that entails both making sure our communication networks are redundant and dependable, as well as making sure the systems themselves have high availability.And when you look at a dated platform, like the AS/400, when those machines fail, it takes some time to come back up. Jeff's comments in his prepared statements, that creates downtime for the stores and creates manual processes, which doesn't result in a very favorable customer experience. So, that's a big spend for us. It's a big lift.It's something we've been working on for a few months now, and we fully expect to roll those out by the end of the year. Some of the other investments, they just have the right return, and there are things we need to do. We've seen savings in our utility expense in 2019 as a result of the LED lighting initiatives in our stores and our DCs, and we're extending that, both from an appearance standpoint, which should help with sales, as well as the financial return. Another example of an initiative with a high ROI is our delivery fleet, our DOT fleet.That's going to do several things for us. Our fleet is an aging fleet. We always depreciated our trucks over an extended period of time. And over the years, those trucks have become much more efficient.So, by replacing a significant portion of our trucks this year, it does several things for us. One, it reduces our maintenance costs because it's new equipment. Two, it should help with our driver hiring and retention because it's new equipment, drivers like to drive new equipment. There are many drivers out there that are not certified to drive trucks with manual transmissions.All of our new trucks will have automatic transmissions, which opens up the applicant pool significantly and also that allows us to have more collision avoidance on our trucks and more technology in our trucks. So, it's a combination of all the above. Some of it, it's based on ROI, some of it's based on driving sales. And some of it, it's just out of necessity like the computer system replacements in our stores. -- Thank you. And then your Q4 comps were obviously pretty healthy and better than many were expecting. Did you see evidence that you gained significant share in the quarter, perhaps, or was it more a function of maybe your store footprint? And then just related to that, can you talk about some specific factors you might have assessed and embedded in your 2020 guide, for example, the extra day because of the leap year, potential sales risks in 2H around the election, anything like that to be aware of? -- Joe, on the comp question on for leap day, we don't include that in our comps. So, that day just becomes a non-comp day. When we look at around the election, our expectation is that we won't see significant disruption around the election. -- As far as the Q4 comps, I mean, we came out of Q3 pretty strong, and that carried into Q4. Just as Greg mentioned in his prepared comments, it's often pretty widespread in December. As far as taking market share, I mean, it's always our goal to be the dominant supplier in every market we operate in. And that's what we focus on fundamentally in all of our stores across the country every day is just the fundamental execution and top-notch customer service, trying to build relationships with all the customers in the market, both retail and professional. -- And that's it. Thank you very much.Thank you. We have reached our allotted time for questions. I'll now turn the call back over to Mr. Greg Johnson for closing remarks. -- Thank you, Zenara. We'd like to conclude our call today by thanking the entire O'Reilly team for our solid fourth-quarter and full-year 2019 results.

There was no major news out on these companies, but a combination of analyst downgrades and valuation concerns pushed the sector down as analysts worried about warm winter weather, slowing economic growth, and stretched valuations.According to data from , Advance Auto Parts fell 17.7%, AutoZone lost 11.2%, and Genuine Parts gave up 11.9% during January. The chart below shows the trajectory of each stock during the month. As you can see, the three stocks largely traveled in tandem. data by AutoZone slipped 3.6% over a two-day span starting Jan. 6 after Wedbush downgraded the stock from Outperform to Neutral and analyst Seth Basham lowered his price target from $1,375 to $1,225. He seemed to think the stock was ready for a breather after gaining 40% in 2019, and saw risks from warmer winter weather and tariff-driven inflation.Image source: Getty Images.A week later, Advance Auto Parts, the worst performer of the bunch last month, also got dinged by a downgrade from\u00a0on Jan. 13\u00a0as analyst Christopher Horvers cut his rating on the stock from Overweight to Neutral and lowered his price target from $168 to $163. He said that Advance's primary sales drivers seem to be \"more incrementally negative\" due to issues like warm winter weather, lower inflation and slower GDP growth, factors that weigh on the sector as a whole. Further, Horvers said that Advance's do-it-yourself business, as opposed to do-it-for-me, is already \"on shaky ground,\" which could impede the company's margin growth.\u00a0On the same day, Wedbush removed the stock from its Best Ideas list due to valuation. Advance lost 2.5% that day after a similar loss in the previous session. However, it regained some of those losses after Melvin Capital Management reported a 5.3% stake in the auto parts company on Jan. 14.Finally, on Jan. 23, Advance Auto Parts shares dove again as the stock got another downgrade, this time from Overweight to Neutral by Atlantic Equities. Over the final week of January, the sector stocks slipped as the broader market pulled back over coronavirus concerns, though the auto parts retailers don't have any direct exposure to the outbreak.The weak start to 2020 comes after some auto parts stocks have outperformed in recent years, including AutoZone and\u00a0, both of which were among the  of the last decade. Looking ahead, many of the concerns expressed by the analysts are temporary. While this winter has been warmer on average and largely devoid of major storms that would drive more consumers to make auto repairs, that is not a fundamental issue with any auto parts stock. Meanwhile, concerns about economic growth and the coronavirus will continue to play out in the market, but investors can take comfort in knowing that auto-parts retailers are largely ,  since most people need a working set of wheels to get to their jobs and take care of their daily business no matter the shape of the economy.All three of these stocks will have a chance to turn things around later in February when they report quarterly earnings.

(Symbol: ORLY) saw new options begin trading this week, for the March 20th expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ORLY options chain for the new March 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $430.00 strike price has a current bid of $14.50.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $430.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $415.50 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ORLY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $432.79/share today.\n\nBecause the $430.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.37% return on the cash commitment, or 21.61% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $430.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $440.00 strike price has a current bid of $13.30.  If an investor was to purchase shares of ORLY stock at the current price level of $432.79/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $440.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.74% if the stock gets called away at the March 20th expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ORLY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing ORLY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $440.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $440.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 55%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.07% boost of extra return to the investor, or 19.69% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 26%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 25%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $432.79) to be 21%.

Moreover, both   and  trade at higher multiples. Although  trades at a similar valuation, its shareholders receive a dividend that yields 3% at current prices.The rising stock price and lower valuation may attract investors. However, conditions within both the market and the company itself indicate that AutoZone stock could experience a dramatic reversal.At first glance, one might wonder why AutoZone stock appears unattractive today. After all, it increased by 680% during the 2010s. Its archrival O'Reilly Automotive registered a return of 1,050% over the same period. Nonetheless, AutoZone became one of the .\u00a0IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGESMoreover, Americans tend to keep their cars longer than in the past. The average age of a running vehicle in the U.S. has reached a record of 11.8 years. That means Americans are choosing to repair older cars more often, likely using parts from a store like AutoZone, rather than buying new.\u00a0Furthermore, it operates in a .\u00a0People need a running vehicle in good times and in bad, and they will spend money to keep them running. A recession could also help AutoZone somewhat as fewer people can afford to replace their cars during harder times.However, while a recession may not derail AutoZone stock, some auto industry trends could work against the auto parts retailer. For one, consumers have increasingly turned to electric vehicles. That causes problems for AutoZone and its peers. EVs have markedly fewer moving parts compared to gas-powered vehicles. \u00a0That will mean that vehicles need less periodic maintenance. For AutoZone, that means lower demand for oil filters, fuel pumps, alternators, and the like.Another trend working against AutoZone is demographics. Those between the ages of 18 and 34  and maintenance versus the average American. That bodes well for AutoZone... if this cohort chooses to own cars.Unfortunately for the auto parts retailer, this generation more often chooses ridesharing or public transportation over car ownership. With fewer of them owning cars, many will not have a reason to set foot in an AutoZone store.Further, in past years, auto parts sales enjoyed a  from e-commerce. When cars break down, owners want them running as soon as possible. This discourages long wait times for e-commerce deliveries, and often, price shopping.However,  stoked fear when it quietly  a few years ago. With the online giant now offering one-day delivery with its Prime service, customers can now buy auto parts from Amazon without a long wait. This could cut AutoZone's profits as it adjusts its pricing and e-commerce strategy to compete.Worse, lower profits could expose significant vulnerabilities in AutoZone stock. At first glance, its \u00a0of just above 17.5 seems reasonable, particularly since analysts forecast average annual earnings increase of 10.95% per year\u00a0over the next five years.However, the balance sheet appears more troubling. The stockholders' equity,\u00a0\u00a0the value of the company after paying off debts and expenses,\u00a0\u00a0stands at around -$1.776 billion as of the last quarter.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This has remained negative for years as management has prioritized stock buybacks over balance sheet stability over the last several years. During the previous reported quarter,  $450 million worth of AutoZone stock and had $1.277 billion remaining under the latest share buyback authorization.Should industry and demographic trends wipe out profits, it may have to reissue some of these repurchased shares simply to cover expenses.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such an occurrence could hurt AutoZone stock, which trades at just over $1,120 per share as of the time of this writing. This may explain why this stock trades at a discount to most of its peers. Despite a reasonable P/E ratio and steady profit increases, AutoZone stock is not as stable as it might appear.Although AutoZone stock ran smoothly in the 2010s, the competitive landscape and the financial condition of the company indicate points of weakness. Admittedly, if Americans need fewer auto parts in the next few years, this will hurt both AutoZone and its peers.\u00a0Competition could also hurt AutoZone stock in another way. Due to aggressive stock buybacks, stockholders' equity has long remained negative. Should the company need to raise cash, its financial condition could lead to massive share issuance, significantly harming AutoZone stock.AutoZone enjoyed tremendous success in the 2010s. However, with market conditions changing for the worse, investors need to take profits.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Meanwhile, beverage-can maker   will thrive in a mild recession accompanied by a fall in raw material prices such as aluminum. Life sciences and diagnostics company   could also do well in a recessionary environment where governments decide to support the economy with spending on healthcare.Let's take a look at the investment case for all three.Image source: Getty Images.When a recession occurs and consumers start feeling the pinch, they tend to hold back on making high-ticket purchases of discretionary items like automobiles. Instead, they have a tendency to run existing cars longer, and since older cars tend to need more servicing it means more demand for auto parts -- great news for O'Reilly.Here's a chart showing how light-vehicle sales fall . Moreover, note how the revenue of the largest listed auto parts retailers tends to increase during recessions. data by In a sense, O'Reilly is a kind of stock that can thrive in economic adversity and for that reason alone it's worth consideration for investors worried about a protracted recession. That said, the stock's valuation isn't particularly attractive and there are question marks around the sector's long-term margin outlook given .\u00a0 data by The case for buying Ball Corp rests on the idea that end demand for beverage cans and personal care product containers will hold its own in an economic slowdown. Ball's core end demand is definitely in the consumer staples camp, and there's also the secular trend toward the use of more environmentally friendly aluminum rather than plastics for packaging. In fact, the latter is largely behind CEO John Hayes' belief that the long-term growth rate of beverage-can unit volume will now be closer to 4% rather than the previously assumed 2%.In addition, Ball has customers on multi-year supply contracts -- , , , and are significant customers -- so its competitive positioning is sound.In the last recession, Ball demonstrated that it could grow earnings, as its revenue held up while costs dropped thanks to lower aluminum costs.A lasting recession would obviously hurt Ball Corp -- there's always going to be cyclical element to packaging demand -- but the company can do well in normal recessionary environment.Last year was a great one for the life sciences and diagnostic-focused company Danaher, and 2020 looks like it's starting off in the same vein. The company's growth exceeded its own expectations in 2019 and it continues to churn out mid-single-digit revenue growth.Data source: Danaher.CEO Tom Joyce recently spoke at the J.P.Morgan Healthcare Conference and told investors that the company's fourth-quarter core revenue growth would come in at 5.5% or above -- previous guidance was for just 4.5%. He also predicted that earnings per share (EPS) would come in at or above the high end of the guidance range of $4.74 to $4.77.Moreover, the deal to buy GE's biopharma business . Especially as that business segment appears to be growing faster than Danaher expected at the time the deal was announced. The completion of the acquisition in 2020 will add a complementary and highly cash generative business to Danaher's portfolio.The impressive growth in Danaher's core businesses comes in a year when other industrial companies have felt the chill winds of the trade conflict and declining end demand. It's a fact that speaks to the relatively defensive nature of Danaher's revenue. Indeed, governments may elect to support healthcare research and development in times of economic uncertainty.All told, none of these stocks are particularly cheap right now, but they will add balance to a portfolio that might be overloaded with cyclical names. They can all be bought by investors who are looking for stocks that actually improve earnings growth in a slowdown, rather than just preserve it.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

First of all, although the trade war is easing, it has done some damage to the global economy. According to Moody\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s Analytics, the trade war . Based on present trends, the firm estimates that the job loss tally will reach 450,000 by year\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s end. Meanwhile, China\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s economy has definitely decelerated in the wake of the trade war.Also, when it comes to politics, we\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re in one of the most divisive eras in American history. With a high-stakes election coming up in November, Trump can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t afford to look weak to his core voting base. Thus, further progress on trade with China is unlikely.Investors have an opportunity to go contrarian with recession-resistant services stocks to buy. Although consumers are generally incentivized to curtail spending in a downturn, some service providers are simply indelible. Others help clients save money, which is a necessity in troubled times.So without any more delays, here are my picks for recession-resistant services stocks to buy:\tAt first glance,  (NASDAQ:, NASDAQ:) doesn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t appear an intuitive candidate for recession-resistant services stocks to buy. With its technology-centric business, and one that is increasingly geared toward the cloud, GOOGL stock would seem more vulnerable to volatility under a recession.However, what changes the calculus for GOOGL stock is YouTube. As we all know, recessions are generally unhelpful for discretionary retail names: people simply will shut down unnecessary spending. And in some ways, that applies to services stocks as well. However, Alphabet via YouTube provides a wealth of free information (amid all the other junk).I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll use a personal example. I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m not the most technically inclined for household maintenance work. However, with YouTube, I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ve been able to take care of several basic jobs, allowing me to save hundreds. In a recession, I think this example will be amplified tenfold, making GOOGL stock one of the surprisingly good services stocks to buy.\tYou don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t have to do deep research to understand that auto sales decline sharply in a recession. But if you want the proof, here it is: according to the Federal Reserve\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s economic research arm, the retail automotive sector was one of the hardest hit segments of the economy during the 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent Great Recession.That\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s bad news for automakers. However, it might spell at least a stable revenue channel for  (NYSE:) and AZO stock.Part of the allure of buying a new car is the associated benefits. For instance, many dealerships offer complementary services like oil changes for the first few years of ownership (or lease). But in a recession, such offers won\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t be enough to overcome consumer fears. That plays into the hands of AZO stock and related services stocks to buy.Not only does AutoZone provide an extensive array of parts, their customer service team can help direct you accordingly. Combined with the do-it-yourself information available at YouTube, AZO stock appears a compelling contrarian buy in a recession.\tOne of the difficult aspects about figuring out which services stocks to buy for a recession is the underlying assumption: nobody truly knows what\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s going to happen next. With the markets still relatively elevated, it seems a recovery is possible in the nearer term. But for those who think that, I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099d still recommend looking into  (NASDAQ:) and ORLY stock.While benchmark indices still have their foot in the bull market, the automotive sector is decidedly bearish. Earlier this summer, automotive journal Jalopnik noted that car sales have slipped to a \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009c.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d As I mentioned earlier, this is bad news for most automakers. However, it suits ORLY stock perfectly.Aside from offering a warehouse of parts, O\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099Reilly also provides . These include critical functions, such as battery testing and \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009ccheck engine light\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d testing. While complementary, these offers facilitate upselling for parts and specialized services. That\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s a big plus for ORLY stock as investors seek out viable opportunities in a distressed environment.\tAmong recession-resistant services stocks to buy,  (NYSE:) is probably the least intuitive play. That assessment has only been exacerbated by the recent sharp decline in HRB stock. With the drop, shares have essentially gone flat for over the last three years. Certainly, this is not a great way to make an introduction.I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099ll freely admit that HRB stock has substantial risks. If you have a conservative portfolio, you may want to seek other services stocks. That said, if we fall into a recession, H&R Block\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s core business becomes all the more valuable.Yes, you can do your taxes yourself, which saves frontline costs. However, in the long run, you\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re better off with credentialed accounting advice. That applies even more so with small business owners and those with complex tax situations.Indeed, in these latter categories, people can save money in the long haul. With accountants guiding you to perfectly legal deductions, clients can maximize their financials and have peace of mind. Those are all valuable attributes that underline HRB stock.\tSupplemental insurance provider  (NYSE:) hasn\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t enjoyed the best performance over the past few months. Since the middle of July, AFL stock is down nearly double digits. With some of the recessionary fears impacting trading behavior, the equity may unfortunately be choppy over the nearer term.But in the broader picture, I think the realities of an economic downturn may inspire people to consider Aflac\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s services. While traditional insurance programs may cover the basics, there are always potential gaps that might not be covered. In these situations, Aflac provides a valuable service, making AFL stock one of the more critical stocks to buy.On a more personal note, I , an aircraft mechanic who suffered debilitating osteoarthritis. Wright was out of work for 20 months while he concentrated on rehabilitation. Through his dedicated commitment, as well as  from employment network Allsup Employment Services, he was back on his feet.Certainly, Wright is one of the lucky ones. But his story is a reminder that our health is not guaranteed. However, companies like Aflac can provide peace of mind, which is a tremendous boost for AFL stock.\tThis is an icky topic, but death is simply a part of life, ironically enough. While it\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s also not dinner table conversation, investments like  (NYSE:) benefit from a guaranteed bullish narrative: we have lots of people in the U.S. and they\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099re all going to die. As one of the biggest funeral services providers, Carriage Services and CSV stock have lucrative growth opportunities.Furthermore, now might be a great time to consider CSV as one of your top recession-resistant stocks to buy. I say this because of demographic realities. Following World War II, the U.S. experienced a surge in population size. Called the baby boom, the demographic belonging to this group peaked in 1999 at .Despite many who passed, there are many more waiting to knock on St. Peter\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s gate. In other words, CSV stock should have ample opportunities for upside.\tThe same arguments for CSV can be made for other funeral services stocks such as  (NYSE:). There are certain industries where the demand does not decrease when the economy is hurting. Unfortunately, making arrangements for deceased loved ones is one of those industries.SCI states that  \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009cprovide families with a full range of choices, from the simplest funeral arrangements to elegant ceremonies requiring intricate planning and unique features or events.\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009d That means that while simpler services may become more popular out of necessity in a major downturn, SCI can still provide those services.\tPrior to its rally that started in early August,  (NYSE:) was, contrary to its name, not looking healthy. At one point, CVS stock was down nearly 20% for 2019. And part of the reason was the competition. With disruptive names like  (NASDAQ:) or  (NYSE:) attempting to take more of the healthcare pie, CVS stock has historically absorbed serious pain.Fortunately, that appears to be changing. Since the beginning of August, CVS stock is up nearly 13% in the last three months, completely altering the implications behind its chart.But a little more patience might be in order, especially if we hit a recession. Even in a downturn, people can\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t avoid everyday frustrations, such as getting sick. Thus, CVS enjoys secular demand, which is why you should consider it among relevant stocks to buy.\tIf you still have a bad taste in your mouth about the funeral services stocks to buy, don\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099t worry: these last two names will put a smile on your face.I\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099m going to start this duo of stocks to buy with  (NASDAQ:), a medical insurance provider for your pets. Specifically, Trupanion insures dogs and cats, but seeing as how these are the most popular pet species, this fits well for TRUP stock.Of course, we all know how expensive medical insurance for humans is. With insuring pets, it might seem overkill. However, our pets are often a huge part of our lives. Plus, an acute issue can . In a recession, it might make sense to insure whatever you can, thus lifting the case for TRUP stock.\t (NASDAQ:) specializes in medical diagnostic equipment for pets. Business has been good for IDXX stock, and its shares have climbed 41% in the last year.And against a longer-term framework, you might want to consider adding IDXX to your list of potential stocks to buy. For one thing, Americans love their furry friends. According to the American Pet Products Association, . Moreover, millennials will spend more on their pets\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 healthcare than on their own health-related needs.Yes, that sounds crazy, but it also underlines the bullish narrative for IDXX stock. Plus, our four-legged family members offer us humans a number of . These factors will especially be important if we incur an economic downturn.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Investors in O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (Symbol: ORLY) saw new options begin trading this week, for the August 21st expiration.  One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 231 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ORLY options chain for the new August 21st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $430.00 strike price has a current bid of $27.90.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $430.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $402.10 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ORLY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $437.42/share today.\n\nBecause the $430.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.49% return on the cash commitment, or 10.25% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $430.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $450.00 strike price has a current bid of $30.10.  If an investor was to purchase shares of ORLY stock at the current price level of $437.42/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $450.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.76% if the stock gets called away at the August 21st expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ORLY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing ORLY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $450.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $450.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 50%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.88% boost of extra return to the investor, or 10.87% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 26%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 25%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $437.42) to be 21%.

Below are the best seven retail stocks of the decade, based on their performance starting on Jan. 1, 2010.Image source: Getty Images. entered the decade as a high-flying  and is exiting in much the same way. The stock surged in the early part of the decade as it recovered from a recession-era sell-off. For several years, however, share growth stagnated as the company struggled to recover from a recall of its pants for being too sheer and faced a backlash over unsavory comments from founder Chip Wilson, including blaming \"women's bodies\" for problems with the company's pants.Despite those stumbles, the stock has surged under new CEO Calvin McDonald over the last two years. Comparable sales have surged by double digits, driving the rapid growth of Lululemon's high-margin business, especially in men's clothing and digital sales.Image source: Lululemon.The cosmetics industry has seen strong growth over the last decade, driven in part by the popularity of Instagram (owned by ) and the premium it puts on appearances. Among retail stocks, the biggest winner of that trend has been , which has soared more than 1,300% as it capitalized on the demand for beauty products and salon services. Ulta has also benefited from the need for consumers to visit brick-and-mortar locations to get a haircut or to try on makeup before buying, giving the business some protection from e-commerce competition. It's also been able to take advantage of ample real estate vacancies to grow its store count from 346 to 1,241 over the course of the decade. Image source: Ulta Beauty.Auto-parts retailers have been surprisingly durable in the e-commerce era. With a vast selection of specialized products in stores, knowledgeable employees who can provide answers you can't get online, and a speedy delivery network to serve commercial garages and individual users, companies like  have bucked the retail malaise to deliver steady growth.O'Reilly now has 5,420 stores across the country, up 2,000 from a decade ago, and profitability has expanded as the company further penetrated the \"do-it-for-me\" market with its 2008 acquisition of CSK Auto. That move and steady comparable sales growth led to its  in the last decade.Image source: Getty Images.Off-price retailers like  have been big winners over the last decade. While conventional apparel chains like  have come under pressure in recent years due to the rise of fast-fashion competitors like and e-commerce, off-price chains have thrived. Employing a model that sells name brands for 20% to 60% less than competing department stores, Ross has grown quickly over the last decade. The off-price model is not easy to maintain through online channels because it relies on fast product turnover of ever-changing merchandise. Ross's store count, which also includes dd's Discounts, has nearly doubled over the past decade, and comparable sales have consistently increased, driving profits higher.Image source: Ross Stores.Another off-price star,  wasn't even trading on the market 10 years ago. The company went public in 2013 and, like Ross, has shown the power of the off-price model. CEO Thomas Kingsbury sees the company's strengths as maintaining its everyday-low-prices model and giving customers the thrill of the \"treasure hunt,\" meaning its merchandise assortment is always changing, and shoppers never know what they'll find.That formula has been undeniably successful: The stock has exploded since its 2013 debut. Today, Burlington continues to deliver solid comparable sales growth and expanding margins and is opening new stores.Image source: Burlington.Like O'Reilly,  has also been a big winner over the last decade. Benefiting from similar trends, AutoZone stock has jumped nearly 700% as the auto-parts seller has proven its staying power. The company also benefited from starting the decade with a cheap valuation and from aggressively buying back shares, reducing its share count by about half. Meanwhile, solid comparable sales growth, new store openings, and bullishness about the aftermarket auto-parts sector due to a growing used-car market have all lifted the stock in the last couple of years.Image source: AutoZone.The leading home-improvement retailer has become the second-most-valuable U.S. retailer (behind ) thanks to its strong growth over the decade, fueled by the housing recovery and a number of strategic decisions.  essentially stopped opening new stores over the last 10 years, and instead, it invested in technology and e-commerce, improving customer service, and returning capital to shareholders -- its dividend payout has surged over that time.Though the stock's growth has slowed more recently, the company continues to see solid comparable sales growth as demand for home-improvement products grows.Image source: Home Depot.You might notice a pattern here: Retail stocks focused on home improvement, auto parts, off-price and discount, and high-end products that tend to flatter one's own image have done the best over the past decade. But they have another key factor in common. With the exception of Home Depot, all of these stocks were small at the beginning of the decade, with market caps of $10 billion or less. Lululemon and Ulta, the two best performers, were worth the least 10 years ago.To find the kind of multibagging returns on this list, it helps to start small. By contrast, well-known names like Walmart and  actually underperformed the over the last decade, as have many of the country's biggest retailers.

But the company continues to scout new opportunities. Amazon will try its hand at almost any sort of business, does well at the bulk of them - and threatens to destroy dozens of other companies with its success.The latest foray into unfamiliar territory? In September, Amazon announced a pilot program for a virtual medical clinic, which includes some in-home services, to be offered to its Seattle-area employees. The virtual clinic aspect would include video visits with doctors, nurse practitioners or registered nurses.That's not Amazon's first venture outside its comfort zone, either. Amazon also is a grocer, a fashion venue, a peddler of handmade crafts and even its own delivery provider, just to name a few. Amazon has become at best a headache, and at worst a survival threat, for any rival in its path.Here is a look at 43 companies that Amazon could kill. A year ago, we named 49 such businesses (as well as one it already knocked out). A handful of names dropped off the list - some successfully regrouped, while a few were officially knocked out. Others have been added as they've slipped into Amazon's warpath. Considering Amazon's ubiquitous presence, no company is ever truly safe.The unchecked growth of Amazon didn't faze auto-parts suppliers such as O'Reilly Automotive (), AutoZone () and Advance Auto Parts () for a long time. Car parts are too heavy, bulky and specialized to be handled like a consumer-centric commodity. And besides, when mechanics (DIYers or the real thing) need a part to use in a repair, they usually want it quickly. The big three names in the auto parts retailing game haven't needed to worry.But times have changed, helped along by inventory-management technology and delivery networks that are willing and able to handle goods they simply couldn't before. That's why Amazon was willing to enter the fray in January 2017.All three stocks have since recovered from their initial setbacks. The underlying companies have finally shrugged off their shock and figured out how to compete with a price-busting Amazon. Advance Auto Parts, for instance, has embraced the idea of in-store pickups of online orders, not unlike the option now offered by many grocery chains.However, Amazon hasn't yet unleashed its full potential on this front. It's disrupting the auto parts retailing industry gradually, just as it has other consumer-facing markets. Give it time.Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods Market sent shockwaves through the organic-grocery business. But just as vulnerable (albeit in a different way) are more conventional grocers such as Kroger (), privately owned Albertsons and the grocery arm of Walmart (). In fact, a year ago, Amazon was technically the biggest online grocer of the United States, boasting market share of 18%.That has changed in the meantime. Walmart stepped up its game by growing its curbside pickup option to 2,100 U.S. locations, while Instacart leveraged its relationship with Costco () and Kroger to beef up its share of the market from 4% to 8% over the past couple of years. That business had to come from somewhere.As the number of places and opportunities for more traditional brick-and-mortar grocers to expand their online-ordering business shrink, however, Amazon's relative retreat will cool and likely reverse. Remember: Amazon has always played the \"long game,\" and it's still learning the business, too, with a relatively limited market of 90 metropolitan areas. But it's already going on the offensive, announcing free Amazon Fresh deliveries for Prime members that have previously used the service.Amazon is the owner of , which boasts the largest audiobook library in the world. That makes it a direct threat to Audiobooks.com and Playster, among others.Don't dismiss this market's importance. Although audiobooks only generated a little less than $1 billion worth of revenue in the United States last year, the size of the market is growing. In 2018, the industry's revenue was up 24.5% year-over-year, extending a longstanding hot streak.What was largely missing from the audiobook landscape for a long time was a central name to mainstream audiobooks, similar to the role Netflix () played within the streaming video arena.Amazon largely has become that player.Audible controls about 41% of the audiobook market, as of the most recent look. And, like Netflix, being the first to become the dominant force in a particular market leaves little room for a second or third player ... which is all Playster and Audiobooks.com are in a position to enjoy from here. But playing second fiddle to Amazon in any business is a problem, especially when Audible can be sold as part of an Amazon Prime package.Bookstore chain Barnes & Noble and Joseph-Beth Booksellers were the first major victims of the rise of Amazon. Remember: Initially, Amazon.com was an online bookstore, and the advent of e-readers - then tablets - made e-books commonplace, further displacing physical bookstores.One end result for B&N is 12 consecutive years of declining sales, with a 13th likely underway. Another end result: 10 straight years of net store closures.A glimmer of hope finally started to shine in June of this year, when hedge fund Elliot Management acquired the struggling chain of 627 bookstores in hopes of turning it around. The fund , who led a successful turnaround of the U.K.'s largest book, to act as CEO of the now-privatized outfit.The task ahead remains a monumental one though. As 1010data research analyst Brian Callahan opined on the buyout, \"In our data sets, there is little indication that side of the business (books) has stopped the bleeding. They're just not getting people.\"There's also little assurance that escaping the short-term-minded scrutiny of public investors is a surefire recipe for success. Toys \"R\" Us was privatized to no avail, as was RadioShack.As for Joseph Beth, it's down to a handful of locations, though they're holding up. But it has a limited degree of much-needed scale, and scale is the key to surviving the Amazon juggernaut.There are a number of specific gaming companies that, with the exception of YouTube Gaming, won't ring any bells with investors. But within video gaming circles, Smashcast, Dailymotion, Mixer (formerly Beam) and a whole slew of other non-descript names are plenty familiar. All of these organizations have developed platforms that allow gaming fans pay to watch other people play video games.Yes, that's a real thing. And yes, it generates revenue for the player as well as the platform owner. Last year, Google's YouTube supplied 50 billion hours' worth of video gaming content.What does that have to do with Amazon?Amazon.com is the owner and operator of Twitch, which is the world's most popular destination to watch other individuals play video games. The players who make the video and Amazon split any subscription revenue created by a particular gamer's channel, so that player has an incentive to do well and grow his or her audience.It's the behemoth in the business. Whereas YouTube Live  during the first quarter of the year, Twitch delivered a stunning 2.7 billion hours of live video game viewing action - up 33% year-over-year.It's possible there's room for more than one player in the game-streaming space. It's unlikely there's room for more than one dominant player.There's no denying that electronics retailer Best Buy () pulled off a miracle.The deeper Amazon.com waded into the consumer electronics market, the more trouble Best Buy found itself in. By 2012, chatter about Best Buy's impending doom was common. Many presumed the company would follow in Circuit City's footsteps to bankruptcy, as Amazon was simply too competitive.But a funny thing happened on the road to oblivion. Turnaround artist Hubert Joly took the helm in 2012 and began working on a turnaround plan. It worked, at least according to Joly. He flatly said last year, \"We have turned around the business, it's about where we go from here. We have not only survived but thrived and I don't believe this is a winner-takes-all market.\"Q2 numbers suggest there's some truth to the matter. Company-wide revenue was up a couple of percentage points, as were same-store sales. Earnings improved by nearly 19%.But hold off on the victory lap. For one, the further Best Buy works its way into the turnaround, the more its progress slows. Its numbers are seemingly closer to reaching a plateau than not, with much if not all of its revenue growth being attributable to inflation. If Best Buy isn't taking business away from Amazon, the e-commerce giant remains in good position to push back and rekindle its market share growth.Also, Joly is no longer at the helm. He stepped down in June 2019, and was replaced by Corie Barry, who previously served as CFO and strategic transformation officer.No one disputes Amazon.com has mastered the art of delivering anything and everything that isn't perishable, but what about pre-packaged meals?Yep, it can do that too.Amazon got into the business in 2017, and it has continued to improve its game ever since. Its entry into the race is a direct threat to the likes of rival meal kit outfits Blue Apron (), HelloFresh and Plated.The marketability and viability of the so-called \"pure plays\" in the business were never all that strong. They're all subject to the changing - usually rising - price of food, and it takes massive scale to make meal kits cost-effective enough to turn into a sustainable business. Blue Apron, for instance, is one of the biggest names in the business yet still hasn't recorded even a quarterly profit.Another unsavory reality of the meal kit biz: Roughly three-fourths of Blue Apron's and HelloFresh's customers stop buying them (on a regular basis anyway) within about six months. The idea is creative, but it doesn't necessarily have longevity.To the extent there is a viable meal kit market, however, Amazon has two advantages. One is that, on a global basis, almost 200 million people visit Amazon.com each month, and the company boasts an estimated 105 million Prime members in the U.S. alone. Amazon has mastered the art of keeping them lingering long enough that a wide swath of them will eventually give a meal kit a shot.The other edge is that Amazon doesn't actually have to turn a profit selling those pre-packaged meals. It can extract a profit from those customers by selling them other products and services.Energizer Holdings (), which of course is the name behind Energizer batteries, is one of the most recognizable names in the business. So is Duracell, which is held by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway ().Batteries currently sold under Amazon's \"Basics\" label don't exactly inspire deep brand loyalty. But don't dismiss the potential of Amazon's entry into the seemingly boring business. For whatever reason, batteries and diapers are the two big winners under the company's AmazonBasics umbrella. Amazon already outsells all other battery brands by commanding roughly one-third of that market. Energizer's market share, for reference, is a little better than 10%, while Duracell's piece of the market is closer to 20%.The bigger concern for those rival brands is the fact that Amazon was able to enter the market and chip away some share for itself at all.It's unlikely Duracell or Energizer will ever be wiped out completely. But Amazon doesn't even really promote its Basics battery other than as an add-on purchase at its website, and yet it already has proven disruptive to the two biggest brands in the business. The fact that it had a 97% share of online battery purchases in Q1 2019 means it's not going away.Etsy () was, and is, a brilliant idea.Some things are just not meant to be made or sold in bulk. Handmade one-of-a-kinds still have a place in consumers' hearts, but makers of these goods are facing an increasingly tough time in just being able to show their wares to an increasingly distracted market. By bringing a huge number of artisans under one roof and promoting the entire collection, Etsy has successfully melded an old-school idea with the new.But Amazon noticed, and responded. In 2015, the e-commerce giant launched , taking a stab at Etsy.Credit must be given where it's due. Etsy has largely fended off the much bigger e-commerce rival, maximizing the value of featuring secondhand goods and handmade items, whereas Amazon's Handmade venue is mostly as cold and impersonal as the other channels of its e-commerce platform. CEO Josh Silverman, former eBay () executive, led a 35.9% improvement in revenues for the first nine months of 2019.Still, Amazon has time and size working in its favor, and it can slowly force its smaller rival into a corner. Etsy, in fact, took one step back in July of this year when it \"encouraged\" its sellers to  on orders larger than $35. Storefront owners that didn't acquiesce wouldn't be featured as prominently as those that did. Some are complying, but others aren't. All of Etsy's sellers, however, are feeling a little more alienated after being sucker-punched by slightly higher transaction fees instituted in July 2018.While both Uber Technologies () and Lyft Inc. () had opportunities to delve into the package delivery business, neither ride-hailing outfit is interested in going down that route. Perhaps it's more of a logistical headache than it's worth, interfering with their people-moving business models.However, Amazon.com isn't merely keeping smaller, would-be competitors from entering the market. With a fleet of 42 delivery jet aircraft and plans to expand its fleet to 70 aircraft by 2021, Amazon is encroaching onto turf presently controlled by United Parcel Service () and FedEx (). The e-commerce giant rounds out its total delivery capacity with .The intent hasn't been to put the more established logistics service providers on the defensive. Rather, Amazon.com has built and continues to grow its own delivery network as a means of saving money and improving its overall customer service. FedEx CEO Fred Smith, however, now deems Amazon a competitor. Amazon feels likewise, calling it and UPS competitors in its annual report.Time and opportunity will only encourage AMZN to monetize its delivery infrastructure even more than it already has - cutting out FedEx and UPS in the process.GameStop () historically has made its money by serving as the middleman, but the game publishing industry's move toward downloads and away from discs and cartridges is increasingly making the venue less of a destination for gamers.Its August-quarter results underscore that idea. Global sales fell 14.3% to $1.29 billion, versus analyst estimates of $1.34 billion. The loss of 32 cents per share was far worse than the 21 cents the pros were modeling. The total adjusted loss of $32 million more than tripled the $10.2 million loss booked in Q2 2018. Perhaps worst of all, the retailer warned that same-store sales would likely fall by the low teens for fiscal 2019.Don't misunderstand. GameStop also sells game downloads via its own website. Amazon does too. Neither venue is completely out of the loop when it comes to this paradigm shift underway within the gaming business.But Amazon.com induces 2.6 billion unique visits every month now, and that figure just continues to swell. It draws a bigger crowd, and the gamers among them know they can buy downloads via the site. GameStop's website simply doesn't attract nearly as many people.To its credit, activist investment fund Scion Asset Management has taken on a $10.6 million, 3% stake in the company, and has encouraged GameStop to use its healthy balance sheet to continue repurchasing stock. Lead investor Michael Burry believes next year's launch of new Microsoft () Xbox and Sony () PlayStation consoles will drive much-needed traffic. But both companies continue to move in a manner that negates the need for any game retailer other than Amazon.Initially, the rise of Amazon.com wasn't only not a threat to book publishers - it was a benefit, making it easy for consumers to purchase a book rather than require a visit to an actual bookstore.But technology never stops marching forward. The development of e-books and e-readers has quelled the need for printing and shipping while simultaneously positioning Amazon.com as an e-book hub. For the crowd that still prefers the feel of paper and the look of a volume on a bookshelf, Amazon's  can arrange for a book to be printed on-demand - even just one at a time.With that option on the table, traditional book publishers such as Penguin Random House and Hachette Book Group are struggling to justify their new role as middlemen that don't bring much value to the table. Amazon can do the marketing job too, or at least offer a platform that will allow an author to promote a book as effectively as a publishing house often does.The results speak for themselves. In 2017, Jeff Bezos disclosed that more than a thousand independent authors using the Kindle Direct Publishing platform earned more than $100,000 apiece. Meanwhile, e-books drove roughly $12 billion in revenue last year. That's only a small fraction of the total publishing market's collective top line, but that tally is spread out among a huge number of publishers. At least two-thirds of all e-book revenue is generated via an Amazon digital publishing service.The numbers prompt one key question: Who needs an old-school publisher?Most consumers have heard of online business directory and review repository Yelp (). Ditto for Angie's List, which InterActiveCorp () has some control of via its 84% stake in ANGI Homeservices (). What most consumers don't yet realize, however, is that Amazon is quietly encroaching into that market.It's called , and it looks a lot like Angie's List. Homeowners looking for anything ranging from tech support to housecleaning services to yardwork can browse Amazon's curated list of service providers and read reviews regarding their previous work. Angie's List and Yelp offer similar information. And while Yelp also serves up information about a variety of other consumer-facing businesses such as restaurants or retail stores, there's no denying that Amazon Home Services is a viable alternative source of information on many fronts.Given that Amazon already connects with so many consumers in so many ways, adding reviews to the mix wouldn't be a major technical hurdle.Yelp doesn't appear to be on the defensive just yet ... at least not given its most recent quarterly earnings report that saw revenues improve by 9% year-over-year. But the headwind is brewing. Its Q2 top line was up 5%, versus 12% sales growth for the same quarter year earlier. Margins improved with expanding scale, but were it not for stock buybacks, per-share profit growth would have cooled too. InterActiveCorp is slowing down as well, and Amazon hasn't even yet applied its full-court press.Even something as mundane and common, yet garment-specific, as fabric could be upended by Amazon.At first glance, it doesn't appear Amazon has given its fabric and material business any particular special attention. Many of the sewing and craft supplies the website offers are featured on the same basic page used to sell all sorts of other goods. And the featured seller, Fabric.com, appears to be the beneficiary of the usual handoff Amazon makes when a customer needs something that can't be sold en masse.But take a closer look at the website that Amazon.com redirects you to when you click on the sizeable at the top of the \"Fabrics\" page. You're buying fabric by the yard from Fabric.com, but Fabric.com is .It's a very un-Amazon-like business, though the company knows something most consumers and investors don't: The fabric and sewing supply retailing market is worth about $4 billion per year, and globally, the textile market is expected to be worth more than $1 trillion by 2025.That's more Amazon-like! Amazon's edge in the arena is that it has the much-needed scale that most textile outlets and retailers don't. That's a problem for Jo-Ann Fabrics.If you own any activewear sporting the Goodsport, Rebel Canyon or Peak Velocity labels, you're actually wearing one of Amazon's homegrown house brands. The company got into the business for itself in late 2017.The foray was a modest one - more of an experiment than something meant to make a splash. It largely was meant to fill gaps left unfilled by the athletic apparel names that weren't offering the entire breadth of their lineup at Amazon.com. Most everything Amazon does, however, starts small and eventually gets big enough to become disruptive.It's a shot at names such as Lululemon Athletica () and Under Armour (), which are well-recognized brands but fiscally struggling companies. Under Armour has been saddled by (admittedly shrinking) debt, while Lululemon is finding that an increasingly competitive environment isn't driving profits any higher despite rising revenue.Nike () is vulnerable too, but being the biggest and most respected name in the business, it could just as easily benefit from the fact that Amazon has put other activewear manufacturers on the defensive. And in fact, Nike moved to cut any reliance on Amazon by taking its wares off the site, which will allow it to focus on its direct-to-consumer business.It wouldn't be a stretch to think Amazon could wreak significant havoc in the semi-specialized apparel arena. Internet Retailer's report for 2019 indicates that U.S. online sales of apparel improved more than 18% last year, and now make up 34.4% of all U.S. clothing sales. That's up from 30.6% the year before, playing right into Amazon's expansive reach. In fact, Coresight Research reported in March that the e-commerce giant eclipsed Walmart and Target to become the world's biggest clothing retailer.Reminder: Office Depot () and OfficeMax are now one and the same company, having merged back in 2013 as a means of defending itself from the slow disintegration of the office supply business.Amazon.com - and  in particular - put that disintegration into motion.It still wasn't enough. That's why Office Depot and privately held Staples sought a merger of their own a couple of years later, explaining that unless the two retailers worked as one, neither would survive. The Department of Justice didn't buy into the argument, however; it feared that whittling down the number of large brick-and-mortar office supply outfits would harm consumers.Little has changed since then. Office Depot managed to top its second-quarter earnings estimates, catapulting ODP shares higher, but a closer look at the Q2 report reveals that not all of the tepid growth was even organic. It was driven by acquisitions and new initiatives. And there was no sales growth in Q3 - revenues declined 4% year-over-year.Staples doesn't have to disclose its quarterly results, but it's difficult to see how it could be faring much better than ODP. Neither can compete with Amazon's prices, and low prices are everything to business customers.Satellite radio company Sirius XM () threw Pandora a much-needed lifeline in early 2019, acquiring the struggling company for a modest $3.5 billion. But the online music platform still faces a steep uphill battle. Shortly after the Pandora/Sirius deal was consummated, eMarketer projected that Spotify's growth trajectory and Pandora's deteriorating membership would continue to dwindle. By 2021, Spotify's () subscriber base should be larger than its rival's. If Sirius can't stop that bleeding, it might throw in the towel on Pandora altogether.But Spotify isn't guaranteed to be a thriving survivor, either. It's also fighting a tough battle against a much bigger Apple () and a much deeper-pocketed Amazon.com, which offers Amazon Music in several different packages. Amazon is able to leverage its Echo smart speaker line too. It recently offered an Echo Dot for a mere 99 cents to consumers who have a subscription to Amazon Music, which costs a modest $8 per month.Whatever Amazon is doing, it's working. The e-commerce giant isn't forthcoming about its music subscriber numbers, but it was estimated in that by the middle of 2019, Amazon's music services grew 70% year-over-year, outpacing the growth Apple and Spotify mustered.There's only room for so many music-streaming platforms in the marketplace. And while Amazon isn't the market leader - that's still Spotify - the presence of a disruptive Amazon Music could still be enough to displace Pandora.Rite Aid () has been on its last legs for a while. Indeed, truth be told, it's surprising the pharmacy chain still is around in a recognizable form. Rivals CVS Health () and Walgreens () both enjoy scale that Rite Aid simply doesn't have, and Rite Aid's sale of nearly 2,000 of its stores by early 2018 only exacerbated the problem. It needs to improve relative profitability, which is more difficult to do - not easier - the smaller an organization becomes.It might be Amazon that ultimately deals the proverbial death blow to the drugstore market's third-place player, however.Amazon's 2018 purchase of online pharmacy PillPack is one reason. CVS and Walgreens can hold their own against the digitally operated rival, but Rite Aid doesn't have a solid enough foundation to do the same. The fact CVS and Walgreens are now in a heated tiff with Amazon's pharmacy operation underscores the depth of the threat. The two brick-and-mortar names are suggesting that PillPack hasn't secured the proper customer consent to transfer a doctor's prescription to the alternative provider.Meanwhile, Rite Aid is increasingly facing off against Amazon with items sold on its store floors. Amazon's home-grown brand of consumables sold under the  label includes goods like hearing-aid batteries, light bulbs and plastic cups just to name a few.In all fairness, Amazon has been making things tough for all brick-and-mortar retailers.Sears () was the wounded and sickest member of the herd, though, finally forced into bankruptcy protection a year ago ... and even then its ultimate survival remains in question. Meanwhile, it looked for a while like JCPenney () would be able to keep its head above water while former Home Depot () Marvin Ellison led the retailer through a turnaround. His exit in early 2018, however, might be a not-so-subtle hint that it's only a matter of time before this ship sinks, too.Amazon competes with both iconic retailers on most fronts. The e-commerce giant, for instance, also offers Maytag appliances, and may have been the driving force of the severed relationship between Sears and Whirlpool. As for JCPenney, hosting Sephoras within its stores has been one of its few recent success stories, but those goods also are available at Amazon.com.Where Amazon has and continues to hit Sears and JCPenney hard, however, is in the apparel arena. As mentioned above, Amazon has become the country's largest clothing seller. Apparel is a huge category for JCPenney and Sears, and the fact that more than one-third of all apparel sales are now done online largely leaves both players on the outside looking in.It's not exactly a secret that people across the U.S., and around the world for that matter, are increasingly concerned about what they're eating. Chemicals and pesticides are completely out of fashion, as is genetically modified produce. En vogue are organic goods, and where at all possible, locally sourced foods.It's a trend that initially sprang life for outfits such as Sprouts Farmers Market (), The Fresh Market and Trader Joe's, which historically have been the go-to options for health-conscious consumers. Now that rival grocer Whole Foods Market is an Amazon holding, it can benefit from Amazon's strong marketing reach.That's not the only edge Amazon has on its organic-grocery rivals, however.Unlike Trader Joe's and Sprouts, Amazon doesn't necessarily have to turn a profit in the grocery biz anytime soon. As long as it can break even and/or be subsidized by the company's e-commerce operations, AMZN can win the organic grocery wars by attrition, and then focus on profits. The fact The Fresh Market announced more than a dozen store closings were in the works as of the middle of 2018 - and a handful more locales were added to the closure list this year - suggests the plan may be working.The kicker: Amazon is no longer limiting itself to higher-end organic and whole-foods fare. The company announced in mid-2019 it was planning to build a chain of more conventional grocery stores. That's a threat to Kroger and Walmart, to be sure. But it could also peel off some less-than-completely loyal customers of Sprouts, TFM and Trader Joe's, too.Teachers Pay Teachers is an unconventional, though brilliant, business idea. Rather than proverbially re-create the wheel, teachers can produce structured classroom handouts and materials, then sell them to other (often overworked) teachers who might not have the time to do so for themselves.It's not exactly clear how big the market is. It's estimated that Teachers Pay Teachers - the biggest name in the business - generates just a little less than $10 million in annual revenue. It splits revenue with its participants on a 50/50 basis, so the teachers selling lesson plans are also effectively pocketing another $10 million per year, give or take. But for perspective: The market size for K-12 curriculum materials in the U.S. is estimated to be $8 billion per year. Less and less of that is being directed toward traditional providers, as teacher-made materials gain popularity.Amazon's increasingly disruptive role in the middle of that melee is its relatively new , which is \"an open collaboration service that helps teachers to easily discover, gather, and share quality educational content with their community.\"The problem for Teachers Pay Teachers and its peers? Amazon Inspire is free to use.That might not always be the case, but as long as it's free, it's a threat to for-profit sites in the same arena. Conversely, should Amazon eventually opt to make it a profit center, it's apt to turn up the heat on promoting Amazon Inspire. Either way, it's already racked up a couple of victims: Educents and Teacher's Notebook, both of which had to shut down in 2018.When Amazon officially entered the B2B (business-to-business) market in 2012 with what was then called AmazonSupply, few heads turned. It's not a scintillating market - particularly the maintenance and repair sliver of it - and it wasn't clear how well the company would be able to stand up to localized specialists like W. W. Grainger ().Investors should have given Amazon more credit. Although it has been a slow burn, the e-commerce behemoth might be prompting Grainger to make moves that often signal the advent of considerably tougher times.The biggest of those red flags is price cuts Grainger has made, following Amazon's lead. The impact of those cuts, however, have yet to take shape. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Christopher Ciolino , \"W.W. Grainger's strategy of lowering prices to grab market share has spurred better than expected volume, yet growth is poised to moderate in 2019-20 amid a slowing industrial economy. An increasingly competitive market, including a growing threat from online rivals, may result in structurally lower prices and gross profit across the industry.\"This doesn't suggest that the coming year will mark the end of Grainger. But it could be another slow step in that direction.In last year's rundown of companies that Amazon could end, Toys \"R\" Us was already a confirmed kill. The toy retailer never really worked its way out of its 2017 bankruptcy, so by March 2018, the organization finally decided to shutter all of its remaining stores for good.Now it's back ... sort of.Earlier in 2019, a consortium of private equity outfits purchased the still-loved toy retailer and is attempting to rebuild the Toys \"R\" Us chain in a much different way. While no new stores will be set up in time for this year's holiday shopping season, the brand's new owners seem to understand that a modern-era toy story has to offer immersive experiences. They also need to be smaller and feel less like a warehouse.The effort will be interesting. But the kind of stores being planned are expensive and labor-intensive, and will require a re-training of consumers that have now become accustomed to purchasing toys from Target, Walmart and ... Amazon.Then there's the not-so-small reality that once again a brick-and-mortar retailer could provide free \"showrooming\" services for Amazon. That's where consumers visit a physical store location to learn more about a particular product, then go online to make the purchase from Amazon at what's sure to be a lower price.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking at options trading activity among components of the Russell 3000 index, there is noteworthy activity today in Edwards Lifesciences Corp (Symbol: EW), where a total volume of 5,186 contracts has been traded thus far today, a contract volume which is representative of approximately 518,600 underlying shares (given that every 1 contract represents 100 underlying shares).

Knowing where to look is key.Image source: Getty Images.The rise of e-commerce has shifted  so that even the Christmas sales season isn't as important as it used to be.November and December used to be when most consumers shopped, and the holiday season is still important for retail spending. But data from Coresight Research show that the advent of \"shopping holidays\" -- especially 's annual Prime Day extravaganza in July and related sales from other retailers trying to piggyback on Amazon's efforts -- has caused consumers to shift their spending away from the last two months of the year.Where the November-December period used to account for almost a quarter of spending in 1998, it has since fallen to 21% in 2018, and likely will be even lower this year. After all, Amazon sold an estimated $6 billion worth of goods on Prime Day in 2019, a 50% increase over the year before.But that doesn't mean investors should only look online for stocks to buy. It's in the world of brick-and-mortar that arguably some of the best investment gems are hidden.Although we can blame Amazon for the demise of many retailers, other physical retailers are growing. Using data from IHL Group, eMarketer listed the top 10 retailers that are opening stores.10100911681457\u00a01506\u00a01555\u00a02004\u00a02003\u00a02102 5001 975Data source: eMarketer.What eMarketer notes is a common theme running through most of these retailers is that not only are many discount retailers -- Aldi, Dollar General, Dollar Tree -- they also specialized in generic merchandise for the most part.You can find name brand goods at the dollar stores and the deep discount grocers, but their primary sales are in private label and off-brand names. Indeed, even at major supermarkets such as  and , private label merchandise is growing four times faster in the United States year over year than national brands, according to IRI data.Name brands are retreating from the physical arena.   may be one of the most high-profile examples of a brand that is increasingly relying upon the direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales channel.While you're still going to find Nike footwear and athletic apparel on store shelves at  and  , it has forecast its DTC business will hit $16 billion by the end of fiscal 2020, a 54% increase over the $10.4 billion in sales Nike Direct generated during fiscal 2018.\u00a0In the second quarter NIKE Direct grew 17% on a currency-adjusted basis, led by the NIKE Digital division surging 38% year over year, a situation it credits to its revamped Nike App and the SNKR App, both operating in over 20 countries.What investors may find is a divergence in who sells what where. As the department store fades in importance, brands will seek to shift their sales from the wholesale channel to one where they have greater control over their brand, its pricing, and customer data. Retailers that are thriving, primarily discounters, will focus their efforts on promoting private label goods.It's smart to do so too, because even major retailers can bolster their bottom line by selling store-brand goods. Dick's Sporting Goods has reported  after introducing its CALIA line of women's apparel, as well as its new Alpine Design and an all-new DSG discount line.That suggests investors looking for bargains in retail look first in the discount bin -- the discount retailer segment. The market has assigned a premium to segment leaders like Dollar General, Five Below, and , the home of T.J. Maxx and Marshall's, but their valuations are not necessarily excessive.For others, like Dollar Tree, which is in the midst of a turnaround, it remains value priced and shouldn't be crossed off anyone's list. There are deals still to be had in the retail space, but only if you know where to look.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Dollar General wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.\u00a0\u00a0The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["\nThere are 8 different analyst targets contributing to that average for O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., but the average is just that \u2014 a mathematical average.

However, investors can lower exposure to volatility ahead of the next \u00a0by investing in companies that have historically withstood the headwinds of a downturn. Three such retailers are  ,  , and  . Let's take a closer look at why now is a good time to consider investing in these stocks.Image source: Getty images.AutoZone is the largest distributor and retailer of automotive accessories and replacement parts in the United States. Auto sales decreased 35% during the Great Recession -- which proves that consumers will drive vehicles longer as the economy slows, fixing small problems to keep a tight budget. The \"do-it-yourself\" consumer is the target customer for AutoZone, which operates locations in the United States, Mexico, and Brazil. During the previous recession, AutoZone was operating 4,417 locations throughout the U.S. and Mexico, with revenue of $6.82 billion in 2009. Revenue projections in August 2019 were $11.86 billion, operating 6,411 locations -- which is an increase of $5.04 billion in annual revenue since 2009.Beating the S&P 500 during the recession, AutoZone achieved an 11.1% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from January 2007 to January 2010, while the S&P 500 retracted 7.6% annually during the same period. Expanding after the economic downturn, AutoZone has , totaling over 6,000 locations in the United States, Mexico, and Brazil.AutoZone's largest competitor,  , is on the company's heels. However, AutoZone is showing it is fairly valued with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 17.66 against O'Reilly's 24.67, in addition to a trailing-12-month price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 2.42, compared to O'Reilly's 3.46. Neither company pays a dividend, but O'Reilly returned a 6.8% CAGR between 2007 and 2010, a 4.3 percentage point lower annual return than AutoZone during the 2008-09 recession.After purchasing Family Dollar in 2015 for $8.5 billion, Dollar Tree increased the store base by 8,000 locations -- giving Dollar Tree a total store count of 15,000 for the second quarter of 2019. Operating approximately 3,500 stores in 2009, Dollar Tree's share price grew 16.9% CAGR between 2007 and 2010 -- beating the S&P 500.Dollar Tree is currently converting the 8,000 Family Dollar locations into Dollar Tree stores, streamlining distribution and giving consumers the successful Dollar Tree pricing model of $1 for everything in the store rather than Family Dollar's pricing, which ranges from $1 and up. in a strong economy, consolidated net sales are expected to total between $23.57 to $23.79 billion for the second quarter, an upward revision from the original low-end estimate of between $23.51 and $23.83 billion. The CEO of Dollar Tree, Gary Philbin, announced in the second quarter that \"efforts to improve the consistency of execution across the store base and our acceleration of initiatives to optimize the real estate portfolio are paying off.\" A planned conversion of 150 Family Dollar stores into Dollar Tree stores in the second quarter shows strength in the acquisition.If another recession is on the horizon, a discount retailer such as Dollar Tree is attractively priced with a 22.25 forward P/E, compared to its largest competitor, , at 24.63. In addition, a 1.16 trailing-12-month P/S is a value over Dollar General's P/S of 1.97. Dollar Tree's five-year revenue growth of 23.37% CAGR stands well above Dollar General's 8.04%.Walmart, one of the largest companies in the world, has approximately 2.2 million employees and delivered fiscal 2019 revenue of $514.4 billion. Providing discount merchandise to consumers, the company has an advantage over competitors as low prices are coveted during tough economic times.

However, not all investments are created equal, and there's a case for private investors to ignore one of    lesser-known holdings, namely  . Finding an under-the-radar Buffett stock is a beautiful idea, but in this case, it probably doesn't make a whole lot of sense to follow the leader. Here's why.Image source: Getty Images.Axalta is one of the smaller players in the global coatings sector. The company's main focus is on , supplying both the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and refinish markets. Within its transportation coatings segment (38% of sales), management claims to be the second-largest player in the global light vehicle transportation coatings market and the leading supplier to the North American heavy-duty truck market.Meanwhile, in performance coating (62% of sales), the company is the leading player in the refinish market (which tends to be less cyclical than the automotive OEM market) and the second-largest player in the industrial coatings market. Other leading players in the market include  ,  , and  .Here's a quick summation of the sales trends in the third quarter so you can see how Axalta generates revenue. For reference, the performance coatings segment has roughly double the margin of transportation coatings -- which is good news, because the refinish market is less cyclical.However, growth in the refinish market wasn't enough to send overall sales higher. Whichever way you look at it, it's clear that the marginal difference in the company's prospects will come from light vehicle OEM coatings and industrial coatings. I'll come back to this point in a moment.Data source: Axalta presentations.Another key point to note is that Axalta's management is  Management is open to a potential sale, and the company has been subject to continual takeover speculation. Indeed, PPG is reportedly looking at making an offer, and Akzo Nobel and Axalta previously discussed a merger in 2017, while private equity firms are also believed to be circling the company.So with the takeover buzz and Buffett behind the stock, what is there not to like about it?I have two arguments.First, it's never a good idea for private investors to buy a stock buoyed by takeover speculation that they wouldn't ordinarily hold. You are effectively trading against people who might be much more informed than you about a key corporate matter such as a takeover bid.Moreover, If a bid doesn't transpire, you will be left holding a stock you might not want, and Axalta isn't a particularly cheap stock. The following chart compares its enterprise value (market cap plus net debt) to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) with a collection of automotive suppliers -- reflecting its exposure to automotive OEM -- and also a couple of auto parts retailers, y and  -- reflecting its automotive refinish exposure.As you can see, you can buy automotive suppliers on much lower valuations, and if you want, you can buy the high-valuation-but- auto parts retailers. data by Second, you are not Warren Buffett! Of course it makes sense to follow a legendary investor like Buffett, but the fact is that with Axalta, Berkshire Hathaway owns slightly more than 10% of the company, and Buffett's word carries huge influence over the market. In other words, Buffett is in a position to guide what happens with the stock, particularly with regard to a takeover, but you are not. He gets to have a huge influence on whether the company is sold and at what price, but you do not.All told, I think the answer is no, at least it's a no right now. Axalta operates in an integral part of the economy and, at some point, light vehicle production will surely stabilize and start to grow again while the automotive refinish market has solid growth prospects.That said, there are better value stocks with which you can get automotive exposure right now, and the stock is arguably being supported by takeover speculation that may or may not occur.\u00a0When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That's right -- they\u00a0think these 10\u00a0stocks are even better buys.At this time, I'd like to introduce Greg Johnson.  -- Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts third-quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning are Jeff Shaw, our chief operating officer and co-president; and Tom McFall, our chief financial officer. David O'Reilly, our executive chairman; and Greg Henslee, our executive vice chairman, are also present.It's my pleasure to congratulate Team O'Reilly on our excellent performance in the third quarter and to thank every member of the team for their unwavering commitment to our company's culture of providing excellent customer service to each and every one of our valued customers. After seeing some weather-driven volatility in the first half of 2019, demand in our industry evened out in the third quarter, and our team did an excellent job of taking advantage of the solid industry backdrop to deliver a strong 5% comparable store sales growth in the quarter, which is at the top end of our guidance range. I'm pleased that our team was able to translate this top line performance into an 11% increase in operating profit dollars and a 13% increase in earnings per share to $5.08 per share, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range by $0.25. Our third-quarter performance is the result of our team's relentless focus on excellent customer service and expense control.Year to date, our comparable store sales growth stands at 3.9%, which is consistent with prior year and in line with our full-year guidance we have maintained throughout the year at 3 to 5%. Now, I'd like to provide some additional color on the composition of our third-quarter comparable store sales results. Both the DIY and professional sides of our business contributed positively to our comp growth in the third quarter, with professional again being the stronger contributor. Part of the performance of the professional side of our business is the result of a calendar benefit from one less Sunday during the third quarter this year as compared to 2018.Sunday is our lowest-volume day of the week on the professional side and the impact of one less Sunday was a benefit of roughly 50 basis points to our total comp sales for the quarter. During the first quarter of 2019, we had one additional Sunday versus 2018. So through the first nine months, we're even on Sunday and there's no impact to our year-to-date comps. Even adjusting for this benefit, we saw a robust comparable ticket growth in our professional business during the quarter, driven by strong performance in key undercar hard parts categories, including brakes, ride control and chassis, as well as more typical performance in hot weather-related categories.Ticket counts in our DIY business continued to see pressure, consistent with our recent trends as customers on this side of our business remain more susceptible to the rising price environment. However, in total, our comparable ticket counts were positive for the quarter. The long-term driver of increased parts complexity, coupled with the current inflationary environment, continues to drive increases in average ticket, which accounted for the majority of our comp increase in our third quarter. On a year-over-year basis, we have experienced product acquisition cost inflation driven by tariffs and other input cost increases passed on from our suppliers.As has been the historical experience in our industry, the nondiscretionary nature and immediacy of need in the products sold in the aftermarket has allowed our industry to rationally pass through these acquisition cost increases. The impact of those top line increases accelerated in the third quarter as the most recent round of tariffs went into effect and our industry began passing through these costs at the beginning of the third quarter. We would expect to see a continued tailwind from the benefit of these price increases in the fourth quarter, though to a lesser extent as we began to calendar price increases that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018 driven by the first round of tariffs. Including the additional price changes we began to see in the beginning of the third quarter this year, we now expect to see a larger benefit from increasing average ticket with same SKU pricing of two and a half to 3% for the full year.As we have discussed on our last two calls, we continue to believe the pressure of rising prices to be a short-term constraint to DIY ticket count growth as much -- as our more strapped consumers react to deferred maintenance when possible, trading down to the good, better, best value spectrum when necessary repairs can't be deferred. However, we believe that consumers will adjust to price pressures and the ticket count growth in our business will return to historical trends over time. As I previously mentioned, we saw more normal weather patterns in the third quarter than we saw in the first half of the year. We would describe sales of seasonal products as being as expected and did not significantly benefit from catch-up of pent-up demand on seasonal products.Adjusted for the Sunday shift, the cadence of the third-quarter sales were also very steady as we saw very consistent results, especially in core hard parts categories throughout the quarter and have seen a similar start to the fourth quarter thus far in October. Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we continue to have confidence in the strength of the broader aftermarket, characterized by stable employment and general macroeconomic conditions, low gas prices, modest increases in miles driven and increasing age and complexity of vehicles. In line with these market conditions and based our performance so far in 2019, we're establishing our fourth-quarter comparable store sales guidance at 3 to 5% and reiterating our full-year comparable store sales guidance of 3 to 5%. As always, our team remains focused on providing the best possible service to our customers, and we remain very confident in our ability to gain share and generate results which outperform the market.For the quarter, our gross margin of 53.3% was a 35 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2018 margin and was a high end -- or was at the high end of our expectations for the quarter. We continued to see stability in gross margin even in light of pressure from tariffs and other input cost increases as pricing remains rational in our industry. We are leaving our gross margin guidance for the full-year unchanged at 52.7% to 53.2% of sales though, as Tom will discuss in his prepared comments, we now expect to come in near the top end of that range. Our operating profit dollar growth was 11% for the third quarter, which represents our strongest quarter growth since 2016.We also expect our operating profit as a percentage of sales to come in at the top end of our previously guided range of 18.7 to 19.2%. Moving on to earnings per share. Our third-quarter EPS of $5.08 was an increase of 13% over last year. And on a year-to-date basis for the first three quarters, our EPS of $13.63 was an increase of 10% over 2018.We're establishing our fourth-quarter guidance at $4.12 to $4.22. Based on our strong sales and profit results for the quarter, our expectations for the fourth-quarter profit and EPS tailwinds from shares repurchased, we're raising our full-year EPS guidance to $17.75 to $17.85. Our full-year guidance includes the impact of shares repurchased through this call but does not include any additional share repurchases. Again, I would like to thank our team of over 82,000 dedicated team members for the outstanding third-quarter performance.I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Shaw. Jeff? -- Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin today by echoing Greg's comments on the dedication of Team O'Reilly. As a result of the hard work and commitment of each of our store and DC team members, we were able to produce strong results in the third quarter, at the top end of our expectations. In my comments today, I'll provide some color on our performance in the third quarter and discuss our organic store and DC expansion plans, and I'll also touch on the exciting plans we have to expand our company's footprint into Mexico with our upcoming acquisition of Mayasa Auto Parts.Our success has been built on the foundation of the O'Reilly culture of excellent customer service, and we remain very confident in our team's ability to seize on growth opportunities as we expand into new markets. I'll begin my comments today by discussing our SG&A results for the third quarter. We were pleased to be able to leverage SG&A expenses 22 basis points during the quarter as a result of the strong comp performance and effective expense management by our teams. On an average per-store basis, SG&A grew two and a half percent, which was in line with our expectations for the quarter.As we discussed on last quarter's conference call, we've experienced continued pressure in SG&A this year from rising wages and other variable costs in the current tight labor market and those pressures continued in the third quarter. However, the year-over-year comparisons ease as we calendar against the increased payroll spend in 2018 from our reallocation of the savings from the tax reform, which had ramped fully by the third quarter of 2018. We're maintaining our guidance range for full-year growth in SG&A per store of two and a half to 3%, and we expect to come in toward the higher end of that range based on the ongoing inflationary environment, which is consistent from our second-quarter call. Our strategy for managing our operating expense spend for 2019 continues to be focused on ensuring we are equipping our store teams with the resources they need to provide excellent customer service while also driving omnichannel and technology initiatives to capitalize on opportunities to drive increased sales and improve efficiency and operating profit.Next, I'd like to provide an update on our store expansion during the quarter and our plans for the remainder of the year and for 2020. In the third quarter, we opened 76 new stores, bringing our total year-to-date 2019 store openings to 181 net new stores and significantly closing the shortfall to our quarterly plan for new store openings, which was caused by weather-related construction delays in the first half of the year. We remain very confident we will achieve our goal with opening 200 net new stores in 2019. We're very pleased with the performance of our new stores and continue to be excited about our opportunities to identify great locations and great store teams to profitably grow our business in markets across the country.A key factor in our successful expansion is the consistent industry-leading support of our distribution teams. Our ability to provide the best parts availability in the aftermarket is the result of the excellent job our distribution teams do on a daily basis to support our stores, coupled with our ongoing commitment to enhance our distribution advantages through continued investments in distribution infrastructure and technology. We continue to progress on schedule with our three DC projects and we'll open our new facility in Twinsburg, Ohio, just south of Cleveland, during the fourth quarter. Our ability to deploy the right inventory at the right location within our supply chain and get parts in the hands of our customers faster than our competitors is one of the keys to our success.We're very confident in our team's ability to successfully manage the distribution expansion projects currently under way and to continue to capitalize on our advantage in parts availability. As Greg announced in our press release yesterday, we've set a new store growth target of 180 net new stores in 2020. Our 2020 new store growth target is slightly below our growth number from the past several years, which reflects the significant effort and resources that we will direct toward our international expansion into Mexico. As we announced in August, we've entered into a definitive agreement to purchase Mayasa Auto Parts headquartered in Guadalajara, Mexico.First, to update on the progress of the transaction. We're working diligently through the customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals and still expect to close before the end of the year. As we've discussed for the past few years, we view expansion outside of the U.S. as a natural next step in our long-term growth strategy, and we focused on evaluating opportunities closer to home in North America in both Mexico and Canada, which have similar vehicle populations.Our process has involved both evaluating the potential opportunities present in the automotive aftermarket in these countries, as well as understanding the competitive landscape and potential acquisition targets to partner with for our expansion strategy. Throughout our history at O'Reilly, we've taken pride in sticking to the fundamentals and making sure we grind out the day-to-day blocking and tackling of executing our business, and we've taken the same detailed approach to working through our evaluation of international expansion. The results of this process have only served to reaffirm to us that we have a great opportunity in Mexico to enhance value for our shareholders as we meld our proven business strategies in partnership with an outstanding company in Mayasa. From their beginnings over 65 years ago, Mayasa's history has mirrored our own history at O'Reilly as a family owned company that has grown into a very successful supplier in the aftermarket by focusing on the same fundamental culture values of hard work and excellent customer service.The Orendain family has built a strong, highly respected business through its five distribution centers, which support 20 company-owned stores and an expansive independent jobber customer base across Mexico. At this time, Mayasa's company-owned stores represent the smaller portion of the business and the overall magnitude of this transaction is not material in comparison to our existing U.S. business. However, this partnership represents a tremendous foundation for us to grow upon from the platform that Mayasa has established to expand the base of company-owned stores over time and become a major competitor at a national level in Mexico.As we look forward to executing this strategy, we're excited to partner with Mayasa's seasoned management team who will continue to operate the business in conjunction with O'Reilly's experienced leadership team. While we're anxious to close the transaction and get started, we will be cautious at the pace at which we move forward in Mexico. Just as it was during our evaluation process, we will be very focused on ensuring we take the time to learn the Mexican market, work with the Mayasa team to develop the growth strategy and invest in developing solid leadership and infrastructure that will move us forward in Mexico. We're very happy to welcome the over 1,100 hard-working and dedicated Mayasa team members to the O'Reilly family, and we look forward to the closing of the transaction in the fourth quarter.To close my comments, I would like to once again thank Team O'Reilly for their outstanding performance in the third quarter and continued dedication to our customers. Our team's execution has driven solid results in the first three quarters of 2019, and we're in a great position to finish the year strong. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom. -- Thanks, Jeff. I would also like to thank all of Team O'Reilly for their continued commitment to our customers, which drove our strong results in the third quarter. Now we'll take a closer look at our quarterly results. For the quarter, sales increased $184 million, comprised of $122 million increase in comp store sales; a $57 million increase in non-comp store sales, which includes the contribution from the acquired Bennett stores; a $7 million increase in non-comp, non-store sales; and a $2 million decrease from closed stores.For 2019, we continue to expect our total revenue to be 10 to $10.3 billion. As Greg previously mentioned, our gross margin is up 35 basis points for the third quarter. On a year-over-year basis, third-quarter gross margin benefited from the sell-through of on-hand inventory that was purchased prior to tariff-driven acquisition price increases, which have gone into effect in stages starting in the second half of 2018 and continuing throughout 2019 and the corresponding retail and wholesale price increases. When we established guidance for 2019 at the beginning of the year, we expected this gross margin benefit from the sell-through of lower-cost inventory to be bigger in the first half of the year based on the then current tariffs and pricing environment.However, with the most recent round of acquisition cost increases, driven significantly by the last round of tariffs but also by other inflation being passed on by our suppliers, we are seeing an additional benefit to our gross margin. This benefit will continue in the fourth quarter of 2019, which is the driver of our expectation that gross margins will be at the top end of our full-year guidance range, as Greg mentioned earlier. While we are not yet prepared to provide gross margin guidance for 2020, we would expect this tailwind to gross margin to carry forward into next year but decrease quarter by quarter as we turn the low-cost inventory and anniversary tariff price increases. Our expectations are based on the current tariff and inflation landscape, but the impact on our gross margin will ultimately be determined by the timing of inflation, tariffs and any corresponding market price changes.Most importantly, we continue to be pleased with our industry's ability to retain rational pricing and pass through cost increases and are confident, based on the nondiscretionary nature of demand for the products we sell, we will be able to sustain this strategy moving forward. Our third-quarter effective tax rate was 22% of pre-tax income, which was below our expectation and comprised of the base rate of 22.5%, reduced by 0.5% benefit for share-based compensation, both of which were better than our expectations. This compares to the third quarter of 2018 rate of 19.6% of pre-tax income, which was comprised of a base tax rate of 22.6%, reduced by 3% benefit for share-based compensation. As a reminder, the third quarter is typically lower than the remainder of the year due to the tolling of certain open tax periods and the better-than-expected base tax rate this quarter as the result of positive resolution of certain tax matters in the quarter.For the full year of 2019, we now expect an effective tax rate of 23%, comprised of a base rate of 23.8%, reduced by a benefit of 0.8% for share-based compensation. However, changes in tax benefit from share-based compensation could create fluctuations in our quarterly tax rate. Now we'll move on to free cash flow and the components that drove our results for the quarter and our guidance expectations for the full year of 2019. Free cash flow for the first nine months of 2019 was $995 million versus 959 million in the first nine months of 2018.As Greg noted in yesterday's press release, a big driver of the year-over-year increase in free cash flow relates to our investment in solar projects that generate investment tax credits, and the timing of these investments can create unevenness in our cash flows. Based on when these solar projects come online, we expect this timing difference in free cash flow to normalize during the fourth quarter. Absent this timing effect, free cash flow is lower year to date, with the reduction driven by increased capex, offset in part by higher pre-tax income. For the full year, we're maintaining our free cash flow guidance in the range of 1 to $1.1 billion.Inventory per store at the end of the quarter was 618,000, which is up 1% from the beginning of the year and up 2.1% from this time last year. We continue to expect to grow per store inventory in the range of two to two and a half percent this year as a result of acquisition cost increases and the fourth-quarter opening of the Twinsburg DC putting pressure on the growth percentage. Our EPD inventory ratio at the end of this quarter was 108%, which is up from 106% from the end of 2018. We now expect to finish 2019 around 107%.Finally, capital expenditures for the first nine months of the year were $481 million, which is up $131 million from the same period of 2018, driven by our ongoing investment in new DC projects, the conversion of the Bennett stores, new store growth and technology investments. We continue to forecast capex to come in between 625 and 675 million for the full year. Moving on to debt. We finished the third quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.28 times as compared to our ratio of 2.23 times at the end of 2018.The increase in our leverage reflects our May bond issuance and the borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility. We're below our stated leverage target of 2.5 times and we'll approach that number when appropriate. We continue to execute our share repurchase program, and year to date, we repurchased 3.6 million shares at an average share price $364.84 for a total investment of $1.3 billion. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, and through the date of our press release, we repurchased 0.1 million shares at an average price $393.33.We remain very confident that the average repurchase price is supported by expected discounted future cash flows to our business, and we continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning available cash to our shareholders. Before I open up our call to your questions, I'd like to thank the O'Reilly Team for their outstanding performance in the third quarter and for their continued dedication to our company and our customers. This concludes our prepared comments. And at this time, I like to ask John, the operator, to return to the line and we'll be happy to answer your questions.[Operator instructions] And our first question is from Chris Horvers from JP Morgan. -- Thanks. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask a little bit about the DIY business and sort of what you're seeing on the sequential trends in the do-it-yourself business. As you pass along more price increases, what have you seen from an elasticity deferral perspective? In one hand, prices are higher.But on the other hand, miles driven have generally picked up since bottoming in the back half of last year and we think that's a nice driver of that business and the overall business. So how is this balanced out in terms of deferred expanding? -- Sure, Chris. Third quarter, we were up slightly on the cash, the DIY side of our business. If the tariffs and inflation persist, we feel like the more cash-strapped consumer will have to make some decisions, not much different than what we would face with rising fuel prices and ordinary inflation. And while we haven't seen a lot of evidence of deferred maintenance, it would be somewhat likely that that would be a decision that that consumer might make if they were having financial difficulties to defer -- not, not complete those maintenance cycles but defer those and extend those maintenance cycles out a little bit longer.So we haven't seen a lot of evidence. Those more elastic categories are more the maintenance categories like oil and things like that. And we haven't seen any evidence that there's been a big shift there, but that could happen these tariffs and inflationary -- should this inflationary environment continue. -- What I would add to that, Chris, is ticket comps were up slightly on the DIY side. Total comps were relatively strong, although as Greg mentioned in his prepared comments, the professional business continues to lead the way in total comps. When we look at our category performance, items that can be deferred, especially on the DIY side, are a little bit lagging, whereas our hard parts business, things that you need to run your car, continue to be good on both sides of the business. -- And then as you think about -- have your tried to disaggregate the strength in the hard parts business between price and unit to try to tease out how the car park improving this year and even more so next year, if that's -- how much of that is driving the -- this commercial comp acceleration, which is accelerating on a stock basis? -- So not to break down the individual numbers, but when we look over the last few years with the lighter SAAR years coming into the professional side of the business really entering our market, which tend to be to -- the newer the car, the sooner it's off warranty, the higher propensity is to be serviced by a professional. That put pressure on us over the last couple of years when we were seeing that abate. When we look at our category type performance, especially items like brakes which are routinely repaired or changed out after they come out of warranty, we continue to do well on that side. So we think the -- that bubble moving into our years and then higher SAAR years coming into our market off-warranty bodes well, has been a positive this year or not a negative, and we'd expect that to continue into the next year. -- Thanks. Best of luck, guys.Our next question is from Matt McClintock from Raymond James. -- Hi. Yes, good morning everyone. I was wondering, just given the magnitude of this being your first time going into a different country, if you could just remind us how you think about the Mexican market overall, the opportunities there, how it's different than the United States market? Just give us a little bit more context just so we can frame it in general. -- Sure. Great question, Matt. One of the things, kind of going back, we've been talking about entering markets outside of U.S. for a few years now.And we've been looking, obviously, in Mexico, as well as in other North American countries for that right opportunity. What I would tell you is that the Mexico opportunity seemed to come about more quickly than other areas of North America. And as we moved into Mexico, we really were looking for acquisition candidates that check several boxes that we needed to have checked. And some of those include they need to have a solid store base.They need to have a leadership team that was grounded and understood the marketplace very well. They needed to be a good culture fit for our company. And they needed to have scalable systems. And while we looked at some companies along the way that were larger than the Mayasa organization, the Mayasa organization seemed to check all of those boxes.So very solid leadership team. As Jeff said in his prepared comments, they've been in business for well over 60 years. The leadership team in Mexico will remain in place and will work very closely with our company's leadership to direct our future opportunities down there. Now what I would tell you is we haven't closed on the deal yet and there is much work to be done, which, as Jeff said, was one of the reasons that we reduced our store count outlook for 2020, is because of the level of effort that goes into preparing for growth in Mexico.And again, the Mayasa organization gives us the ability to do that. They've got distribution. They've got the knowledge of the marketplace. But our real estate team and operations teams have a great deal of work to do to really understand, to fully understand that marketplace and learn from the Orendain family and the leadership to drive our future growth in Mexico.Jeff, did you want to add anything to that? -- No. I mean, you covered it pretty well. I mean it's obviously a new market and we've got a lot to learn. But when you go down there and visit the markets, I mean, it's like the U.S.four years ago. I mean it's a highly fragmented market. There's really not that many chains of any size, AutoZone being the biggest. But there's just a ton of small independent jobber business.So it's obviously a much smaller market than U.S., but we're very excited about entering the market and growing our business down there. -- Well, it sounds pretty exciting. I wish you all the best of luck. Thanks for the color.Our next question is from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. -- Thanks a lot. I'd love to follow up a little bit more on the pass-through of inflation and the response from both DIY and do-it-for-me. Specifically, you mentioned already some of the potential deferral. What have you guys been able to do to help offset or mitigate that by maybe growing private label or offering a different sort of assortment both in hard parts and maybe more traditional maintenance stuff? -- OK. Thanks, Greg. This is Tom. Just to clarify one item on Chris' question earlier when he asked about DIY ticket trends.What I meant to say was the trend was slightly positive but continues to be under pressure. To answer your question, Michael, we continue to look for ways to entice our DIY customers to repair their vehicles. We do a lot of work online with how to repair vehicles. We're promotional in our industry.But really, we think our best opportunity is to continue to grow that base is to provide great customer service, know-how, tool loaners, testing, so that as these consumers feel the pinch of higher prices, they feel more confident in their ability to repair their vehicles and save money that way. -- Do you see indirectly any of that happening on the hard part side where you're getting the unit demand but people are maybe changing the mix on older cars? -- Not any more than what we've normally seen. When you look at the life cycle of our good, better, best product levels, as the vehicle gets older in that life cycle, the consumer tends to buy more toward the good or better end of the spectrum. There's exceptions to that, but overall leading into the higher-end vehicles would tend -- and the professional side of our business would lean more toward the higher end of that good, better, best spectrum. And then the older the vehicle gets, the more likely they are to trade down to the lower end of that spectrum. -- Got it. And then my follow-up was on Mexico and the grander scheme of the growth algorithm. I think you mentioned stores now being about 180. Is that the number you guys said in the beginning? -- No, company-owned stores is 20 in Mexico. -- Got it. But for the company, now we're going to do 180 net new stores next year? -- Yes. -- And so should we be -- is that just like in the -- is that because next year you're doing Mexico? And should we think about the 180 as a step-down that could step up again? Or is it more of like look at -- look for the U.S. business to do three and a half percent footage growth and now the additional point of footage growth might come out of Mexico? -- What I would tell you is we still feel like we can operate somewhere in the neighborhood of 6,500 stores in the U.S., and our U.S. growth over time will continue as we approach that number. But what we're going to do is we're going to kind of blend that growth between the U.S. and countries outside the U.S., the first being Mexico. -- To add to Greg's comment, we felt like it was prudent having gone through a number of acquisitions, knowing how important it is to get the foundation of that acquisition right before we move forward. That we, as a company, are going to allocate a lot of time to understanding the Mexican market, developing our plan and to make sure that we can put the appropriate amount of focus on developing and starting that plan. We're going to back off new stores just for this year. I don't think it indicates anything about future years of what we're going to do.We're going to run our business with the mind of continuing to grow our store base profitably and set that going forward, but we wouldn't say that this is an indication we think the total number of stores we can open in U.S. or our ability to open stores has changed. -- All right, that's clear. Thanks a lot guys and good luck, too.Our next question is from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital. -- Good morning guys. Scot Ciccarelli. I guess, I have a bigger picture question for you guys. So historically, this industry kind of viewed a sweet spot for cars entering their initial repair stage at maybe six to eight years old for the pro side of the business.But a recurring theme for a long time is we keep hearing about, let's call it, sluggish ticket counts being offset by higher average ticket. So my question is this, with parts continuing to be made better and lasting longer, should we start to think about that initial repair stage maybe starting later in the vehicle's life? In other words, could we have seen -- or are we seeing, I should say, the sweet spot maybe shifts to seven to nine years or eight to 10 years where they really come into that kind of initial repair stage for your pro customers? -- Yeah. Scot, what I would tell you is I don't know the starting point of that sweet spot has moved that much. But I think the sweet spot itself has expanded because vehicles are just lasting longer. If you look at whether it's five to seven, six to eight, six to 10, I think that that initial inflection point of the sweet spot is driven by the vehicles coming off warranty.As soon as those vehicles come off warranty, a lot of those maintenance and repair items go to the professional installer. And then over time, as those vehicles get older, we benefit on the DIY side as well. But vehicles are just lasting longer, vehicles lasting between 11 and 12 years now. And a lot of times vehicles that are on their second and third ownership pattern are being maintained, as well as they were when they came off the assembly line. -- OK. Just conceptually like you owned the -- yes, I understand that it comes off the warranty and then you start taking it somewhere other than the dealer and you start using aftermarket parts but, I don't know, let's call it is the breaks and the starter. Maybe it doesn't need to be changed, right, at six years. You really can last till seven or eight or nine years.I guess, that was the thought process. -- So what I would add to that, Scot, is a lot of the routine maintenance items, when you look at oil change intervals, fluid change intervals, when you look at tune-up type items, those have definitely expanded with different technologies that cost more to do but don't happen as often. When you look, a lot of our core items: brakes, belts, hoses, rotating electrical, batteries, that hasn't changed dramatically. But some of those categories that have changed and have been spread out, example oil changes where it used to be 3,000 miles and now your car tells you when you should change your oil with synthetic or semi-synthetic, those had a lot -- have a lot of ticket count but don't have the per-transaction value that hard part repairs have. -- OK, thanks, guys.Our next question is from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. -- Thanks, everyone. So you're on track to hit, looks like, your midpoint of your comp guidance of about 4%. You mentioned there's a little bit of help from price hitting 2 to 3% now for the full year, if I heard that right. So if you look at it that way, the underlying growth is more like 2% -- maybe 1 to 2%, arguably.And if you look in the past, your business seemed to have averaged something a little bit higher than that with no inflation, 2 to 3% or even better than that with no inflation. Do you diagnose it in that same way? Or how do you diagnose it? Is underlying demand softer? And then when we start to lap some of this pricing, will the units go back up? I don't know if that's how it should work but curious to hear your thoughts on that. -- So when we look at our business, I think we've been pretty clear that the professional side of the business where the average consumer or end consumer is less price sensitive, continues to see good unit growth and average ticket growth, and that's why that side of the business continues to lead. On the DIY side of the business, we have pressure on our ticket count from rising prices so that is limiting what the comp is on that side. So we still feel very good about a 5% comp in the third quarter. When we look at annualizing these price increases, I think our direction is similar to where we've see shocks in gas prices.We would expect that the DIY side will -- the average consumer will become adjusted to what the current prices are and that we will see, as we annualize these increases, less pressure on count. -- OK. So I think it just, if I could paraphrase, it seems like there's really no impact to the do-it-for-me demand side or unit count. It's really the do-it-yourself sort of would explain maybe some of that -- some of the underlying the softness, I guess? -- Well, I don't know that we would characterize it as soft when we deliver 5% comps. We're very, very happy with that result. -- Fair enough. Can I ask this one follow-up? Have you thought about a scenario in which tariffs get revoked? I don't know if you plan for that or thinking through that, but what percentage of the price increases could the industry -- do you think the industry could keep? -- Well, we'll have to see what happens with tariffs. As we've talked about on our quarterly calls, starting with the first quarter, our guidance anticipates that the current inflationary/tariff environment will remain. And we will adjust our business accordingly when those changes occur. But to speak about something that hasn't occurred or may not occur is probably not the appropriate thing to do. -- Thank you.Our next question is from Michael Lasser from UBS. -- Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. There was a little bit of confusion in terms of some of the commentary about the consumer response to the price increases. And on the one hand, it seems as though there was a comment that you're anticipating some unit demand destruction from the price increases.On the other hand, there was indication that some categories that were deferrable, like motor oil and some other areas where -- actually mean some unit demand destruction from price increases. So could you clarify what category -- if they're actually seeing some elastic response and what categories right now? -- Yeah. Michael, we're not seeing any. Again, our professional side of our business was very strong. So what we've been talking about here is the DIY side of our business.And we haven't seen any of the elastic categories take a big hit because of this. What we would say in summary is if inflation persists, again, no different than ordinary inflation or gas prices or what have you, that that consumer may have to make some decisions. And what those decisions may be would be deferring or extending maintenance cycles on those categories, some of which are more elastic, or perhaps trading down from a good, better, best spectrum on required repairs. -- OK. And so is the way to characterize what happened this quarter is everything remained largely stable. You didn't see as much of a negative impact from the weather plus you had a slightly higher benefit from pricing this quarter and then -- and that's all adjusting out for the extra Sunday. Is that a fair way to think about it? -- I think it is, yes. -- OK. And then my last question is for Tom. Is there a scenario in 2020 where SG&A per store doesn't grow two and a half percent or above? And what's the likelihood of that? -- Well, we're not going to -- we're not giving guidance for 2020. But I'll reiterate what we've said on previous conference calls is to the extent that the labor market remains tight, we would expect to continue to have pressure on our SG&A growth. That's the biggest expense that we have in that line. And really, that pressure of higher wages impacts everything that we do and a business does.But we would expect to see, if that were the case, continued inflation in selling price to help offset that. -- Thank you.Our next question is from Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse. -- Hey, guys, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on capex. So obviously, this year, there was a big increase related to some of the DC work and store conversions.I'd assume some natural step-down next year, particularly with less U.S. store growth. But can you just discuss some of the capital requirements related to Mayasa and whether there's going to be a need for any sort of meaningful investment within that chain at some point? -- So this is Tom. We would expect to have a lower capex level next year just based on not having three ongoing DC projects, although it will continue to be elevated because two of the projects will still be ongoing. To speculate on Mayasa right now and what we'll do next year is premature. We haven't even closed on the business.But our expectation over time is that we have a great opportunity to grow a large store base in Mexico and we'll deploy capital successfully in Mexico. But to Jeff's earlier comments, we really want to make sure we understand the market, have the team in place, have the infrastructure in place before we commit additional capital to start growing that store base robustly. -- Got it. Understood. OK. And then I just want to follow up on pricing.How would you guys categorize the competitive landscape today from a pricing perspective? Do you feel like it's rational? Have competitors followed some of your moves on pricing? And then sort of related, when you analyze your price gaps versus some of the emerging competitors in the space, whether that's pure-play online companies or whoever that is, have you seen any major change in those price gaps as you guys have taken pricing up? -- Sure. So what I would say is we've seen very little change in the competitive landscape. Our industry still is very rational from a pricing perspective. And there are categories that we lead and move up in and typically, our competitors will follow, and I guess, vice versa.That holds true as well. But we -- our industry has always been very rational and continues to be very rational from a pricing perspective. As far as online, really haven't seen a lot of change there, except for the method by which some of the brick-and-mortar retailers price online. I think it's become more typical that our price points are the same or very similar to what we have in the stores.And we offer discounts across the ticket to be more competitive with pure online retailers. And again, a lot of times there's a perception out there that when you're looking at brand to brand, we might not be competitive from a pricing standpoint. But when you look at it from an application-to-application standpoint, we are consistently very competitive from a price point standpoint. That consumer is buying products online.For price, we'll be able to go out and look for a part for his vehicle that maybe we have on a proprietary brand at equal to or sometimes less than what the pure online retailers are selling at. -- Thanks, guys.The next question is from Chris Bottiglieri from Wolfe Research. -- Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. I guess, first question is kind of wanted to think through the impact of opening DCs. It's great to see you opening DCs again. It's been a while.Kind of what are the impact on comps that you've observed when you open a DC? Is there any kind of quantifiable uplift in that market? And then two, how do we think about the margin cadence? I would think maybe initial headwind of some kind and then it becomes a tailwind but just kind of curious how you're thinking about the net of those. -- I might take the first part, this is Jeff, and then let Tom or Greg chime in. But any time you open a DC in a given market, I mean, that market could be serviced by a hub store carrying somewhere from 45,000 to 65,000, 70,000 SKUs. And opening that DC, we have availability same day, several times a day availability to 160,000 to 170,000 SKUs. So when you have that inventory available, you're just able to say yes to the DIY customer or the professional customer or fill the -- fulfill the B2B ticket more times than not where before it would have been available overnight.So I don't know if it's exactly quantifiable, but it's sure another tool in the tool box for those stores in that given market serviced by that new DC. -- And from a cost perspective, our history has been to continue to grow our store base and expand DCs really beyond the range that's ideal from efficiency standpoint for them to run and to overload their store count, which makes them internally inefficient before we open a new DC. So as we open these new DCs and unload the stores from overloaded DCs, it makes their labor more efficient. It makes the miles driven more efficient. So we don't see a real big impact in our gross margin on a comparative basis. -- OK. A quick follow-up on the gross margin commentary from tariffs you said earlier. I just want to kind of confirm, maybe it through a little bit more. So you expect the gross margins to be up year over year and accelerate the Q4 and then decelerate but still positive year over year into 2020.Is that the right way to look at it? Like -- or how should -- like maybe just clarify a little bit. I wasn't quite sure what the answer was. -- So we're seeing a benefit in our POS margin as prices have moved up with the tariffs. I mean, basically we have a slow-turn industry. So we have an amount of inventory that we purchased before the tariff increase so we make a higher gross margin. So that was a benefit here in the third quarter.It will be a benefit in the fourth quarter. As we sell through that merchandise and reduce that amount that was basically sitting in LIFO, we will see that tailwind diminish quarter by quarter next year. -- Got you. OK. But still up, though, is the answer, or no? -- The answer for the fourth quarter is we expect to see strong gross margins, which will drive us to the top end of our gross margin -- full-year gross margin guidance. -- Thank you.Our next question is from Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities. -- Thanks a lot, and good morning. I have a question as it relates to the number of employees. On a per-store basis, we saw a bit of a decline year over year this quarter. Is that because of the mix shift toward full time? Or are you managing your employee base a little bit differently? -- I think we fielded this question on a few different conference calls. We have, obviously, a large employee base and that number is a point-in-time number. So depending on the time of the week it ends, depending on how many jobs we have that are open and the fluctuation, especially on the part time, that number can fluctuate, but it's not an indication of any actual a change in our business staffing philosophy. And for that, I'll turn it over to Jeff. -- Really, I mean, we run our business one store at a time and have the appropriate staffing to take care of the business in that market. And then that seasonally ramps up and ramps down depending on the time of the year. Obviously, we're kind of in the ramp-down mode a little bit coming out of summer, going into fall and winter. So nothing's changed structurally on how we run our business.We've always ran our business for the long haul, provide excellent customer service each and every day. -- Got it. And just a follow-up, a clarifying question. Tom, did you say that DIY ticket count, so traffic on a comparable store basis was up or down this quarter? And how did that trend relative to the last two quarters? -- Yeah. I'd make sure I get it right this time. The number continues to be under pressure, so it was negative. It was slightly improved from the second quarter is what I was attempting to say. -- I understand now. Thank you.And we have reached our allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Greg Johnson for closing remarks. -- Thank you, John. We'd like to conclude our call today by thanking the entire O'Reilly team for your continued hard work in delivering a strong third quarter. I'd like to thank everyone for joining our call today, and we look forward to reporting our fourth-quarter and full-year results in February.

The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock.  Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much \u2014 that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist.

For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger.  Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and \"tosses out\" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller \"up-and-comers\" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals).

(Symbol: ORLY) saw new options become available this week, for the May 2020 expiration.  One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 234 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ORLY options chain for the new May 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $390.00 strike price has a current bid of $26.00.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $390.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $364.00 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ORLY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $399.97/share today.\n\nBecause the $390.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 61%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.67% return on the cash commitment, or 10.40% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $390.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $410.00 strike price has a current bid of $30.20.  If an investor was to purchase shares of ORLY stock at the current price level of $399.97/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $410.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 10.06% if the stock gets called away at the May 2020 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ORLY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing ORLY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $410.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $410.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 49%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.55% boost of extra return to the investor, or 11.78% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 28%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 27%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $399.97) to be 24%.

While it's important to note that most economists are not forecasting a recession, investors may still want to position themselves for one, or at least increase the weight of defensive stocks in their portfolios. In this context, here are three investment themes and stocks to prepare for a recessionary scenario.Image source: Getty ImagesFirst, let's consider a few types of businesses, and the attributes that position them to outperform in a recession.Now, let's review some of the details behind these assertions.You'd be hard-pressed to find many groups of stocks that grew both revenue and earnings through the last recession, but that's exactly what the auto parts retailers did, as the chart below shows. Trailing 12-month (TTM) revenue and earnings rose in the 2007-2011 period and it's no coincidence that U.S. light-vehicle sales declined over the period. Simply put, declining sales of new cars mean more miles driven by older cars -- which is music to the ears of those whose business it is to keep those vehicles on the road. data by Indeed, a similar pattern has been occurring in recent years, as first a slowdown and then an actual decline in light vehicle sales has been accompanied by sales growth for the auto parts retailers. data by When the next recession occurs, it's a safe bet that automobile sales will decline further, and auto parts retailers will benefit accordingly. The pick of the bunch is probably O'Reilly Automotive. Its relatively high exposure to the \"Do It For Me\" (DIFM) market (around 43% of total sales) means it's less exposed to threats from online competition. Professionals in the DIFM segment usually require their parts immediately, and will buy in-store if they can, as opposed to the Do It Yourself (DIY) crowd, who may have more time flexibility and willingness to wait for an e-tailer's delivery.During the last recession, Zoetis was still the animal healthcare segment of pharmaceutical giant  . It has since spun off publicly, but to get an idea of how it might do as a stand-alone business in a downturn, let's focus on how it performed when it was part of Pfizer.The picture is complicated further by Pfizer's merger with Wyeth (which added animal health solutions) in 2009, so I've used the figures for the legacy Pfizer animal health operations. Its flat growth in 2009 was a fairly commendable performance in a year when U.S. GDP shrank by 2.5%.Data source: Pfizer presentations.After a near 42% stock price rise so far in 2019, Zoetis now trades at 30 times its estimated 2020 EPS of $3.98 -- hardly a superficially cheap stock. There's little doubt it's been bid up by the market in part for its recession-resilient qualities. That said, if you are worried about a protracted slowdown in the economy, Zoetis is probably a good place to park some of your money.Ball Corp. is arguably the most interesting investment opportunity in this batch. It currently derives around 90% of its earnings from beverage packaging -- the rest comes from its aerospace operations. And here too, the evidence from the last recession suggests that Ball has the ability to grow its earnings during a downturn.One reason for that is that the consumption of canned beverages -- and thus, demand for Ball's products -- isn't particularly tied to the cyclical behavior of the economy.\u00a0In addition, its costs are heavily exposed to the\u00a0prices of raw materials, principally aluminum. If a protracted recession causes a slump in demand for aluminum then the decline in\u00a0Ball's cost of sales due to lower aluminum prices could more than compensate for any revenue lost, even as it passed through those some of those lower prices to its customers.A good example comes from 2009, in the heart of the Great Recession.Beverage can packaging sales volumes in the Americas and Asia were up 2%, but sales revenues were down 3% \"primarily as a result of the impact of lower aluminum prices\" according to SEC filings. However, Ball's overall cost of sales fell in 2009, more than compensating for any lost revenue -- as shown by the fact that earnings grew in 2009 and 2010.Data source: Company presentations.Fast-forward to today. The company has divested itself of its more-cyclical food and aerosol container packaging businesses, and is in the middle of ramping up capacity to meet the demand growth generated by the trends toward preferring aluminum packaging to plastic. Consequently, CEO John Hayes said he now believes long-term unit volume growth is more likely to be 4%\u00a0annually, rather than the previously forecast 2%.Ball has already proven it can grow earnings in a recession. With its enhanced growth prospects in place, it could do so again.\u00a0\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Zoetis wasn't one of them!

For one thing, the benchmark indices have not demonstrated much conviction. Further, individual names have taken some ugly dives, scaring off investors from the usual stocks to buy.Unfortunately, the situation may not improve in the nearer term. While President Trump has always spouted the message of winning against China, the actual data suggests otherwise. According to Moody\u2019s Analytics, the trade war has . Based on present trends, the firm estimates that the job loss tally will reach 450,000 by year\u2019s end.Another factor that has stymied stocks to buy is the political situation. Currently, we\u2019re in one of the most divisive eras in American history. With a high-stakes election coming up next year, Trump can\u2019t afford to look weak to his core voting base. Thus, the trade war might continue for at least another year.But in the midst of this turmoil, investors have an opportunity to go contrarian with recession-resistant services stocks to buy. Although consumers are generally incentivized to curtail spending in a downturn, some service providers are simply indelible. Others help clients save money, which is a necessity in troubled times.So without any more delays, here are my picks for recession-resistant services stocks to buy:Source: Castleski / Shutterstock.com\n\tAt first glance,  (NASDAQ:, NASDAQ:) doesn\u2019t appear an intuitive candidate for recession-resistant services stocks to buy. With its technology-centric business, and one that is increasingly geared toward the cloud, GOOGL stock would seem more vulnerable to volatility under a recession.However, what changes the calculus for GOOGL stock is YouTube. As we all know, recessions are generally unhelpful for discretionary retail names: people simply will shut down unnecessary spending. And in some ways, that applies to services stocks as well. However, Alphabet via YouTube provides a wealth of free information (amid all the other junk).I\u2019ll use a personal example. I\u2019m not the most technically inclined for household maintenance work. However, with YouTube, I\u2019ve been able to take care of several basic jobs, allowing me to save hundreds. In a recession, I think this example will be amplified tenfold, making GOOGL stock one of the surprisingly good services stocks to buy.Source: Robert Gregory Griffeth / Shutterstock.com\n\tYou don\u2019t have to do deep research to understand that auto sales decline sharply in a recession. But if you want the proof, here it is: according to the Federal Reserve\u2019s economic research arm, the retail automotive sector was one of the hardest hit segments of the economy during the 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent Great Recession.That\u2019s bad news for automakers. However, it might spell at least a stable revenue channel for  (NYSE:) and AZO stock.Part of the allure of buying a new car is the associated benefits. For instance, many dealerships offer complementary services like oil changes for the first few years of ownership (or lease). But in a recession, such offers won\u2019t be enough to overcome consumer fears. That plays into the hands of AZO stock and related services stocks to buy.Not only does AutoZone provide an extensive array of parts, their customer service team can help direct you accordingly. Combined with the do-it-yourself information available at YouTube, AZO stock appears a compelling contrarian buy in a recession.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\tOne of the difficult aspects about figuring out which services stocks to buy for a recession is the underlying assumption: nobody truly knows what\u2019s going to happen next. With the markets still relatively elevated, it seems a recovery is possible in the nearer term. But for those who think that, I\u2019d still recommend looking into  (NASDAQ:) and ORLY stock.While benchmark indices still have their foot in the bull market, the automotive sector is decidedly bearish. Earlier this summer, automotive journal Jalopnik noted that car sales have slipped to a \u201c.\u201d As I mentioned earlier, this is bad news for most automakers. However, it suits ORLY stock perfectly.Aside from offering a warehouse of parts, O\u2019Reilly also provides . These include critical functions, such as battery testing and \u201ccheck engine light\u201d testing. While complementary, these offers facilitate upselling for parts and specialized services. That\u2019s a big plus for ORLY stock as investors seek out viable opportunities in a distressed environment.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\tAmong recession-resistant services stocks to buy,  (NYSE:) is probably the least intuitive play. That assessment has only been exacerbated by the recent sharp decline in HRB stock. With the drop, shares have essentially gone flat for over the last three years. Certainly, this is not a great way to make an introduction.I\u2019ll freely admit that HRB stock has substantial risks. If you have a conservative portfolio, you may want to seek other services stocks. That said, if we fall into a recession, H&R Block\u2019s core business becomes all the more valuable.Yes, you can do your taxes yourself, which saves frontline costs. However, in the long run, you\u2019re better off with credentialed accounting advice. That applies even more so with small business owners and those with complex tax situations.Indeed, in these latter categories, people can save money in the long haul. With accountants guiding you to perfectly legal deductions, clients can maximize their financials and have peace of mind. Those are all valuable attributes that underline HRB stock.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\tSupplemental insurance provider  (NYSE:) hasn\u2019t enjoyed the best performance over the past few months. Since the middle of July, AFL stock is down nearly double digits. With some of the recessionary fears impacting trading behavior, the equity may unfortunately be choppy over the nearer term.But in the broader picture, I think the realities of an economic downturn may inspire people to consider Aflac\u2019s services. While traditional insurance programs may cover the basics, there are always potential gaps that might not be covered. In these situations, Aflac provides a valuable service, making AFL stock one of the more critical stocks to buy.On a more personal note, I , an aircraft mechanic who suffered debilitating osteoarthritis. Wright was out of work for 20 months while he concentrated on rehabilitation. Through his dedicated commitment, as well as  from employment network Allsup Employment Services, he was back on his feet.Certainly, Wright is one of the lucky ones. But his story is a reminder that our health is not guaranteed. However, companies like Aflac can provide peace of mind, which is a tremendous boost for AFL stock.Source: Shutterstock\n\tThis is an icky topic, but death is simply a part of life, ironically enough. While it\u2019s also not dinner table conversation, investments like  (NYSE:) benefit from a guaranteed bullish narrative: we have lots of people in the U.S. and they\u2019re all going to die. As one of the biggest funeral services providers, Carriage Services and CSV stock have lucrative growth opportunities.Furthermore, now might be a great time to consider CSV as one of your top recession-resistant stocks to buy. I say this because of demographic realities. Following World War II, the U.S. experienced a surge in population size. Called the baby boom, the demographic belonging to this group peaked in 1999 at .Despite many who passed, there are many more waiting to knock on St. Peter\u2019s gate. In other words, CSV stock should have ample opportunities for upside.Source: Shutterstock\n\tThe same arguments for CSV can be made for other funeral services stocks such as  (NYSE:). There are certain industries where the demand does not decrease when the economy is hurting. Unfortunately, making arrangements for deceased loved ones is one of those industries.SCI states that  \u201cprovide families with a full range of choices, from the simplest funeral arrangements to elegant ceremonies requiring intricate planning and unique features or events.\u201d That means that while simpler services may become more popular out of necessity in a major downturn, SCI can still provide those services.Source: Shutterstock\n\tPrior to its rally that started in early August,  (NYSE:) was contrary to its name not looking healthy. At one point, CVS stock was down nearly 20% for the year. And part of the reason was the competition. With disruptive names like  (NASDAQ:) or  (NYSE:) attempting to take more of the healthcare pie, CVS stock has historically absorbed serious pain.Fortunately, that appears to be changing. Since the beginning of August, CVS stock is up nearly 15%, completely altering the implications behind its chart. Against January\u2019s opening price, shares are just above break even. By itself, that\u2019s nothing to write home about. But considering where it was, investors will gladly take what they can.But a little more patience might be in order, especially if we hit a recession. Even in a downturn, people can\u2019t avoid everyday frustrations, such as getting sick. Thus, CVS enjoys secular demand, which is why you should consider it among relevant stocks to buy.Source: Shutterstock\n\tIf you still have a bad taste in your mouth about the funeral services stocks to buy, don\u2019t worry: these last two names will put a smile on your face.I\u2019m going to start this duo of stocks to buy with  (NASDAQ:), a medical insurance provider for your pets. Specifically, Trupanion insures dogs and cats, but seeing as how these are the most popular pet species, this fits well for TRUP stock.Of course, we all know how expensive medical insurance for humans is. With insuring pets, it might seem overkill. However, our pets are often a huge part of our lives. Plus, an acute issue can . In a recession, it might make sense to insure whatever you can, thus lifting the case for TRUP stock.Source: Shutterstock\n\t (NASDAQ:) specializes in medical diagnostic equipment for pets. Up until a recent decline, business has been good for IDXX stock. Even with the drop in market value, shares are up nearly 47%.And against a longer-term framework, you might want to consider adding IDXX to your list of potential stocks to buy. For one thing, Americans love their furry friends. According to the American Pet Products Association, . Moreover, millennials will spend more on their pets\u2019 healthcare than on their own health-related needs.Yes, that sounds crazy, but it also underlines the bullish narrative for IDXX stock. Plus, our four-legged family members offer us humans a number of .

Despite the U.S. economy's continuing to grow and add jobs, global growth outlooks have been cut, and escalating trade tensions between the world's two largest economies, the U.S. and China, only add to investor nervousness. If you're very concerned about a recession, it's a good idea to make a list of stocks that perform well during a downturn. And if you're here for some ideas, you're in luck:\u00a0 ,  , and   are all intriguing options for their own reasons.During the Great Recession, the S&P 500 shed roughly 38% of its value through the 18-month slowdown. Even finding stocks that traded flat over that time was considered a huge win for your portfolio, but AutoZone thrived, and its stock actually increased 35% over the same 18 months.Why did AutoZone pop when the rest of the S&P 500 dropped? The answer may be simpler than you think, because as consumers felt the pinch in their wallets and as uncertainty about the economy intensified, many consumers saved a buck whenever they could. For some people that meant doing simple auto repairs and maintenance themselves instead of paying a repair shop. Even something as simple as consumers opting to change their own oil for a year brought a lot of foot traffic into automotive retailers.Image source: Getty Images.Further, the company has strong engagement through offering consumers tool loans, how-to videos, diagnostic equipment at its stores, and even repair guides \u2013 if you're going to go out on a limb and do your own basic repairs, AutoZone is known to be a great starting point. As the past recession went on, many consumers put off buying new cars, and as the age of vehicles on the road increased, the demand for maintenance, service, and small repairs rose.Now, it's true that AutoZone was one of multiple auto retailers to thrive during the past recession:  and  also jumped 16% and 15%, respectively. One reason AutoZone outperformed its primary competitors is likely its nationwide presence and brand image, which has helped the retailer achieve leading market share in the do-it-yourself market. Even if we avoid a recession in the near term,  to expand its plan for megahubs, a distribution network strategy to help improve inventory availability and speed of delivery in order to attract more commercial customers, which will only add to its impressive DIY business. AutoZone offers investors an excellent option, as its business thrives when consumers need to save a buck, but another intriguing stock to own during a downturn is a good idea for a completely opposite reason: Ferrari's customers  need to save a buck.Many of us will unfortunately never obtain enough wealth that we can completely ignore possible recessions. But that's common for the type of consumer buying Ferrari's ultraluxury vehicles. Years ago at a Frankfurt car show, Fiat's CEO, the late Sergio Marchionne, quipped, \"If you go to the Ferrari stand, there aren't any customers worried about the recession.\" Marchionne continued, according to Bloomberg, \"The last Ferrari customers I saw at the show weren't crying.\"\u00a0As insensitive as it may seem to the masses that feel financial pain during recessions, Marchionne was right, wealthy people will buy extravagant Ferraris even during economic slowdowns. Even during the second quarter, as the vast majority of automakers saw slowing global demand, , which drove revenue 9% higher and net profit 14% higher. One of the core advantages that make Ferrari an incredible stock and company is its exclusivity -- management literally sets the limit on the number of vehicles it wants to sell, and it often has a wait list or backlog of orders. That gives the company control over its sales growth and helps boost its lucrative pricing, as demand seems to always exceed supply, even during downturns. Just take a look at the company's margins compared to those of mainstream automakers, and you'll see the company is more an ultrapremium luxury manufacturer than it is an automaker. data by Mainstream automakers checked in near the bottom for operating margin, as they fail to generate anything near the average transaction prices (ATPs) or margins that Ferrari can, and well-known luxury automakers such as Aston Martin and  fared only slightly better. Here's the kicker: Not only would Ferrari's business do fine during a downturn, the company plans to accelerate its profits in the near term. In fact, it announced roughly a year ago that it plans to launch 15 new products, including the brand's first SUV, to . One problem with Ferrari's stock is simply that its share price is almost as expensive as its vehicles. Ferrari trades at a sky-high forward consensus price-to-earnings multiple of 36 times. But if you're looking for a recession-proof stock, and one with a near-term growth story, maybe that price is warranted.You might recall from earlier that during the past recession AutoZone increased 35% while the S&P 500 tanked 38%. You might not know that Dollar Tree actually did even better with an increase of 47% over the same 18-month stretch. There are two primary reasons Dollar Tree performed so well during the past recession: price and location.Looking at the first factor, price, dollar chains generally operate on thin margins which enables them to pass on highly discounted goods to lower-income consumers. Consumer dollars can go further at a retailer such as Dollar Tree during recessions, and more people look to discount chains to try and stretch their earning power.But there's more to the company's success than simply offering discounted goods for around a dollar. Dollar stores have long zeroed in on smaller communities that don't have a large grocery store presence, if any at all. That strategy has been met with some community criticism over the years as the discount chains have crippled sales of independent grocery stores, but it's a strategy that's paid off for investors.  data by You could easily argue that Dollar Tree is in even better position for the next recession, as the company acquired Family Dollar in 2015 and now operates over 15,200 stores across 48 states and five Canadian provinces. That massive scale and experience operating under thin margins should help management wade through the uncertainty of escalating trade tensions and tariffs on Chinese goods. Further, Dollar Tree doesn't require innovation or a unique experience to drive its business: It simply operates small stores with lean staffing and a fraction of the product lines and inventory that larger retailers deal with. For all of those reasons, don't be surprised if Dollar Tree gives investors more bang for their buck during the next recession, just as it has in the past. We don't know when the next recession will be, but we know there will be one. It's important not to make any knee-jerk decisions and to . But that doesn't mean you can't add shares of recession-resilient stocks, whether you add businesses that thrive as consumers look to save or stretch their dollars, such as AutoZone or Dollar Tree, or businesses that cater to customers who have long stopped counting their dollars, such as Ferrari.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

While it's far from clear that the global economy -- or even the U.S. -- will fall into a recession in the next few years, there are warning signs. It's quite possible that a major country like Germany could be in a recession (defined as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction) by the time you read this article. Moreover, history suggests the global economy will fall into recession at some point. What's a worried equity investor to do? Here are three suggestions.The three ideas are as follows:Image source: Getty Images.A quick look at the share-price charts of O'Reilly, AutoZone, and Advance Auto Parts in the two-year period straddling the last recession shows a significant outperformance. There's a reason for this, and it's the tendency for consumers to skip buying a new car in troubled times in favor of running older cars longer. That's good news for auto parts retailers because older cars need more servicing. data by \u00a0Shaded areas correspond to recessions.\u00a0As you can see below, that relationship appears to have continued in the last few years as U.S. retail car sales have passed a cyclical peak -- throw in a recession, and they are likely to decline further. data by The sector looked like\u00a0  and the three stocks had \u00a0But are they still a good value, particularly with concerns over .The answer to the valuation question probably depends on whether there will be a recession and how long it will be. An extended period of economic decline will lead to employment instability and consequently falling car sales. Of the three, O'Reilly is probably best positioned to deal with the long-term threat from Amazon due its relatively higher share of its revenue from in-house repair\u00a0revenue -- the company generates 43% of its revenue from professional mechanics (as opposed to DIY). This is important because professional customers tend to need the parts immediately. And O'Reilly has arguably the best distribution system in the industry with 90% of its stores receiving what it says are \"multiple same-day deliveries of hard-to-find parts\" from its hubs.

By then, film cameras were an analog product in a digital world. And when the same day of reckoning came for Blockbuster Video and for Borders bookstores, the nostalgic among us may have felt a twinge of regret, despite having seen it coming. Of the three, only Kodak still exists or trades publicly, at a penny-stock price of $2 a share.These companies were disrupted--unseated by forces that made their products or services obsolete. As we've grown more technologically advanced, this sort of disruption has become more common. In 1964, the average tenure for a company in Standard & Poor's 500-stock index--which represents 500 large U.S. firms--was 33 years, according to consulting firm . By 2016, it was 24 years, and the firm projects it will shrink to 12 years by 2027.It behooves the long-term investor, then, to choose stocks that are unlikely to crumble in the face of persistent challenges. The stocks below are equipped to deliver long-term performance despite current or potential disruption within their industries. Some trade at lofty valuations, and all could be adversely affected by a bear market or recession. But if you're willing to hold for the long term, these firms should deliver healthy returns. Prices and other data are as of September 6.Equinix (symbol , $554). Equinix has already proved it can thrive despite technological disruption. Equinix began as a \"colocation\" firm, renting out space in physical centers for companies' data storage and computer network equipment. \"It essentially served as an on-and-off ramp to the internet,\" says Mike Lippert, portfolio manager at  fund.Then came the cloud, and widespread concern among investors that businesses would route their computing work through the data centers of major public cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, making colocation centers like Equinix's obsolete. Instead, says Lippert, Equinix adapted, partnering with the major cloud players so that Equinix centers could function as clearinghouses where clients access numerous public cloud services. For example, an Equinix business client might access different public clouds, such as AWS and Azure, as well as cloud-based software applications, such as Salesforce and Workday, in one place.Equinix's centers boast four times as many interconnections as its next-biggest competitor, and the company should steadily boost sales as it expands its capacity to meet strong demand for its business, says Keith Snyder, an analyst at  firm . Equinix, which is structured as a real estate investment trust, no longer comes cheap after returning 60% so far this year. But Lippert sees it as a solid long-term holding that can generate annual growth in funds from operations (a measure of REIT profitability) at a rate in the high-single-digit percentages over the next decade.Marriott International (, $129). Home-sharing websites are a growing problem for hotels.  lists more than 6 million properties on its site (up from 300,000 in early 2014)--a formidable figure, considering that there are 17 million rooms offered at hotels worldwide.The intrusion has limited hotels' pricing power, says Becky Baker, portfolio manager at . So far in 2019, revenue per available room, a measure of hotel profitability, has grown by only 1%, and Baker doesn't see growth picking up much anytime soon. But amid the hotel doldrums, Marriott is well positioned, with brighter growth prospects than its competitors, she says.Helping matters is that Marriott owns practically none of its industry-leading 1.3 million rooms; 97% of them are either managed by the company or operated as a franchise. Such agreements allow Marriott to collect recurring fees from the hotels' owners and franchisees. The model requires practically no capital from Marriott to open a new hotel, Baker says, and the firm is boosting its supply of rooms more than twice as quickly as the rest of the industry. Marriott plans to add up to 295,000 new rooms by 2021, a move the firm expects to boost earnings per share by as much as an annualized 15% from 2018 levels. O'Reilly Automotive (, $400). When Amazon entered the car-parts business in 2017, shares of auto-parts seller O'Reilly dropped precipitously. O'Reilly wouldn't have been the first store to be put out of business by the mega retailer's fast shipping, low prices and vast inventory. But O'Reilly's stock bounced back as the company showed that it has one of the rare business models that is insulated from the ubiquitous threat of e-commerce.O'Reilly sells after-market parts and tools to professional mechanics and do-it-yourselfers. With about 5,300 stores, almost all located within 300 miles of a distribution center, O'Reilly can ship quickly to mechanics who need specific parts on short notice. \"If you can't ship a part in 30 to 45 minutes, you won't remain a preferred distributor for long. Amazon has same-day shipping, but they can't move that fast,\" says  portfolio manager Ira Rothberg. And O'Reilly's retail staff offer guidance and expertise for the DIY crowd that is harder to find at a large online retailer, he says.O'Reilly will likely outpace its competitors in growth of store space, sales and earnings over the next few years, and it should benefit from the increasing age of vehicles on the road, which should create demand for more repairs, says  analyst Garrett Nelson. He sees earnings rising by 8.7% in 2019, followed by a 15.7% increase in 2020. He rates the stock a \"strong buy.\"Visa (, $186). Essentially the world's largest toll collector on electronic payments, Visa has benefited from a decades-long shift away from cash. But the firm is first to admit that innovations in mobile commerce and peer-to-peer payments, along with advancing technology (including the growth of internet-connected devices), will continue to drastically expand and change the way people and businesses exchange money. Visa has estimated that the number of devices used to make payments and the number of ways to accept them will increase 10-fold by 2022.Analysts at financial services firm  say Visa has remained ahead of the curve, investing in and partnering with financial technology firms to ensure that the electronic payments of the future \"occur over Visa's rails.\"Visa has benefited from the emergence of electronic payment platforms such as PayPal and its subsidiary Venmo, whose customers largely fund payments through credit and debit cards, says Brandon Ladoff, co-manager of  fund. Trading at 31 times estimated earnings for the 12 months ahead, Visa shares are not bargain-priced. But Ladoff sees plenty of room for long-term growth, especially considering that 85% of the world's transactions are still executed in cash. He expects Visa to boost earnings at an annual percentage rate in the high teens over the next half-decade.Walmart (, $115). When it comes to retail disruption, Walmart is \"the only American retailer that can compete comprehensively with Amazon's retail offering,\" says  analyst Zain Akbari.Walmart's grocery business gives the company an advantage over Amazon. Groceries account for more than half of sales at Walmart's U.S. stores. Walmart's ample facilities and parking lots are optimized for so-called \"click and pick\" (order online and pick up in-store) shopping models, which will be more difficult for Amazon to execute at its Whole Foods stores, says  fund manager Mark Finn. Walmart's grocery offerings drive customers to more-profitable merchandise in the rest of the store, says Akbari.Walmart is boosting its nascent e-commerce business, which accounts for just 4.7% of the U.S. division's net sales, says CFRA's Nelson. He says Walmart is well positioned to loosen Amazon's e-commerce stranglehold, having introduced in May free next-day shipping on orders over $35 (without a fee akin to the annual membership cost of Amazon Prime). He projects e-commerce sales growth of 35% in the fiscal year that ends in January, compared with the previous year. That should help Walmart (trading at 23 times year-ahead earnings) close the valuation gap on Amazon (trading at 71 times earnings), says Nelson. He rates Walmart stock a \"buy.\"Zoetis (, $128). The bad news for drugmakers is that lowering prescription drug prices is a bipartisan goal, promising disruption of old pricing models and volatile share prices. The Trump administration is mulling a plan that would base Medicare payments for certain drugs on the lower prices paid for those drugs in other countries. And analysts say a single-payer system, such as the one proposed under Medicare for All plans, could drastically reduce pharmaceutical firms' pricing power.Zoetis, which makes medicines, vaccines and diagnostics for farm animals and pets, needn't worry about any of that. As  analyst Debbie Wang notes, the animal health industry \"lacks large players like Medicare, single-payer governments or large insurance companies\" that could potentially affect drugmakers' pricing. Additionally, Zoetis faces little competition from generics, and pet and large-scale livestock owners alike will pay a premium for prescriptions from a company they trust, says fund manager Ladoff.Unlike many of its competitors--animal health divisions of human-pharma companies--Zoetis can focus on developing treatments targeting animal illnesses exclusively. Analysts at  are bullish on the firm's pipeline of treatments, and they believe Zoetis will boost earnings by 14% in 2019 followed by an 11% uptick in 2020. Though the shares earn an \"outperform\" rating from Credit Suisse, it's worth noting that they currently trade at 35 times year-ahead earnings, compared with an average forward P/E of 25 over the past five years.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Image source: The Motley Fool.\u00a0Q2 2019 , Good morning, and welcome to the O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. second-quarter 2019 .

That's right -- they\u00a0think these 10\u00a0stocks are even better buys.At this time, I'd like to introduce Greg Johnson.  -- Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts second-quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning are Jeff Shaw, our chief operating officer and co-president; and Tom McFall, our chief financial officer. David O'Reilly, our executive chairman, is also present.I'd like to begin our call today thanking Team O'Reilly for their continued dedication to providing the excellent service that earns our customers' business every day. Our team remains relentlessly committed to our customers and the growth of the O'Reilly brand in all of our markets. In the second quarter, we generated a 3.4 comparable store sales growth as our core underlying business was very solid. However, we faced some adverse weather headwinds during the quarter, which resulted in comparable store sales coming in toward the bottom end of our guidance range.We saw a strong start to our quarter in April but experienced unseasonably cool and rainy weather in many of our markets as we moved through the quarter, which significantly impacted the demand we typically see in seasonal peak season categories. As we called out in our press release yesterday, the significant precipitation we have seen thus far in 2019 has also delayed new store construction and pushed back our anticipated new store opening schedule, which Jeff will discuss in his prepared comments. The combination of these top-line pressures, coupled with continued headwinds in SG&A expenses from an inflationary cost environment, resulted in our second-quarter earnings per share performance of $4.51, falling below our guided range of $4.55 to $4.65. We are not pleased whenever our actual results fall short of our expectations, but remain confident in the drivers of underlying demand in the automotive aftermarket and in the ability of our team to outperform our competition and grow market share.Now I'd like to provide some additional color on the composition of our second-quarter comparable store sales results. Both the DIY and professional sides of our business contributed positively through our comp growth in the second quarter with professional again being the stronger contributor. In aggregate, comparable store sales gains continued to be driven by increased average ticket as a result of continued increasing parts complexity and inflation. Comparable ticket counts for the quarter were flat with solid growth on the professional side offset by a pressure to the DIY ticket counts, consistent with our recent trends as customers on this side of the business remained more susceptible to rising prices.On a year-over-year basis, we experienced product acquisition inflation driven by tariffs and other input cost increases passed on from our suppliers. As has been the historical practice in our industry, these acquisition cost increases have been rationally passed through to increase pricing. During mid-June, the additional round of 15% tariffs went into effect, and we anticipate the related acquisition price increases will be passed along in selling price. However, we expect the incremental benefit in same SKU pricing will likely be offset by pressure to ticket counts and good, better, best product mix headwinds.Next, I would like to provide some additional details on category performance and the cadence of our comparable store sales growth during the second quarter. As I previously mentioned, the quarter started off well but demand slowed as we moved into May and June. Typically, we see a seasonal increase during these months and heat-related categories such as air conditioning and refrigerants. However, with the unseasonably cool and rainy weather in many of our markets in May and June, we experienced sluggish demands in these categories.Excluding the headwinds we saw on these categories, we saw -- we continued to see solid demand in both sides of our business, in line with our expectations, and are pleased with the performance of key undercar hard part categories, including brakes, ride control and chassis. We continued to have a positive outlook on the strength of our industry, including positive trends in core underlying demand drivers, steadily increasing miles driven and increasing aging complexity of vehicles. While weather conditions can cause short-term volatility on our business, our team remains focused on providing the best possible service to our customers every day in all of our markets, and this consistency in execution drives our ability to take share in all market conditions. With more normal summer weather we have experienced thus far in the quarter, we're off to a solid start in the third quarter and are establishing our third-quarter comparable store sales guidance in 3% to 5%.Based on the first-half performance and our unchanged expectations for the demand conditions in our industry, we are maintaining our full-year comparable store sales guidance of 3% to 5%. For the quarter, our gross margin of 52.8% was a 36-basis-point improvement over second-quarter 2018 margin and in line with our full-year gross margin guidance. During the quarter, our slower-than-anticipated seasonal sales resulted in a mix benefit to gross margin percentage, and the year-over-year stability in gross margin highlights our industry's ability to pass along acquisition price increases. For the year, we're leaving our full-year gross margin guidance unchanged at 52.7% to 53.2% of sales.Although based on year-to-date results and second-half expectations, we now expect to be above the midpoint. Our operating profit dollar growth was 4% for the second quarter and 4.5% for the first half of 2019, and we continue to expect our full-year operating profit as a percent of sales to be within our previously guided range of 18.7% to 19.2%. For earnings per share, we're establishing our third-quarter guidance at $4.73 to $4.83. We are maintaining our full-year EPS guidance of $17.37 to $17.47.Based on our year-to-date results, expected headwinds from delayed new store openings and continued anticipating pressure to SG&A, we expect to come in near the bottom of the range. Our full-year guidance includes the impact of shares repurchased through the call but does not include any additional share repurchases. Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I would like to again thank our team of over 81,000 dedicated team members for their continued dedication and commitment to our customers. We remain very confident in the long-term drivers for demand in our industry, and we believe we're very well-positioned to capitalize on this domain by consistently providing industry-leading services to our customers every day.I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Shaw. Jeff? -- Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to join Greg in thanking team O'Reilly for their hard work and steadfast method to outhustling the competition to earn our customers' business for providing the best service in our industry. Our team continues to successfully navigate a choppy sales environment by staying focused on the fundamentals of our business and ensuring we are doing everything possible to take care of our customers. I'd like to begin my comments today by discussing our SG&A results for the quarter and provide some color on our approach to executing our business model and managing expenses.SG&A as a percent of sales was 33.6%, a deleverage of 64 basis points from 2018. On average per store SG&A basis, our SG&A grew 3.4%, which is higher than our expectations for the quarter, while total SG&A dollars spend was on plan. The majority of the deleverage from the prior year was expected as we continue to see structural cost pressure from rising wage rates and other variable costs in a tight labor market. At the same time, we continue to invest in our goals to continually enhance customer service both in-store and in our omni-channel and technology initiatives.The higher-than-expected per store SG&A growth is the result of delays in new store openings. When a new store's opening day is pushed back a month or two, a portion of the staff for the new store has already been hired and is in training in an existing store. Adjusting for these delays is extremely difficult, especially in this tight labor market. Our field management teams have flexibility to adjust staffing levels to appropriately respond to persistent trends in our business but will not adjust drastically in short periods of time in an attempt to hit a short-term target.We're very confident in this strategy and feel that our consistency in delivering excellent customer service in all market conditions has been critical to our long-term success. However, we do encounter pressure to our SG&A when facing sales volatility, particularly when we experience significant weather-driven swings in the business in the short term. We constantly evaluate the opportunities we have to drive increased sales and profitability. We can and will prudently adjust expenses over time when appropriate for our business.As Greg discussed earlier, as we look forward to the remainder of 2019, we continue to have a positive outlook for the demand in our industry and are maintaining our sales guidance. As a result, we're also maintaining our guidance range for full-year growth in SG&A per store of 2.5% to 3% with the expectation we will come in toward the higher end of that range based on the results in the first half of 2019. Next, I'd like to provide an update on our store expansion during the quarter and our plans for the remainder of the year. In the second quarter, we opened 43 net new stores, bringing our total 2019 store openings to 105 through the first six months of the year.While the construction, installation and opening of over 100 stores in the first half of the year is a result of a significant amount of hard work and dedication by our team, we unfortunately are well behind the planned schedule for new store openings we established coming into 2019. This shortfall is the result of the significant level of precipitation we saw in markets with new store projects in development. Consistent with our approach in previous years, our projected calendar for new store openings is more heavily weighted toward the front half of the year, which affords us the opportunity to put a new team in place and let them get their feet underneath them before entering the busy summer season. We're accustomed to seeing and adjusting to delays for any number of reasons, including weather, and typically would not have a material impact to our overall schedule.Unfortunately, the wet weather in 2019 has been widespread and persistent enough on a week-to-week basis that it has delayed many projects for extended periods of time and has impacted our overall schedule significantly. As Greg mentioned earlier, this delay created top-line pressure in our second quarter that will persist as we catch up in the back half of the year. However, we remain very confident we'll achieve our goal of opening at least 200 new net new stores for 2019. Now before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to provide an update on a couple of other expansion projects.During the second quarter, we successfully completed the conversion of 20 Bennett Auto Supply stores acquired at the end of 2018 and merged the remaining five stores into existing O'Reilly locations. The Bennett team has been a great addition, and we're pleased with the opportunities to continue to grow our business in Florida, which remains a key growth market for us. Finally, I'm pleased to report that we continue to progress on schedule in the development of our three DC projects with planned new facilities in Twinsburg, Ohio, just South of Cleveland; in Lebanon, Tennessee in the Metro Nashville market; and in Horn Lake, Mississippi, just South of Memphis. We've established an aggressive schedule for these projects with a planned opening of Twinsburg in the fourth quarter followed by Lebanon opening in the first half of 2020 and Horn Lake opening in the second half of 2020.Our DC team has repeatedly demonstrated the ability to successfully manage multiple ongoing new distribution projects while consistently achieving the high standard of service to allow our stores to get hard-to-find parts in our customers' hands faster than our competitors. We're the industry leader in the investments we've made to establish a robust distribution infrastructure that supports the best parts availability in the aftermarket, and we will aggressively work to enhance our distribution capabilities to maintain this competitive advantage. As important as the physical locations of our 27 DCs and our network of 350 hub stores are to our strategy, it's equally important that we execute our business model of deploying the right inventory at the right location within our supply chain and effectively and efficiently delivering the right part to our customers faster than our competitors. We're extremely confident in the ability of our teams to execute at a high level and lead the industry and inventory availability, but we will not rest on our past success as we strive to expand our industry-leading advantage.I'd like to once again thank our store and distribution teams for their continued dedication to providing the best customer service in our industry. Despite the fluctuations and industry demand we experienced in the first half of the year, our team has produced solid results, and we're in a great position to finish the year strong. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom. -- Thanks, Jeff. I would also like to thank all of team O'Reilly for their continued commitment to our customers, which drove our solid results in the second quarter. Now we'll take a closer look at our quarterly results. For the quarter, sales increased $134 million, comprised of an $81 million increase in comp store sales, a $54 million increase in noncomp store sales, which includes the contribution from the acquired Bennett stores, and $1 million increase in noncomp, nonstore sales and a $2 million decrease from closed stores.For 2019, we continue to expect our total revenue to be $10 billion to $10.3 billion. As Greg previously mentioned, our gross margin was up 36 basis points for the quarter as we saw benefits from product mix. On a year-over-year basis, second-quarter gross margin also benefited from the sell-through of on-hand inventory that was purchased prior to the tariff-driven acquisition price increases which went into effect at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 and the corresponding retail and the wholesale price increases. Within our guidance expectations coming into 2019, this benefit to gross margin was expected to be more significant to gross margin in the first half of the year.And as Greg mentioned earlier, we are leaving our full-year guidance unchanged, but our actual results will be impacted by the most recent round of tariffs and the timing of corresponding market price increases. We remain confident that margins will remain rational in our industry as the nondiscretionary nature and immediacy of need of the parts we sell affords us and our competitors' significant pricing power. Our second-quarter effective tax rate was 23.9% of pre-tax income, slightly above our expectations and comprised of base rate of 24.4%, which was on plan, reduced by 0.5% benefit from share-based compensation, which was less than expected. This compares to the second quarter of 2018 rate of 21.5% of pre-tax income, which was comprised with a base rate of 24.5%, reduced by a 3% benefit for share-based compensation.For the full year of 2019, we continue to expect an effective tax rate of approximately 23.5%, comprised of base rate of 24.1%, reduced by a benefit of 0.6% per share-based compensation. While the benefit from share-based compensation will fluctuate from quarter to quarter, we expect these variations to even out over the course of the year and are leaving our full-year tax rate expectation unchanged. We expect our base rate to be relatively consistent with the exception of the third quarter, which may be lower due to the totaling of certain open tax periods. Now we'll move on to free cash flow and the components that drove our results for the quarter and our guidance expectations for the full year of 2019.Free cash flow for the first six months of 2019 was $541 million versus $632 million for the first six months of 2018, with the reduction driven by increased capex and a higher accounts receivable balance, which is timing related due to the day of the week the quarter ended, offset in part by higher pre-tax income and a reduction in our net inventory investment. For the full year, we're maintaining our free cash flow guidance in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. Inventory per store at the end of the quarter was 610,000, which was down slightly from the beginning of the year and up 1.6% from this time last year. We continue to expect to grow per store inventory in the range of 2% to 2.5% this year as a result of acquisition cost increases and the fourth quarter opening of the Twinsburg DC putting pressure on the growth percentage.Our EPD inventory ratio at the end of the second quarter was 108%, which is up from 106% from the end of 2018. We still expect to finish 2019 at approximately 106%. Finally, capital expenditures for the first half of the year were $296 million, which is up $71 million in the same period of 2018, driven by our ongoing investments in new distribution projects, the conversion of the bonds -- excuse me, conversion of the Bennett stores and new store growth and technology investments. We continue to forecast capex to come in between $625 million and $675 million of the full year.Moving on to debt, we finished the second quarter with an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.35 times as compared to our ratio of 2.23 times at the end of 2018. The increase in our leverage ratio reflects our May bond issuance and borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility. We're below our stated leverage target of 2.5 times, and we'll approach that number when appropriate. We continued to execute our share repurchase program.And year to date, we repurchased 2.6 million shares at an average share price of $359.63 for a total investment of $921 million. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter and through the date of our press release, we repurchased 0.2 million shares at an average price of $380.79. We remain very confident the average repurchase price is supported by expected discounted future cash flows of our business, and we continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning available cash to our shareholders. Before I open up our call to your questions, I'd like to thank the O'Reilly team for their dedication to our company and our customers.This concludes our prepared comments. And at this time, I'd like to ask Brandon, the operator, to return to the line, and we'll be happy to answer your questions.[Operator instructions] And from Jefferies, we have Bret Jordan. Please, go ahead. -- Good morning, guys. -- Morning. -- Just a follow-up on your inflation comments here. I mean I guess as we look at anniversarying last year's tariffs but then some potential new tariff additions this year, how do you see the inflation stacking up in the second half of the year? -- So our second-quarter inflation was a little bit over too similar to the first quarter. We would expect as these tariffs start hitting our acquisition costs that we will flow through that into price. So we would expect that we'll see a higher number, originally we thought too for the year with an easing in the back half, but that looks like there will be additional pressure there. It will depend on how long these tariffs stay in place.Our plan right now is that they will continue as is. -- OK. Great. And then a question, I guess, when you look around the market, you talked about even in this space of slow demand, pricing was pretty rational. Are you seeing any either passed through of tariffs than lower prices from competitors or more aggressive activity around, I do know, small commercial accounts or large national accounts? -- Jeff, do you want to take that one? -- Well, I mean, for the most part, I mean, everybody is under the same pressure from the price increases. And what we're seeing in the field is everybody is adjusting to the process accordingly. I mean any time there's pressure on sales, you'll see some competitors try to use price as a tool to gain business. But for the most part, that's not the case. -- Yes. I mean -- yes, I'm sorry. We -- it's been very rational, Bret, and to Jeff's point, any exceptions to that from some of these small regional players I wouldn't attribute to tariffs or inflation, it's just typically some of the things they do during the course of a quarter. -- OK. Great. Thank you.From Goldman Sachs, we have Kate McShane. Please, go ahead. -- Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just after these first two quarters of cost being closer to 3% and the 5%, we're wondering what you're seeing that gives you confidence that we could potentially still reach the high end of that range. And do you have an estimate of how much your business was impacted by the wet weather? -- What we would tell you is when we look at our category-by-category performance that our underlying nonseasonal business has been very strong. Where we've run into problems are our seasonal business. We would tell you that absent the pressure we saw in the HVAC refrigerant category that Greg spoke to, we would have been happy with our comps this quarter. So when we look at the rest of the year we always plan for a normal weather and that core underlying demand for our harder parts remains good and gives us confidence in the last -- second half of the year. -- OK. And just with the delayed store openings, I just can't, of the top of my head, recall a time when this has been the case before. Is it purely just weather? Or is it just -- is there more specific circumstances as to why this is happening now than maybe not happening before? Is it the timing of the number of stores versus -- -- We had a fairly aggressive plan in 2019 front loaded to the first half of the year, but it's entirely weather-related. I mean, we've always got issues year-to-year when you're making a plan and a forecast. I mean, it could be environmental, regulatory, whatever the case may be. There is always weather issues and normally the second quarter is the most volatile quarter of new store openings during the year.That's when we have the most impact from weather, and this year was just extremely tough and widespread and persistent. What I would add to that, Kate, is all of the locations for the year are in progress. So we're not looking for additional locations. It's just how quick we can get the doors open on the buildings. -- OK. Thank you.From Wells Fargo, we have Zack Fadem. Please, go ahead. -- Hey, good morning. You talked about the benefit of selling through pre-tariff merchandise at post-tariff pricing, curious how much of a tailwind this has been for you so far these year? And then as the more inflationary products start to roll in, in the back half, curious if you could walk us through the puts and takes here? And at what point do you think this dynamic could shift to a gross margin headwind? -- So we would tell you that the faster-moving products there's less benefit because those are the ones we're most quickly reordering. So it's more of the back end of the lines where we're seeing the benefit. And we tell you that it's a modest benefit, and it's something that helps our gross margin. But ultimately, we look at last buy -- what was our last buy purchase price, and that's how we're managing our business.So when we look at the ongoing forward tariffs, we're going to take a look and make sure that we're priced appropriately for the market. And looking at what margin we think we need to make and should make based on GM ROI of each product to set those prices. So we think that the impact will not be a negative going forward. And we think we'll be able to sustain our margin percentage. -- OK. And on the SG&A side, how much of the 64 basis points of deleverage would you specifically assign to the delayed new store openings? And going forward with SG&A per store expected up about 3% for the year, are there any other buckets where you anticipate a step down in the growth rate from here? -- So last year, we talked about SG&A -- people invest in SG&A with the part of the funds they receive from the tax reduction. And then going forward, if we saw higher-than-average SG&A growth, we would expect to see inflationary pricing in the top line being a benefit. And that's what we've seen this year as the labor market continues to be tighter. So when we looked at our guide this year, we were going to anniversary some of those investments we made last year in store payroll, primarily more heavily weighted in the first and second quarter as they ramped up.We would tell you that when we look at our guidance and you look at the guidance from the beginning of the year, the midpoint of our operating profit was an expectation of a decrease because of those pressures. We would tell you that when you look at the second quarter specifically that most of the deleverage was planned based on these higher structural store payroll numbers, but that -- a meaningful amount is due to slower comp sales than expected and later noncomp sales due to the store is not opening at that time. -- Got it. That makes sense. Appreciate the time, guys.From Stephens Inc., we have Daniel Imbro. Please, go ahead. -- Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking our questions. Just a follow-up on the last SG&A question actually. One of your larger peers has talked more recently about investing more heavily into supply chain and DC wages.Are you feeling any specific pressures from those kind of investments in that part of your business or is it more broad-based wage pressure? -- I'd say it's across the board. And we're seeing some wage pressure in some of our store markets that's driven by minimum-wage changes where they're escalating some of those that are on the West coast. But across the country, across really in the corporate office and the DCs and in the stores, we're seeing wage pressures and wages moving up. One of the biggest areas we've seen some wage pressures is with our DOT truck drivers and our DCs.That's become a very aggressive market. Supply hasn't kept up with demand over the last couple of years, and we've seen a lot of inflation and wage pressure there. -- OK. And then I think it was last quarter or the call before that, you guys talked about the market becoming more rational and being able to raise retail prices to offset some of these wage pressures. So curious if you still think the market's in a similar place? Or what's changed to keep you guys being able to pass through either industrywide cost pressures being able to pass it through in the form of inflation? -- Well, I think we've spoken to the first and second quarter of same SKU inflation being up slightly over two, which is a reflection of passing through the inflationary pressures across the cross retail through our pricing to cover both the tariffs and increase in expenses, and I think you see that in our increasing gross margin percentage.From Wolfe Research, we have Chris Bottiglieri. Please, go ahead. -- Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to go into a little bit of tariffs. Just hoping you may be give us a lay of the land in terms of the percentage of SKUs affected and the levels of price increases. And then just for clarity, the next 15, those are the same SKUs affected or has that become more expensive SKU set? And then just like holistically thinking about this, given some of your reservations on deferred demand and customer trade down, is this something you've already seen in the first round of tariffs that's what gives you the confidence that you won't see comps accelerate on the next 15? That'll be helpful. -- Chris, I'll take the first part of that and let Tom back to back-end question. There's been a total -- I think, this is the fourth round of tariffs. The first was more of a component tariff increase and then we hit more and more SKUs in the second and third round. The third round was the most impactful.It was a 10%. And this latest round is an additional 15% on the 10% for basically the same base of SKUs. As we said in previous-quarter calls, just because there was a tariff increase, either at the component level or at the SKU level of 10%, that doesn't mean that we're going to take the full 10% tariff on that. We direct in for a very smaller subset of our SKU base.Most of our direct -- most of our import lines coming from China flow through one of our suppliers facilities here in the U.S. So the impact of tariffs is a little less for us than if we directly imported all of that product. So what we would expect and what we've seen thus far is this next round of 15%, we would also take a less than 15% increase on this round. -- In relation to your second question, we started to see some inflation on commodity-type items second quarter of the last year. And as prices go up, especially on items that are more discretionary, what we see is pressure on our lower-end consumer, our DIY consumer, and that's been reflected in pressure around their traffic counts. We see less of that pressure on our professional side of the business as the general demographic there is less impacted by price increases. So when we look at rolling through this additional round of tariffs, we'd expect the professional side of business to be less impacted on traffic and see a benefit there in average ticket.On the DIY side, you will see the ticket average go up, but we would expect to see additional pressure on traffic as people work harder to defer to save money. -- Gotcha. That's helpful. And then just a quick strategic question. Is there anything you can do to address this? I know you know the tool is pretty difficult.But is there any way to diversify outside of China so you're not exposed to one country? Is that something that's feasible? Or would you lose some of the benefit of scale from doing that and it's just not a road worth traveling? -- So it's definitely an option. It's just not a short-term option. We try and for years we've tried to diversify where we buy our products across multiple suppliers to mitigate risk and where we can across multiple countries to also mitigate some of that risk. So for brake category, for example, we've got brake products coming in from China, from India and from some other smaller countries.So we're continuing to work with our suppliers to see what alternate sourcing locations we have, but that's just typically not a short-term change because it's not like the capacity sitting there. And these other countries, they have to build that capacity. -- That makes sense. All right. Thank you for the time.From Credit Suisse, we have Seth Sigman. Please, go ahead. -- Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to clarify on the full-year guidance. So I think the earlier comment was that you're expecting EPS to now be at the low end of the range for the year. Is that due to the first-half performance or are you actually modifying your expectations for the second half as well? -- Well, I think the specific word we used was lower. It's based on really two factors that are different: Second-quarter results and our expectation that we're going to continue to be -- have a drive from new store openings where we're not going to generate as many noncomp store sales dollars as we expected as we both catch up and stores that open later in the year don't generate quite as much revenue as they have a later date to sort of ramping up their business. -- OK. Makes sense. And then a follow-up question on the gross margin. Can you just talk about the performance in the quarter, specifically you highlighted mix as a benefit.If you can quantify that that would be really helpful. And then I think previously you talked about gross margin being flattish for the second half of the year. Is that still the right way to think about it? I mean you do have higher pricing now, I guess, incremental to what you expected previously. So should we actually expect that that could be a little bit higher for the year or at least for the back half of the year? -- We've maintained our guidance. We think we'll be a little bit above the midpoint of the guidance. Seth, I'm sorry, will you repeat the first question? -- The first part was just around the gross margin performance in the quarter. You highlighted mix. I'm just wondering if you could quantify that. -- I'm sorry about that. We're not going to get into the nitty-gritty of the details, but what we would tell you is that a lot of the seasonal products in HVAC and refrigerant are big-ticket items but carry a lower gross margin percentage. So not having those sales hurt our comps but help our gross margin percentage mix. -- Got it. Understood. Thanks, Tom.From Wedbush Securities, we have Seth Basham. Please, go ahead. -- Thanks a lot, and good morning. My question is around the trends between DIY and DIFM. If you could give us a sense of whether or not the performance gap of comps between those two customer segments widened this quarter relative to the last quarter, that would be helpful. -- Yes. Overall, the spread was very similar to what we saw last quarter with professional outcomping DIY. -- Right. And as you look back further in 2018, was it a narrower gap than we've seen thus far in 2019? -- It's been pretty similar for the last four quarters. -- Got it. And just lastly, as you roll forward, do you think about the impacts of tariffs and the pressure on DIY customer? Do you think this next round leading to higher price increases and more pressure on the DIYers pocketbooks is going to lead to a further widening of the gap? -- I think it likely will. And it's not just that, Seth. It's the complexity of products that are impacting that as well. And it's not just our industry.We talk a lot about the average DIY consumer. Their spend is being impacted in everything they buy because of these tariffs. So their discretionary income and discretionary money they have to spend on nonessential items is just -- it's less than it was. And they will likely postpone any repairs that they don't have to make. -- Understood. Thanks a lot.From Oppenheimer, we have Brian Nagel. Please, go ahead. -- Hey, guys. It's David Bellinger on for Brian. So first, I want to push a little further on the monthly cadence of sales. Anything in particular there that you can point to in terms of underlying demand improving as the quarter progressed? Maybe certain category trends or geographical trends they could get into to help give us further comfort that comps in the back half of the year could potentially track better than what we've seen so far in the first two quarters? -- Sure. David, I'll take that and then I'll let Jeff speak to the regional trends. On the last call, the team talked about a more normal winter with the follow up -- with the normal weather, you have road conditions deteriorating and breaking of under car products, things like that or product categories rather. And that's to Tom's point earlier, that's what we saw on the quarter.So we had a more normal weather pattern for April. So April was the strongest month of the quarter. And then May and into June, those weather patterns changed, and it was a cooler weather than we normally see during that time of year, and much wetter across most of the country than we normally see. And that impacted primarily those heat-related categories that Tom spoke to and I said in my prepared comments.So what we would say is from a cadence standpoint, April would have been our strongest month of the quarter followed by June and then May would have been the softest month in the quarter. -- Got it. And then on the continued expense pressures you're seeing mostly on the wage side, are there any indication that those impacts are subsiding in any way? And how should we think about overall expense growth over the next couple of quarters if comps potentially track toward that lower end, the 3% to 5% range, and also as we begin to look more toward 2020? -- So our expectation is that payroll will continue to be a pressure item as unemployment stays very low. People are out there competing for folks. When we look at our SG&A, your expectation is that we're going to have solid sales for the last two quarters, absent -- with the exception of some pressure from new store opening timing but our comps will be solid and that our SG&A will come in at the high end of our average SG&A growth per store for the full year, which means being on plan for the third and fourth quarter. -- Understood. Thank you.From J.P. Morgan, we have Chris Horvers. Please, go ahead. -- Thanks. Good morning. So just want to -- I want to follow up on the gross margin with respect to the tariffs and understand your comments, Tom. So is it that -- why wouldn't gross margin -- you see the similar gross margin benefit.So asked another way, are people not raising ahead of it and sort of waiting to roll into that acquired inventory and then raise the price on it? And is that sort of the different behavior in the competitive marketplace around pricing? -- Well, what we see is an uneven application of the increase of price. So some of it has to do with weather was underwater, it depends on how much is in your supply chain here. What we've typically seen is that when the faster-moving items, which are the higher-value items, when you're starting to reorder those and then you sell through it, obviously, at a much faster rate, when you're reordering those at the higher prices and starting to sell through and that's when we're seeing the prices be addressed in the market. So the slower-moving items that you have many more days of supply are the items where you get that benefit. -- And the first time around last fall, did the prices go up more quickly on the slower-moving items? -- Well, they go up across the line. Typically the tariffs will be addressed across the line. It's just when you are ordering them. What I would tell you is that the first round of tariffs, you -- the pass-through is more on even than what we see here in the latest round of tariffs.Obviously, it's a bigger number. We've all gone through this process so we are expecting a more even, probably quicker application of those price increases. -- So does that suggest that -- so it seems like people in the marketplace are sort of feeling their way through this price increases. Is that the right way to think about it? -- Yes. -- Got it. And then in terms of -- understood. And then in terms of -- I'm not sure, just two follow ups. With May negative and then also from a regional performance, was this Midwest with the flooding and the rains, is it California, which is cooler versus the Northeast? Not sure if you touched on that yet. -- Yes. May was not negative. We didn't have any negative months or weeks during the quarter. May was just softer than June and April.And Jeff, do you want to take the regional? -- On the regional performance, really, the underperformance performance we saw in the quarter was consistent across most of our markets as you'd expect with the weather conditions across the majority of the country. Where we experienced the most unfavorable weather we saw more impact our business, especially our DIY business, and it's calling out the areas that were most impacted, that would be really the center part of the country and the West Coast. -- Understood. Best of luck for us this year and next year.From Morgan Stanley, we have Simeon Gutman. Please, go ahead. -- Thanks. Good morning everyone. Ex the weather, if we look at the first half in total, not just the second quarter, do you have a sense of where the comp would end up? Would it be at the midpoint or could have been at the high end of the full-year guidance? -- We're not going to get into details that specific. What we would tell you is, especially given the second quarter, weather was more normal in those categories that were impacted performed OK, we would be happy with our comps. -- OK. That's fair. And I forget what the first quarter, did you make the similar comment that weather -- you underperformed. I remember there was a soft part of that quarter as well, maybe February.So look, I was just trying to get a sense of -- -- So when we look at the first quarter, we had a deferral of a lot of the spring weather into April, which was a positive. And that get out and clean up in the spring as more of a DIY side of the business. And we caught up on that in April. When we look at the drivers of hard parts, we had a more normal winter from a precipitation standpoint, spring didn't break quite as early.So when we look at the first quarter and the second quarter, we look at the core categories that really display long-term demand in our business, the ware parts, the under tire parts, our people taking care of their vehicles, if there's wear and tear on their vehicles, those categories have looked solid all year and thus translated into a more solid professional side of the business. The seasonal categories, when spring hit, how much air-conditioning business that we do, those have been a little bit of a headwind when we look at the back half of the year, that core underlying demand for the key categories in our industry is what gives us confidence to reaffirm our guidance for the year. -- OK. That's helpful. My follow-up is your view toward larger chains. I think it seems like the consolidation at the shop level is picking up a bit.And I know in the past, you've tend to veer away from some of these chains because it's not been good for margin. Just wanted to see if that's still the case? -- Well, there's a tremendous amount of shops in the country. And there has been some consolidation. When we look at performance, there's a lot of regional chains that do a fantastic job. When we partner, we want to partner with people that are providing great customer service, have a model that were efficient in supplying.And we've got a lot of regional and national customers. At that end, we do a lot of great business with them. So I wouldn't say that we would shy away from any of that business. We're going to make sure that we lead with service in all the business we do.And from UBS, we have Michael Lesser. Please, go ahead. -- Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So thus far you've done a 3.3% comp or so in the first half. Last year, you did 3.8% comp for the full year.This year, you've had 100 basis points of incremental inflation. Just in that, units are below where they were last year running at a slower pace of growth than they were last year. But why would that -- -- I'm sorry. Did you cut off there, Michael? -- So my question is it seems like you're seeing a greater elastic demand to the price increases than what's suggested or than what's perceived by -- what you had assumed in your guidance. Your comp year to date are running below where they were last year. And this is with more inflation than you experienced last year. -- So what we would tell you is our professional business continues to be strong. We're seeing more of that volatility on the DIY side of the business. A lot of DIY business also carries a very low average ticket with high volumes when you look at some of the maintenance items and attend some of the appearance items that we do business in. So appearance, obviously, has been under pressure with -- the late March weather wasn't very good.And when you look at things like oil changes, a lot of volume, not as high a ticket. Those are items that either the customer can forgo or defer and that has created pressure on DIY traffic. What we'll tell you is that the hard parts category has continued to perform well. -- So when you look at the second half of the year, do you -- is your expectation that consumer is not going to defer these projects as much, and that will -- that's what will drive an improvement in the business? -- In the second half, when we look at it, there is less seasonal categories that drive our business than in the first half. -- OK. And then coming back just to the longer-term outlook. It's been several years since O'Reilly has comped up 5%. Is the business now just in a different stage as the industry has become more consolidated, you're doing higher per store volume that it's just going to be more difficult for O'Reilly to come up 5%? -- We had the same question in 2010, 2011. What we would tell you is that our business is a cyclical business, kind of seven-year cycles. The professional size of the business is much more stable. When we see good DIY years for many different reasons, whether it's new weather-driven, whether it's increase in miles driven, wages, when we have those good DIY years, that's when we see the industry outperform.When that DIY consumer is under pressure, you see the industry put up numbers not quite as good. And I tell you that at the current phase, we're in that beginning part. If we -- that second part where DIY customer is under pressure. If we look back three years, we saw a run of three years where the DIY business swung up.And it will go through these cycles over time. -- And look at the year. Thank you.Thank you. And we have reached our allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Greg Johnson for closing remarks. -- Thank you, Brandon. We'd like to conclude our call today by thanking the entire O'Reilly team for your continued hard work and delivering another solid quarter. I'd like to thank everyone for joining our call today, and we look forward to reporting our third-quarter results in October.

(Symbol: ORLY) saw new options become available this week, for the February 2020 expiration.  One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 239 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ORLY options chain for the new February 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $360.00 strike price has a current bid of $25.00.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $360.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $335.00 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ORLY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $365.79/share today.\n\nBecause the $360.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 6.94% return on the cash commitment, or 10.60% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $360.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $370.00 strike price has a current bid of $30.20.  If an investor was to purchase shares of ORLY stock at the current price level of $365.79/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $370.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.41% if the stock gets called away at the February 2020 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ORLY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing ORLY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $370.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $370.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 46%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 8.26% boost of extra return to the investor, or 12.61% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example, as well as the call contract example, are both approximately 27%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $365.79) to be 22%.

Now, the stock is off about 10%. Still up 30% in the past year, but it has certainly been dinged.The company has noted that some of the problem was that in its core region \u2014 the Midwest, South and Southwest \u2014 rain on the weekends dampened its customers\u2019 ardor for shop work. Cold and snow usually boosts business, but rain has the opposite effect. Also, an extra Monday and one less Sunday in the quarter didn\u2019t help matters for ORLY stock.Generally, weather-related excuses, or one weekend day here and there shouldn\u2019t throw your whole quarter off. But they are valid reasons up to a point. And the numbers weren\u2019t horrible, they were just somewhat disappointing.Then you add to the weak Q1, projections for a weaker Q2, and you wonder whether there\u2019s something more afoot.But if you take a look at the macro picture, car and truck sales are slowing; consumer debt is higher than it was in 2008; and wages are rising slightly. Maybe some people can afford to take their cars to the shop to have them worked on now, but the trend for DIY work is still in place.And as cars get older, they need more parts.

Consumers have gotten fickler than ever, which has created an interesting environment for many retail stocks to operate in.Today, people want their goods when they want it and how they want it. This means that both physical stores and digital commerce need to be blended. Two-day and even one-day shipping is now the norm, while online ordering and pick-up have quickly become a default option for many consumers.Needless to say, a lot of retail stocks have buckled under this pressure. Store closures and bankruptcies dot the sector.However, not all retail stocks are being tossed to the wolves. In fact, several are getting it right. That includes the right tech and consumer experiences to compete in the new omnichannel paradigm. These winners are proving that investors don\u2019t have to ignore the sector completely, but they do have to be selective. Choose wrong and you could be staring at plenty of empty storefronts.Which retailers are getting the job done in omnichannel? Here are five retail chains that will be winners in the years ahead.   The best part is this fanbase tends to be older and more affluent than typical bargain shoppers. After all, if you\u2019re willing to  on an espresso machine, you have some cash to spend. And they tend to transfer their love of the brand down to their children when they finally become adults.The same could be said for its other major brands like Pottery Barn and West Elm for home furnishings. WSM has managed to create a cohort of wealthy customers that are willing to shop there first before anywhere else. This gives it a monster edge over many other retail stocks.Williams-Sonoma has been an earnings machine \u2014 especially in the world of omnichannel. It has been able to get people into its stores for demos and product help while making plenty of revenues online. Sales have grown by an annual rate of , while earnings have grown 11% per year over the same time. And it has been sharing the wealth via a growing dividend. Today, WSM yields almost 3%.All in all, WSM stock has all the right ingredients to keep winning in the new retailing world.   And customers are coming back in a big way.Because of its operating model and low-cost of goods, the funky dollar store has managed to turn sales into actual profits. New stores have an average payback time of just one year, while  by over 32% per year since its IPO. That\u2019s torrid growth considering this is a budget retailer. And FIVE has managed to do all of this without debt.Given its focus on tweens as well as on-trend goods, the retail stock has a unique niche that can\u2019t be tackled by many other rivals. For investors, this position offers plenty of opportunities to grow into the future.   But  (NYSE:) seems to be getting it right, albeit slowly. The firm has been able to leverage its scale as the nation\u2019s largest supermarket chain to make a serious go at the new world of omnichannel.This includes unveiling new order ahead options for its products, apps, a  with Instacart, and other tech-oriented consumer experience products. Today, KR has more than 1,685 stores that offer order pickup locations as well as over 2,125 delivery locations for its groceries. That covers about 93% of its customers.These efforts have helped grow digital sales by  during the first quarter of this year. Meanwhile, Kroger has been copying Amazon and  (NYSE:) playbooks and moving into so-called alternative revenue streams. This includes media and advertising, customer data, and other real estate investments. KR is on track to start producing some significant revenues this year. So far it crushed its latest earnings estimates and was able to increase its Though KR\u2019s moves are working at a slow pace, the grocery giant could be an interesting value among retail stocks. KR is getting it right, it\u2019s just taking time. At least you get paid a hefty dividend while you wait.   What housing crisis?That\u2019s the mantra for home improvement giant  (NYSE:). The retailer continues to see rising sales and demand for various home improvement products and services. And the reason is simple: HD has started to seriously court the next generation of homeowners.Thanks to generally low interest rates and looser lending standards, Gen X and Millennials are finally able to buy homes. But they are not buying move-in ready McMansions. They\u2019re buying fixer-uppers that require plenty of sweat equity, which means plenty of trips to Home Depot. Moreover, HD has courted these customers with new omnichannel operations, mobile apps, and customer service experiences.It\u2019s working in a big way. Last year, HD pulled in record profits and the streak is continuing this year.  of this year increased 5.7% to clock in at $26.4 billion. Earnings per share managed to jump by over 9%. Its continued moves into omnichannel have certainly helped on this front.With the continued revenue and EPS gains, HD has rewarded shareholders in a big way. Thanks to improved results, Home Depot unveiled a new monster $15 billion buyback program and increased its dividend by an insane 32%. And with interest rates set to drop further, more people could be able to buy a home.All in all, HD\u2019s outlook could be one of the rosiest of all retail stocks.   All of this could help explain why  (NASDAQ:) crushed the market last year.The retail stock has seen plenty of steady single and  over the last few years as the economy continues to expand and miles driven increase. As long as the economy continues to clip at a steady pace, ORLY should be able to get the growth going.Another reason for its success is its management team. The stock is packed with insiders and family ownership. Because of this high ownership, management often takes more long-term views of investments and decisions. Yes, it\u2019s about improving quarter to quarter, but its more about building the company over the decades. And ORLY has done just that. During the recession, a decision to expand made the firm the giant it is today.With new moves to court professional garages and a $1 billion buyback now under its belt, ORLY continues to make the right moves in the new retail environment.At the time of writing, Aaron Levitt had a long position in AMZN.The post  appeared first on .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["(RTTNews) - O`Reilly Automotive Inc.

Q1 2019 April 25, 2019Hello, and welcome to the O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. first-quarter 2019 . My name is Michelle, and I will be your operator for today's conference. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.I will now turn the call over the Tom McFall. Mr. McFall, you may begin, sir. -- Thank you, Michelle. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. During today's conference call, we'll discuss our first-quarter 2019 results and our outlook for the second quarter and full year of 2019. After our prepared comments, we'll host a question-and-answer period.Before we begin this morning, I'd like to remind everyone that our comments today contain forward-looking statements.

Greg Johnson, our CEO and co-president, is unable to be with us today due to a very serious health issue involving a close family member. For today's call, Greg Henslee, our executive vice chairman and former CEO, will be participating in Greg Johnson's absence. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Greg Henslee. -- Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts first-quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning are Jeff Shaw, our chief operating officer and co-president; and Tom McFall, our chief financial officer. David O'Reilly, our executive chairman, is also present.I'd like to begin our call today by thanking Team O'Reilly for their unwavering commitment to providing consistently excellent levels of service to our valued customers. This dedication to our customers is what drives our long-term success, and I'm extremely proud that the job we do each day taking expert care of both our professional and DIY customers. As we've discussed in the past, the timing of weather patterns in our first quarter can cause the most volatility during the year. This was especially true this past quarter as we saw extended periods of harsh winter weather that are positive for our business and should support solid demand throughout 2019, but we also encountered significant rain throughout the quarter, which is a headwind for our DIY business.Additionally, the delay in tax refunds and a reduction of total refund dollars during the quarter contributed to the sales volatility on a comparable basis. Finally, I would remind everyone that our first quarter included an additional Sunday as compared to 2018, which had a negative impact of approximately 50 basis points of comp store sales as Sunday is our lowest volume day of the week. As a result, our first-quarter comparable store sales increase of 3.2% was at the bottom end of our guidance range due to the short-term impact of the headwinds we saw during the quarter. As we review our results for both our DIY and professional customer business on a day-by-day, region-by-region basis, we remain very confident in our business and the health of the automotive aftermarket and the strength of the underlying trends of our industry.Considering the sales volatility during the quarter, I'm proud of the effort our team put in to managing expenses and driving profitable sales growth, resulting in a 5.2% increase in operating profit dollars as compared to the first quarter of 2018 and an operating margin rate of 18.5%. In addition to the solid growth in sales and operating profit, we were -- we also benefited from a substantially lower tax rate than expected, which Tom will cover in his prepared comments. This combination of operating performance along with our ongoing share buyback program drove an increase in first-quarter earnings per share of 12.2% to $4.05 per share, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $4.02 per share and reflects our team's ability to consistently execute our business model and drive solid profitable results. Now I'd like to provide some additional color on our first-quarter comparable store sales results.The composition of our sales results was consistent with our recent trends, with both the professional and DIY sides of our business being positive contributors to our comp store sales increase in the first quarter with professional continuing to exceed DIY. The ticket count growth in our professional business outpaced DIY and continued to drive comparable store sales even with the headwind of the additional Sunday in the first quarter. The impact of weather volatility during the quarter was most evident in DIY ticket counts. However, the demand on this side of the business was otherwise consistent with recent trends even as these customers feel the pinch of rising prices across the economy.Average ticket was a strong contributor to comparable store sales on both sides of the business driven by the increasing complexity of vehicle repairs and a favorable overall business mix. The impact to average ticket from same SKU inflation was in line with our expectations for the first quarter, and we still believe the full-year impact will be approximately 2%. Moving on to the cadence of our comparable store sales growth. As Greg Johnson mentioned during our 2018 Year-End Analyst Call in February, we were pleased with our start to 2019.However, we met softness from a comparable standpoint in the back half of February due to the timing of tax refunds compared to last year and generally unfavorable weather in most of our markets. This was somewhat offset by the harsh winter weather from the polar vortex in many markets. However, business was good in March, and we finished the quarter strong as March was easily our strongest month of the quarter even with the extra Sunday headwind. And I'm pleased to report that this strong trend has continued to this point in April.Given the delay in timing of tax refunds and refund dollars down approximately 3%, it's difficult to fully estimate the impact to our first-quarter results, but we are confident in the core underlying fundamentals that drive demand in our business moving forward. On a category basis, our performance matched the trends I've already discussed with strong performance in key categories driven by cold, harsh weather such as batteries and wipers along with good performance in maintenance and repair categories, such as brakes, lighting and drive line. As we look ahead to the second quarter and the remainder of 2019, our outlook on the strength of our industry and our opportunity to continue to gain market share by executing our business model of providing the best customer service in our industry has remained unchanged since we provided guidance at the beginning of the year. As a result, we are reiterating our full-year comparable store sales guidance of 3% to 5% and establishing our second quarter guidance at the same 3% to 5% rate.For the quarter, our gross margin of 53.1% was a 44 basis point improvement over first-quarter 2018 margin and, as expected, was toward the top end of our expectations built into our full-year margin guidance. During the quarter, we benefited from continued incremental improvements in acquisition cost, a favorable mix of hard part sales and a rational inflationary pricing environment. Tom will discuss LIFO and the impact of tariffs to our acquisition cost in more details in his comments, but I will add that we've been pleased to see that tariff cost increases in general have been passed along in market prices, and we continue to expect pricing in our industry to be rational moving forward. We are leaving our full-year gross margin guidance unchanged at 52.7% to 53.2% of sales and also continue to expect our full-year operating profit to be within our previously guided range of 18.7% to 19.2% of sales.For earnings per share, we're establishing our second quarter guidance at $4.55 to $4.65 and are reiterating our full-year EPS guidance of $17.37 to $17.47. Our full-year guidance includes the impact of shares repurchased through this call which does not differ significantly from the impact we included in our fourth quarter call but does not include any additional share repurchases. Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I would like to again thank Team O'Reilly for their hard work and dedication to our company's continued success. Due to our continued commitment to our customers, we are off to a solid start in 2019, and I'm confident in both the long-term drivers of demand in our industry and our team's ability to capitalize on this demand by providing excellent service to our customers every day.I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Shaw. Jeff? -- Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin my remarks today by echoing Greg's comments and thanking our team members for their hard work and dedication to providing top-notch customer service. Our team weathered the significant sales volatility during the quarter by remaining dedicated to taking care of our customers while closely managing expenses to drive profitable growth. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our SG&A results for the quarter.SG&A as a percent of sales was 34.6%, a deleverage of 52 basis points from 2018. On an average per store basis, our SG&A grew 3%, which is at the top end of our full-year guidance but in line with our expectations for the quarter. Within our SG&A for the quarter is a headwind of 12 basis points relating to deferred compensation with a corresponding and offsetting benefit in other income. We continue to aggressively pursue our customer service and omni-channel goals and face pressures to wages and other variable costs from a low unemployment, inflationary environment.Our expense control focus is a key component of the O'Reilly culture, and each of our managers is held accountable for the profitability of their individual store, DC or corporate department. We manage our SG&A spend with a long-term focus on building strong relationships with our customers, and we actively scrutinize all of our expenses to ensure every dollar we spend helps to provide excellent customer service. We remain confident in our opportunity to continue to drive profitable growth through diligently executing our business model and continue to expect full-year growth in SG&A per store of 2.5% to 3%. Next, I'd like to spend -- or next I'd like to provide an update on our ongoing distribution center projects and share some additional exciting DC expansion news.If our decades of experience in executing our dual market business model have taught us anything, it's that we must continue to innovate and invest to lead the industry in parts availability. It's crucial to the economic livelihood of our professional customers and equally critical to our DIY customers who depend on us to get all the parts they need to get their car back on the road. Our ability to provide outstanding customer service in our stores is dependent on the work our 27 distribution center and 342 hub store teams do to get hard-to-find parts in our customers' hands faster than our competitors. As we previously announced, we have two significant DC expansion projects under way with the addition of a new location in Twinsburg, Ohio just South of Cleveland and an upgrade to a new larger facility in the Nashville market in Lebanon, Tennessee.Both of these projects are on track, with the Cleveland DC targeted to open in the fourth quarter and the new Nashville DC set to open in the first half of 2020. On our last call, we also discussed that our 2019 capex plan included an additional DC project starting in 2019, and we're pleased to announce the purchase of an existing facility in Horn Lake, Mississippi, just south of Memphis. The new DC will be approximately 580,000 square feet, and our initial plan is to build out capacity to service 250 stores. We plan to complete the infill work for this new DC in the back half of 2020, and at that time, we'll consolidate the operations and convert our existing DC in Little Rock, Arkansas into a super hub store.The new DC will provide us with additional capacity for store growth in this region of the country and provide flexibility for the surrounding DCs while also accommodating a broader SKU capacity, increasing our breadth of hard-to-find parts and allowing us to provide an even higher level of service to the Memphis metropolitan area markets. This plan is similar to our strategy for the relocation to the larger Nashville DC, which will allow us to consolidate Nashville and convert the Knoxville DC to a super hub. Now managing three major DC projects at one time is a significant undertaking, but it isn't a first for our experienced distribution operations teams. And I'm extremely confident in the ability of the team to successfully build, plan and open each of these facilities.Finally, before turning the call over to Tom, I'd like to provide a brief update on our store expansion during the quarter and our plans for the remainder of the year. In the first quarter, we opened 62 net new stores, and we continue to be on track to open at least 200 net new stores for the year. We continue to spread our store growth across the country, with new store openings in 27 different states during the quarter as we continue to identify great opportunities to open stores across all of our market areas. We also have successfully begun the work of converting the Bennett Auto Supply stores, which we acquired at the end of 2018.The acquisition of the 33 Bennett stores will net a total of 20 new O'Reilly locations, with the remaining 13 stores merging into existing O'Reilly stores. We will complete the conversion of the Bennett stores by the end of the second quarter. The Bennett team has been a great addition, and we look forward to continuing to grow our market share in Florida. Before I finish up today, I'd like to once again thank our store and distribution teams for their continued dedication to providing the best customer service in our industry.We're off to a solid start in 2019, but we're never satisfied and remain highly focused on driving industry-leading results by outhustling our competition to win our customers' business each and every day. I'm confident we have the right team in place to deliver an outstanding year in 2019, and I want to thank Team O'Reilly for their continued commitment to our company's success. Now I'll turn the call over to Tom. -- Thanks, Jeff. I would also like to thank all of Team O'Reilly for their continued commitment to our customers, which drove our solid performance in the first quarter. Now we'll take a closer look at our quarterly results and update our guidance for the full year. For the quarter, sales increased $128 million, comprised of $72 million increase in comp store sales, a $60 million increase in non-comp store sales, which includes the contribution from the acquired Bennett stores, and a $1 million decrease in non-comp, non-store sales and a $3 million decrease from closed stores.For 2019, we continue to expect our total revenues to be $10 billion to $10.3 billion. As Greg previously mentioned, our gross margin was up 44 basis points for the quarter as we saw benefit to acquisition costs, mix and pricing. On a year-over-year basis, first-quarter gross margins benefited from sell-through of on-hand inventory that was purchased prior to the recent tariff-driven acquisition price increases and corresponding retail and wholesale price increases, and we'd expect this to be a year-over-year benefit to gross margin in the second quarter as well. As a result of the inflation-driven pressure to aggregate acquisition costs, we did not see a LIFO charge during the quarter and we don't expect to have a -- excuse me, we don't expect to have a charge for the remainder of 2019.Our first-quarter effective tax rate was 22.5% of pre-tax income and was comprised of a base rate of 24.5% reduced by 2% benefit from share-based compensation. This compares to the first quarter of 2018 rate of 22.9% of pre-tax income, which was comprised of a base tax rate of 24.5% reduced by 1.6% benefit for share-based compensation. For the full year of 2019, we continue to expect an effective tax rate of approximately 23.5% comprised of a base rate of 24.1% reduced by a benefit of 0.6% for share-based compensation. While the benefit from share-based compensation will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and exceeded our expectations for the first quarter, we expect these variations to even out over the course of the year, and we are leaving our full-year tax rate expectations unchanged.We expect our base tax rate to be relatively consistent with the exception of the third quarter, which may be lower due to the tolling of certain open tax periods. Now I'll move on to free cash flow and the components that drove our results for the quarter and our guidance expectations for the full year of 2019. Free cash flow for the first quarter was $279 million versus $311 million in the first quarter of 2018 with the reduction driven by increased capex and higher credit card receivable balances, offset in part by higher pre-tax income and a reduction in our net inventory investment. For the full year, we are maintaining our free cash flow guidance in a range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion.Inventory per store at the end of the quarter was $609,000, which was down slightly from the beginning of the year and up 1.6% from this time last year. We continue to expect per store inventory to grow in the range of 2% to 2.5% this year as a result of acquisition cost increases and the fourth quarter opening of the Cleveland DC putting pressure on the growth percentage. Our AP-to-inventory ratio at the end of the first quarter was 106%, in line with where we ended 2018 and where we expect to finish 2019. Finally, capital expenditures for the first quarter were $153 million, which was up $38 million from the same period of 2018 driven by our ongoing investments in new distribution projects Jeff discussed in his prepared comments as well as capex to convert Bennett stores, drive new store growth and accelerate technology investments.We continue to forecast capex to come in between $625 million and $675 million for the year. Moving on to debt. We finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.24 times, in line with our ratio at the end of 2018. We are below our stated leverage target of 2.5 times, and we will approach that number when appropriate.We continue to execute our share repurchase program. And during the first quarter, we repurchased 0.9 million shares at an average share price of $347.09 for a total investment of $322 million. We remain very confident the average purchase price is supported by the expected discounted future cash flows of our business, and we continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning available cash for our shareholders. Before I open up our call to your questions, I'd like to thank the O'Reilly team for their dedication to our company and our customers.This concludes our prepared comments. And at this time, I'd like to ask Michelle, the operator, to return to the line, and we'll be happy to answer your questions.\u00a0Thank you, sir. [Operator instructions] The first question in the queue comes from Christopher with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Please proceed. -- Thanks. Good morning, guys. Can you talk a little bit about -- a little bit more about the cadence of the quarter? You mentioned March was by best -- by far the best despite there's probably 150 basis point headwind for that month. So was February negative? And sort of how did January size up relative to those two? -- Well, Chris, as we said, March was the strongest quarter. February wasn't negative. January was pretty solid. But clearly, March was our best-performing quarter.It's -- spring hit and the tax refunds hit. And we had a little bit of a comparison issue in February relative to tax refunds -- customers who'd received tax refunds and also the size of those refunds, and we think that was a primary driver of the shortfall compared to our plan in February. But those started coming in, in March, and we saw the pickup in business. And as I said, we've continued to experience a solid business trend to this point in April. -- Understood. Do you think there was any deferral between the first and second quarter? Or does it all going to sort of wash-out within the quarters? -- Oh, I think there was some push forward into April probably as a result of the tax refunds being delayed and also just the weather that we had in February. People -- DIY customers, if it's pouring down rain outside for several days in a row, just don't have a chance to get out and work on their cars so they push that forward. And something else I want to mention relative to weather. As I've read some of the reports over the last couple of months relative to the polar vortex and some of the weather events, I want to make clear that the weather extremes, cold weather and hot weather, those are all good for our business.They drive demand. They cause failure of rubber parts and freeze/thaw in cold weather that causes the roads to bust up and creates pot holes does damage to chassis parts and steering parts and things like that. But snow in and of itself is not good for our business unless it's accompanied by just incredibly cold weather that causes the freeze/thaw and a bust up of the roads. When it snows hard, schools close, people stay home and our DIY business on those days is soft.And in some markets, we experienced some of that along with the rain in February. So I just want to mention that just for clarity. -- Understood. And then on that snow question, do you think -- as you think about -- how would you assess this winter? Did you have that -- was that snow accompanied with that weather extreme in that weather variation? And are you expecting that same sort of lift from corrupted roads, so to speak, in this second quarter? -- Yes. I would say that it was a good winter for the auto parts business. Not -- and again, that's not immediate results, but I think the winter that we had would be conducive to good business in the spring/summer as we move into those months. -- And sorry, just any particular regions that you're thinking about had a better winter versus others? -- Jeff, do you have any regional...? -- The regional performance is really based on the weather that we experienced throughout the quarter. The makeup throughout the regions would be about what you expect. The -- as Greg alluded to, there is parts in the center part of the country and the southern parts of the country that was just -- they were diluted with heavy rains, which kind of display -- or it slows down that early spring weather. And as everybody has seen on the national news, I mean, there was historic flooding up in the northern parts of the country.The eastern and the northeastern markets probably benefited more from a more normalized winter than anybody. -- Understood. Thanks very much.The next one in the queue comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. -- Good morning. So first, to follow up on Chris' weather question. But in the past, you've discussed in these type of quarters the variance in performance between weather affected and non-weather affected markets. Is there some type of number like that you can give us here for Q1 just to help understand better what maybe the core business was tracking at ex the factor -- ex the impact of weather? -- Yes. Just the difference between our best-performing markets and our worst-performing markets, is that what you're asking? -- Yes. -- You got any numbers on that, Tom? -- What we would tell you, Brian, is that there was some beneficial weather in all of our markets and some headwind weather in all of our market. I think as Jeff talked about, the overriding driver for the little softer sales than we anticipated was how much rain and cool temperatures we received in the center part of the country. We're not disclosing that comp variance at this point. Obviously, when you look at where we are versus our midpoint, it's relatively close performance and to call that out probably wouldn't be appropriate as we expect that to normalize throughout the year and haven't changed our comp expectation or total revenue expectation for the full year. -- Yes. That's fair. That's fair. Then the second question I wanted to ask and maybe a bit longer term in nature.In your prepared comments, you spent time talking about both the number of stores you opened in the quarter as well as the integration of the acquisition, I guess, in Florida. So as we look at it, how do you view right now the sort of, say, the productivity of the new store as you continue to open at a relatively decent clip? And as you think of that -- because there are -- there do remain a number of smaller chains out there that are at least potential targets for purchase. Do you think about the decision whether to open stores or make potentially strategic acquisitions? How does that thought process take place? -- Tom, you want to talk about that? -- So our new store performance has been right where we would expect. Obviously, we're putting the Bennett stores, and I talked about that in my prepared comments, goes into the non-comp store sales, which throws off the calculation for a new store performance. But we continue to be very pleased with the performance of our new stores. When we talk about the number of chains that are out there and how we enter new markets, our business philosophy has always been when we're going to enter a new market, what we want to do is find out who's selling parts in the market and see if there's an opportunity to team up with those parts sellers, whether it's one store and with CSK, it was 1,300 stores.So that's always our first lead. But what we have to do is be able to find a win-win where they're looking to exit, we're opportunistic in our acquisitions. We continue to do a large number of one and two store acquisitions. When we look at the Bennett stores, not a huge store count but really a very solid team in the market that we're growing in and an opportunity to leverage those teams and those relationships in the market to really add those stores but also make our new stores that much better. -- Thank you.And the next question in the queue comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. -- Good morning, guys. I know you guys talked about expecting about 200 basis points of part inflation for the year, but two questions related to that. First of all, what was the impact on 1Q? I don't know if you had said that. And then number two, how do you guys measure that? Like is that against kind of year-end or is that a year-over-year figure, etc.? -- Tom? -- It's slightly above two. And what we would tell you is we do a detailed calculation on a SKU-by-SKU basis outflow for the volume that was sold this year versus last year and prices this year versus last year. So as we talked about on our call in the fourth quarter and really we talked about last year's is last year we saw SG&A inflation without as much same SKU inflation as people reinvested in our industry and in retail in general the reduced tax amount, and we talked about it, this year we'd expect our SG&A growth to be similar unless we saw increases in inflation on the top line, and that's what we're seeing as we talked about in the fourth quarter that we're pressured on our SG&A from a inflationary standpoint, but we're seeing those price increases flow through really started primarily with the tariffs. But really costs of interest and cost of healthcare and cost of payroll especially passed through in price increases.So we continue to expect to see about 2% SKU-on-SKU inflation calculated at a detailed level. -- And if the tariffs did go away based on what's happening on the political front, does your view on that change, Tom? -- I think we would expect to see some opportunities for reduced prices. But tariffs are only one portion of what's driving inflation. I'd tell you that wage inflation is a bigger driver in aggregate of our price increases. So that's to be determined on how the market prices that through, how fast they come through.Obviously, we're planning our business from a go-forward basis that the tariffs that are in place will stay in place and that we won't see additional tariffs or reductions of existing tariffs to the extent that, that happens, we'll manage the business on day-by-day basis to make sure that we are being competitive in the marketplace. -- Got it. All right. Thanks a lot, guys.And the next question in the queue comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.Hi. This is Josh Cambridge on for Simeon. Was the gap between your DIY and DIFM growth in the quarter consistent with how it's been over the past few quarters? -- We tell you, it was a little bit more, which is not unexpected given the weather volatility and some of the headwinds we have seen from weather, which, obviously, when you talk about precipitation, impacts our DIY customers as our professional shops are primarily inside and also the delay in tax returns, which is a bigger impact on our lower-end consumer.That makes sense. And then just a quick follow-up. Aside from maybe the weather and the tax for this quarter, if you can sort of push that to the side, are you seeing any change in the sort of number of really old, call it, 11, 12, 13-year-old vehicles coming into your stores? -- What we would tell you is that the vehicle population in the United States moves very slowly. We haven't seen a dramatic change in the reported scrap rates and sales have maintained about the same amount. So we haven't seen a big change. And we continue to see the age of the vehicles get older as they're better manufactured and able to go through more routine maintenance cycles and be driven safely on the road at higher mileages.So that's a change to the vehicle population we see happens very slowly over time, and we tell you it's pretty consistent.Thank you.Thank you, sir. And the next question comes from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on the inflation. It sounds like the same SKU inflation is tracking as you would expect.What are you guys seeing from a competitive perspective? Are there others basically doing what you're doing as well? And then any signs of elasticity? -- Yes. So we do a lot of work on making sure that our prices are competitive both on the professional and DIY side of the business. And we would tell you that we continue to be very competitive in the market and adjust our prices appropriately. When we talk about elasticity of products, it really depends on the product itself.For example, batteries have a high lead content and the change in lead prices leads to quarterly changes in the prices of batteries, but it's a very inelastic product. If you go out and your battery doesn't work, your car doesn't start, and people need to replace them. On the flip side of that, our routine maintenance items, for example, oil changes to the extent that you see oil prices go up, people can extend those miles that they drive between oil changes. So it really depends on a maintenance and a failure standpoint. -- OK. That's helpful. And then just any more color on how strong March -- the improvement that you saw in March may have been. And specifically the DIY business, you've been somewhat cautious on that business over the last few quarters.How do you think about the macro backdrop for your DIY customer today? -- Tom, do you want to take that? -- So we saw a benefit in March partially from easing weather and partially from tax returns getting out there. We continue to view our low-end DIY customers as somewhat exposed to price increases. And to the extent that fuel goes up, they're a little more exposed to that. We continue to see it as a great business and a great opportunity for us to grow our market share. -- OK. Thanks.And the next question comes from Matt McClintock with Barclays. Your line is open. -- Yes. Good morning, everyone. Just I was thinking higher level. You talked a little bit about continued investments in part availability and you discussed the new DCs that you're opening and the new super hub, mega hub, etc., that you're going to do.And there's a lot of discussion about investments that some of your competitors and others in the marketplace are making to improve their part availability. And it just seems like it's overlooked sometimes that maybe you're not just sitting down doing nothing while that's occurring. So I was wondering if you can maybe just give us an overview of over the last couple of years some of the things that you've done to increase and continue to build upon your marketing-leading position in part availability? -- Jeff, do you want to take that? -- Sure, I'll start with it and maybe you guys can chime in. Obviously, it starts with our distribution centers. And you heard us talk on the call here that we've got three new distribution centers under way. And putting that number of SKUs out in the market to provide that availability is just huge for the stores that benefit from that.A couple of those DCs, the Little Rock DC and the Knoxville DC that we mentioned, they were legacy DCs from the Midwest acquisition and through the CarPro acquisition back in 2000. And they just didn't have the footprint to hold the necessary number of SKUs that we needed to hold to support a market and the capacity as well. So that's the reasoning for the new Lebanon DC as well as the new Memphis DC. Obviously, the Akron DC is an expansion these to support greenfield growth.And beyond that, I mean, it would be -- the next level would be the super hubs -- the amount of super hubs and then the hub stores where we don't have DCs in those semi-metro freestanding markets, we want to make sure that we've got the level of SKUs it takes to support the market based on the competition in that market. And that's normally driven by the number of traditional competitors. There's many, many, many solid regional and two-step competitors out there in a lot of these markets that never get talked about. They just do a phenomenal job and really still control the bulk of the do-it-for-me business across the country that we have to go head-to-head with every day.So we're continually evaluating our position in markets from an inventory standpoint and reacting accordingly. We've done that for many, many years. -- And what I would add to that is we comment that the Little Rock DC and the DC in Tennessee are going to become super hubs. We have stores in those locations. The DCs are relatively small. So what we're trying to communicate is those are important markets for us that we aren't going to step away from and we'll continue to have a high level of parts availability at. -- And something I want to add, Matt, this is Greg, is that this is an old discussion here at O'Reilly. If we look back 20 or 30 years that we were talking about how we make more parts available to each store, and the reason it's become more of a discussion in the public forum now as our larger publicly traded competitors have gotten more into the do-it-for-me side of the business and realized that availability is the key to being successful in that business, it's just become more of a topic of a discussion. So we have -- as that has happened, we have worked to improve availability through hub stores and hubs and just better SKU deployment tools in our Spoke stores, we call them, stores that stand alone in the market where you -- they're not supported by hub or a DC on a same-day basis. So a big part of the success in our business, regardless of whether it's us or one of our competitors, is having the part on the shelf or having it available within an hour or two when a customer needs it. -- Perfect. That's exactly what I was looking for. Thank you very much.Thank you. And the next question in the queue comes from Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. -- Hey, thanks for taking the question. One near term and then one long term one. So inflation, given that 2% inflation isn't entirely driven by tariffs, it's in wages, like given the methodologies to calculate it, was there any inflation in Q1 '18 last year? Because I think wages were still up pretty considerably last year? -- We saw a little bit of inflation. We talked about it in 2018 was the first year in the past five years that the saw some same SKU inflation, and we've talked extensively about that. A lot of it was commodity-driven in the first quarter was less than 1%. -- Got you. Yes, that's helpful. Bigger, longer-term question. In your 10-K, you suggested that as of 12/31, you had the capacity in your DC networks to support additional 900 stores with Twinsburg, now you're adding the DC in Mississippi.Historically, at Analyst Days, you've targeted a store potential of 6,000 but seems that you're capacitizing your business to do a bit more than that, especially if you open any more DCs on the East Coast or whatnot. So I guess, just the question is like have you really thought at all your 6,000 store potential? -- What we'd say is the addition -- some of the additions here are being offset by the closure of Little Rock and Knoxville. What we also continue to see is as you would expect, there's more vehicles on the road, more model years, more parts specific to each model that the number of SKUs continue to increase. So that we need more square footage per store to cover that SKU diversity. But what we'd tell you is that we continue to look for all the opportunities we can to add stores, and we are probably expecting to have north of 6,000 stores at this point. -- And additionally, we would expect that some of our smaller regional competitors will continue to be consolidating increasing the number of stores that we would be able to have in the U.S. by replacing those stores with our stores. -- It makes sense. Thank you.The next question in the queue comes from Elizabeth Suzuki from Bank of America. Your line is open. -- Great. Thank you. Actually, that was a perfect lead-in to my question because I wanted to ask about further industry consolidations. I mean, how would you categorize the ability of some of your competitors to take share or -- in some of the trends in the last few years of share movement between the large chains, the smaller mom-and-pop operations, auto dealerships and online-only retailers? -- Well, I'll start off, and then Tom and Jeff may have some comments. But what I would say is that the large chains, obviously, have advantage from the perspective that there's this immediacy of need of parts in our business, and we're the best positioned to provide parts to any market. And I think all of us are looking to expand by acquisition where it makes sense to do so. So I think clearly, that's an advantage.I think from an online perspective, we're positioned to dominate that over time if there is more of a transition on the DIY side to online simply because of the distribution networks that we have and the availability that we can provide for online purchases, which in many cases are going to be pick-up-in-store transactions. And Tom, I don't know if you have anything you want to add to that or not? -- No. Sounds good. -- Great. And what percentage of the market at this point do you think is still not contained in the large chains that could potentially be up for potential acquisition? -- When you look at the number of stores that are selling auto parts over the last 15 years, it's been relatively consistent at 32,000 to 34,000 outlets. So when you look at the top chains, we continue to consolidate the market, but we're a little less than 50% of the overall market at this point. -- Great. Thank you.And the next question in the queue comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is open.Good morning. This is Atul Maheshwari filling in for Michael Lasser. Can you provide some color on the comparison to second quarter? I think April has an easier compare versus May and June. Is that right? And if compares are actually getting tougher over the balance of the quarter, what is giving you confidence on the 2% to 5% comp target for the second quarter? -- Yes. April is our easier compare of the quarter. What gives us confidence is simply the condition of our industry, gas price is down, miles driven and then, of course, the trend that we've been on for the past several weeks give us confidence in our ability to comp well throughout the quarter. We don't disclose our monthly comps, of course, but there is an advantage in April from a comparison standpoint as compared to May and June. -- What I would add to that is when we look at our guidance for each quarter and for the year, we're looking at a daily sales plan and obviously, April is the easiest compare. So our expectations are at the highest and we continue to do well versus our daily expectations for our 3% to 5% guide for the second quarter.Understood. And as my follow-up, if we look at your result versus a competitor who recently reported, it does appear that the spread narrowed somewhat this quarter. So do you think you're not gaining as much share as you were in the past? Or can the narrowing of the spread this quarter be explained by other factors such as calendar mix or maybe just recent variance? -- I think we're still gaining share. What I would tell you is that some of our competitors don't report in the same periods that we report. So we internally look at our business comparing our sales to their period. And I think that, to some degree, paints a little bit of a different story.I think you also have to look at the two-year stack with some of our competitors who have much easier comparisons to what we have. And then you also have to look at the makeup of their comp store sales and the -- and our competitors who have a substantial amount of job or business and how those comp store sales are calculated and so forth. So I still feel confident that we're gaining market share and over time, we'll -- this all plays out with our yearly comps and we'll see how that does.Thank you. Good luck with the rest of the year.The next question in the queue comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. Please proceed. -- Morning. On that market share question, I guess you got a couple of competitors that seem to be doing relatively better than they were, and you guys are gaining share. Does it seem like that independent network that's just over 50% of the store base is losing share at an accelerating pace? -- I don't know if it's an accelerating pace. I know as we look at some of the companies that we've talked about buying and not bought and some of the companies that we have bought, there's definitely some pressure on some of the independent guys as we grow into their markets as some of our primary competitors have improved their ability to be successful on the do-it-for-me side of the business, which is the primary business that most of these independently owned shops. So yes, I think that many of them are under pressure as those of us that have larger have continued to grow and improve the go-to-market strategy. -- Great. And then I guess, a question on the tax impact. And it really -- it's obviously impactful to DIY. Do you see any evidence that the DIFM business pushed back from tax refunds? Or is that consumer sort of higher socio-economic and could pay for the service anyway? -- It was more noticeable on the DIY side. I think that as you said from just a socio-economic standpoint, the do-it-for-me customer typically is not under the same pressure as the DIY customer. Many of which who choose to work on their own cars out of economic necessity as opposed to hobbyists and things like that. So yes, we see more pressure on the DIY side than we do on the do-it-for-me. -- Thank you again.And sir, the next question in the queue comes from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. -- Thanks a lot and good morning. Just following up on that question. If you think about the impact on the DIY customer for the delayed tax refunds in February, how do you come to the conclusion that you don't think you got all of that delayed spending back in March? -- Well, I don't think we'd come to that conclusion. We just look at our daily sales and kind of how we compare it to the plan that we had for the year. And the trend that we started on in March has continued to this point in April. But it's hard for us to know exactly what the drivers of our comp store sales results are.We just simply look back at what's happened and say, well, this could have been a factor, that could have been a factor. What I can tell you is that March we finished strong and April has been strong to this point. And based on the daily plan that we have, we feel reasonably confident that we'll be able to beat or exceed our plan for the remainder of the quarter, which is what we're trying to do every day. -- Got it. And as a follow-up, different topic, omni-channel progress. Can you give us an update on things you've done to improve the site experience, average up-to-home times, the pick-up process in stores, etc.? -- Tom, do you want to take that? -- That's an area we continue to focus on. We want to be able to interact with customers in the way they choose to reach out to us. We've gotten away from talking about specific initiatives that we're working on. What we would tell you is we continue to enhance the engagement and our website continue to improve the knowledge that we're passing on to the customers from a SKU availability look up and delivery time standpoint.Those are the key focuses for us as two-thirds of the business is pick-up-in-store. So people want to find out, do we have the part? If we don't have it -- well, do we have the part? What part do I need? When can I get it? Can I pick it up in the store? So those are the items that we continue to focus on. -- Thanks.The next question in the queue comes from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Your line is open. -- Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Following up on that last question, on the omni-channel, it does seem like some of your peers definitely are also talking about investing more heavily into that channel. So can you talk about just the online competition.Has that changed at all from either the big chains getting more aggressive there or the online-only competitors? How are legacy online-only competitor responding to you guys' investments? -- Well, the legacy online competitors, obviously, their -- the thing they have to offer customers is that the price is typically, or in some cases, lower than what a brick-and-mortar price would be. This immediacy of need thing plays in, getting advice when you buy a part plays in. Just simply the helping people solve problems with their cars is really the business that we're in, in many cases. Our biggest opportunity, and the reason we are investing in this as are brick-and-mortar competitors is that so many people today use their phones to research before they make a purchase.And if we can provide our customers information that they might not be able to get from other sources and help them solve problems with their car, gather information about the part they may be buying, understand how to install the part and what tools it takes, those are all very important factors. And the relationships that we have with our customers, which the reason we're investing as much money as we are in this. The threat from pure online competitors, we don't see as being real significant from the perspective that there are so many part stores in the U.S. and availability is so robust.And many of these products simply have to be bought same day if people want to drive their car that evening or the next day or whatever the case may be. So we feel like we're in a little bit of a protected business when it comes to pure online exposure, although our efforts and our competitors' -- our brick-and-mortar competitors' efforts are to simply be the best when it comes to content and exposing our availability and the information that they need to repair their cars. -- Got it. That's extremely helpful. And then, Tom, on the gross margin outlook, I think in your prepared comments, you mentioned that you thought the tailwinds from selling through previously bought inventory would continue into the second quarter. But as we look at the back half and comparisons get more difficult, I understand transportation headwinds could get easier, but how should we think about the cadence of gross margin as we move through the remainder of 2019? -- We would expect as we saw in the first quarter for our year over year growth to be more in the first and second quarters of the year and then to moderate in the third and fourth quarter. Based on that sell-through, we continue to work hard at making sure that we're optimizing our gross margin dollars on a daily basis. But year over year, we'd expect to be higher than the midpoint of our range in the second quarter and then moderating to come to our annual guidance. -- Thanks.Thank you. The next question in the queue comes from Zack Fadem with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. -- Hey, good morning. On the cost side in the quarter, could you talk through the drivers of the SG&A per store up 3%? And how much of this would you categorize as business as usual versus investment spending or maybe the Bennett acquisition? And then given the 2.5% to 3% guide for the year, how much should we expect that level to moderate as we move into Q2 and the back half? -- When we look at our total SG&A spend for the first quarter, we're right on plan. When we talk about the growth level, yes, we decided last year to reinvest large portion of our tax savings into service-related items primarily technology and store payroll. So the first quarter we had an adjustment for some of the benefits that we offered that was a relatively large charge, but we haven't annualized those. What we would tell you is that the growth in per-store SG&A would be obviously the highest here in the first quarter moderating in the second and third and fourth.That's all dependent on what happens in the -- with unemployment and wage rates, that is the biggest driver of the increase. And as we talked about in relation to inflation, that we're continuing to see inflationary pressures in our SG&A and seeing a benefit for that in same SKU inflation. -- Got it. That's helpful. And then just bigger picture, can we talk about the importance of national brands for your customers? Just given the competitive dynamics and rising price environment, are there any categories where your customers either Pro or DIY are shifting to your private label brand versus national brands? Any thoughts there? -- Well, I -- we've always viewed national brands or branded products as being extremely important, especially where there's a product difference. And that has been the case in many of the national brands where the product in the box is simply a better product or has some benefits that a private-label brand might not. What we do is we have multiple private label brands which are established as national brands. Some are brands that previously existed as independently owned brands by a supplier that were national brands and we over time have had the opportunity to acquire those brands and represent those exclusively at O'Reilly as national brands.So our strategy is simply that we want to carry the best products in our stores that provide the best service to our customers and give us the best opportunity to run a profitable business. And sometimes that's a brand -- a national brand that's not owned by us, sometimes it's a private-label brand that we'll represent as a national brand and sometimes it's a private-label brand that represents a significant cost advantage to our customers and would be an entry-level product that we would carry in our shelves and give them the option to trade up to a better product if they're looking for a better product and what our lower-end private labels might be. -- Got it. Appreciate the time, guys. Thank you.Thank you. We have reached our allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Greg Henslee for closing remarks. -- Thanks, Michelle. We just want to conclude our call today by thanking the entire O'Reilly team for their continued hard work and delivering another solid quarter. And I'd like to thank everyone on the call for joining us today. We look forward to reporting our second-quarter results in July.Thank you very much.[Operator signoff]When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

And as first-quarter results begin to trickle in, the big question is which stocks will outperform investor expectations by building on that 2018 momentum.With those trends in mind, we asked Motley Fool contributors to highlight a few retailers worth watching this month. Read on to see why  ,  , and   topped that list.Image source: Getty Images. Target's stock hasn't seen the strong run of its larger competitor , as over the last three years shares are flat versus a 45% gain for the latter. However, this is an opportunity, as the company is undertaking many of the same drivers that fueled Wally World's rise, most notably significant investment in the digital channel.In 2017 the company committed  to improving the customer experience with a focus on building out the digital channel, buying Internet delivery company Shipt in the process. It's working. The company reported fourth-quarter comparable sales of 5.3% with a strong assist from digital sales, which increased 31%.Despite outperforming the S&P 500 index this year -- up 22% versus 15% -- shares are still cheap, trading at a forward P/E ratio of 13 times versus 17.5 for the greater index. It's clear that investors have tempered expectations for the company going forward, but moderate expectations benefit value-oriented investors. Look for continued growth as a recommitment to customer experience and the digital channel drive revenue, earnings, and the stock price higher. Automotive aftermarket leader O'Reilly is set to kick off its fiscal 2019 with first-quarter results on Wednesday, April 24. The retailer's stock outperformed in 2018 and could push that rally deeper into 2019 -- if trends keep playing out as they have in recent reports.Image source: Getty Images.After all, O'Reilly's sales boost in the latest quarter surpassed management's forecast as the industry continued to benefit from a slowdown in new-car sales (and the concurrent increase in the average age of automobiles on the road). The chain notched surprisingly strong growth for the full year, too, which has  about industry disruption from online-only rivals. \u00a0In late April the chain should report faster sales growth, with management's forecast calling for a 4% boost at the midpoint. CEO Greg Johnson and his team are also hoping to open as many as 210 new locations in 2019, compared to 200 last year. Together, these metrics will likely push annual revenue up above $10 billion for the first time. Later this month we'll find out whether O'Reilly stands by those broad goals or perhaps has decided to boost them in response to strong demand over the winter months. Bed Bath & Beyond just reported its full-year earnings, and the results weren't pretty. For fiscal 2018, which ended on March 2, its revenue declined 3%, its comparable store sales dipped 1%, and its adjusted earnings tumbled 34%.The retailer's troubles weren't surprising, since it's been struggling to compete against , , , and other retailers. However, two things make Bed Bath & Beyond an interesting stock to watch this month.First, three major  -- Legion Partners Asset Management, Macellum Advisors, and Ancora Advisors -- are trying to replace the retailer's entire board. The three firms, which own a combined 5% stake in the company, believe that they can boost its adjusted EPS from $2.05 in fiscal 2018 to $5 within a few years.Second, Bed Bath & Beyond made some lofty claims during its fourth-quarter report. It claimed that while its revenue would likely decline 3% to 5% in 2019, its earnings would rise 3% to 7% on margin improvements. It also claimed that its revenue growth would accelerate over the \"mid- and long term\" and that its earnings would hit \"double-digit growth\" in 2020.Those promises, likely aimed at appeasing the activists, are problematic because Bed Bath & Beyond is still trying to boost its sales with margin-crushing promotions and its loss-leading Beyond+ membership plan. Dropping those strategies would likely result in ugly comps declines.I wouldn't buy Bed Bath & Beyond's stock yet, even though it looks cheap at nine times this year's earnings estimate. However, investors should follow the brewing activist battle and see if it paves the way for a meaningful turnaround.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Business schools, research and professional business firms, and professional associations alike are writing about\u2014and attempting to quantify\u2014the value and qualities of good governance. One of the world's largest independent  firms\u2014\u2014has taken a novel approach to analyzing the strength of corporate management teams by assessing companies' stewardship of investor capital.\u00a0Nasdaq recently spoke with Brett Horn of Morningstar's Equity Research team to find out more about the purpose and methodology behind Morningstar's Corporate Stewardship Rating Program and what it takes for a company to achieve \"exemplary\" status.A: Morningstar's corporate Stewardship Rating assesses management's stewardship of shareholder capital. Essentially what we're trying to answer when we look at stewardship is whether the actions and strategies of corporate management are well suited to drive long-term shareholder value\u2014or not.\u00a0\nWe have three stewardship ratings: exemplary, standard and poor. The majority of companies included in our stewardship coverage earn a \"standard\" rating. What we are doing with \"exemplary\" and \"poor\" ratings is identifying companies that we think are outliers in terms of the strength or weakness of management.\u00a0\nWhile we believe that stewardship is a material factor that investors should consider, it is just one component of evaluating investment potential. A company with exemplary stewardship could still be a \"poor\" investment even if the evaluation is correct, and vice versa for a company with a poor stewardship rating.\u00a0\nA: Capital allocation is the primary factor Morningstar evaluates when rating companies on stewardship.\u00a0\nWe review management investment strategy and valuation, both external and internal. A company with \"exemplary\" stewardship will be one that has an M&A history of making investments and acquisitions that support its competitive advantages and core business, while divesting underperforming or non-core businesses. We assess whether the company is paying a reasonable price for acquisitions. We determine if management is investing sufficiently to take advantage of all the value creative opportunities that are in front of it. We also evaluate whether management is over-investing and moving into areas where the returns are not going to be sufficient relative to the company's cost of capital.\u00a0\nWe analyze how companies approach balance sheet structure to determine if they have reached optimal financial leverage\u2014conservative, but not too conservative. We evaluate how they return capital to shareholders. We review accounting practices to determine if a company's accounting methods are aggressive or potentially deceitful, which is obviously going to be a negative.\u00a0\nWe also look at executive compensation, specifically at the incentives and the targets that management is awarded and whether those are appropriate targets to align management's interest with shareholders in the long-run.\u00a0\nA: There are a number that come to mind:\u00a0\nFounder and CEO Andrew Florence has navigated the company from its start-up days to its IPO in 1998. Since the IPO, the company has gone from $14 million in revenue to an expected $1 billion+ estimated for 2018. While acquisitions have complemented the existing platform recently, organic growth has been the main driver over the past two decades. The proprietary data CoStar has built out puts it light years ahead of its competition, and places a wide moat around the business.\u00a0\nCostco is a great example of a company that plays the hand that they've been dealt very well. The company has built up a very big footprint but stayed firmly within its circle of competence. Costco has prudently reinvested in the business, while also returning excess cash to shareholders. Management has also developed a winning culture that promotes below-average employee turnover, as the attrition rate is 6% among employees who have been there over a year\u2014as opposed to attrition rates of 50% or greater in the general retail industry.\u00a0\nFiserv is a bank technology company that was built by numerous acquisitions since their founding which left a very decentralized management system. CEO Jeff Yabucki came in and centralized the company's operations, which led to material cost savings and margin improvement. We're also impressed by its stellar M&A track record. The relatively recent acquisition of Open Solutions greatly improves its real-time processing capabilities, which appears to be the future for bank software providers. In addition, it appears Fiserv got Open Solutions on the cheap since the price mostly consisted of the assumption of debt.\u00a0\nManagement has done well to leverage the company's size to capitalize on the firm's ability to provide more consistent and rapid part availability. The benefits of the firm's broad store and distribution network, as well as management's operational prowess, have pushed returns on invested capital higher over the last five years, with returns increasing from 14% in 2011 to 23% in 2016. O'Reilly's leadership has transformed the company from a regional player into a top-four national chain, acting quickly to develop and capitalize on significant long-term brand and cost advantages.\u00a0\nManagement's strategy of providing deep levels of relationship-based banking has been unchanged since its founding, and bankers are compensated not only on the amount of assets they bring up, but how much they retain over time. The bank's focus on low costs as well has paid off, as it typically locates offices on the upper levels of buildings versus the more expensive street-level locations. Signature has undoubtedly been one of the most successful banks in the nation over the past 15 years, in large part because of Signature's straightforward business model and the nimbleness of its executives.\u00a0\nTo date, Steel Dynamics remains one of the most efficient steelmakers, not just in the U.S., but also on a global basis. Management is quick to attribute its success to its employee compensation strategy which, modeled after Nucor's approach, effectively treats employees as managers by motivating their performance via weekly and monthly production bonuses.\u00a0\nA: It's the flip side of everything that would earn a company an exemplary rating. Poor stewardship companies are negatively impacted by short-sighted investment strategies or value-destructive acquisitions. For example, maybe a company has a very attractive core business, but if they make acquisitions that stray from core competencies or don't benefit from similar competitive advantages, their long-term returns are most likely going to be poor. Or a company that makes acquisitions that represent good sense strategically, but pays dramatically too much for them, will similarly dilute long-term returns.\u00a0\nOther examples of poor stewardship include aggressively investing internally in projects that are not going to earn necessary returns; too much leverage; over-aggressive accounting; or compensation targets that are tied to a matrix that would not correspond well with long-term value.\u00a0\nWe also look at the extent to which a company is a good day-to-day operator. A company can't create shareholder value if it has frequent operational and execution missteps like industrial accidents, poor customer service, or product recalls.\u00a0\nMorningstar's Stewardship Rating differs from ISS QualityScore in a few ways. QualityScore evaluates the extent to which the company's management adheres to standard corporate governance practices. Morningstar's Stewardship Rating is evaluating management's strategy and the likelihood that management's actions will improve or deteriorate long-term returns.\u00a0\nQualityScore is a quantitative numerical score that ranks companies, whereas the Stewardship Rating does not explicitly rank order management teams against peers within their industries but against ideal stewardship. We're not trying to figure out if one management team is slightly better than the other; we are focused on identifying particularly strong or particularly weak management teams.\u00a0\nFinally, QualityScore is a more objective rating, whereas Morningstar has extensive research data and the capability of delivering a rating that considers management's actions in the context of the company's situation, which is inherently more subjective. Morningstar's equity research focuses on competitive advantages, and our analysts have a very detailed understanding of the companies they follow and the industries those companies operate in. Investors primarily care about long-term returns, and our Stewardship Rating speaks directly to that.\u00a0\u00a0The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["t has been about a month since the las  report for O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY).

Good morning everyone and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts Fourth Quarter Conference Call. Participating on the call with me this morning are Jeff Shaw, our Chief Operating Officer and Co-President; and Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer. David O'Reilly, our Executive Chairman; and Greg Henslee, our Executive Vice Chairman, are also present.To begin today's call, I would like to recognize the hard work and commitment of all of our team members throughout 2018. Your commitment to our dual market strategy and the O'Reilly culture values drove a 3.8% comparable store sales growth, which was at the top end of our annual guidance range of 2% to 4%, which we said at the beginning of the year. Your dedication to exceptional customer service and expense control yielded a total sales increase of 6.2% over the prior year and an operating profit of 19%, which was also at the top end of our annual guidance range.For the year, we generated our 26th consecutive year of comparable sales growth, record revenue and operating income, every year since becoming a public company in 1993. And I would like to thank team O'Reilly for your many contributions to support our growth and success in 2019.Now, I will cover our fourth quarter results and key expectations supporting our 2019 guidance. Our comparable sales for the fourth quarter grew 3.3%, which is in line with our expectations. From a comp store sales progression standpoint, October and November were strong with December being weaker and slightly negative. The December results fell short of our expectations due in part to seasonal business that was pulled forward into November, as we experienced cold weather earlier in the quarter in 2018 than the prior year coupled with a lack of harsh weather in December, which we were facing difficult compares with the past two Decembers.We also faced stronger than expected headwinds from Christmas and New Year's Eve falling on Monday, as opposed to Sunday in 2017. For the quarter, both DIY and professional were contributors to our comparable store sales growth with professional contributing continuing to outperform DIY. Average ticket value drove comparable store sales growth due to increasing parts complexity same-SKU inflation of approximately 2% and a higher mix of hard parts on the DIY side, as customers attempt to defer non-critical repairs and maintenance, as pricing increase -- increases across the economy, put pressure on many of our DIY customers' wallets.For the full year 2019, we are establishing our comparable store sales guidance at 3% to 5%. We anticipate that the demand drivers for the automotive aftermarket industry will remain solid, as miles driven grows at a modest pace, supported by continued record high levels of employment, with gas prices remaining in a reasonably positive range.We expect continuation of the trend we have seen for several years, where average ticket growth is driven by increasing complexity of parts on newer model year vehicles and also expect additional top-line growth from same-SKU inflation, similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. This level of inflation is based on known input cost pressures and does not take into account additional tariffs or other unknown factors. We expect DIY ticket counts to continue to be under pressure, as a more economically constrained customers feel the pinch of rising prices across the economy and reacts by attempting to defer repairs and maintenance, when possible.We expect continued solid growth on the professional customer ticket counts, as we continue to consolidate the market and these end-user consumers tend to be better able to cope with increasing prices. As normal, we expect pricing in the industry to be rational and weather patterns to be average.For the first quarter, we are establishing a comparable store sales guidance range of 3% to 5%, which is in line with our expectation for the full year. We remain extremely confident in our team's ability to provide industry-leading customer service and gain market share and are pleased with the solid start 2019, we have seen thus far in the first quarter.For the fourth quarter and the full-year, gross margin as a percent of sales was 53.3% and 52.8% respectively. The fourth quarter gross margin is higher than the full year due to normal seasonality in sales mix related to winter weather. Full year gross margin was in line with our guidance throughout the year.For 2019, we are sitting our guidance range for gross margin at 52.7% to 53.2% of sales, which is a 20 basis point increase from the 2018 guidance range. Assumed in our guidance, our continued incremental improvements and supplier agreements our continued ability to pass along acquisition cost increases to the end consumer and leverage on our fixed distribution cost of higher sales volumes. These gains will be partially offset by continued pressure from distribution wages and freight costs. Tom will provide more additional gross margin details in his comments.Fourth quarter operating profit as a percent of sales came in at 18.5% and the full year was 19%. Both are at the top end of our expectations. On a year-over-year comparison, operating profit declined by 19 basis points, as we directed approximately 30% of our tax savings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts of 2017 back into the business with a focus on our in-store and omnichannel efforts.For 2019, we anticipate our operating profit will be in the range of 18.7% to 19.2% of sales. Jeff will discuss our SG&A expectations in more detail. However, we expect to see leverage on our fixed costs on higher sales, offset by a more inflationary cost environment and continued focus on strengthening our in-store customer service and omnichannel experience.For the fourth quarter, earnings per share of $3.72 represented an increase of 5.7% and for the full year 2018, earnings per share of $16.10 was an increase of 27.1%. Excluding the impact of the excess tax benefit from stock options on our tax rate and the revaluation of our deferred tax liability in the fourth quarter of 2017, our quarterly and annual earnings per share increased 34.5% and 35.8% respectively. Tom will provide more information on our tax rate in his prepared comments.For the first quarter of 2019, we are establishing our earnings per share guidance at a range of $3.92 to $4.02. And for the year, our guidance is $17.37 to $17.47. Our quarterly and full-year guidance includes an estimate for the excess tax benefit from stock options and the impact of shares repurchased through this call, but does not include any additional share repurchases.Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I would like to again acknowledge the outstanding contributions of our entire team. Our track record of 26 consecutive years of record comparable store sales growth, record revenue and operating income is the direct result of your hard work and commitment and I have every confidence we will extend that streak in 2019.I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Shaw. Jeff? -- Thanks Greg, and good morning, everyone. I'd also like to thank team O'Reilly for delivering another record-breaking year. Your commitment to consistent, excellent customer service has always been the strength of our company and will continue to be our strength in the future. At the beginning of the year, we plan to reinvest a portion of our savings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act back into the business with a target of 70 basis points of additional SG&A spend. We successfully executed on that plan and through solid expense control and better leverage from a solid 6.2% increase in sales, our SG&A only delevered 46 basis points coming in at 33.8% of sales for the year.For the full year, SG&A per store increased 3.4%, which was near the top end of our beginning of the year guidance of 3% to 3.5% of sales and is consistent with what we would expect with comparable sales at the higher end of our guidance range. The increase is primarily attributable to variable expenses and variable compensation at virtually every level of the company, as we structure our pay plans for our team members to run it like they own it.For 2019, we're expecting SG&A to continue to grow at a rate higher than our historical norms of 1.5% to 2%. Looking at our 2019 SG&A spend, we expect to continue to aggressively pursue our in-store in omnichannel goals and anticipate continued pressure to variable costs, especially payroll from the current inflationary environment and record low unemployment rates, which we expect to partially offset by better leverage on our fixed cost. As a result, we are establishing our initial SG&A guidance at a 2.5% to 3% increase per store.For the year, we successfully achieve our goal of opening 200 net new stores. We set our 2019 new store goal to open between 200 and 210 net new stores on our third quarter call. Since that time, we purchased Bennett Auto Supply in South Florida, and because of the additional work it will take to convert those stores, we will end up in the lower portion of the new store opening range, excluding the Bennett stores.For the acquired Bennett stores, our plan is to merge 13 of these stores into existing O'Reilly stores and convert the remaining 20 into O'Reilly stores in the first half of the year. Due to the impact from transitioning business during the merger process, the remaining 20 stores will not enter our comparable store sales base until January of 2020. We expect to incur between $4 million and $5 million related to closing down the 13 stores, the Bennett DC and the offices and these costs are an additional headwind built into our SG&A growth per store assumptions.Our capital expenditures for the year were $504 million, which was squarely in the middle of our beginning of the year CapEx guidance of $490 million to $520 million. For 2019, we have a number of large projects and we expect CapEx to increase to a range of $625 million to $675 million. This is a big step-up from 2018 and would represent our largest CapEx investment in company history. So, I'll provide a little color around the additional projects that are creating the sizable increase.First, we have our two announced an ongoing distribution projects, a new location in Twinsburg, Ohio, just south of Cleveland and an upgrade in Lebanon in Tennessee, just east of Nashville. The new larger Nashville DC will allow us to convert the current Knoxville DC into a super hub and then consolidate both existing Nashville and Knoxville DCs. Our CapEx plan also includes an additional DC projects starting during the year and we'll provide you the details, when we close on that property later in the year. Second, with the conversion of the Bennett stores, we'll have new store CapEx for between 220 and 230 new stores this year.Next, we continue to invest heavily in our omnichannel experience. This includes, but is not limited to, our online functionality, our in-store experience and distribution systems to facilitate multiple delivery options to meet customer's desire. And finally, as both our installed store base and distribution network grow, we're committed to spending the CapEx required to keep these assets operating at peak performance, and investing in new tools and technology to continue to take market share.We have always geared our business model to generate long-term sustainable growth, that is solidly profitable. We're very confident our SG&A spend and our capital investments in 2019, will put us in a great position to continue our history of success. However, we're an extremely proactive and detail-oriented company, and should situations change or additional opportunities arise, we will make changes to our investment strategy on a store-by-store, project-by-project basis.As I conclude my comments, I'd like to again thank the entire O'Reilly team for a solid year in 2018. We're well positioned in 2019, to capitalize on the solid macroeconomic factors that underpin our business and we look forward to continuing to (technical difficulty) of strong results in 2019, by rolling up our sleeves and earning our customers' business, we're providing excellent customer service each and every day, all of our stores across the country.Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom. -- Thanks, Jeff. Now, we'll take a closer look at our quarterly results and our guidance for 2019. For the quarter, sales increased to $124 million, comprised $71 million increase in comp store sales, a $50 million increase in non-comp store sales, a $6 million increase in non-comp non-store sales and a $3 million decrease from closed stores. For 2019, we expect our total revenues to be between $10 billion and $10.3 billion.Our gross margin was up 41 basis points for the quarter, as we experienced stable merchandise margins and benefited from the LIFO comparison to the prior year. We did not see a LIFO charge during the quarter versus a $3 million charge last year. For the full year, we did not experience a LIFO charge versus a $22 million charge in the prior year. For 2019, we do not anticipate a LIFO charge, as we expect inflation will continue to put upward pressure on aggregate acquisition costs.On a year-over-year basis, we expect gross margins for the first two quarters of the year to see the largest improvement, as we receive a benefit from selling through the on-hand inventory that was purchased prior to the recent tariffs -- tariff-driven acquisition price increases and corresponding retail and wholesale price increases.Our fourth quarter effective tax rate was 23.6% of pre-tax income and was comprised of a base rate of 24%, reduced by a 0.4% benefit from share-based compensation. This compares to the fourth quarter of 2017 rate of 19.8% of pre-tax income, which was comprised of the base tax rate of 37.4%, reduced by a 3.5% benefit for share-based compensation, and a benefit of 14.1% or $53 million related to the initial measurement --remeasurement of our federal deferred tax liability, from a tax rate of 35%, down to the new 21% rate, in accordance with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.For the full year, our effective tax rate was 21.8% of pre-tax income, comprised of a base rate of 23.9%, reduced by 2.1% for share-based compensation. For the full year of 2019 , we expect an effective tax rate of 23.5%, comprised of a base rate of 24.1%, reduced by a benefit of 0.6% for share based compensation. We expect our base rate to be relatively consistent with the exception of the third quarter, which maybe lower due to the tolling of certain open tax periods. Also variations in the tax benefit from share-based compensation will create fluctuations in our quarterly tax rate.Now we move on to free cash flow and the components that drove our results for the year and our expectations for 2019. Free cash flow for 2018 was $1.2 billion, which was a $300 million increase from the prior year. The increase was driven by higher operating profit and lower cash taxes, offset in part by higher capital expenditures and cash interest.In 2019, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion with the year-over-year decrease due to higher CapEx and higher cash taxes, offset by increased operating profit. Inventory per store at the end of the quarter was $612,000, which was a 2% increase from the end of 2017. The increase was at the top end of our guidance, as cost increases in year end acquisition of Bennett, push the metric to the top end of the range.That said, our gross inventory levels were well-managed throughout the year, as our ongoing goal is to ensure, we grow per store inventory at a lower rate than the comparable store sales growth we generate. For 2019, we expect per store inventory to grow between 2% and 2.5% with the acquisition cost increases and the fourth quarter opening of the Cleveland DC putting pressure on the growth percentage. Our AP to inventory ratio at the end of the quarter was 106%, which is where we ended 2017. We were slightly below the anticipated level of 107%, as the acquisition of Bennett and slower December sales pressured the ratio. For 2019, we expect to remain flat at a 106% of inventory.Moving on to debt . We finished the fourth quarter with an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.23 times, as compared to our ratio of 2.12 times at the end of 2017. The increase in our leverage ratio reflects the $750 million, 10-year bonds we issued in May and incremental borrowings on our $1.2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility. We are below our stated leverage target of 2.5 times and we will approach this number, when appropriate.We continue to execute our share repurchase program, and for 2018, we repurchased 6.1 million shares at an average share price of $282.80, for a total investment of $1.71 billion. Subsequent to the end of the year, through the date of our press release, we repurchased 0.7 million shares at an average price of $341.20. We remain very confident that the average repurchase price is supported by expected discounted future cash flows of our business. And we continue to view our buyback program as an effective means of returning excess capital to our shareholders.Finally, before I open up the call to your questions, I'd like to thank the O'Reilly team for their dedication to the company and our customers.This concludes our prepared comments. And at this time, I'd like to ask Vanessa, the operator to turn the line, and we'll be happy to answer your question.And thank you. We will now open the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan. -- Thanks, good morning guys. Can you talk a little bit about the regional performance that you saw during the quarter. How does that compare to earlier than -- earlier in the year? And related to that, can you expand upon your quarter-to-date comments? Obviously, a lot of variability around the winter some tough compares, but overall, what are you seeing quarter-to-date, and how would you assess the winter so far compared to sort of history in last year? -- Yes, this is Jeff, and I'll take the first half of that and then flip it over to Tom and Greg. As far as regional performance, really our regional performance was in line with our expectations and pretty solid across the majority of the country that the central part of the country was a little bit softer than the rest, really due to just lack of winter weather in a lot of those markets. And also we had a little bit of headwind down south from the post hurricane numbers we compare against. -- So Chris, from a from a cadence standpoint, although we don't disclose what our actual comp numbers or trends are on a month-by-month basis, what I would tell you is, we feel good about our three to five guide. We've talked about December being the softest month of the quarter and as we moved into 2019, we've seen a more typical weather pattern. We would view this winter as a more normal winter. We've had ups and downs. We've had spikes along the way in different areas of the country and as normal, where we have those spikes, we have improved sales related to the winter weather spikes. But, overall we feel, we continue to feel good about our three to five guide for the quarter. -- Understood. And then as my follow-up, can you -- Tom, can you remind us of what the inflation was for in totality for 2018? I think you mentioned 2% in the fourth quarter, what was that over the year and how are you thinking about the overall inflationary environment in 2019? Thanks very much. -- It ramped up through 2018. No significant numbers in the first and second quarter. So, we ramped up to 1% and 1.5% in the third quarter and 2%. So, I'd say a little above 1% in total. When we look at 2019 and Greg's prepared comments, our expectation is, we're going to see a similar number that we saw in the fourth quarter, which was 2%. -- Got it. Good luck for the year, guys. -- Thank you. -- Thanks.And thank you. We have our next question from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. -- Thanks. Hey guys. I wanted to follow-up on that inflation point. So, the 200 basis points of same-SKU inflation that you're expecting in '19. Just to clarify, is that, that's the net impact on comps, or so in other words, are you considering the volume offsets within that as well? -- So, that would be our expectation for what's going to drive our total inflation number that goes into our average ticket, as we've seen over the last 10 or 15 years of the new model years roll on. They have more expensive parts primarily based on technology that's in those parts and that's been a tailwind to average ticket over the last decade. We think that's going to be augmented by 2% in totality in 2019. -- Got you. Okay. And then on the DIY trends, you've talked about that for a couple of quarters now, some level of caution around the DIY business, suggesting that maybe the consumers have been deferring maintenance. Any signs that, that may be starting to normalize? If you give us some more color on what you think is driving that deferral, and what needs to happen for that to change? That would be helpful. Thank you. -- Yes, I think a big part of -- we talked last year about fuel prices maybe impacting discretionary spending. This year, we're cautious that inflation may again have an impact on discretionary spending for that lower income DIY customer. That customer would have to make necessary repairs to keep their car running, to get them into work, to the grocery store and what have you. But from a discretionary standpoint, when you get to items like routine maintenance, deferring oil changes, longer extended oil change periods, those things you can push out a little longer, filters things like that and your car still runs fine. You're just not following the manufacturer's recommended schedules for doing that. So, I think the DIY customers that are on the lower end of the wage scale and are more economically challenged, as we said, they're going to have to make those breakage related repairs. But some of those repairs and maintenance things that are somewhat discretionary, they're going to be likely to push those off. -- Okay, thank you.And thank you. Our next question comes from Elizabeth Suzuki with Bank of America. -- Great, thanks. Throughout 2018, you guys have guided to comps 2 %to 4%, now you're looking for '19 at 3% to 5%. Given that we still have a fair amount of winter left, which could either end up being favorable or unfavorable versus last year's normal winter, and you mentioned that you think this year is looking fairly normal as well. And what are the other factors that are really driving the outlook for an acceleration and comps? -- Yes, a lot of the things we talked about Liz, it's you know, we fuel cost has come down over the past several weeks. And I think the expectation is that fuel prices will continue to be lower this year than prior year and that will be supportive of increasing miles driven. Just we look at the whole industry backdrop, the fact that employment rates are higher, the economies more stable. Those things it just these created an industry backdrop that's more favorable and you add that to Tom's point about average ticket growing because of a combination of parts complexity, the cost of the more technology related parts on newer cars and the inflation tailwind we had. We felt good about three to five guide.One of the things, I would add to that, and it's not really related to the guide, but it sure makes us feel a lot better about, where we are is. We had our annual Leadership Conference in Dallas back in mid-January and in that conference, we had about 6900 O'Reilly team members, all of our store managers, district managers, regional managers were there. And we do that every year, but it sure felt different, going into conference this year than it has the past year or two because there was just a lot of excitement, a lot of positive attitudes coming from our store managers when they got there and we really focused that week on, on things like ownership, running the business like you own it.We talked about commitment of running and driving a profitable business. We talked about customer service. And our team is left that conference really motivated and we feel like that they're out there on the streets, driving sales and providing even a higher level of customer service than they may have done last year. -- So, in an environment that where the industry is potentially growing kind of mid single digits, as it usually does like 2% to 3%, or maybe a little bit better. Do you feel like you can continue to gain market share in 2019? -- Yes, we do. I mean that again to Greg's point, I mean, our philosophy, our business model, our strategic distribution network, I mean, our programs, I mean, we are our teams with a lot of tools, what happens one customer and one store at a time and we're focused on fundamental execution on both the do-it-for-me and the DIY side each and every day in each one of our markets. -- All right. Great, thank you.And thank you. Our next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. -- Hey, everyone, it's Simeon. Tom, I wanted to ask you first about the flow through. And so in the past, when you guided you typically allowed sales to what drives the upside, or downside to your forecast. And I want to ask you about 2019, if there's any greater likelihood that margins could surprise, or it's really dictated by where you end up with net sales guidance? -- As a multi-unit retailer relatively high fixed cost because of the service component of our business, sales will be the key to leveraging operating profit performance to the extent that those sales don't come in as high as we'd like. We have levers to pull. Although we won't do anything in the short term that will impact long-term relationships. And on the upside, we'll continue to-we'll see leverage, but we want to make sure that if the demand is there, we're providing the level of customer service that builds those long-term relationships. -- Got it. Okay, thanks. And then secondly for Greg. I wanted to ask about map or whatever they call eMRP pricing that's out there. We're hearing from more brands that or some even distributors that more brands are going toward this direction, basically controlling price. Curious if you've seen that to sort of what's changing, and I guess did that price discipline being shown across different channels, where we're just not seeing is, I don't know bigger as problematic pricing differences as there could be? -- Yes, I mean, one of our -- one of our suppliers half bunch of suppliers for couple of years now has been for them to protect their brand and control their pricing online. And there were a couple of suppliers, a couple of years ago in 2017, that they really pioneered this for the industry and we really had a slow start to get other suppliers to come onboard.So, late 2018, we had two or three major suppliers come onboard and so far in 2019, we've had several additional suppliers to commit. So, whether it's an eMRP pricing program, or a Matt pricing program, or unilateral pricing program, different suppliers have taken different approaches based on recommendations from their legal department or counsel. We are gaining some traction in that respect and I think, we'll see more tighter controls across the industry for online sales going forward. -- Okay. Thanks, Greg. -- Sure.And thank you. Our next question comes from Bret Jordan with Jefferies. -- Good morning, guys. -- Good morning. -- On pricing, I guess as you get other brick and mortar shops, are you seeing any increased competition, I guess, anybody rather than passing through some of the inflation holding it, and trying to reduce pricing to get more commercial volume? -- Well, I mean that's ongoing. I mean that's happened forever. I mean there's always been suppliers out there, when times get tough, they cut their prices a little, offer rebates, try to buy the business. That's normally a short-term strategy. I mean it's really, probably I've been in the business, it's been a service and relationship business. And you really build the business and keep the business through solid service, availability and then solid relationships, partnering with that shop to help them grow their business. But pricing comes and goes depending on how tough business is. -- Okay. And then I guess within your omnichannel initiatives, you have any sort of data as far as maybe increase of buy online, pickup in store, where the trajectory is there, I mean, obviously you ramp it up? -- Sure. Overall, it has increased significantly. I will tell you that from a breakout standpoint, ship-to-home, buy online, pickup in store, it fluctuates slightly, Bret. But we're staying right around that two-thirds of our online sales or pickup in store, which is where we want. We want to end up that customer inside our store, we can make sure that we provide the highest level of service and make sure they -- we have everything they knew to complete the job. -- Okay, great. Thank you. -- You bet.And, thank you. We have our next question from Michael Lasser with UBS. -- Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. So, as we think about modeling the course of your year, you're guiding 3 to 5, it sounds like the start of the year it has been good, in part because of inflation, progressively over the course of the year. The inflation repairs are getting it more difficult and you're going to no longer likely see the benefit of some of the tariff related price increases and probably have less visibility into the second half of the year. So, as we model the year should we take a more cautious view on the second half of the year, and along those lines, what happens if it -- how our models be affected if 25% tariff goes through? -- Okay, Michael, this is Tom. What we would tell you that our comps will be relatively consistent on a quarter-by-quarter basis. On a year-over-year basis, as you pointed out, the first quarter will have the most inflationary benefit. We also have an extra Sunday here in the first quarter, which is a 50 bp headwind.When we look at the rest of the year, it should be relatively consistent, we pickup a Sunday in the third quarter and it was the fourth quarter, the ease going from a weekend to Monday, really were a big headwind for our business and that from a calendar standpoint, will help the fourth quarter. So, we look a pretty consistent comps throughout the quarter. -- And on the 25% tariff? -- I'm sorry. And your second question, Michael was -- -- On the 25% tariffs? -- On the 25% tariffs. Yes, as Greg pointed out, our expectations are, we're going to be in the same state we are now for the year and obviously things have changed a lot. To the extent that we saw those additional tariffs go in March, we'll have to see how the market reacts. But our expectation is that we'll see a larger increase in average ticket, driven by those cost increases. And then offsetting pressure because of those rising prices on ticket count. -- And if I could ask a follow-up on the SG&A in the investment side, this will be second in a year -- another year where SG&A per store growth is above what it's been historically. Is this a function of maybe the cost of doing business within the auto part retail sector becoming more expensive for whatever reason, more competition becoming more complicated, or is this just a catch-up from maybe some different investment philosophies in the past? -- Well, I would point you back to our call this year, -- last year this time and we talked about a rise in SG&A cost, as people reinvested, part of their savings from the new tax laws and that we would see those costs go up, but we wouldn't see a proportional increase in average ticket from inflation, on the top-line.And at that time, we said when we look at next year, if we continue to see cost inflation and the expenses to run the business, we'd expect to feel that tailwind in our top-line same-SKU inflation and that's what we're seeing this year.Given that unemployment is very low, wages are growing up very quickly, costs are going up, interest rates are going up, we're seeing that inflation run through all our expenses and getting the top-line tailwinds. So, we don't think the business itself has changed, we think that we're just more in a inflationary environment than we've seen in the last five to eight years. -- Understood. Thank you so much.And, thank you. We have our next question from Chris Bottiglieri with Wolfe Research. -- Hi, thanks for taking the question. One quick follow-up and I got one bigger picture question. So, is there a way to walk us on the 10 point tariff to a 2 price increase. What percentage of SKUs were impacted, product costs, percentage of COGS or were the offsets are, maybe I just want to bridge there? -- So, all of our products are produced overseas. It's a portion of them and even for some lines, some are here in the States and some are not. We're not going to get into breaking down the individual numbers. We push back on all the price increases we get, whether they're tariff related, interest rate related, healthcare related, raw commodity related, but that ends up being the blended number. And we didn't take full 10% increases on most of our products. -- Got it. Okay and then a bigger picture question was just from your distribution strategy. You talked about the super hub that you referenced after you consolidated the TDCs. The nomenclature though of our super hub, I think is different, not to be confused with your peers are doing to replace DCs with larger hubs stores. So, it's just like more equivalent to your master DCs or you just walk us through kind of what you're doing there would be helpful. -- I mean, we basically have a -- our spoke store, and then we have a hub store, that would be in the 45,000 SKU range and then we have super hubs, but we don't have DCs in a large metro market that would be in that 80,000, 90,000 SKU range and then our DCs would obviously have in that 160,000, 170,000 SKU range. -- Yes, Chris, if I could, could add to that a little bit about why we're making that change. We are facing some pretty significant capacity issues in both Middle Tennessee or Nashville DCs located and our East Tennessee market in Knoxville. And we had to make a move and we decided to consolidate those two facilities into a much larger facility. That will allow DC to have a larger breadth of SKUs for the some of that customer base, but because that market in Knoxville is a market that's had a DC inventory presence for a number of years now, we wanted to supplement that markets for same-day service by converting that DC into a super hub and making sure that we maintain that same day parts availability in the Knoxville market. -- Got it. Lastly, this is a one-off just specific to that market? Or do you foresee or envision creating more these super hubs throughout the country? Thank you. -- We've always used to super hub strategy, but in the case of Knoxville, I mean Knoxville was just, it was no mid-stage DC and it just didn't -- it wasn't big enough to have the capacity that we needed to truly service that market. -- Jeff, we got 340-ish hub stores and how many super hubs of those super hubs? -- 40 give or take. -- We've got several on the markets right now. -- Okay. Got it. Got it. It's helpful. Thank you.And thank you. Our next question is from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities. -- Thanks a lot, and good morning. -- Good morning. -- My questions around the gap between DIY and pro-comps. Could you provide some color as to how that trended for each quarter through 2018 and how you're looking at that through 2019? -- We've spoken to it on each quarter you can find that information. We don't give the actual number. What we would tell you is that, when we look at 2018, we've been pressured on the DIY customer count. Pro has grown each year -- each quarter. Average ticket is up on both and we'd expect that trend to continue in 2019. -- But you don't expect that sales gap to widen between DIY and commercial in 2019? -- We're anticipating a similar difference with professional business continuing to grow faster based on our ability to consolidate the market, based on that consumer being less impacted by general rising prices and based on other macro factors our business slightly aging population and more expensive repairs that are more technical in nature on late model vehicles being expensive. -- Got it. Perfect. That's helpful. And then secondly, looking at your CapEx budget for 2019, you provide some color on some of the things are driving the increase. Could you give a little bit more granularity, which are the factors DCs, new stores, IT projects, maintenance, are changing the most from 2018 to 2019? -- Biggest changes are, number one is DCs and DC projects. Number two is in-store technology. -- Thank you.And thank you. Our next question is from Matt McClintock with Barclays. -- Yes, good morning everyone. In 26 years, it's just amazing. Congrats. -- Thank you. -- I'd like to follow up on Michael's question a little bit maybe parse it out in a different way. Just the in-store and omnichannel investments in 2018 that you're continuing to do in 2019. I know you invest for long-term sustainable growth, but can you give us some sense of when the payback is on those investments are? When we should expect the payback on those investments, whether that be through increased sales, accelerating sales or margin or whatever the payback is? Thanks. -- What we would tell you is that, most of these changes are just consumer expectations. Consumers shop outside of auto parts that many retailers and their expectation of what great services changes over time. And our job is to continue to make sure that our customer service levels are up there, to maintain our business. It's hard to parse out what that is from a sustaining standpoint versus additional business. It's part of the factors that go into customer service that drive our comps to be higher than the industry growth rates. -- Yeah, Matt, to add on to that, I'm not going to go into any details about what the initiatives are for competitive reasons. But from an omnichannel perspective, we're primarily focused on improving content, improving online search, improving -- customers buying decisions, whether they buy online, ship to home, buy online pickup in store or research online buy in store, a lot of those transactions and buying decisions are made based on research online. So, we're just focused on making sure that we are providing the highest level of searchability so to speak, for our products, for our customers and we think that's going to pay dividends long-term from a sales perspective. How we quantify that, it's very difficult to do. -- All right, I understand that. And thanks for the color. And just on my follow-up, just the seasonal pull forward in November, were there any margin implications for the quarter from that? -- No, there wouldn't be. -- Perfect. Thank you very much.And thank you. We have our next question from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. -- Good morning, guys. How you are doing? -- Good morning, Scot. -- Hi. So, I'm curious, in your business plan for 2019, are you expecting any industry trend change based on the car park and tell me how are you thinking about the car park? It's obviously an investor topic, but as company operating in that industry, I'm curious, you know, how you guys thinking about it? -- As the bubble year go through from the Great Recession, that's part of the reason that two years ago was kind of the biggest headwind for those year vehicles entering our sweetspot and kick that professional business more in 2018. That's part of the reason that it was more of a gap between the DIY and professional.We'd expect that, that will continue to, as that moves through to the older vehicle years that are much higher DIY to continue to, one be a positive on the professional side, because there is not the headwind and it will start to be more of a headwind on the DIY side. -- And so, are you expecting those trends to become exaggerated in 2019? In other words, aren't there just more vehicles kind of coming into that repairs stage, and have you factored that into your expectations your 3 to 5 comp count? -- We wouldn't expect it to accelerate because if the pressure is the DIY side of the business that's also the side of the business, it's growing from a longer tail of vehicles and vehicle staying on the road longer. Those 10, 12, 14, 15 year vehicles are primarily DIY side business and that's helping to offset the pressure from those bubble years. -- Got it. All right. Thanks guys. -- Thank you.And thank you. Our next question is from Daniel Imbro with Stephens. -- Yes, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. -- Good morning. -- On the gross margin guidance, you guys mentioned as far as cadence, the expansion to be front-half weighted. And I think you identified freight pressures, as a potential headwind to gross margins?Can you talk about, when you really saw freight pressure step up in 2018? And, is there anything different about those cost pressures that would inhibit you from passing them through in the form of price, like you would any other form of inflation? -- Well, it seems like we've been on the three year run for freight costs us continue to go up, and that's a population of jobs that is a very, very tight market and that type market is driving increases. When we look at our distribution costs obviously, we deliver nightly at all the stores. So, there is quite a bit of pressure there and we built that into our costs. But we've got to be market competitive. So, to the extent that we're a higher distribution intensive company that's more exposed to this. We're going to have little pressure that we're not able to pass on. -- Got it. And then just within that expectation, are you expecting a similar price increase that we saw in 2018 and 2019? -- 2018 was pretty, pretty high for rate. The incremental year-over-year increase is less, but the number still a higher rate than we experienced in 2018. -- Got it. That's helpful. And then from a follow-up, when I think about December, you guys mentioned a few negative impact, the holiday calendar shift, weather a tougher compare. Can you maybe quantify some of those headwinds, as we think about the deceleration from November and December? -- We can't -- we are not going to quantify them. But in that order of magnitude, number one item in December it's very weather driven, people fix their vehicles, if they have to, otherwise into holiday shopping. So, that's number one. And then number two would be the calendar shifts of the eves. -- Got it. Thanks. Best of luck. -- Thanks. -- Thank you.And thank you. We have reached our allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call over to Mr Greg Johnson for closing remarks. -- Thank you, Vanessa.

Additionally, higher demand for on-highway and construction products in India, Europe and Latin America are expected to drive the company's revenue generation from markets outside North America.In North America, Cummins expects its market share in heavy-duty trucks to rise 15-17% from 2017 while medium-duty trucks' market share is anticipated to witness annual growth of 31-34%. Further, changed government policies are expected to drive truck demand in China and India. For 2018, the company projects to sell 1.3 million units of medium and heavy-duty trucks in China, and witness record truck sales in India.

In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.O'Reilly Automotive has an Earnings ESP of +2.01% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 6. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the  , it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.This auto parts retailer is expected to pos  of $3.75 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +29.3%.Revenues are expected to be $2.33 billion, up 6.2% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.06% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For O'Reilly Automotive, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.01%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that O'Reilly Automotive will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that O'Reilly Automotive would pos  of $4.30 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.50, delivering a surprise of +4.65%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.O'Reilly Automotive appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

The company's power solutions segment generates the majority of its revenues by selling replacement batteries while the rest is achieved by selling batteries for the production of new vehicles. Declining production in China is a concern for the company's power solutions segment that delivers roughly 154 million lead-acid batteries a year in the world's largest automotive market.Further, rise in commodity prices, owing to high tariffs, is anticipated to create a dent in the company's profit margins. The other segment, building technologies & solutions' production involves raw materials - consisting of steel, aluminum and copper - whose high costs might hamper the segment's EBITA.Other headwinds for Johnson Controls are salesforce expansion and incremental investments to develop products. Despite such a backdrop, the company anticipates witnessing a strong fiscal year on the back of robust end-market demand.For the soon-to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for power solutions' and building technologies & solutions' net revenues are pegged at $2.5 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for power solutions' and building technologies & solutions' adjusted EBIT are pinned at $407 million and $601 million, respectively.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Johnson Controls is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ORLY options chain for the new March 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $320.00 strike price has a current bid of $7.90. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $320.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $312.10 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ORLY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $334.43/share today.Because the $320.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

Following the same growth strategy, O'Reilly targets to open 200-210 stores in the current year, balancing between growing markets and matured ones. | The company's store expansion is backed by a strong distribution network that provides O'Reilly a competitive edge over its peers. Further, it has been making investments to expand its distribution centers that are likely to support its continued store growth. Further, O'Reilly's wide-ranging product portfolio caters to Do-it-Yourself (DIY) and Do-it-for-Me (DIFM) customers, which is driving comparable store sales growth. In fact, this has encouraged O'Reilly to raise its 2018 guidance for comparable store sales to 3-4% from 2-4% mentioned earlier. For 2018, it anticipates earnings per share of $15.95-$16.05.Apart from robust demand, the company is expected to gain from economic stability, and improved aging of average cars. For fourth-quarter 2018, it expects earnings per share of $3.6-$3.7, whereas comparable store sales are expected to be 2-4%. O'Reilly is scheduled to report quarterly and full-year results on Feb 6.Despite such soaring demand, O'Reilly is expected to experience a slump in profit margins, owing to tariff-related raw material costs in 2018. The same pressure on the profit margin is likely to continue in 2019 as well, owing to tariffs on commodities imported to the United States. Further, wage pressure, freight costs and fuel expenses are other headwinds for O'Reilly. For 2018, this specialty parts retailer expects capital expenditure of $490-$520 million, marking an increase from $466 million recorded in 2017.Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for O'Reilly's annual earnings has moved 0.12% upward.

For starters, they all reported solid same-store-sales growth in 2018, marking somewhat of a recovery from a period of weakness.Data source: company presentations. Chart by author.Revenue growth at auto-parts retailers is partly dependent on weather -- as extreme weather in winter and summer puts stress on cars -- as well as on miles driven and the age of the automobiles. Vehicles more than seven years old are typically the sweet spot for auto-parts retailers.Therefore, after a couple of years of mild winters, O'Reilly, AutoZone and Advance Auto Parts found themselves surpassping easier comparable numbers from previous years, aided by a pickup in the economy in 2018 that encouraged a record year for miles driven.Second, fears over a cyclical slowdown in the economy fed through into a defensive mentality in the market, and investors may have decided to switch away from more cyclically aligned stocks toward auto-parts retailers -- traditionally seen as good  .Image source: Getty Images.Third, the slowdown in auto sales has encouraged investors to believe that the outlook for O'Reilly is going to get better in the coming years.

There's little doubt that Amazon has pressured the industry, but O'Reilly et al. are likely to still have a key edge through their ability to have parts in stock that a customer -- particularly a business customer -- needs immediately.Of course, when auto-parts retailers' sales were weak in 2016 and 2017, there was no end of speculation that Amazon was behind it. The performance in 2018 helped allay existentialist fears over the sector.Investors fearing the worst from the economy in 2019 are likely to still favor buying stock in the sector, but given the strong rise in 2018, O'Reilly and the others need to deliver on their potential.  at  the start of 2018, but now that positive expectations have been baked into valuations, investors need to keep a very close eye on all three companies to see whether they meet expectations in 2019.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It ended up following through just a couple of days later, but to no avail. Shares reversed course the day after that, and spent the following month falling back to its previous low around $27.That pullback ended up turning into a double-bottom though, and since the MAS has fought its way back above $27. The newest hurdle now stands just above $33, where Masco shares peaked the one day more than a month ago the ceiling at $27 was breached.

(Symbol: ORLY) saw new options become available this week, for the August 16th expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 225 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ORLY options chain for the new August 16th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $340.00 strike price has a current bid of $28.90. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $340.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $311.10 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ORLY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $343.01/share today.Because the $340.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 58%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 8.50% return on the cash commitment, or 13.79% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $340.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $350.00 strike price has a current bid of $32.50. If an investor was to purchase shares of ORLY stock at the current price level of $343.01/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $350.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 11.51% if the stock gets called away at the August 16th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ORLY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing ORLY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $350.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $350.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 46%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

In the last reported quarter, it witnessed an 8.1% year-over-year decline in new vehicle unit sales while the gross profit declined 13%. Huge availability of off-lease used vehicles contributed to the decline in new vehicle sales. Further, a similar trend is anticipated to continue in the coming quarters as well. With an aim to balance the loss by new vehicles sales, the company is launching branded products under the finance and insurance (F&I) business. The latest launches are expected to contribute to drive AutoNation's financials.In third-quarter 2018, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.24, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.25. Quarterly revenues declined 1.5% year over year to $5.4 billion. The top line also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. During the reported quarter, revenues generated by the Used-vehicle, F&I, and Parts and service businesses soared year over year while new-vehicle revenues witnessed a decrease. | Moreover, AutoNation's profit margin is hurt by rising Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses. In third-quarter 2018, its SG&A expenses rose to roughly $626 million compared with $608 million recorded a year ago. The expenses majorly consisted of salary and store compensations, commissions and advertising. In fourth-quarter 2018, expenses are expected to rise further, owing to costs related to Hurricane Michael and continued investments for brand extension initiatives. In fact, on the back of such costs, AutoNation no longer projects flat rise in yearly SG&A to gross profit in 2018.However, its business expansion through acquisitions, investments and store openings will drive the company's financials in the medium-to-long term. Further, AutoNation's One Price strategy for used-vehicles enables it to leverage on centralized capabilities such as centralized pricing and appraisals.Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's fourth-quarter and 2018 earnings has moved down 5% and 1.3%, respectively. Further, in the past year, shares of AutoNation have lost 34.1% compared with the  's decline of 25.9%.AutoNation currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader auto sector are Fox Factory Holding Corporation  , CarGurus, Inc.  , and O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .Fox Factory has an expected long-term growth rate of 5%. Share price of the company has increased 45.1% in the past year.CarGurus has an expected long-term growth rate of 5%.

Out of the total delivered vehicles, Tesla's Model 3 accounted for 63,150 units while Model S and X were 13,500 and 14,050 units, respectively.In fact, Tesla delivered 245,240 vehicles in 2018, which consisted 145,846 units of Model 3 and 99,394 units of Model S and X. The actual deliveries of Model S and X missed the set target of 100,000 units.During the fourth quarter, all the Model 3 deliveries, comprising of a mid-to-high price range, were delivered only in North America. Apart from catering to the reserved bookings in the region, the company delivered the model to new customers as well. | Further, Tesla views good growth opportunities for Model 3 in markets outside North America. With this anticipation, the company plans to launch the lower-priced model variation in international markets. It will start delivering Model 3 in Europe and China from February 2019, gradually expanding to other markets.Despite reporting decent fourth-quarter 2018 deliveries, shares of Tesla have plunged roughly 3.8% in a day's trading on Jan 2. The dip in share price can be attributed to the company's decision to slash all three model prices by $2,000 in the United States.Tesla has decided the price cut, owing to the phasing out of federal EV tax credit, which has been dropped to $3,750 from the prior credit of $7,500, effective Jan 1, 2019. In a bid to keep the electric vehicles (EV) affordable for customers, the company adopted the strategy of partially absorbing the tax credit reduction.Per a few analysts as reported in Reuters, the $2000 price cut for all models questions the demand for the California-based manufacturer's EVs. The step might also imply a lowering demand for Tesla's vehicles. Furthermore, as Tesla is already struggling to deliver profit, the recent move will further dent its profit margin.Tesla is already under intense pressure to deliver annual profit, which the company has not been successful to achieve as of 2017. For the most of 2018, the company's profit margin was hampered by high shipping and sourced component costs due to tit-for-tat tariffs of China and the United States. In the first nine months of 2018, the company's loss from operations was $801.6 million compared with $1 billion recorded in the same period of 2017.Over the past month, shares of Tesla have lost 13.8% compared with the  's decline of 9.6%.Tesla currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

These are the stocks that emerged victorious from a year of extremely volatile trading. However, not all those stocks that crushed 2018 are still worth buying now.Take  (NASDAQ:  ) for example. Last year it put on a 54% sprint. But now the stock only has a \"hold\" analyst consensus.\"We continue to be concerned by TRIP's execution track record, its uncertain strategic position in Online Travel, and Revenue concentration risk from BKNG & EXPE\" explains RBC Capital's Mark Mahaney.However there are other outperformers that are primed for further growth, meaning they're still great buy opportunities. I used  to pinpoint 2018's most compelling names. These are the stocks you want to be focusing on right now. They score a \"strong buy\" consensus from the Street based on ratings from the last three months.Plus we can tune in to the Street's top analysts to see what they have to say. What's interesting is that even with their 2018 gains, many of these stocks still appear undervalued.Let's dive in now. 58% (NASDAQ:  ) is a leading manufacturer of medical implant devices, including the AbioCor artificial heart and Impella. This is the world's smallest heart pump, often used in patients with severe heart failure. Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death in the U.S. Abiomed estimates that about 221,000 U.S. patients annually would benefit from procedures using Impella. Plus the stock doesn't just have a U.S. focus. It also operates in Europe and Japan, and even India.\"We feel shares are discounted nicely from their high\" writes BTIG's Sean Lavin (  ), after shares dropped 30% in the last three months. Nonetheless, shares are still up a whopping 250% over the last three years.The five-star analyst continues: \"ABMD is arguably the cleanest story in Med Tech and while the shares' valuation is not cheap, we feel the robust cash position, high margins, potential indication expansions and lack of competition support the argument for a premium multiple. Our $450 PT is based on 20x our 12-24 mo. sales est.\" His price target indicates upside of 27% from current levels.Clearly Lavin isn't alone in his bullish take on this stock: ABMD has received only buy ratings from the Street in the last three months, with a $443 average price target. Interested in Abiomed stock?  42%It's worth keeping a closer eye on  (NYSE:  ) as we head into the new year. Keysight is a U.S. company that manufactures electronics test and measurement equipment and software. As we can see, this is a stock with 100% Street support right now. That means only buy ratings (and a $74 average price target).Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari (  ) recently upgraded KEYS from \"hold\" to \"buy.\" He cites the company's robust outlook and ramped up his price target from $66 to $76 (for 23% upside potential).The company's sizable exposure to two end-markets, Communications and Defense, makes it a more defensive stock, Hari told investors. That's because these are two of the \"right\" markets with improving growth prospects.Indeed, Stifel analyst John Marchetti cites \"company specific tailwinds around 5G, automotive and software combined with a generally constructive view of the core T&M (test and measurement) market to drive revenue growth above the company's core target of 4%-5%,\" along with the company's flexible cost structure and strong operational controls.He has a KEYS buy rating and $73 price target.  60% (NYSE:  ) is the largest specialty retailer of automotive parts, accessories and maintenance items. We are talking over 4,600 stores and counting.The stock put on a rip-roaring performance in 2018. Better weather and easing automotive headwinds both boosted results. Plus Advance Auto's accelerating top-line results outpaced that of the industry, suggesting solid market share gains.However AAP remains undervalued. So says RBC Capital's Scot Ciccarelli (  ). He has a \"buy\" rating on AAP with a $203 price target (for 30% upside).\"We remain bullish on the automotive aftermarket sector and believe industry trends should continue to improve as car parc headwinds transition to a multi-year tailwind\" the analyst explains.That's not all. Here's why he's particularly bullish on AAP: \"Given its many years of underperformance, we believe Advance has the most 'upside' in the sector, as comps and margins are now both improving.\"And with Advance's substantial earnings power, Ciccarelli remains on the buy side. Indeed this is a strong-buy stock according to the Street, with a $203 average price target.  41%From one auto stock to another. RBC Capital's Scot Ciccarelli is also betting on  (NASDAQ:  ) for 2019. This is an auto parts retailer that provides automotive parts and tools to both professional service providers and DIY customers.\"Given the company's highly consistent top/bottom line growth we remain buyers of ORLY\" the analyst writes. Notably, fundamentals are very solid and should continue to get better in 2019 from cyclical factors.Meanwhile the analyst reiterates that auto parts tend to provide defensive positioning in a down market/softening economy. Indeed, the stock is now trading flat over the last three months - with May's 30% gains sticking tight.Ciccarelli has a $389 price target on ORLY (13% upside potential) and recommends buying \"aggressively\" on a pullback. Overall nine out of 12 analysts are bullish on this strong-buy stock. Their average price target: $377 (10% upside).  33%Last but not least comes  (NYSE:  ). No less than 17 top analysts have published buy ratings on BSX over the last three months.In fact, Needham's Michael Matson (  ) calls this medtech stock one of his favorite strong-buy stocks for 2019. That's with a $43 price target. He approves of the company's decision to snap up the rest of  for up to $450 million.\"While there are still clinical, commercialization, and integration risks and BSX is paying a high price for Millipede, we believe this transaction could lay the foundation for the mitral leg of BSX's Structural Heart franchise\" Matson explains. This could eventually serve the needs of \"a large and underpenetrated market.\"In fact, BSX estimates the transcatheter mitral valve replacement markets could reach $1 billion combined by 2021. \"We believe BSX has developed and demonstrated the capabilities to successfully identify, complete, and integrate acquisitions and expect M&A to remain a potential source of TAM expansion\" the analyst concludes.

With this in mind, let's look at one industry traditionally seen as doing well in an economic slowdown: auto parts retailers like  (NASDAQ: ORLY) ,  (NYSE: AZO) , and  (NYSE: AAP) . Not least because they have been crushing it in 2018.Looking back into the last two recessions, you can clearly see that auto parts retailers tend to grow revenue and earnings in these conditions. This isn't because they are less affected by a downturn, as you might argue dentistry or healthcare are, but because recessionary conditions can actually be better for the sector.The reason? In hard times, consumers tend to delay buying a new car in favor of continuing to run older cars, which require more servicing -- good news for auto parts retailers. data by In a nutshell, all three companies have reported pretty solid same-store sales growth in the last couple of quarters. This has reassured the market that the slowdown in 2016-2017 wasn't due to the existentialist threat from  (NASDAQ: AMZN)  .Data source: Company presentations. the sector had upside prospects in 2018. For a start, the last two years saw mild winters, and 2017 had a cooler spring and summer. Given that cars get more stressed in extreme weather, this tended to curtail demand in the previous years -- making it easier for the companies to beat previous years' sales.Moreover, according to Advance Auto Parts CEO Tom Greco on the company's third-quarter , end-market conditions are set to improve: \"...after three consecutive years of declines, the number of vehicles greater than seven years old is expected to grow in 2019 for the first time since 2015. This group of vehicles is one of the largest demand-drivers in our industry, and we're confident this will enable continued industry momentum.\"While the near-term outlook continues to look bright, there are longer-term questions. The  And even though the auto parts retailers will always have a business edge -- many do-it-yourselfers require in-store service and staff support, and do-it-for-me customers often need a part immediately -- it's hard to argue that price discounting from online competition won't hold back margin.Moreover, in the very long term, growth in electric vehicles and/or hybrid cars could challenge the industry's business model, since auto parts retailers have traditionally sold parts for combustion-engine vehicles. Electric vehicles could require fewer repair costs and recurring purchases, and as traditional car-battery replacement is a significant revenue and footfall generator for auto parts retailers, the challenge from electric vehicles is significant.Image source: Getty Images.The near-term outlook is good for auto parts retailers, and if you have significant worries about an oncoming recession, then they are a good place to be looking to buy stock. However, for the long-term investor, the threat from online competition and electric vehicles might be concerning enough to avoid the sector.Auto parts retailers won't be killed by Amazon and electric vehicles, and the companies will still do relatively better than most in an economic slowdown. But it's not clear what their growth and margin prospects will look like over the long term.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Kevin Matras screens for companies showing their 'first' profit and explains why they are ones to watch.You can simply arrive at a decision to Buy or Sell a particular stock by looking at its sales and earnings numbers. But such a strategy does not always warrant superior returns. A critical analysis of the company's financial background is always required for a better investment decision.A company's fundamentals should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations. This can be judged with coverage ratios - the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations. Here we have discussed one such ratio - the Interest Coverage Ratio. .Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charged on its debt.Debt, which is crucial for most of the companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and the company's creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision.Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations and could default on repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship. Definitely, one should also track the company's past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.Zacks.com created the first and best screening system on the web earning the distinction as the \"#1 site for screening stocks\" by Money Magazine.

This strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks that have impressive prospects and are trading at a discount.The GARP approach leads to the identification of stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.That means a portfolio created on the basis of GARP strategy is expected to have stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.The GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by utilizing the best features of both value and growth investing. Investors adopting the GARP approach will prefer to buy stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Both strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.GARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics - price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is also considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Zacks.com created the first and best screening system on the web earning the distinction as the \"#1 site for screening stocks\" by Money Magazine.

Chances are high that the volatility plaguing the markets in 2018 isn't going anywhere next year. With that in mind, you need to be extra careful about how you re-balance your portfolio for the new year. Luckily Goldman Sachs is here to help. It recently released a report of exactly the kind of stocks you want to be thinking about right now.These are 'high quality' stocks specially selected by the firm. And by 'high-quality' Goldman Sachs means stocks that meet the following 5 factors: strong balance sheets, stable sales growth, low deviation in operating income, low stock drawdown risk, and return-on-equity that exceeds peers. In other words these stocks are the best-positioned to 1) withstand an economic slowdown; and 2) diminishing equity returns. That sounds good to me!On top of that I used  ' stock data to find out what other top analysts have to say on these stocks.That way I can highlight stocks with the most bullish Street consensus from Goldman Sachs' list.Let's take a closer look at these top stock picks for 2019 now:I'm with Goldman Sachs on this one. Blue chip telecoms giant  (NASDAQ:  ) is a worthy 2019 stock pick. CMCSA stock has an extremely stable portfolio and growing free cash flow.Not only is its credit high-quality, but its dividend is 'sacrosanct', and it repurchases shares when it's not deleveraging from strategic M&A.\"CMCSA is arguably more a safety stock than a growth stock. While its valuation is modest we'd argue so is its risk\" writes RBC Capital's Steven Cahall (  ).He has just ramped up his price target to $45, citing the recent $15 billion deal for Sky. From current levels this means we are looking at upside potential of 19%.\"Excuse Me While I Kiss the Sky\" Cahall calls his report, adding \"We see the strategic merits of Sky being better appreciated in time.\"True CMCSA paid a hefty multiple, but Cahall sees long-term strategic benefits from Sky, ranging from a bigger subscriber base for emerging tech investments to savings on content acquisition and accelerated advanced advertising.This 'Strong Buy' stock scores 15 buy ratings vs 3 hold ratings. Its $44 average analyst price target suggests 16% upside potential. Interested in CMCSA stock? This financial stock continues to outperform. Year-to-date,  (NYSE:  ) shares have surged over 19%.And looking forward to 2019, I see no reason why Visa's outperformance can't continue.Indeed, top-rated Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Joseph Foresi (  ) has just reiterated his V Buy rating. This comes with a bullish $160 price target - 18% upside potential.\"Strong growth continues\" cheers Foresi, before writing: \"We remain attracted to Visa's dominant position in the global card network market and to its strong, recognizable international brand.\"Notably, Foresi highlighted Visa's opportunity to capitalize on the global conversion of cash into credit, international opportunities, and digital payment tailwinds.Meanwhile Visa Direct, contactless payments, and B2B all have the potential to drive share prices higher.Out of 18 analysts polled on this 'Strong Buy' stock, 17 are bullish. This is with a $167 average analyst price target. Tech stocks may be going through a rough patch, but here's one mega cap Goldman Sachs thinks is still worth buying for 2019.Trading at ~11x 2019 EV/EBITDA,  (NASDAQ:  ) valuation looks compelling, says Brent Thill (  ) of Jefferies. He picks GOOGL as his Franchise Pick i.e. a high conviction stock. This is with a juicy $1,450 price target (37% upside potential).So what justifies this bullish call?\"The Internet Team remains bullish on Alphabet due to continued expected mobile search growth and a positive stance on YouTube\" explains Thill.Online video is lining up as the biggest online ad growth driver - with GOOGL's YouTube capable of driving meaningful upside by stealing ad budgets away from television.Meanwhile, \"mobile search has been the number one driver of revenue growth for the past several quarters and the team sees continued opportunity given the ubiquity of smartphones and the important location and contextual signals from mobile devices\" writes Thill.Plus, Alphabet also boasts its fast-growing Google Cloud, and a strong leadership position in both AI and autonomous vehicles. Its Waymo vehicles have driven many millions of miles on public roads more than peers.Taking a step back, we can see that out of 31 analysts polled recently, 28 are bullish on the stock. This is with a $1,346 average price target (28% upside potential).  (NASDAQ:  ) is one of the largest specialty retailers of auto parts in the US, with over 5,000 stores. Already, year-to-date, shares are exploding by over 45%. And the stock has a long growth runway ahead.Alongside Goldman Sachs, RBC Capital's Scot Ciccarelli (  ) is also a big fan of the stock.\"O'Reilly is a net market share gainer in an attractive industry,\" says the analyst. And he sees four key reasons why ORLY is set to outperform. Namely: 1) strong pricing power, 2) little threat from e-commerce because the parts are too complex, 3) increasing number and age of vehicles and 4) a highly fragmented industry.Further, steady ORLY stock performance suggests that the company is feeling little effect from price transparency/ e-commerce competition.\"Given the company's highly consistent top/ bottom line growth we remain buyers of ORLY,\" sums up Ciccarelli. He sees shares surging 10% to hit $389.Now if we look at all analysts, the consensus is a cautiously optimistic Moderate Buy. However, if we shift to only the Street's best-performing analysts, then the consensus also upgrades to Strong Buy. This is with a $380 average analyst price target (8% upside potential). If you're planning a holiday right now, chances are you'll turn to  (NASDAQ:  ). From a small Dutch startup, BKNG is now one of the world's largest travel e-commerce companies. It holds Booking.com, Priceline.com, Kayak.com, Cheapflights, OpenTable and more.From a Street perspective, what stands out is a recent upgrade from Wells Fargo's Robert Coolbrith (  ). Analysts usually reiterate their stock ratings - so when a stock is upgraded to Buy that definitely tells us something.Plus Coolbrith simultaneously ramped up his price target from $2,150 to $2,200. From current levels, this means we are now looking at upside of close to 18%.In this case Coolbrith cites the company's Q3 performance and Q4 guide as well as management's 2019 long-term strategy. This breaks down to: 1) platform investment, 2) above-market top-line growth and 3) a close focus on EBITDA dollar growth.And crucially, even though shares are over $1,800, Coolbrith sees an appealing entry point right now. Shares are currently trading down over 5% in the last three months. \"We note that shares remain significantly below historical valuation averages - BKNG's current NTM EV/EBITDA is 12% below its 3-year median.\"Overall, BKNG stock earns a Moderate Buy analyst consensus. This comes with a $2,242 average price target - which means 23% upside potential lies ahead.  Source: ShutterstockWhen trading is rough, defensive stocks tend to do well. And bargain retail store  (NASDAQ:  ) is a perfect example of a defensive stock. Everything in the store sells for $1 or less.On October 16, the NY Post reported that Carl Icahn is accumulating a stake in Dollar Tree. Apparently, we are looking at a 'significant' stake. On the news, DLTR stock jumped 6.8%. Icahn is an activist investor, known for pushing for changes at the company leadership level.Five-star Oppenheimer analyst Rupesh Parikh (  ) has an Outperform rating on the discount giant. He writes: \"We continue to see meaningful optionality with the DLTR story from either an improving fundamental longer-term outlook or optionality with the Family Dollar asset.\"Encouragingly, he believes the stock is trading at attractive levels. This is in part down to the market undervaluing American variety store chain Family Dollar.\"At a low $80s stock price, the implied Family Dollar valuation is just a low single-digit EBITDA multiple\" points out Parikh. And as for Icahn joining the team, he gives this reaction: \"We await more details on Icahn's stake and the proposed actions that could potentially unlock shareholder value from here.\"With a Moderate Buy consensus, the stock's $94.18 average analyst price target works out at 15% upside potential from current levels.  (NASDAQ:  ) has a dominant position in neuroscience. The company has a leading portfolio of medicines to treat multiple sclerosis (MS) as well as the only FDA-approved treatment for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).To top it off, Biogen also boasts an extensive pipeline of new medicines in development. This includes Aducanumab for Alzheimer's disease. It is estimated that over 25 million individuals are living with AD worldwide.The memory loss and functional decline of Alzheimer's disease have been linked to amyloid plaques, abnormal protein deposits that build up in the brain. Aducanumab is an antibody that binds to and may reduce amyloid plaques from the brain, potentially slowing the progress of the disease.\"We believe Biogen shares are undervalued based on our view that the company's leadership position in neuroscience should deliver long-term growth. A business supporting high-risk, high reward studies puts BIIB in the lead to develop a potentially disease-modifying AD drug,\" states Oppenheimer's Jay Olson (  ).He has a buy rating on the stock with a $380 price target. According to Olson, BIIB has achieved a critical mass in neuroscience that enables high-risk programs with sufficient cash flow to embark on high-risk programs.Overall this 'Moderate Buy' stock has scored 8 buy ratings vs 3 hold ratings in the last three months. Meanwhile the $391 average analyst price target works out at over 20% upside potential. Goldman Sachs has just upgraded software stock  (NASDAQ:  ) from Hold to Buy. The firm's James Schneider (  ) also raised his price target for the shares to $84 from $81. He now predicts shares have 20% upside ahead.Improving revenue growth brings prospects for a stock \"re-rating,\" Schneider told investors. Plus a rebound in the company's Financial Services vertical should drive improved revenue growth in the near term.This bullish analysis is echoed by other analysts. For example, Loop Capital's Joseph Vafi has a Street-high $94 price target on shares (35% upside potential). Following the company's upbeat analyst day, Vafi is even more confident in the company's unique offer of a \"full spectrum of services demanded by Fortune 500 CIOs\".CTSH has now \"successfully pivoted its business to the most leading-edge service capabilities,\" and the bear case should be \"put to bed\", especially given the forecast of improving margins in 2019.Meanwhile valuation provides a positive risk/reward opportunity, with a roughly 60% multiple discount to Accenture's PE in 2019, despite similar aggregate growth rates and higher margins. Owner of the discount TJ Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods stores and others,  (NYSE:  ) is a leading off-price retailer of home and fashion goods. Basically, if you're looking for a bargain, TJX could be for you.\"Off-price remains one of our favored industries given its positive traffic, market share gains, and strong cash flow generation,\" gushes five-star Guggenheim analyst Robert Drbul (  ). And TJX is one of his top stock picks in this space.\"Despite expense headwinds, TJX continues to report enviable comps, one of the highest across retail landscape, fueled by traffic increases and share gains\" the analyst writes. He now sees TJX delivering an impressive $50B revenues over the next five years.Plus, TJX is a great stock for shareholders. This is thanks to its 1.7% dividend payout - a dividend which has now recorded 21 years of consecutive growth.\"Beyond the share gains and stable EPS growth, we believe with the increased dividend and the buyback program, TJX once again underlines FCF generating ability of the business model,\" writes Drbul. He expects TJX to generate $2.5B of FCF and combined with $1B of repatriated cash, return all of it to shareholders with dividends and buybacks.From top analysts, the stock scores a 'Strong Buy' consensus. This is with a $56 average analyst price target so we are looking at 24% upside ahead. Last but not least, comes a stock I only discovered recently, index provider  (NYSE:  ).MSCI is a global provider of equity, fixed income, hedge fund stock market indexes and multi-asset portfolio analysis tools. It publishes the MSCI BRIC, MSCI World and MSCI EAFE Indexes.\"We continue to view the index business as a key catalyst that should produce solid top-line results (in the upper-single-to-low double digits)\" is how Cantor Fitzgerald's Joseph Foresi (  ) describes the stock's outlook.The company is experiencing strong growth in its index business while margins are also expanding.Foresi sums up as follows: \"We expect shareholders to benefit over the long term from growth in indexing, recent investments/reorganization, margin expansion, and capital allocation.\"This Top 50 analyst has a bullish $182 price target on the stock - 20% upside potential.

The chart below shows the one year price performance of FTC, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, FTC's low point in its 52 week range is $58.95 per share, with $70.93 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $60.77. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["rowth at a reasonable price or GARP is an excellent way for investors to make some quick gains.

China Passenger Car Association, the country's passenger car association also reported that this American automaker sold only 211 vehicles in October. This waning sales figure in the world's largest automotive market, along with the ongoing tariff war between China and the United States, is expected to strain Tesla's financials.Since July, the government in China has imposed a counter tariff of 40% on all U.S. vehicles that are imported to China.In fact, in October, this U.S-based electric carmaker announced that tariff hikes are hampering its sales in China as it imports all of its vehicles that are sold in the country. However, in spite of lowered revenue generation, Tesla recently reported a price cut for its Model X and Model S cars in China. With an aim to make the cars more affordable, the company slashed prices of the two models by 12-25%. | In a bid to avoid steep tariff charges and lower costs, Tesla acquired a plot in China to set up its new factory outside the United States. In the last month, the company bought an 864,885-square meter plot in Shanghai by investing 973 million yuan or $140 million. With an initial production target of 250,000 vehicles and battery packs a year, the factory is expected to manufacture its first batch of vehicles in three years.Demand for clean-energy vehicles is witnessing a growth in China majorly due to initiatives taken by its government. However, the broader automotive industry is observing its first major sales decline in nearly three decades.Over the past three months, Tesla's stock has gained 10.9%, outperforming 3.6% decrease recorded by the  it belongs to.Tesla currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

A declining demand for combustion-engine based sedans impelled the company to halt auto production at the assembly plants in North America and reduce workforce.From 2019, General Motors will stop production at three of its factories in North America that includes Detroit-Hamtramck assembly of Detroit, MI; Lordstown assembly of Warren, OH; and Oshawa assembly of Oshawa, Ontario. Further, some models that are currently being manufactured in these hubs will also be discontinued - including Chevrolet Cruze, the Chevrolet Volt hybrid, the Cadillac CT6 and the Buick LaCrosse. Nevertheless, the company will keep producing these models in Mexico to cater to markets outside North America.Per Reuters, General Motors has numerous plants to manufacture a single car model, which places it in a difficult position in case a model production halts. Manufacturing several vehicle models at a single hub, like Japanese automakers, enables carmakers to cease a particular model production, without incurring any major change in the production lines. | Additionally, the company's two powertrain component manufacturing hubs situated at Baltimore, MD and Warren, MI, don't have any production assignments post 2019. Outside of North America, it will close two factories by the end of 2019.Apart from decreasing the number of production plants, General Motors will also cut its global workforce. It will slash 15% of its salaried contract staff, which consists of 25% of executive ranks.Per the company's CEO, the actions will raise long-term profitability along with improved potential of cash generation. These decisions are projected to elevate annual adjusted automotive free cash flow by $6 billion by the end of 2020 and lower capital expenditure by roughly $1.5 billion. Additionally, General Motors will increase its investments for next-generation battery-electric architectures.However, General Motors projects to record a pre-tax charge of $3-$3.8 billion for these actions in the near term. The impact of these charges will majorly be incurred in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019.Over the past month, General Motors' stock has gained 13.6%, outperforming 2.6% increase recorded by the  it belongs to.General Motors currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Definitely, one should also track the company's past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.Apart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of A or B to your search criteria should lead to better results.

(NASDAQ: ORLY)Q3 2018 Oct. 25, 2018 , Hello, and welcome to the O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Third Quarter 2018 . My name is Senara, and I'll be the operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a 30-minute question-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Please note that this conference is being recorded.I will now turn the call over to Mr. Tom McFall. Mr. McFall, you may begin. -- Thank you, Senara. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. During today's conference call, we'll discuss our third quarter 2018 results and our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year of 2018. After our prepared comments, we'll host a question-and-answer period.Before we begin this morning, I'd like to remind everyone that our comments today contain forward-looking statements and we intend to be covered by and we claim the protection under the Safe Harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as estimate, may, could, will, believe, except, would, consider, should, anticipate, project, plan, intend or similar words.The Company's actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements due to several important factors described in the Company's latest annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, and other recent SEC filings. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.At this time, I'd like to introduce Greg Johnson. -- Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts' third quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning are Jeff Shaw, our Chief Operating Officer and Co-President; and Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer. David O'Reilly, our Executive Chairman; and Greg Henslee, our Executive Vice President, are also present.It's my pleasure to begin our call today by congratulating Team O'Reilly on a strong third quarter and a solid first nine months of 2018. The sales momentum we experienced in the first half of 2018 continued through the third quarter and drove our comparable store sales increase of 3.9%, which was at the top end of our guidance range. As a reminder, we faced a headwind in the third quarter from an additional Sunday as compared to 2017, which had a negative impact of approximately 50 basis points since Sunday Is our lowest-volume day of the week.We're also pleased with our team's ability to generate year-to-date comparable store sales growth of 4% through their unwavering commitment to providing excellent customer service. Our sales growth, combined with our team's relentless focus on profitable sales and expense management, generated a 5% increase in operating profit dollars as compared to the third quarter of 2017 at an operating margin of 19.5%.In addition to our solid growth in sales and operating profit, we also -- we were also the beneficiaries of a substantially lower tax rate than expected, which Tom will cover in his prepared comments. This combination of operating performance along with our ongoing share buyback program, drove an increase in the third quarter earnings per share of 40% to $4.50 per share, which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $4.30 and is a testament to our team's efforts to provide unsurpassed customer service.Now I would like to provide some additional color on our third quarter comparable store sales results. The composition of sales in the third quarter was very similar to the second quarter, and really the full year of 2018, as we have seen a very consistent and stable trend throughout the year. Both our professional and DIY sides of the business were positive contributors to our comparable store sales growth with professional performing at a stronger level as we saw strong ticket count growth on that side of the business again in the third quarter, with the only sequential difference versus the second quarter resulting from the headwind of the additional Sunday.DIY ticket counts continued to see pressure as customers on that side of the business are more sensitive to increased gas prices and inflation and are more likely to defer maintenance or repairs in the short term, particularly for lower-income DIYers. Average ticket continues to be a strong contributor to our comparable store sales increase on both sides of our business, driven by the increasing complexity of vehicle repairs, a favorable overall business mix and continued effective pricing management.Similar to the past two quarters, we benefited from some modest commodity-driven inflation on same-SKU pricing in the quarter. We'll begin to see same SKU-inflation accelerate as our industry passes through cost increases for the parts subject to the latest tariff, which went into effect on September 24th, although we are working with our suppliers to minimize and delay this impact.Moving on to the cadence of our comparable store sales growth in the quarter. Our monthly results, after adjusting for the impact of the extra Sunday in September, were consistently solid throughout the quarter as we began the quarter with continued steady demand in our typical summer selling season and saw the rest of the quarter play out within our expectations. On a category basis, we saw strong performance throughout the quarter on weather-related categories, such as batteries and air conditioning, as a result of the hot summer weather. We also continued to see solid performance in key hard parts categories, such as brakes and ride control, in line with our expectations of typical maintenance and failure related demand following a normal winter.As you can tell from our comments thus far, our sales trends have been very steady in the year including a solid trend thus far in October, which is consistent with what we would expect from a normal weather cycle for our business and also reflects the core underlying strength of the automotive aftermarket.From a macroeconomic perspective, if we continue to have a favorable outlook -- I'm sorry, from a macroeconomic perspective, we continue to have a favorable outlook for the long term demand drivers of our business as employment remains stable and average vehicle age continues to increase. However, as we look to finish out 2018, we remain cautious on the short term impact to miles driven from pressure consumers as they -- pressure to consumers as they respond to higher gas prices and economic uncertainty from rising prices and the impacts of tariffs which could lead to incremental pressure to ticket counts from the short term deferral by lower income DIY customers.Our business can also be more variable in the fourth quarter, based on the holiday season and weather volatility, and we face difficult comparisons at the end of our quarter as the last two Decembers have benefited from favorable winter weather. As a result of these factors, we are maintaining our fourth quarter guidance at 2% to 4%. While we do benefit from one fewer Sunday in the fourth quarter 2018 versus 2017, the impact is offset by the timing of both Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve holidays, which fall on Mondays instead of Sundays this year, which will result in a lower professional sales volume as many shops run limited hours on those holidays versus a typical Monday.Based on our year-to-date results and fourth quarter guidance, we are raising the lower end of our full year comparable store sales guidance from a range of 2% to 4% to a range of 3% to 4%. For the quarter, our gross margin of 53% was a 42 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2017 margin at the top end of our guidance expectations, built into our full year gross margin guidance. After seasonal mix pressures in the second quarter, mix was more favorable to our gross margin in the third quarter and we benefited from a lower LIFO impact, which Tom will discuss in more detail.We continue to work with our suppliers to make incremental improvements in acquisition cost, but are also seeing modest inflation driven by commodity increases. However, we are pleased to see continued rational pricing within our industry to pass along those increases. We're beginning to see the early stages regarding the impact of tariffs, but expect to react to those cost increases in the same manner as any other source of inflation and remain confident in our industry's ability to pass through inflationary price increases.We're leaving our full year gross margin guidance unchanged at 52.5% to 53%, but based on our third quarter results, we no longer expect to come in at the bottom half of that range. We also continue to expect our full year operating profit for 2018 to be within our previously guided range of 18.5% to 19% of sales. For earnings per share, we're establishing our fourth quarter guidance at $3.60 to $3.70, which at the mid-point, would represent a 4% increase over EPS of $3.52 in the fourth quarter of last year, which included a $0.62 benefit related to adjusting our deferred tax liabilities in conjunction with the tax law change.Excluding that benefit, our guidance mid-point would represent a 26% increase in the fourth quarter EPS. We're also updating our full year EPS guidance to $15.95 to $16.05, reflecting our third quarter performance and the shares we have purchased through the call today. I would remind everyone that our full year guidance includes the impact of shares repurchased through this call, but does not include any additional share repurchases.Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I would like to again thank our team of over 80,000 dedicated Team Members for their solid performance thus far in 2018, and I'm confident our team will finish up the year strong. We remain very confident in the long term drivers for demand in our industry, and we believe we are all very well positioned to capitalize on the demand by consistently providing industry-leading customer service to our customers every day.I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Shaw. Jeff? -- Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to add my congratulations to Team O'Reilly on a solid third quarter and thank our team for their continued commitment to providing top-notch customer service. As Greg previously discussed, our sales trends in 2018 have been solid and very consistent, which reflects the unrelenting focus on customer service demonstrated by our teams every day in each one of our markets.I'd like to begin today by talking about some exciting distribution center expansion news. When you truly focus on what excellent service really means for our customers, it's impossible to underestimate the importance of parts availability. Our ability to provide top-notch customer service in our stores is dependent on the work our distribution center teams do to get those hard-to-find parts in our stores faster than our competitors.Our long term investment in our robust regional DC network is a key competitive advantage for us, and we're pleased to announce two new DC projects which will further strengthen our industry-leading position. First, we're pleased to announce we've acquired property in Twinsburg, Ohio, where we have began to build our 28th distribution center. Twinsburg is located in the Greater Cleveland area in Northern Ohio, approximately halfway between Cleveland and Akron.As we've discussed often in the past, our greenfield expansion strategy has been to enter new markets contiguous to our existing footprint as we build toward a critical mass of stores to leverage a new DC in an expansion region. We followed that familiar game plan over the last several years as we've opened stores further east into Ohio, West Virginia and Western Pennsylvania, supported by our DCs in Indianapolis and Detroit.We've now reached the point where additional DC capacity is necessary to support continued store growth in this region of the country while also freeing up capacity in our existing distribution centers to allow us to take advantage of opportunities to backfill stores in existing markets. The Twinsburg DC is a ground-up facility we plan to open in the fourth quarter of 2019 with the capacity to service approximately 275 stores out of a projected 405,000 square feet.In addition to adding overall capacity, the placement of this DC allows us to further leverage this investment by providing multiple same-day service to the approximately 130 stores in the important Northern Ohio market. The second distribution project we're announcing today is our purchase of an existing facility in Lebanon, Tennessee, which is an eastern suburb in Nashville, and our plan to relocate our existing leased facility in Nashville and begin service out of this new DC in the first half of 2020.The new DC will be approximately 410,000 square feet and will have the capacity to service 300 stores. Nashville and its surrounding markets have been very strong growing markets for us, and the additional capacity in our new Nashville DC will allow us to take advantage of continued profitable growth in the region and accommodate a broader SKU capacity to provide even better breadth of hard-to-find parts to our store teams in this market.Before I move on from our discussion of these upcoming DC projects, I just want to express the confidence I have in our distribution operations teams, who have proven time and again their effectiveness in planning, building and seamlessly opening new distribution centers, often successfully executing multiple DC projects at the same time. With the dedication and support of this team, we're confident these projects will roll out with the same degree of efficiency that our past projects have delivered.Now I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our SG&A results for the quarter. SG&A as a percent of sales was 33.5%, deleverage of 62 basis points from 2017. On an average per-store basis, our SG&A grew 3.7%, which was at the high end of our expectations, as we continue to see pressure to wages and variable compensation as well as headwind in fuel expenses driven by increased gas prices and delivery miles driven. On a year-over-year basis, the deleverage resulting from higher-than-normal per store SG&A growth has been the result of our plan to allocate a portion of the savings from the new tax law to incremental operating expense dollars in 2018 to further enhance our best-in-class customer service.As we are now well into 2018, we feel these additional investments have been prudent, and we're very confident that our commitment to taking care of the customer by ensuring that we're hiring, training and retaining the very best professional parts people in the industry will drive continued strong performance. We remain on the same path to finish out 2018 in the fourth quarter and continue to expect full year growth in SG&A per store of 3% to 3.5%.Finally, before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to finish with some comments about our store expansion thus far in 2018 and our plans for the remainder of the year and for 2019. We've successfully opened 171 net new stores in the first nine months and are on target to hit our goal of 200 net new stores in 2018. As Greg announced in our press release yesterday, we've also set a new store growth target range of 200 to 210 net new stores for 2019.Our store openings in 2018 have been spread across 33 different states, and we continue to be pleased with our opportunities to identify great locations and open with great store teams to profitably grow our business in markets across the country. Our 2019 store growth will follow a similar strategy to the past few years, with a balance between our expansion markets in Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast, and backfill in existing more mature markets.As I mentioned earlier, our store expansion would not be successful without the amazing support of our distribution teams, and I'm confident we will continue to equip our new store teams with the tools they need to provide outstanding customer service, including the best parts availability in the industry.As I close my comments, I want to thank all of Team O'Reilly for their continued dedication to our Company's success. We've had a solid year so far and we're in a great position to finish the year strong by out-hustling and out-servicing our competitors, and I'm confident in our team's ability to do just that.Now I'll turn the call over to Tom. -- Thanks, Jeff. I'd also like to thank all of Team O'Reilly for their continued commitment to the outstanding customer service, which drove our solid performance into the third quarter. Now I will take a closer look at our quarterly results and update our guidance for the last quarter of 2018.For the quarter, sales increased $143 million, comprised of a $90 million increase in comp store sales, a $57 million increase in non-comp store sales, a $3 million decrease in non-comp non-store sales and a $1 million decrease from closed stores. For 2018, we continue to expect our total revenues to be $9.4 billion to $9.6 billion. Our gross margin was up 42 basis points for the quarter as we continue to experience stable merchandise margins and benefited from the LIFO comparison to the prior year.We did not see a LIFO charge during the quarter versus a $3 million charge last year. And for the remainder of the year, we do not expect to have a LIFO charge as a result of our expectation of the impact of tariff-driven cost increases. Tariffs have had a minimal impact to our comps and gross margin thus far in 2018, but the list of parts subject to the 10% tariff is more extensive. However, we continue to expect to pass along cost increases from tariffs to our customers.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 had a dramatic impact on our third quarter earnings and will continue to have a significant positive impact on our tax rate on a go-forward basis. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 19.6% of pre-tax income, including the benefit from tax deductions for share-based composition, which reduce our tax rate by 3%. Excluding the tax benefit from share-based compensation, our effective tax rate of 22.6% was better than our expectations as we continue to refine our estimates of the impact of the Tax Cuts and Job Acts (ph) on our ongoing tax rate.Also as a reminder, the third quarter rate is typically lower than the remainder of the year due to the tolling of certain open tax periods. We now expect full year tax rate to be 21% to 22% of pre-tax income. Please keep in mind, changes in the tax benefit from share-based compensation will create fluctuations in our quarterly tax rate as we've seen in the first three quarters of 2018.Now we'll move on to free cash flow and the components that drove our year-to-date results in our guidance expectations for the full year of 2018. Free cash flow through the first three quarters was $959 million, which was a $254 million increase over the prior year, driven by higher pre-tax income, lower cash taxes and a higher reduction in our net inventory investment. For the full year, we're maintaining our free cash flow guidance in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion.Inventory per store at the end of the quarter was $605,000, which was up 1% from the beginning of the year and from this time last year. We continue to expect to grow per-store inventory in the range of 1% to 2% this year as our ongoing goal is to ensure we grow per-store inventory at a lower rate than the comparable store sales growth we generate. Our AP to inventory ratio at the end of the quarter was 108%. We expect our AP to inventory ratio to moderate slightly during the fourth quarter as a result of seasonality, but we expect to finish the year at approximately 107%.Finally, capital expenditures for the first nine months of 2018 were $350 million, which is on par from the same period of 2017 and in line with our expectations. We continue to forecast CapEx to come in between $490 million and $520 million for the year.Moving on to debt. We finished the third quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.15 times as compared to our ratio of 2.12 times at the end of 2017. The increase in our leverage reflects our May bond issuance and borrowings on our unsecured revolving credit facility. We are below our stated leverage target of 2.5 times, and we'll approach that number when appropriate.We continue to execute our share repurchase program, and year-to-date, we've repurchased 4.9 million shares at an average per share price of $269.52 for a total investment of $1.3 billion. We remain very confident that the average purchase price is supported by the expected discounted future cash flows of our business, and we continue to view our buyback program as an effective means for returning available cash to our shareholders.Before I open up our call to answer your questions, I'd like to thank the O'Reilly team for their dedication to our Company and our customers. This concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I'd like to ask Senara, the operator, to turn the line, and we'll be happy to answer your questions.Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. -- Thank you so much, and good morning. My first question relates to gas prices. So you cited gas prices and miles driven as a risk last quarter. You nonetheless came in toward the high end of your same-store sales guided range. Any thoughts as to how this is playing out in terms of consumer's mindset? And anything you can see in the traffic in the stores or the kinds of categories that are ebbing and flowing that would suggest that the increases in gas prices over the past several months have had any impact on the business? -- Sure, Matt. I'd be happy to answer that. We really have the same concern going into the fourth quarter that we had going into the third quarter. And that is that the -- with fuel prices rising, the impact is most likely on the lower-income DIY customers. And this quarter and third quarter and even earlier in the year, the professional side of our business has outperformed the cash side of our business. And we just -- I don't know if there's any specific evidence in the third quarter to substantiate that, but it is an ongoing concern. As fuel prices continue to increase or stay at a high level for a longer period of time, there's a better chance that it will impact the spending habits of our cash-strapped DIY customers, specifically in -- with them deferring regular maintenance and maybe postponing repairs where they can. -- Great. And then as a quick follow-up. I know that the car park evolution really plays out over a period of years, but presumably, you have insights based on what you're selling as to whether we've seen the bottoming in the supply of vehicles best suited to your mix. Any sign -- if you think, not necessarily Q3 versus Q2, but this past quarter, the past couple of quarters versus the prior that -- versus the few that preceded it, as to whether the drag that the whole industry had experienced from car park vintage might be bottoming, if not turning. -- Sure, well -- the past -- if you look back at 2017, as we've said, there were several, several things that impacted sales in 2017, one of which we felt was the impact of the SAAR bubbling in the car park. We have seen evidence this year, as we've reported, that the professional side of our business is improving, and that's where we expected to see the first improvements, was on that side of our business, as those cars that are coming out of the warranty cycle are more likely to go back to the shops to be repaired at that time. So the improvement in the professional side of our business is evidence that we're trending out of that bubble. -- Thank you so much for that. Appreciate it.Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Baker from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. -- Two margin questions. One, when you adjusted the LIFO numbers that you give, it looks like your gross margins, excluding LIFO, were up this quarter. And that looks like an inflection point versus the last four or five quarters. So is that all just mix or are you taking prices? Is there something else to explain that inflection point? -- When we see inflationary prices, our industry has historically been able to pass those on. So we remain competitive on our pricing. What we would tell you is that the improvement year-over-year is primarily mix driven for the third quarter. -- Okay. And then as a follow-up to the margin question, as we look ahead to next year, can you provide any early insight into how we might think about gross margin and operating margin for 2019? After -- I think this year will be -- 2018 will be the second year in a row of declines. Any insight into whether this year will be the trough? Or how we should think about next year? -- Well, there's a lot of activity that's going to occur between now and the end of the year, and there's another round of tariffs that potentially could go into a pack (ph) -- effect, excuse me, in January. So before giving guidance, and typically, we'll give our guidance on the fourth quarter call, there's some things that have to transpire for us to better be able to put numbers around that. -- So the tariff outlook will have an impact, you think, to that outlook. -- I think it'll have an impact on -- it will have an impact on what we see our average ticket doing, our comps doing and also our expenses. -- Okay. Thanks. I'll turn it over to someone else.Thank you. Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. -- Good morning, guys. -- Good morning. -- So, hi -- so, we know that SG&A growth is exaggerated this year because of a bunch of the labor investments. Obviously, you highlighted that almost a year ago at this point. But if we kind of think about past '18, what are your expectations for SG&A per store growth? Is it something similar to what we've seen this year, just given the incredibly tight labor environment? Or do we get something back to a similar cadence as we saw in, let's call it, 2017, 2016, et cetera? -- Again, we -- we'll give our 2019 outlook on our next call. As we talked about within this year and in relation to SG&A, we saw a step-function increase in our SG&A as we proactively looked at primarily our IT spend and our store payroll and raised those without the expectation of significant inflation in our selling price. On a go-forward basis, we would expect SG&A pressure to be reflected also in the goods that we sell, as is typical in retail. -- Understood. Thanks, guys.Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt McClintock from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. -- Hi. Yes. Good morning, everyone. I understand the conservatism that you're putting in your guidance from rising gas prices, and that makes sense, but how should I think about that lower-income consumer and the impact of rising gas prices at the same time; that the unemployment rate is at an all-time low and wage pressure that you're experiencing, and the rest of the retail industry is experiencing, everyone's experiencing, should actually increase their purchasing power. -- Tom, do you want to take that one? -- Okay. Gas price is one of the factors that will impact their discretionary income and their ability to fund their life. And when those costs go up, gas prices and expected impact of tariffs in average pricing of auto parts, they have historically attempted to defer maintenance. And we would expect that there's a potential that they will take a look at those inflationary price increases and stretch out their intervals of repair or delay repairs as long as they can. So that's what we've seen in the past. We will see how they react to these inflationary pressures as -- because it will also be a computation of what happened to their wages. -- And Matt, to add to that, I mean, there were other components too, that impacted our guide, other than just the inflation component and gas prices. As we discussed, December is a volatile month from us and it's really dependent a lot on weather patterns. And the past two Decembers have come with very cold weather, which has driven strong sales. And we're very hopeful for cold, wet winter, a cold wet December, a early winter again this year. Also, we talked about the impact of the holidays. We talked about New Year's Eve and Christmas Eve falling on a Monday this year as opposed to a weekend last year, and that will result in some of our professional customers likely either being open shorter hours on a weekday, which are typically higher-volume days, or being closed altogether on those holiday eves. So there's several factors that impacted our fourth quarter guidance over and above just the rising fuel prices and inflation. -- Perfect. Thanks for the color. I appreciate it.Thank you. Our next question comes from Seth Basham from Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. -- Thanks a lot and good morning. My question is also around inflation, specifically thinking about the potential for tariff rates going to 25% in 2019. I understand your confidence in your ability to pass along cost increases related to inflation, whether it be tariff-related or otherwise, but there's also the potential, as you called out, for demand destruction. In this instance, with such a large potential inflation ahead of us, would you consider not fully passing along some of those cost increases you face to keep the impact on demand to a minimum? -- Seth, we have had very good success, as you pointed out, passing along what we've seen thus far. And thus far, this last round in September hit a lot more of our product categories than the first two rounds. The first two rounds were more so related to components and the third round in September was more related to finished goods.What I would tell you is that we push back on our suppliers, both from a -- the amount of tariff they're passing along to us and the timing of what they're passing through. And we didn't experience a full 10% and we don't expect to experience a full 25%, should that go into effect after the first of the year. But our plan is to try to push all that through. -- Okay, fair enough. And my follow-up question is thinking about some of the strategic implications of one of your large competitors, Advance Auto, forming a strategic partnership with Walmart. Would you guys ever consider forming a strategic partnership with any online marketplace? And what are your thoughts as it relates to that idea? -- The concept of us partnering with an e-commerce company or a larger retailer is not something that we've considered. The Advance-Walmart deal is still relatively new, and frankly, we probably know as much or less about that than you guys do. All we know is what we've read. But today, we have really not even considered partnering with anyone outside of our own Company and our own channels to sell auto parts. We are very focused on our omnichannel initiatives and e-commerce initiatives to make inventory more readily available to consumers over which ever channels that they decide to buy auto parts. But we've had no discussions about going outside of our Company to sell parts on the internet. -- Fair enough. Thanks a lot, guys.Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open. -- Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Nice quarter. -- Thanks, Brian. -- Bigger picture question. As sales have -- as you've commented in your prepared remarks, sales in this -- so far in this year have been much better and then much steadier. So clearly, a nice rebound from what was occurring several quarters ago. But as you look at the data, and you've mentioned too, that you think the overall environment is getting better, whether it be the car park or other factors. But as you look at these larger, more macro external factors, are sales now tracking with where they should be, given those factors? -- Brian, yes. The short answer is yes. We always want those numbers to be higher. We're never, never pleased with our sales and we also -- always want to deliver higher sales than what we did the previous quarter. It's what we strive to do every year. But this -- we're tracking on plan this year. We're performing where we felt like we would perform throughout the -- both the third quarter and the year-to-date. So we're relatively pleased. -- Okay. And then my second question is somewhat of a follow-up to Seth's question from a second ago. But with regard to tariffs, and you -- clearly you and your industry have had a very good history of passing along higher costs. But is there the potential now, with increased price transparency out there, that could limit to some extent, your ability to pass along these costs? And have you looked at that or -- and considered that factor as we think about these potential tariffs? -- Tom, do you want to take that one? -- When we look at the base cost of the products we sell, no matter what outlet they're going through, those tariffs are going to hit those products, the same amount. So there is disparity between what you can buy a part online for and you can buy a part in the store for. And there's also a tremendous amount of service that comes with the immediacy of need, our professional parts people, ability to test parts. Some parts, we'll change out for you. Ability to return something that didn't work, ability to pick up the same day something that you didn't have.And there's a tremendous value in that. So the effect that tariffs raise the price of all the goods sold, to us, we look at what's that price differentiation and what's the value? But we also have to remember that most of the price comparisons that we see out there are in branded parts which are really not the DIY parts. Those are primarily professional parts. And there is an entry level private label product in virtually every category that's a much more economical fix, it meets OE specs, but much more economical fix for our DIY customers. -- Got it. Appreciate all the color, and thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. -- Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Very good quarter, but I had just one metric I wanted to focus in on a little bit. Your new store productivity metric, as measured by the difference in revenue and comps divided by square footage, seemed to fall off a little bit. I know that non-store decline is probably a piece of it and perhaps maybe slower DIY growth. Was there any timing in store count or anything else you can kind of call out that would have impacted the ramp up from new stores? -- I would tell you that you should look at the numbers from my script, and they will be in the Q on -- what, non-store, non-comp were. That was the big driver that had to do with just the timing of year-end and how we do our new sales return reserves. But we are pleased with our new store performance. They continue to achieve and surpass our expectations. So we're going to continue to move forward. As Jeff talked about, we're going to go to arrange 200 to 210 new stores next year. And again, it's that accounting noise that's creating issues in your calculation. -- Got you. The 6,000 -- I think you've historically said 6,000 was the right store potential and 6,500 if there's consolidation. Is that still the way you're thinking about kind of the long term store potential when you think about your business? -- It is at this point, yes. -- Got you. Okay. Thank you for the time. Appreciate it.Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lasser from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. -- Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. -- Good morning, Michael. -- Based on what you know now -- based on what you know now and all else being equal, if you pass through the tariff price increases you're getting into next year, what do you think the inflation contribution to your business, based on a like number of units, would be? -- Again, we have another round of tariffs that may or may not come into effect. We also -- most of our suppliers have -- on-shore inventory, so we haven't seen all the price effects of the tariffs that we're going to see. We're also actively working to mitigate those. So making comments on next year's inflationary pressures at this point would be premature. So we will update everyone within our guidance, which we give detailed guidance, probably the most detailed guidance in the industry, and give quarterly numbers. So we will provide all of that information on our fourth quarter call. -- And Tom could you give us the contribution from inflation in the third quarter? And was there any impact from the tariffs as of yet? -- Touch on that in my prepared comments. Inflation this year has been around 1%, pretty consistent per quarter. The tariff impact has been very minimal year-to-date, minimal in the third quarter. They've been primarily commodity-based. And we will see how it plays out in the fourth quarter, but expectation is that we will see more inflation. -- And my follow-up question is if we look at the spread between O'Reilly's comp, GPC's comp, the retail sales data from the Census Bureau, the spread narrowed a bit this quarter now. Some of it's the timing of when the Sunday fell, but do you -- can you give us a sense for why your share gains might be decelerating a bit? -- Jeff, do you want to take that one? -- Yeah. Well, I mean, we're pretty pleased with our quarter. I mean, we guided 2% to 4% and we came in at a 3.9%. So as Greg said earlier, we can always do better and we're always focused on doing better, but we're pretty happy with the results of the quarter. As far as what's going on in the field, I mean, we don't really see or hear anything on the street that would indicate that we're losing any share. The business is a -- as we spoke to in the past, is a highly fragmented business, especially on the DIFM side with 37,000 parts stores out there and there's really no underserved market. We have a tremendous amount of respect for all our competitors. But really, we focus on our business model, and that's really doing the best we can on the retail and the professional side of the business in each one of our stores all across the country every day. -- Thank you very much, and good luck with the fourth quarter. -- Thanks, Michael.Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Horvers from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. -- Thanks. Good morning. -- Good morning. -- How do you -- following up on the gross margin, how do you expect the mix to play out in the fourth quarter? Do you expect that mix benefit to continue? And then on the current price increases, is there any near term potential benefit to capture some merchandise margins benefit on your existing inventory cost as you pass along the price increases, perhaps, ahead of that next order? -- Tom, do you want to take that? -- Yeah. On the gross margin, we always plan for normal. So we would expect to have normal fourth quarter gross margins. On the price increases and capturing additional margin, it will depend on the cadence of prices that go out. What I would tell you is because there are so many price increases, we are working very hard with our suppliers to try to defer these price increases, so we're actually paying them either through the inventory that we have or through the inventory that our suppliers have on shore. So I don't think there's a huge opportunity to raise prices in advance, and don't think that, that's our best approach. -- Understood. And then just thinking longer term about passing through price increases. Is the pricing increase such that you expect to able to maintain the merchandise margin rate? Or is the expectation that you get the inflation in the top line, and that drives better leverage on the fixed costs and in gross margin, and that allows you to maintain or potentially expand gross margin. -- When we look at the straight math, our goal is always to maintain our gross margin percentage because we also have expenses that have the same inflationary impact on them. -- Understood. Thanks very much. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. -- Hey, good morning, guys. -- Good morning, Bret. -- Could you talk about regional performance dispersion, strong markets versus weaker markets? -- Sure. Jeff, do you want to take that? -- Well. I mean, really, it was about what you'd expect coming off a more normalized winter and a better summer across most markets. It was fairly consistent across the country. A couple of markets I would call out is the North and the Northeast had a very solid quarter. And the only other comment I would make would be that our Western markets maybe weren't quite as strong as the rest of the Company. But that really is due to tougher compares from last year, and they really had a milder summer than normal out west. That didn't help, either. -- Okay, great. And then a follow up on, when you think about the environment with tariffs and the big players making more omnichannel push, does the M&A environment potentially get more active? I mean, as some of those smaller players might have a harder time just competing in this environment, do you see either more interested sellers? How you're able thinking about the next 12 months? -- The players that are still out there that we would be interested in are good operations that have weathered a lot of storms and have good management teams and are well-capitalized. When we look at those opportunities, what we've seen over the last two or three years is that we're, as everyone knows, an opportunistic acquirer and consolidator and had success in that realm. But we need a motivated seller. And these companies that are out there, we're still looking at, are good companies, and it's more a timing thing for them than the economic environment. -- Yeah. Bret, I would add to that. Every year, we'll buy a few one, two store operations. And this year has really been -- the cadence of this year's acquisition is really no different than we've seen in the past few years. So I wouldn't attribute any change to tariffs or inflation. -- Okay. Great. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Kate McShane from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open. -- Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question around the new DCs. Could you remind us what happens to the surrounding stores when you open up a new DC? Do they get a comp lift of any kind? And what happens with the DC capacity currently used for the nearby stores? -- Well, historically, I mean, the stores that are serviced out of a hub store that do have a new DC open in their market, they've got a much greater SKU offering. They move from somewhere in the neighborhood of 60,000 to 70,000 SKUs up to 150,000, 160,000 SKUs. So they just have much more availability readily in the market. And historically, we have seen a little bit of a comp lift in those markets. -- Yeah. Kate, to add to that, what we're going to see as we move in to an expansion market is the stores within a reasonable distance from the DCs will have same day, multiple times a day, access to that DC inventory. And to really add to what Jeff said, from a hub store perspective, not much difference on the outside stores. They're receiving -- that are outside of that perimeter, they're receiving inventory from a different DC. That doesn't really impact them. The real benefit is to the stores that are within a city counter service area of the DC. -- Okay, great. And if I could just ask just another comp lift, market share question. In the press release and in your commentary, you mentioned you're opening another 200 to 210 stores, based on your comp lift, increased market share. Is there something different that you're seeing in the market for these new stores that you're opening versus what you've done in the past with store openings? -- As Jeff said in his prepared comment, we don't go into any underserved markets. So every market is competitive. We continue to have a lot of confidence in our business model and how we execute in our ability to take share in any market we go into. But we would tell you that it's been pretty consistent for a number of years, the competitiveness of each market. The one thing I would tell you is that when we look at the Northeast, as we saw on the West Coast, is that development time to get stores open take longer. -- Okay. Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Zach Fadem from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. -- Hey, good morning. Could you speak to the impact of weather and Hurricane Florence in the quarter compared to Harvey last year, particularly on the DIY side? And do you foresee any notable impacts of Hurricane Michael or the flooding in Texas to play out in your business in Q4 and ahead? -- As far as Florence, I mean, we had roughly 100 stores that were closed during the event, mainly due to mandatory evacuations. So there's no doubt that it cost us some business. Our goal in any natural disaster is to get back in the stores as quick as we possibly can, ensure our team members' safety and then -- and they get back in the stores. Even though it might be a skeleton crew, at least get the doors open to be there for our customers.So we try to open back in the markets as quick as anybody to provide the post-hurricane supplies that the customers desperately need. I mean, there's a tremendous amount of goodwill created when your doors are open and you've got a family that's without power, potentially without power for days or weeks, and we can supply a generator where they can keep their food from spoiling or have some lights on. So anything that we would lose in the pre-hurricane, there's always some tailwind after the event. But it normally -- as we seen in the ones last year, it was somewhat of a push. -- Got it. And on the SG&A line in the quarter, I just want to confirm that the step change is -- it's primarily wages and some IT investments. And for Q4, is it fair to expect that the SG&A per store will come back to that 3% to 3.5% range that you've spoken about for the year? -- That would be a fair estimate, and the components will be the same. We had some additional pressure on some other lines that put us above 3.5% in the third quarter. -- Got it. Appreciate the time, guys. Thanks so much. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. -- Hey, everyone. This is Simeon. Good quarter. Follow-up on the do-it-for-me business, you mentioned, I think, ticket positive. I missed it if you talked about traffic -- how traffic is trending, or I guess, transaction count and do-it-for-me. -- Yes. So on the DIFM side of the business, both were positive. -- Okay. And is that rate -- has that rate changed a bit during the year? Is it accelerating? If you could -- to sort of support the comment that we're getting past that bubble. -- It's remained pretty solid. -- Okay. And then just thinking about demand for next year, looking at the sweet spot. I don't know if there's a nuance, but how do you look at it between 6 to 11-year-old vehicles, 6 to 12? Do you look at vehicles only? Or do you include light trucks? And I'm asking because if you kind of run the waterfall, it does produce all healthy but different magnitudes of outcomes. Curious if there's one version that you're relying on more than another. -- Well, we've talked about coming -- we talked about last year that the bubble was a pressure to us, especially on the professional side of the business because it was the weight of the tailwind of more vehicles was being offset in the professional side by that bubble. And that bubble worked through over time. But we felt like 2018 would -- that headwind we faced had abated. We would expect, as those years to go through, that we'll see some pressure, it will end up being more in the DIY side. We see relief on the professional side this year. But we'd expect, on a go-forward basis, to start -- to not have that headwind, to have a little bit of a tailwind. As far as the years, as you said, there's many ways to look at it. We tend to look at 5 to 15-year-old cars and light trucks. -- Thanks. I appreciate it.Thank you. We have now reached our allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Greg Johnson for closing remarks. -- Thank you, Senara. We'd like to conclude our call today by thanking the entire O'Reilly Team for their continued hard work and delivering another solid quarter. I'd like to thank everyone for joining our call today, and we look forward to reporting our 2018 full year results in February. Thank you.Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

This strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks that have impressive prospects and are trading at a discount.The GARP approach leads to the identification of stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.That means a portfolio created on the basis of GARP strategy is expected to have stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.The GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by utilizing the best features of both value and growth investing. Investors adopting the GARP approach will prefer to buy stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Both strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.GARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics - price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is also considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Along with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable  (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)

It has amassed assets over $307.39 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Growth segment of the US equity market.Mid cap companies, with market capitalization in the range of $2 billion and $10 billion, offer investors many things that small and large companies don't, including less risk and higher growth opportunities. These types of companies, then, have a good balance of stability and growth potential.Qualities of growth stocks include faster growth rates compared to the broader market, as well as higher valuations and higher than average sales and earnings growth rates. Something to keep in mind is the higher level of volatility that is affiliated with growth stocks. Even though growth stocks are more likely to outperform their value counterparts in strong bull markets, value stocks have a record of delivering better returns in almost all markets than growth stocks.Investors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.30%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.35%.While ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 25.70% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Industrials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Oreilly Automotive Inc (ORLY) accounts for about 1.48% of total assets, followed by Align Technology Inc (ALGN) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD).The top 10 holdings account for about 11.57% of total assets under management.JKH seeks to match the performance of the Morningstar Mid Growth Index before fees and expenses. The Morningstar Mid Growth Index measures the performance of stocks issued by mid-capitalization companies. The Morningstar index methodology defines mid-capitalization stocks as those stocks that form the 20% of market capitalization between the 70th and 90th percentile of the market capitalization of the stocks eligible to be included in the Morningstar US Market Index.The ETF return is roughly 4.94% so far this year and is up about 9.91% in the last one year (as of 10/24/2018). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $192.38 and $237.43.The ETF has a beta of 1 and standard deviation of 13.56% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 202 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.IShares Morningstar Mid-Cap Growth ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, JKH is an outstanding option for investors seeking exposure to the Mid Cap ETFs segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.The iShares S&P Mid-Cap 400 Growth ETF (IJK) and the iShares Russell Mid-Cap Growth ETF (IWP) track a similar index. While iShares S&P Mid-Cap 400 Growth ETF has $7.33 B in assets, iShares Russell Mid-Cap Growth ETF has $8.52 B. IJK has an expense ratio of 0.25% and IWP charges 0.25%.While an excellent vehicle for long term investors, passively managed ETFs are a popular choice among institutional and retail investors due to their low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit  .Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

This compares to earnings of $3.22 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4.65%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this auto parts retailer would post earnings of $4.04 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.28, delivering a surprise of 5.94%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.O'Reilly Automotive, which belongs to the Zacks Automotive - Retail and Wholesale - Parts industry, posted revenues of $2.48 billion for the quarter ended September 2018, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.48%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.34 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the .O'Reilly Automotive shares have added about 41.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.5%.While O'Reilly Automotive has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for O'Reilly Automotive was favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for the stock.

(Symbol: ORLY) saw new options become available this week, for the December 21st expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ORLY options chain for the new December 21st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $340.00 strike price has a current bid of $14.50. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $340.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $325.50 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ORLY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $343.03/share today.Because the $340.00 strike represents an approximate 1% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 56%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of ORLY stock at the current price level of $343.03/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $350.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.00% if the stock gets called away at the December 21st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ORLY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing ORLY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $350.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $350.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

(Symbol: ORLY) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $338.33, changing hands for $339.54/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 12 different analyst targets contributing to that average for O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $300.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $390.00. The standard deviation is $26.144.But the whole reason to look at the  ORLY price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with ORLY crossing above that average target price of $338.33/share, investors in ORLY have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $338.33 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

During the period, the stock has lost 18.8% in comparison with the industry's decline of 15.7%.Over the past two quarters of 2018, the company's sales were majorly driven by sports utility vehicles (SUVs) and trucks. Out of its diverse product line across different segments, the key players include F-series trucks and Lincoln Navigator, among others. | On the contrary, Ford's traditional sedans witnessed a downward trend in the same time frame. Declining consumer demand and product profitability impelled Ford not to invest in North America's next-gen sedans.Strong demand for high-end trucks aided Ford's F-Series to gain one of the top spots among best-selling pickup trucks in America. Further, year-over-year growth in F-Series' demand encouraged the company to set a target of selling 1 million F-Series pickups by the end of 2018. In the first half of 2018, Ford sold more than 450,000 F-Series trucks, referring that it is on track to achieve its target. Moreover, the fact that the company usually sells almost 52% of its pickups in the second half of the year indicates that it has the ability to cross the set mark for 2018.Taking a glance at the company's sales in the last three months, unit sales of F-Series seem to be a striking one. Ford's F-Series crossed the 70,000 truck sales mark for the seventh consecutive month in September.Although the number of F-Series trucks sold are high but the brand reported a sales decline of 8.8% in September. A major portion of Ford's trucks segment comprises of the F-Series, which witnessed 9.9% fall to 93,408 units during the month. With most of the company's sales depending on its pickup line, a monthly sales decline recorded by this segment is a concern for Ford.Additionally, imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imported from China is expected to hurt Ford like other automakers. In fact, Ford claimed that the increased tariffs will cost it almost $1 billion. Apart from raw material costs, Ford also spent money on recent recalls. In the last month, Ford announced a recall of 2 million F-150 pickup trucks in North America due to faulty seat belt. Estimated cost of the recall was $140 million, which will hurt its third-quarter earnings, per management.Among other automotive companies, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.  is scheduled to release results on Oct 24, whereas BorgWarner Inc.  and General Motors Company  are scheduled to report earnings on Oct 25 and Oct 31, respectively.O'Reilly sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while BorgWarner and General Motors carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The stock has advanced 13.4% compared with 5.3% increase recorded by the industry during the period.Let's see, how things are shaping up for this announcement. | Our proven model shows that O'Reilly Automotive is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have the right combination of the two key ingredients - a positive  and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) - for increasing the odds of an earnings beat. : O'Reilly Automotive has an Earnings ESP of +0.51% as the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $4.33 and $4.30, respectively. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . : O'Reilly Automotive currently carries a Zacks Rank #1.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.For third-quarter 2018, O'Reilly Automotive projects diluted earnings per share of $4.2-$4.3 compared with $3.22 recorded in the prior-year quarter. It expects consolidated comparable store sales of 2-4%, rising from 1.8% in third-quarter 2017. Positive demand from both Do-it-Yourself (DIY) customers and Do-it-for-Me (DIFM) or professional installers will aid the company's third-quarter 2018 earnings.O'Reilly Automotive's strategy to open stores across the country enabled it to expand presence across 29 different states. During the first half of 2018, the company opened 128 net new stores. It is in sync with its goal to open 200 stores by 2018 end. Apart from existing markets, store openings aid O'Reilly Automotive to expand in new and less-populated areas.Moreover, the company benefits from its dual-market strategy and is continuously benefiting from a strong distribution network.For the soon-to-be-released quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales per weighted-average store stands at $480,000, in-line with the actual figure of second-quarter 2018. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for number of stores opened is 36 compared with 56 in the last reported quarter.However, O'Reilly Automotive's dependence on weather cycle for product sales is a concern. During the third quarter, the company's sales might have been impaired by Hurricane Florence that took place in September. Additionally, O'Reilly Automotive is experiencing continuous rise in SG&A expenses, majorly due to store openings and maintaining the old ones, which might hurt margins.Here are a few other stocks worth considering from the same space, with the right combination of elements to outpace earnings estimates this time around:Cummins Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +1.46% and a Zacks Rank #3.

The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the  , helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at  , which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. O'Reilly Automotive currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for ORLY that show why this auto parts retailer shows promise as a solid momentum pick.Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.For ORLY, shares are up 3.19% over the past week while the Zacks Automotive - Retail and Wholesale - Parts industry is up 1.98% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 4.04% compares favorably with the industry's 4.54% performance as well.Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of O'Reilly Automotive have risen 19.07%, and are up 65.02% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 5.1% and 18.29%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to ORLY's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. ORLY is currently averaging 506,853 shares for the last 20 days.The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with ORLY.Over the past two months, 12 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost ORLY's consensus estimate, increasing from $15.54 to $15.91 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 11 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Taking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that ORLY is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep O'Reilly Automotive on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

(Symbol: ORLY) shares, but tentative about paying the going market price of $348.75/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2020 put at the $250 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $7.40. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 3% return against the $250 commitment, or a 2.2% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to ORLY's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $250 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. sees its shares fall 28.2% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $242.60 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $7.40 from $250), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 2.2% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $250 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2020 put at the $250 strike for the 2.2% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $348.75) to be 28%.

The company's shares have gained more than 46% on a year-to-date basis against the  's decline of 0.8%. The overall improvement in the U.S. economy and a rise in housing momentum are expected to further drive RH's performance. This leading luxury home furnishings retailer recently reported stellar second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Notably, earnings estimates for RH have exhibited an uptrend, reflecting optimism in the stock's prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's earnings for fiscal 2018 has moved up 13.1%, reflecting 10 upward revisions over the past seven days. Also, estimates for fiscal 2019 have climbed 8% over the same time frame, depicting nine positive revisions. This signifies that analysts are optimistic of the company's future earnings growth, despite much apprehension surrounding the impact of a rising interest rate scenario and other ongoing headwinds.Let us delve deeper into the other factors that make this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock a profitable pick. You can see  . RH has been exhibiting strong quarterly numbers, buoyed by its focus on improving profit margins rather than chasing for sales, as well as creating a new and differentiating shopping experience with the addition of hospitality (restaurants and cafes) in new Full Line Design Galleries.Recently, RH posted strong second-quarter fiscal 2018 results, with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17.8% and also increasing more than three times from the year-ago quarter despite lower-than-expected revenues. The company's margins also showed solid improvement. Adjusted gross margins expanded 800 basis points on higher-full-price/lower clearance sales and supply-chain efficiencies.RH's focus on executing its new business model, designing a new operating platform and maximizing cash flow via increasing revenues as well as earnings bodes well. Given solid quarterly results, the company raised its fiscal 2018 view. RH now expects adjusted gross margin in the 40-40.2% range (versus 39.3%-39.6% expected earlier). Adjusted operating margin is now expected in the 11.2-11.7% band, up from the previous expectation of 10.4-11%. Finally, adjusted earnings per share are expected in the $7.35-$7.75 range ($6.34-$6.83 expected earlier). RH has solid growth prospects, as is evident from the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings of $7.51 per share, which are expected to grow 146.2% year over year (higher than the industry average of 11.5%). Meanwhile, the company's revenues are expected to increase by a decent 4.3% in fiscal 2018 (versus 2.8% of the industry). Moreover, its earnings are expected to increase 9.9% on 7% revenue growth in fiscal 2019. Notably, the company has a three-five year expected EPS growth rate of 25.4%.Overall, it constitutes a great pick in terms of growth investment, supported by a Growth Score of A. In 2016, the company transformed its business from a promotional to a membership model (RH Members Program), which is expected to enhance its brand, streamline operations and enhance customer experience. Meanwhile, RH has been focusing on the expansion of its chain of restaurants within its stores. Also, initiatives like RH Modern, RH Teen, RH Hospitality, the redesign of RH Interiors Source Book, the rollout of Design Ateliers across the company's retail Galleries are expected to contribute to growth in fiscal 2018 and beyond. RH has a  of A. Our VGM Score identifies stocks that have the most attractive value, growth and momentum characteristics. In fact, our research shows that stocks with VGM Scores of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 make a solid investment choice. RH's return on equity (ROE) supports its growth potential. Its ROE of 520.9% compares favorably with the industry's average of 9.3%, implying that it is efficient in using its shareholders' funds.Other top-ranked stocks in the  include Advance Auto Parts, Inc.  , AutoZone, Inc.  and O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2.Earnings for Advance Auto, AutoZone and O'Reilly Automotive are expected to increase 29.2%, 15.7% and 34.4%, respectively, for the current year.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:  ,  ,  and  .The United States recently reached an agreement with Mexico for a new trade deal. It is called U.S.-Mexico trade pact and will rewrite NAFTA, which also includes Canada. The announcement lifted the broader markets that have for quite some time been weighed down by trade conflicts.U.S. auto and parts makers, in particular, recorded even bigger gains as the deal gave American plants an upper hand over Mexican facilities, where workers earn far less. Railroads also gained as the trade deal eases the risks of big tariffs, thus, offering smooth cross-border transportation services. Given the positives, investing in solid domestic automakers and railroad companies seems judicious.The United States and Mexico reached a deal to change parts of the NAFTA, the trade agreement that Trump finds unreasonable. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said that the deal requires 75% of parts in a car traded in North America to be sourced from the United States or Mexico. This is higher than the current 62.5% of the parts needed to be produced in the United States, Mexico or Canada.The deal also requires around 40% to 45% of parts in cars sold to be manufactured by workers earning at least $16 UDS an hour. The agreement is intended to last nearly 16 years and will be reviewed every six years.The deal however raises concerns about whether Canada, the third country in NAFTA, will agree to the amendments. Nonetheless, Lighthizer said that the pact was \"absolutely terrific\" and would surely modernize a trade agreement that had \"gotten seriously out of whack.\" He remained optimistic that the Congress would approve the deal with broad bipartisan support.Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland added that \"progress between Mexico and the United States is a necessary requirement for any renewed NAFTA agreement\" and that \"Canada is encouraged by the continued optimism shown by negotiating partners.\"Investors seem to be shouting approval for the new trade deal. After all, the Trump administration had imposed series of tariffs and other protectionist measures against several of its key trading partners, raising concerns about a global trade war, which in turn may derail economic growth and squeeze corporate profits.Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at an all-time high for a second straight session on Aug 27, with the Nasdaq trading above the coveted 8,000 mark. This marked the second 1,000 point advance for the tech-laden index this year, something that has not happened since 1999. The Dow also exited its correction phase for the first time in more than six months, finishing its longest correction period since the 223-session run in 1961, per Dow Jones Market Data.Shares of U.S. auto and parts manufacturers surged the most on news that the United States and Mexico have reached a tentative deal to update the 25-year old NAFTA. General Motors Company shot up almost 5% and Ford Motor Company jumped more than 3%. Both these stocks are now rebounding from a two-month downtrend.But, what led to the rally in domestic auto shares? This was largely backed by the deal's allowance of import tariffs on cars, trucks and their parts if manufacturers do not get bulk of their content from the NAFTA region, or use a significant number of workers who earn handsomely. The latter provision, in fact, will further compel car makers to push for more of their production into the United States from the lower wage Mexican plants.Top rail stocks also scaled higher on the trade agreement as it eased the effects of big tariffs on Mexico that could disrupt supply chains and rail shipments all through North America.Shares of Kansas City Southern climbed 4.7% to end at 119.04 and successfully broke out of a flat base with a 115.01 entry point earlier this month. Rail giant Union Pacific Corporation (UNP) increased 1.8% to 152.78 and broke out of a flat base last month with a 148.43 entry point. Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian National Railway also rallied on the deal news, up 1.7% and 2%, respectively.Banking on such positives, investing in the stocks from the mentioned sectors seems prudent.

But the company continues to choose new opportunities. Amazon is willing to try its hand at almost any sort of business, does well at the bulk of them - and threatens to destroy dozens of other companies with its success.The latest foray into unfamiliar territory? The  turns Amazon into a mail-order pharmacy, with a twist. PillPack packs all pills it dispenses into individual bags, each with a unique time and date to be consumed by the customer.That's not Amazon's first venture outside its space. Amazon's also a grocer, a fashion venue, a peddler of handmade crafts and even a video game developer, just to name a few.As a result, Amazon has become at best a headache, at worst a survival threat, for any rival organization in its past. Indeed, in November, we tallied up 32 companies that looked like potential victims of Amazon's never-ending expansion. Today, we're looking at 49 companies Amazon could kill - a few updates of the original list, but also an alarming number of new outfits that have fallen into Amazon's crosshairs - as well as one confirmed kill.The unchecked growth of Amazon didn't faze auto parts suppliers like O'Reilly Automotive (  ), AutoZone (  ) and Advance Auto Parts (  ) for a long time. Car parts are too heavy, bulky and specialized to be handled like a consumer-centric commodity. And besides, when mechanics (DIYers or the real thing) need a part to use in a repair, they usually want it quickly. The big three names in the auto parts retailing game haven't needed to worry.But times have changed, helped along by inventory-management technology and delivery networks that are willing and able to handle goods they simply couldn't before. That's why Amazon was willing to enter the fray in January 2017.It didn't take long for brick-and-mortar operators to notice. AutoZone shares fell 27% during the first half of 2017, reflecting a first-quarter revenue and earnings miss. O'Reilly hit a similar headwind in Q2 2017 as well, as did Advance Auto Parts.All three stocks have since recovered, as the market realizes Amazon hasn't yet unleashed the same havoc realizing Amazon hasn't unleashed the same kind of havoc on the auto parts retailing industry that it has on other consumer-facing markets. Give it time though. The fact that a little more than half of this trio's business, on average, comes from consumers rather than mechanics, it's a perfect opportunity for Amazon to become a disruptor.Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods Market sent shockwaves through the organic-grocery business, but just as vulnerable (albeit in a different way) are more conventional grocers such as Kroger (  ), privately owned Albertsons and the grocery arm of Walmart (  ).Yes, Whole Foods and Kroger somewhat overlap, particularly since Kroger has stepped up its organic and whole foods offering. But it's not the brick-and-mortar alternative that should worry Kroger shareholders the most. More concerning is that consumers are increasingly comfortable with the idea of ordering their potato chips, laundry detergent and ground coffee from Amazon.com, just like they order office supplies or books.Recent numbers from industry research outfit One Click Retail tell the story. Since the end of last year, Amazon has sold 18% of all groceries purchased online in the United States, making it the biggest online grocer despite more recognizable names in the business also offering online ordering. The firm estimates the company sold $650 million worth of groceries in the second quarter of this year, up 40% on a year-over-year basis. Beverages, of all things, are likely to be Amazon.com's best-selling grocery category.As time rolls on, more people raised in the internet era are becoming comfortable with the idea of not shopping in an actual grocery store. This shift plays right into Amazon's hand.Music isn't the only audio Amazon.com can digitally deliver. It's also the owner of  , which boasts the largest audiobook library in the world. It's a direct threat to (among others) Audiobooks.com and Playster.Don't dismiss this market's importance. Although audio books only generated $2.5 billion worth of revenue in the United States last year, the size of the market is not only growing, it's accelerating. In the first quarter, the industry's revenue was up 32% year-over-year, extending a longstanding hot streak.What was largely missing from the audiobook landscape for a long time was a central name, playing the role Netflix (  ) played within the streaming video arena in mainstreaming the audio books.Amazon largely has become that player.Audible controls about 41% of the audio book market, as of the most recent look. And, like Netflix, being the first to become the dominant, defining force in a particular market leaves little room for a second or third player ... which is all Playster and Audiobooks.com are in a position to enjoy from here. But playing second fiddle to Amazon in any business is a problem, especially when Audible can be sold as part of an Amazon Prime package.Bookstore chain Barnes & Noble (  ) and Joseph-Beth Booksellers were the first major victims of the rise of Amazon. Remember: Initially, Amazon.com was an online bookstore, and the advent of e-readers - then tablets - made e-books commonplace, further displacing physical bookstores.One end result for B&N is 11 consecutive years of declining sales, and the 12th appears to be underway. Another end result: nine straight years of net store closures.The matter may get worse, too. CEO Demos Parneros was terminated after only 14 months on the job during which he presumably couldn't drive any measurable change. A statement from the company only said Demos had violated corporate policies, and further made a point of saying it wasn't a matter of fraud or misreporting of results.Such a disruption here only exacerbates the underlying problem.Global Data Retail analyst Neil Saunders explains the challenge bluntly and succinctly, saying, \"People may drop in for a browse but they won't make a dedicated trip to a bookstore. They don't have the need and they don't have the time. The way people shop changed, and that's been detrimental for Barnes & Noble.\" Ditto for tiny Joseph-Beth, which has four stores left in the U.S.There are a number of specific gaming companies that, with the exception of YouTube Gaming, won't ring any bells with investors. But within video gaming circles, Hitbox, Mixer, Dailymotion, Beam and a whole slew of other non-descript names are plenty familiar. All of these organizations have developed platform that let gaming fans pay to watch other people play video games.Yes, it's a real thing. Last year nearly 700 million people watched someone else play a game, though some suggest the figure is actually closer to 1 billion, depending on how it's measured.What does that have to do with Amazon?Amazon.com is the owner and operator of  , which is the world's most popular destination to watch other individuals play video games. Not unlike YouTube, the maker of the video and Amazon split any subscription revenue created by a particular gamer's channel, so that player has an incentive to do well and grow his or her audience.It's possible there's room for more than one player in the game-streaming space. It's unlikely there's room for more than one dominant player. For the same reason Facebook (  ) became the place where the world can gather online, the biggest crowd attracts the best game players, and the best game players attract an increasingly bigger crowd.There's no denying that electronics retailer Best Buy (  ) pulled off a miracle.The deeper Amazon.com waded into the consumer electronics market, the more trouble Best Buy found itself in. By 2012, chatter about Best Buy's impending doom was common. Many presumed the company would follow in Circuit City's footsteps to bankruptcy, as Amazon was simply too competitive.A funny thing happened on the road to oblivion. Turnaround artist Hubert Joly took the helm that year and began working on a turnaround plan to save Best Buy. It worked, at least according to Joly. He flatly said earlier this year, \"We have turned around the business, it's about where we go from here. We have not only survived but thrived and I don't believe this is a winner-takes-all market.\"Last quarter's numbers suggest there's some truth to the matter. Company-wide revenue was up 6.8%, and same-store sales grew 7.1%.Hold off on the victory lap. Best Buy wasn't facing the most difficult of comps last quarter, and it remains to be seen whether there's a growth trajectory in place or if Best Buy is simply lifting the revenue plateau to a slightly higher level. It will take a few more quarters to know for sure. In the meantime, Amazon is undoubtedly going to push back, reminding Best Buy that it's tough to fight a sustained war against a bigger army.Major video game publishing outfits such as Activision-Blizzard (  ) and Electronic Arts (  ) will be forced to face off with Amazon at some point in the future. Both those companies are big enough and well-grounded enough to hold their own, however.The same can't be said for all the smaller, \"indie\" game developers and game-engine providers such as HeroEngine, Unity, Blender, Godot and more, which eventually could feel the pressure from Amazon.Confused? You're not alone. Though most investors - and even most gamers - don't know it, Amazon has a hand in the video game development arena. It owns a game engine called  , allowing developers and designers free access to this solid technology licensed from a company called Crytek. Games such as Crucible and Star Citizen are some of the early AAA games the Amazon platform has produced.You've heard little about this because the whole effort still is in its infancy. It's possible not even Amazon really knows where it's going. So it's not entirely clear who should be worried about Amazon's potential push.Given Amazon's sheer size and strength, though, any of the smaller players in the highly fragmented game development industry should fear what Amazon may try to do once it feels Lumberyard is ready to promote in a big way.No one disputes Amazon.com has mastered the art of delivering anything and everything that isn't perishable, but what about pre-packaged meals? Yep, the e-commerce company can do that too. It got into the business in the middle of last year, and it has since stepped up its game. Its entry into the race is a direct threat to the likes of rival meal kit outfits Blue Apron (  ), Hello Fresh and Plated.The marketability and viability of the so-called \"pure plays\" in the business were never all that strong. They're all subject to the changing - usually rising - price of food, and it takes massive scale to make meal kits cost-effective enough to turn into a sustainable business. Blue Apron, for instance, is one of the biggest names in the business yet still is nowhere near profitability.Another unsavory reality of the meal kit biz: Roughly three-fourths of Blue Apron's and HelloFresh's customers stop buying them (on a regular basis anyway) within about six months. The idea is creative, but not necessarily one with longevity.To the extent there is a viable meal kit market, though, Amazon.com has an edge. Two edges, actually. One of them is the fact that Amazon regularly serves more than 300 million customers, enough of whom will test drive a meal kit. The other edge is that Amazon doesn't have to turn a profit selling pre-packaged meals. It can extract a profit from those customers by selling them other products and services.Energizer Holdings (  ), which of course is the name behind Energizer batteries, clearly is one of the most recognizable names in the business, as is Duracell, which is held by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (  ).Batteries currently sold under Amazon's \"Basics\" label don't exactly inspire deep brand loyalty.Don't dismiss the potential of Amazon's entry into the seemingly boring business. In the United States alone, the battery business (including the automotive component of the market) is worth roughly $17 billion per year, and Amazon already outsells all other battery brands in the U.S. As of last year, Amazon.com sold a little more than 30% of all consumer-electronics-sized batteries for use in the United States, versus Energizer's market share of around 12%. Duracell is holding up a little better, sporting roughly 21% of last year's non-rechargeable battery business in the U.S.It's unlikely either brand will ever be wiped out completely. But Amazon doesn't even really promote its Basics battery other than as an add-on purchase at its website, and yet it already has proven disruptive to the two biggest brands in the business.Teachers Pay Teachers is an unconventional, though brilliant, business idea. Rather than proverbially re-create the wheel, teachers can create structured classroom handouts and materials, then sell them to other (often overworked) teachers who may not have the time to do so for themselves.It's not exactly clear how big the market is. Owler provides an estimate of $5.8 million in annual revenues for Teachers pay Teachers, but the ecosystem of the money its 80,000 contributors earn is much larger. Last year, they collectively banked more than $100 million. For perspective, the textbook market in the United States alone is worth roughly $11 billion per year.Amazon's increasingly disruptive role in the middle of that melee is its relatively new  , which is \"an open collaboration service that helps teachers to easily discover, gather, and share quality educational content with their community.\"The problem for Teachers Pay Teachers, Educents and all their peers? Amazon Inspire is free to use.That may or may not always be the case, but as long as it's free, it's a threat to for-profit sites in the same arena. Conversely, should Amazon eventually opt to make it a profit center, it's apt to turn up the heat on promoting Amazon Inspire. That could prove highly disruptive to the other venues that have commercialized DIY classroom materials.Etsy (  ) was, and is, a brilliant idea.Some things are just not meant to be made or sold in bulk. Handmade one-of-a-kinds still have a place in consumers' hearts, but makers of these goods are facing an increasingly tough time in just being able to show their wares to an increasingly distracted market. By bringing a huge number of artisans under one roof and then promoting the entire collection, Etsy has successfully melded an old-school idea with the new.But Amazon noticed, and responded. In 2015, the e-commerce giant launched  , taking a stab at Etsy.Amazon's disruption of Etsy has been hit and miss. Etsy's revenue grew 30% year-over-year last quarter, and the company upped its full-year revenue guidance, too. Clearly Etsy is doing something right under the relatively new leadership of former eBay (  ) executive Josh Silverman.Still, Amazon may slowly but surely taking a toll - or at least forcing Etsy to take a toll on itself. In July, Etsy upped the transaction fee it charges merchants from 3.5% to 5.0%, inciting enough grumbling among some of its sellers that it's a legitimate fear many of them will look elsewhere ... such as Amazon. Amazon Handmade charges considerably more, but also boasts considerably more marketing firepower.Amazon appears to be playing the proverbial long game, planning to win the war by attrition.Ride-hailing services Uber and Lyft were long thought to be potential victims of Amazon. Whispers that Lyft was aiming at parcel delivery were circulating, and Uber was waist-deep into the package-shipping business. Amazon was using contractors to deliver packages as well, though, and the foray into people transportation would have been an easy one.Amazon's focus is elsewhere, however. Rather than expands its network of delivery drivers, earlier this year it doubled down on building its own delivery chain using contractors. Called  , the company is encouraging individuals with an entrepreneurial spirit to build their own business by delivering Amazon-ordered parcels. Such a venture takes aim at the likes of United Parcel Service (  ) and FedEx (  ).The Amazon Delivery Service Partners venture isn't a direct, immediate threat to the existence of FedEx and UPS. Indeed, some of these deliveries may well be ones that those bigger logistics outfits don't want to do.Amazon isn't a company that thinks small, however. With a fleet of 32 delivery jets in operation and a growing fleet of trucks on the road, the next natural step is bridging the two and completely cutting out middlemen like FedEx and United Parcel Service from many of its delivery chains.GameStop (  ) historically has made its money by serving as the middleman, but the game publishing industry's move toward downloads and away from discs and cartridges is increasingly making the venue less of a destination for gamers.Jefferies analyst Stephanie Wissink explained the problem in July, noting \"We've observed meaningful valuation expansion across retailers where margin rates base, pricing power returns (inventory & markdown clean-up), and sector participation/consumption is healthy.\" Wissink added, however, that \"GME has not participated in this reversal ... due in part to leadership turnover, lack of an articulated vision & direction, and overriding fears around software profit dependence.\"Don't misunderstand. GameStop also sells game downloads via its own website. Amazon does too. Neither venue is completely out of the loop when it comes to this paradigm shift underway within the gaming business.But Amazon.com induced 2.8 billion unique visits just over the course of the first half of the year. It simply draws a bigger crowd, and the gamers among them know they can buy downloads via the site. GameStop's website simply doesn't attract nearly as many people.The premise is evident in the numbers. Revenue has been drifting lower since 2011, and more often than not since 2012, the organization has reported slight declines in per-share profits. Its first quarter revenue was off to the tune of 5.5%, cutting profits roughly in half year-over-year.Initially, the rise of Amazon.com was not only not a threat to book publishers; it was a benefit, making it easy for consumers to purchase a book rather than require a visit to an actual bookstore.Technology never stops marching forward, though. The development of e-books and e-readers has quelled the need for printing and shipping while simultaneously positioning Amazon.com as an e-book hub. For the crowd that still prefers the feel of paper and the look of a volume on a bookshelf, Amazon's  can arrange for a book to be printed on-demand - even just one at a time.With that option on the table, traditional book publishers like Penguin Random House and Hachette Books are struggling to justify their new role as a middleman that doesn't bring any real value to the table. Amazon can do the marketing job too, or at least offer a platform that will allow an author to promote a book as effectively as a publishing house often does.The paradigm shift toward self-publishing continues to get traction too, democratizing the space in a way that accelerates that shift. Jeff Bezos noted in his most recent letter to shareholders that that more than 1,000 independent authors earned more than $100,000 using Kindle Direct Publishing last year. For 2017, Amazon paid out more than $200 million to its authors.The numbers prompt one key question: Who needs an old-school publisher?Most consumers have heard of online business directory and review repository Yelp (  ). Ditto for Angie's List, which was owned by InterActiveCorp (  ) but later spun off into ANGI Homeservices (  ). What most consumers don't yet realize, however, is that Amazon is quietly encroaching into that market.It's called  , and it looks a lot like Angie's List. Homeowners looking for anything ranging from tech support to housecleaning services to yardwork can browse Amazon's curated list of service providers and read reviews regarding their previous work. Angie's List and Yelp offer similar information. And while Yelp also serves up information about a variety of other consumer-facing businesses such as restaurants or retail stores, there's no denying that Amazon Home Services is a viable alternative source of information on many fronts.Given that Amazon already connects consumers with restaurants near them, adding reviews to the mix wouldn't be a major technical hurdle.Nothing is wrong with Yelp yet, at least not given its most recent quarterly earnings report. Sales were up 12% year-over-year, and per-share profits grew from 9 cents to 12 cents. But the company hasn't yet faced Amazon in a full-on fight.Even something as mundane and common, yet garment-specific, as fabric could be upended by Amazon.At first glance, it doesn't appear Amazon has given its fabric and material business any particular special attention. Many of the sewing and craft supplies the website offers are featured on the same basic page used to sell all sorts of other goods, and the featured seller, Fabric.com, appears to be the beneficiary of the usual handoff Amazon makes when a customer needs something that can't be sold en masse.But take a closer look at the website that Amazon.com redirects you to when you click on the sizeable at the top of the \"Fabrics\" page. You're buying fabric by the yard from Fabric.com, but Fabric.com is  .It's a very un-Amazon-like business, though the company knows something most consumers and investors don't: The fabric and sewing supply retailing market is worth about $4 billion per year, and globally, the textile market is expected to be worth more than $1 trillion by 2025.That's more Amazon-like! Amazon's edge in the arena is that it has the much-needed scale that most textile outlets and retailers don't. That's a problem for Jo-Ann Fabrics.If you own any activewear sporting the Goodsport, Rebel Canyon or Peak Velocity labels, you're actually wearing one of Amazon's homegrown house brands. The company got into the business for itself late last year.The foray was a modest one - more of an experiment than something meant to make a splash. It largely was meant to fill gaps left unfilled by the athletic apparel names that weren't offering the entire breadth of their lineup at Amazon.com. Most everything Amazon does, though, starts small and eventually gets big enough to become disruptive.It's a shot at names such as Lululemon Athletica (  ) and Under Armour (  ), which are well-recognized brands but fiscally struggling companies. Under Armour has been saddled by debt, while Lululemon is finding that an increasingly competitive environment isn't driving profits any higher despite rising revenue.Nike (  ) is vulnerable too, but being the biggest and most respected name in the business, it could just as easily benefit from the fact that Amazon has put other activewear manufacturers on the defensive.It certainly wouldn't be a significant stretch to wreak some significant havoc in the semi-specialized apparel arena. Morgan Stanley noted earlier this year that Amazon.com already generates more U.S. apparel revenue than any other retailer, garnering 8.6% of the market for itself in 2017. And last year, online apparel sales grew 7% to make up more than 20% of the market, while in-store purchases fell 3%. Amazon is well-positioned to leverage its own athletic apparel into the equation.Reminder: Office Depot (  ) and OfficeMax are now one and the same company, having merged back in 2013 as a means of defending itself from the slow disintegration of the office supply business.Amazon.com - and  in particular - put that disintegration into motion.It still wasn't enough. That's why Office Depot and privately held Staples sought a merger of their own a couple of years later, explaining that unless the two retailers worked as one, neither would survive. The Department of Justice didn't buy into the argument, however; it feared that whittling down the number of large brick-and-mortar office supply outfits would harm consumers.Little has changed since then. Office Depot managed to top its second-quarter earnings estimates, catapulting ODP shares higher, but a closer look at the Q2 report reveals that not all of the tepid growth was even organic. It was driven by acquisitions and new initiatives. Perhaps worse, the lackluster year-over-year results appear to be the new normal.Staples doesn't have to disclose its quarterly results, but it's difficult to see how it could be faring much better than ODP. Neither can compete with Amazon's prices, and low prices are everything to business customers.When consumers mull their digital music options, Amazon Prime generally isn't a name that comes to mind. The race for online-radio mindshare has largely been won by the likes of Spotify or Pandora (  ) ... or increasingly, Apple (  ), which was recently cultivated its own subscription-based service to complement the a la carte nature of its iTunes store.However, a wide swath of consumers are grooving to Amazon's beat. As of Q1, Amazon Music boasted 12.7 million regular/monthly users. That pales in comparison to the \"Big Three\" of Apple, Pandora and Spotify. But considering how little effort Amazon.com puts into music, that user base could ramp up quickly if Amazon turns up the heat.Amazon's exposure to the digital music market may actually be much bigger than it seems on the surface, too. That's because you also could include the number of Amazon Prime subscribers that take advantage of the Prime Music offer available to Prime members. There's no firm figure on how many people listen to some sort of online audio via Amazon, but the company said the number is in the \"tens of millions.\"One small tweak in its music platform, then, could make Amazon alarmingly disruptive.Rite Aid (  ) actually earned a spot on Amazon's list of likely victims a few months ago - back when rumors were merely swirling that the e-commerce outfit was toying with the idea becoming a drug dispenser. Little had come of the possibility at the time, but obviously much has changed.Aside from the threat that Amazon's acquisition of PillPack poses to the Rite Aid, the remaining piece of Rite Aid that wasn't sold to Walgreens (  ) still needs help in reinvigorating sales and profitability. A partner/buyer appears to be a means to that end, but finding a suitable, willing suitor is proving tough to do. The latest would-be partner was grocery chain Albertson's, though such a pairing may not exactly have been of any benefit to investors. Proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services penned a report on the matter just a few weeks ago. It wrote, \"The merger combines two low-margin, over leveraged companies, both of which are facing heightened competitive environments.\"Shareholders agreed, prompting management to kill the deal and leaving Rite Aid in need of a lifeline that doesn't appear to be on the horizon.Amazon is largely responsible for the \"heightened competitive environments\" both parties are facing. Amazon not only owns PillPack and Whole Foods Market, but it's also selling all sorts of consumable dry goods via its online platform.In all fairness, Amazon has been making things tough for all brick and mortar retailers. Sears (  ) is the wounded and sickest member of the herd, though, and therefore the prey most vulnerable to Amazon.com.Revenue has been shrinking since 2006, and the company hasn't turned a full-year profit since 2011. In retrospect, hedge-fund-manager-turned-CEO Eddie Lampert should have fixed as many of its poorly performing stores as he could rather than simply shed them in an effort to raise much-needed cash. Or, maybe Sears (and Kmart) were and still are simply unfixable.The irony? Sears has actually partnered with Amazon on multiple occasions in an effort to drive sales. In October of last year, Kenmore - a Sears-owned brand of home appliances - unveiled a new line of smart refrigerators that work with Amazon's artificial intelligence assistant Alexa. In July of last year, Sears listed a slew of Kenmore branded goods at the Amazon.com website. In May of this year, Amazon began selling tires to consumers that ultimately would be installed at a Sears Tire Center.The struggling retailer may only be feeding the beast that will eventually eat it, however. Amazon also is selling tires that Monro will install, and Amazon.com sells Maytag and Frigidaire home appliances too, even if those other brands aren't featured as prominently.Sears, and Kmart, are just too deep into the Amazon quicksand now to fight their way out.It's not exactly a secret that people across the U.S., and around the world for that matter, are increasingly concerned about what they're eating. Chemicals and pesticides are completely out of fashion, as is genetically modified produce. En vogue are organic goods, and where at all possible, locally sourced foods.It's a trend that initially sprang life for outfits like Sprouts Farmers Market (  ) and Trader Joe's, which historically have been the go-to options for health-conscious consumers. Now that rival grocer Whole Foods Market is an Amazon holding, it can benefit from Amazon's strong marketing reach.That's not the only edge Amazon has on its organic-grocery rivals, however.Unlike Trader Joe's and Sprouts, Amazon isn't all that concerned about turning a profit in the grocery biz. Indeed, the company is almost annoyingly coy about how its grocery business is doing, offering no meaningful details of its performance. Being in the business is simply another means of connecting with consumers, pulling them further into the Amazon ecosystem, where they can be monetized in other ways.More than that, though, Amazon's ambition of dominance-at-all-costs has allowed it to become the low-price leader in the whole foods and organic grocery market. Unable to compete with the giant, The Fresh Market announced in July it was closing a total of 15 stores.Sprouts and Trader Joe's haven't been forced become that defensive - yet - but both have been forced to reshape plans. They're investing more in technology, and less in store growth, where Amazon can really start to pound them.Amazon.com has proven problematic for the likes of Walmart (  ) and Costco (  ), and more recently, vice versa. All three companies are big enough and different enough from one another that they'll be able to at least defend their turf.Target (  ) is in a tougher situation, however. It has neither the size of Walmart, the pricing power of Costco nor the sheer online presence of Amazon.com. It's trapped somewhere in the middle, which within the world of modern retailing is the last place any organization wants to be.You can see this idea at work in the company's most recent earnings report. Although fiscal Q1's same-store sales grew nicely, investments in Target's online presence and customer-attraction efforts - such as deliveries and price-cutting - crimped margins from 7.1% a year earlier to 6.2% this time around. Morningstar's analysts foresee more of the same heavy spending ahead, and Target isn't in a position to outspend its competition.There is one plausible, albeit low-percentage, ray of hope on the horizon. More than once, Amazon has been rumored to be interested in acquiring Target. Such a maneuver would instantly give the organization a retail footprint that could prove more problematic for Walmart than Target is on its own. But simply hoping for a buyout is never a good enough reason to buy or stick with a stock.Supply outfit W. W. Grainger (  ) has held up better than many investors presumed it would when Amazon announced it was tiptoeing onto its turf last year with a platform called Amazon Business. Indeed, GWW shares are up more than 120% from their August 2017 lows, largely driven by slow and steady revenue and earnings growth that analysts didn't think Grainger would achieve.How did GWW manage it, and against a bigger foe that cares little about profits? Macquarie analyst Hamzah Mazari explained earlier this year, \"Close to $2.5 billion of their revenue, out of their total $10 billion, was uncompetitively priced, so they cut their price to be more in line with the market ... in the fourth quarter they showed volumes were up double digits.\"It has worked so far. But Grainger isn't well-equipped to fight a price war, and CEO D.G. Macpherson has already hinted that gross margins around 38% would be the new norm. That compares unfavorably to gross margins of 44% achieved in 2013. And Grainger will only hit that 38% number if Amazon does something very un-Amazon-like and doesn't start a price war within this business sliver.Last but not least, a eulogy for Toys R Us.After a poor showing for 2017's busy holiday shopping season, the privately held toy company finally decided to call it quits in March 2018. It didn't even bother seeking a buyer that might be looking for a cheap way to scoop up a recognized name, or garner some cheap retailing square footage.Not every observer entirely blames Amazon.com for the demise of Toys R Us. In many regards (and like so many other brick-and-mortar retailers), Toys R Us became sloppy on its own - operationally and fiscally - and never fully realized it until it was too late. Greg Portell, lead partner at retail consultant A.T. Kearney, commented in June, \"If you're going to have that breadth of inventory, you need someone in the store to help you find it, help you experience it. It's hard to sell toys in a cold, warehouse environment.\"If not Amazon, another player would have continued to chip away at the once-iconic toy store chain.Still, the fact that Amazon.com is rumored to be preparing the printing of a traditional holiday toy catalog this year sends a clear message. That message: Amazon isn't stopping now. With the biggest pure-play threat out of the way, it's going to be even easier for the company to go after other toy sellers such as Target and Walmart.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["U.S. auto sales jumped in August helped by higher sales of SUVs, crossovers and pickup trucks. Both  (NYSE:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) reported year-over-year increases. Also, sales of  (NYSE:  ) and  (OTCMKTS:  ) rose in August.The overall jump in auto sales is an indication of a booming economy that follows a rise in consumer confidence, which is near an 18-year high. This indicates that President Donald Trump's protectionist trade policies too haven't dented investor confidence much. Given this scenario, it makes good sense to indulge in stocks gaining from the jump in sales.Major automakers reported a jump in August auto sales. Ford reported a nearly 4.1% rise in auto sales. The company sold 218,504 vehicles in August compared with 209,897 vehicles in the year-ago period. Fiat Chrysler's sales jumped 10%. The automaker reported sales of 193,718 vehicles, driven by high demand for Jeep and Ram.Honda and Nissan also reported an increase in vehicle sales in August. Honda's U.S. sales rose 1.3% in August to 147,903 vehicles, while Nissan's sales jumped 4% to 112,376 vehicles. The U.S. car industry has been suffering for a while. In 2017, auto sales declined 2% after hitting a record high of 17.55 million units in 2016. Moreover, the auto industry has had a roller coaster ride this year too, with automakers reeling under trade war fears. However, the jump in August auto sales is definitely going to bring a smile on the faces of carmakers.All major automakers reported a decline in sales of passenger cars. The rise in August auto sales can be primarily attributed to robust demand for SUVs, crossovers and trucks, which accounted for 68% of new-vehicle retail sales in August, according to J.D. Power. Sales of Ford's SUV brands jumped 20.1%, while pickups grew 5.7% in August. Ford's passenger car sales declined 21.3% in August.Fiat's Ram sales surged 55% in August to 36,798 vehicles, while Jeep sales went up to 87,502 units. At the same time, Fiat's Dodge and Chrysler brands declined 18% and 3%, respectively, over the same time period. Toyota Motor Corporation's (TM) SUV sales jumped 11.7% through August. Understandably, sedans are fast losing their appeal to American customers, which have made automakers like Ford announce that it would gradually stop production of passenger cars in the United States.The jump in August auto sales follows a rise in consumer confidence, which is near an 18-year high. Moreover, higher wages, stable jobs, unemployment level at a 19-year low all pointy all hint at a booming economy. This definitely has given a boost to consumers' confidence, resulting in higher spending.At the same time, trade war fears too don't seem to have affected investors' sentiment much. Moreover, last week United States and Mexico entered into a new agreement to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The new pact will bring a sigh of relief to domestic automakers, which have been reeling under trade war fears, as a number of U.S. automakers have their production units in Mexico.The jump in August auto sales will definitely boost automakers' confidence. A near 18-year-high consumer confidence is an indicator of customers' willingness to spend more. Moreover, higher wages and unemployment level at a 19-year low is sign of a booming economy. Given this scenario, it makes good sense to invest in stocks benefiting from the spike in auto sales.However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.

For 2018, it targets to open 200 stores. During the first six months of the year, the company opened 128 stores. These store openings in new and existing markets will enable O'Reilly to expand its presence in large markets as well as in scarcely populated areas that attract fewer competitions.Last month, this automotive aftermarket parts' specialty retailer reported second-quarter 2018 earnings. The company witnessed a year-over-year increase in revenues and adjusted earnings during the reported quarter. Moreover, both earnings and revenues surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Better weather conditions, along with positive demand in the industry, have aided O'Reilly to drive its financials. | With the expectation of a similar trend to continue, the company anticipates earnings per share of $4.2-$4.3 and comparable store sales of 2-4% in third-quarter 2018. For 2018, it anticipates earnings per share of $15.7-$15.8 compared with $12.67 in the prior year.Moreover, over the past 30 days, the company's stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter and 2018 earnings being revised 0.5% and 0.3% upward, respectively.However, the dependence on weather condition for store sales is a concern for O'Reilly. Bad weather condition discourages customers, majorly DIY customers, from visiting the company stores. Rising SG&A expenses, majorly due to store openings and maintaining the existing ones, will also hamper profit margin for the company.In the past six months, O'Reilly's stock has gained 35.6%, outperforming 27.5% increase recorded by the  it belongs to.O'Reilly currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Some other top-ranked stocks in the auto space are Allison Transmission Holdings, Inc.  , Fox Factory Holdings Corporation  and Honda Motor Co., Ltd.  . Allison Transmission and Fox Factory sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while Honda carries a Zacks Rank of 2. You can see  .Allison Transmission has an expected long-term growth rate of 10%. Shares of the company have risen 24.5% in the past six months.Fox Factory has an expected long-term growth rate of 16.8%. Over the past six months, shares of the company have gained 73.2%.Honda has an expected long-term growth rate of 3%. Over the past year, shares of the company have gained 9.2%.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6% and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

And while the major indices are at or near all-time highs, investors have chosen stocks to buy in a curious way: they've gone on defense.Bank of America recently reported that the top-performing sectors of the past three months have been defensive in nature: consumer staples, utilities, health care, telecommunications and real estate investment trusts (REITs).In other words: Investors aren't putting their full faith into this  . And Wall Street's pros seem to agree with their timidity.Wells Fargo's Christopher Harvey believes the markets are set to get choppy. \"What we're telling clients is, 'Don't light your hair on fire. Start to take down risk prudently, and selectively,'\" he recently told CNBC, adding, \"It's going to be painful, but it will be healthy.\"But where do you go from here? Which stocks provide an attractive investing opportunity, but can also withstand increased volatility and downward pressure? Here we turned to  to source seven stocks to buy that have consensus \"Buy\" ratings from Wall Street's analysts, and that all have a beta of less than 1. Beta is a crucial measure of stock volatility, and a sub-1 reading implies a stock is less volatile than the broader market.Here's a closer look at these seven highly rated stock picks:Market value: $29.5 billionBeta: 0.72TipRanks consensus price target: $159.86 (14% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: \"Strong Buy\" medical device stock Edwards Lifesciences (  , $140.72) specializes in artificial heart valves and hemodynamic monitoring. Shares already are up 24% year-to-date, and top Canaccord Genuity analyst Jason Mills (  ) sees a robust growth runway ahead.\"Buy EW aggressively here\" advises Mills, who sees shares spiking about 26% to $177. He backs up his Buy rating and Street-high price target here:\"The reason we are adamant about adding to positions in EW owes to our belief that the firm will deliver accelerating growth in underlying Transcatheter Valve Therapy (TVT) revenue over at least the next 2 quarters, and quite possibly the next 4 to 6, given myriad catalysts.\" These catalysts include new products, low-risk data and indication expansion through the second half of 2019.Mills believes this will send shares soaring. He writes, \"We think growth acceleration in TVT, which we expect to start in (the second half of 2018), and possibly extend through 2019, will drive both operating leverage and multiple expansion in EW.\"Market value: $22.1 billionBeta: 0.77TipRanks consensus price target: $104.69 (12% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Discount retailer Dollar Tree (  , $93.07) sells items for $1 or less, making this a popular defensive stock pick that should hold up well in unfavorable economic times. Indeed, from the end of 2007 through mid-2009, DLTR shares climbed a whopping 54% versus a 36% loss for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.Fast forward to today, and the outlook for Dollar Tree remains bullish.Out of 10 recent analyst ratings, eight analysts are bullish while only two are staying sidelined.Oppenheimer's Rupesh Parikh (  ) has a \"Buy\" rating on the stock and an upbeat long-term outlook for the company. He cites multiple positive factors, including 1) a compelling market growth opportunity, 2) potential for double-digit EPS growth and 3) an attractive valuation.Meanwhile, top Loop Capital Markets analyst Anthony Chukumba (  ) echoes this analysis. Despite near-term challenges, he remains impressed by management's growth execution \"on both the operational side and on the demand creation front.\" He has a $120 price target on Dollar Tree that implies 29% upside potential.Market value: $281.4 billionBeta: 0.42TipRanks consensus price target: $106.35 (12% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: American retail giant Walmart (  , $94.54) is buzzing right now. Shares surged 9% after the company reported the best sales growth in a decade. \"We look very favorably upon WMT's Q2 results,\" cheers Guggenheim consumer analyst Bob Drbul (  ). This five-star analyst has now ramped up his price target from $100 to $110, implying 16% upside potential.He writes, \"The WMT U.S. comp was the strongest in >10 years, led by grocery (strongest in 9 years), with broad strength continuing through back-to-school.\" Encouragingly, U.S. online sales - a critical category - also rose 40% during the most recent quarter.Drbul concludes, \"We believe the business remains healthy, with inventory in great shape (-3.4% in total), traffic increasing (+2.2%), and e-commerce accelerating (+40% growth).\"Walmart also recently announced a savvy 77% stake in India's Flipkart Group - the country's largest homegrown retailer. The $16 billion deal positions Walmart perfectly to gobble up a slice of India's massive $600 billion retail industry.This, as well as the retailer's low-cost position in the U.S., should protect WMT somewhat should a bear market hit; note that  rose by 5% during the Great Recession.Market value: $33.4 billionBeta: 0.92TipRanks consensus price target: $66.44 (10% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Beverage company Monster Beverage (  , $60.44) owns multiple drink brands including its namesake energy drink, as well as Relentless and Muscle Monster protein shakes.The company recently reported strong Q2 earnings results, including impressive 13.2% volume growth that drove a 12% improvement on the top line. Top Jefferies analyst Kevin Grundy (  ) described the report as \"boringly good.\"Post-earnings, Grundy assigned a bullish $71 price target to the stock (17% upside potential). He also ramped up EPS estimates by 1% and confirmed that Monster remains a \"top large cap growth idea.\"According to Grundy, MNST offers strong sales growth - with impressive international market share gains - and an attractive valuation. Interestingly, he also floats the idea that Coca-Cola (  ) could acquire the remaining 82% of outstanding shares. This would drive the stock toward his \"bull case\" price of $88 - a whopping 46% from current prices.Market value: $101.1 billionBeta: 0.99TipRanks consensus price target: $237.77 (3% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Member-only retail club Costco Wholesale (  , $230.03) is up more than 20% year-to-date. And word on the Street is that there is still a long-growth runway ahead. Ten analysts have published \"Buy\" ratings on the stock in the last three months - no \"Holds\" or \"Sells.\"Five-star RBC Capital analyst Scott Ciccarelli (  ) has just delivered a bullish verdict on Costco's recent earning results. He notes solid e-commerce growth with strong traffic trends (up 4.7% worldwide, and 4.5% in the U.S.). But the best part is that Costco continues to offer a unique investing proposition:\"With what we view as a significant competitive advantage (buying better and working on lower mark-up than almost any other company) and (high-single-digit/low-double-digit) EPS growth, we continue to believe that COST provides investors with scarcity value that simply can't be found in many other places in the market.\"Even amid competition from rivals Amazon.com (  ) and Walmart, comps continue to exceed estimates and e-commerce growth continues to grind higher. Ciccarelli, who has a $246 price target on the stock (7% upside potential), sums up: \"Continued in-store traffic growth coupled with a burgeoning e-commerce channel, makes Costco one of the best stories in Hardline/Broadline Retail. Remain buyers.\"Market value: $124.8 billionBeta: 0.65TipRanks consensus price target: $183.27 (14% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: McDonald's (  , $160.48) managed to stay afloat during the Great Recession when many other companies sank. Shares stayed flat (up by 0.03%) while the rest of the world crashed. Could this be because McDonald's is a \"premium consumer staples company\"?That's how RBC Capital's David Palmer (  ) describes McDonald's in a note reiterating his \"Buy\" rating on MCD with a $175 price target.This five-star analyst believes McDonald's is on the right track as it focuses on upgrading its asset base, improving food quality, improving digital/delivery convenience, and establishing compelling value messages.More specifically, he expects the U.S. business to improve over the next 12 to 18 months thanks to such factors as increased effectiveness of digital and loyalty initiatives and a refocus on past sales drivers (e.g. chicken and breakfast).\"These initiatives should result in 105%+ free cash flow conversion, high-single-digit EPS growth, and low-double-digit total shareholder return over the long term,\" Palmer writes.Market value: $26.6 billionBeta: 0.95TipRanks consensus price target: $337.11 (2% upside potential)TipRanks consensus rating: Last but not least, we have O'Reilly Automotive (  , $330.08), one of the world's leading auto parts retailers with more than 4,000 stores. And this company has held up well in rough times, with shares climbing 14% during 2007-09.Not that ORLY is a slouch when times are good - the stock is up 37% year-to-date.Earlier this month, five-star Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel (  ) significantly boosted his ORLY price target from $305 to $360. \"For a long while, we have highlighted Outperform-rated O'Reilly Auto (ORLY) as the best-run and most optimally-positioned chain amongst leading auto parts retailers,\" Nagel wrote.O'Reilly is set to outperform going forward, too. Nagel writes, \"As we look forward, we are encouraged that ORLY remains well positioned to capitalize on a solid sector backdrop and market share opportunities coming as a result of ongoing struggles at leading competitors.\"Harriet Lefton is head of content at TipRanks, a comprehensive investing tool that tracks more than 4,700 Wall Street analysts as well as hedge funds and insiders.

Shares have been on the move with the stock up 6.7% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $335.98 in the previous session. O'Reilly Automotive has gained 37% since the start of the year compared to the 19.6% move for the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the 27.6% return for the Zacks Automotive - Retail and Wholesale - Parts industry.The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on July 25, 2018, O'Reilly Automotive reported EPS of $4.28 versus consensus estimate of $4.04 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 1.08%.For the current fiscal year, O'Reilly Automotive is expected to post earnings of $15.9 per share on $9.56 billion in revenues. This represents a 34.29% change in EPS on a 6.46% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $17.71 per share on $10.06 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 11.39% and 5.29%, respectively.O'Reilly Automotive may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.O'Reilly Automotive has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and D, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 20.7X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 21.6X versus its peer group's average of 16.2X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.32. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, O'Reilly Automotive currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if O'Reilly Automotive passes the test. Thus, it seems as though O'Reilly Automotive shares could have a bit more room to run in the near term.Shares of O'Reilly Automotive have been moving higher, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including Advance Auto Parts (AAP), AutoZone (AZO), and IAC/InterActiveCorp (IAC), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 4% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for O'Reilly Automotive, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

However, they can also lead on the downside when the growth story is over, so it is important to find companies which are still seeing strong growth prospects in their businesses.One such company that might be well-positioned for future earnings growth is  . This firm, which is in the Automotive - Retail and Wholesale - Parts industry, saw EPS growth of 10.3% last year, and is looking great for this year too.In fact, the current growth estimate for this year calls for earnings-per-share growth of 34.3%. Furthermore, the long-term growth rate is currently an impressive 15.7%, suggesting pretty good prospects for the long haul.And if this wasn't enough, the stock has actually seen estimates rise over the past month for the current fiscal year by about 2.2%.

It has amassed assets over $293.51 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Growth segment of the US equity market.With market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion, mid cap companies usually contain higher growth prospects than large cap companies, and are considered less risky than their small cap counterparts. These types of companies, then, have a good balance of stability and growth potential.Growth stocks have higher than average sales and earnings growth rates. While these are expected to grow faster than the broader market, they also have higher valuations. Also, growth stocks are a type of equity that carries more risk compared to others. Compared to value stocks, growth stocks are a safer bet in a strong bull market, but don't perform as strongly in almost all other financial environments.Since cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.30%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 0.40%.Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 29.60% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Industrials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Align Technology Inc (ALGN) accounts for about 1.37% of total assets, followed by Oreilly Automotive Inc (ORLY) and Rockwell Automation Inc (ROK).The top 10 holdings account for about 11.42% of total assets under management.JKH seeks to match the performance of the Morningstar Mid Growth Index before fees and expenses.

The Morningstar index methodology defines mid-capitalization stocks as those stocks that form the 20% of market capitalization between the 70th and 90th percentile of the market capitalization of the stocks eligible to be included in the Morningstar US Market Index.The ETF return is roughly 11.68% so far this year and was up about 25.00% in the last one year (as of 08/14/2018). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $181.10 and $228.65.The ETF has a beta of 0.98 and standard deviation of 14.38% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 201 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.IShares Morningstar Mid-Cap Growth ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, JKH is an outstanding option for investors seeking exposure to the Mid Cap ETFs segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.The iShares S&P Mid-Cap 400 Growth ETF (IJK) and the iShares Russell Mid-Cap Growth ETF (IWP) track a similar index.

Shares have been on the move with the stock up 7.8% over the past month. NSIT hit a new 52-week high of $54.67 in the previous session. Insight Enterprises has gained 41.1% since the start of the year compared to the 15.7% move for the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector and the 32.5% return for the Zacks Retail - Mail Order industry.The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on August 1, 2018, Insight Enterprises reported EPS of $1.45 versus consensus estimate of $1.26.For the current fiscal year, Insight Enterprises is expected to post earnings of $4.54 per share on $7.33 billion in revenues. This represents a 40.12% change in EPS on a 9.37% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $4.84 per share on $7.59 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 6.54% and 3.53%, respectively.Insight Enterprises may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for NSIT? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Insight Enterprises has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and F, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 11.9X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 12.1X versus its peer group's average of 12.1X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.We also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Insight Enterprises currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Insight Enterprises fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though NSIT shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.Shares of Insight Enterprises have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including Restoration Hardware Holdings (RH), IAC/InterActiveCorp (IAC), and O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 7% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for NSIT, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

It is called U.S.-Mexico trade pact and will rewrite NAFTA, which also includes Canada. The announcement lifted the broader markets that have for quite some time been weighed down by trade conflicts.U.S. auto and parts makers, in particular, recorded even bigger gains as the deal gave American plants an upper hand over Mexican facilities, where workers earn far less. Railroads also gained as the trade deal eases the risks of big tariffs, thus, offering smooth cross-border transportation services. Given the positives, investing in solid domestic automakers and railroad companies seems judicious.The United States and Mexico reached a deal to change parts of the NAFTA, the trade agreement that Trump finds unreasonable. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said that the deal requires 75% of parts in a car traded in North America to be sourced from the United States or Mexico. This is higher than the current 62.5% of the parts needed to be produced in the United States, Mexico or Canada.The deal also requires around 40% to 45% of parts in cars sold to be manufactured by workers earning at least $16 UDS an hour. The agreement is intended to last nearly 16 years and will be reviewed every six years.The deal however raises concerns about whether Canada, the third country in NAFTA, will agree to the amendments. Nonetheless, Lighthizer said that the pact was \"absolutely terrific\" and would surely modernize a trade agreement that had \"gotten seriously out of whack.\" He remained optimistic that the Congress would approve the deal with broad bipartisan support.Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland added that \"progress between Mexico and the United States is a necessary requirement for any renewed NAFTA agreement\" and that \"Canada is encouraged by the continued optimism shown by negotiating partners.\"Investors seem to be shouting approval for the new trade deal. After all, the Trump administration had imposed series of tariffs and other protectionist measures against several of its key trading partners, raising concerns about a global trade war, which in turn may derail economic growth and squeeze corporate profits.Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at an all-time high for a second straight session on Aug 27, with the Nasdaq trading above the coveted 8,000 mark. This marked the second 1,000 point advance for the tech-laden index this year, something that has not happened since 1999. The Dow also exited its correction phase for the first time in more than six months, finishing its longest correction period since the 223-session run in 1961, per Dow Jones Market Data.Shares of U.S. auto and parts manufacturers surged the most on news that the United States and Mexico have reached a tentative deal to update the 25-year old NAFTA.  (NYSE:  ) shot up almost 5% and Ford Motor Company  jumped more than 3%. Both these stocks are now rebounding from a two-month downtrend.But, what led to the rally in domestic auto shares? This was largely backed by the deal's allowance of import tariffs on cars, trucks and their parts if manufacturers do not get bulk of their content from the NAFTA region, or use a significant number of workers who earn handsomely. The latter provision, in fact, will further compel car makers to push for more of their production into the United States from the lower wage Mexican plants.Top rail stocks also scaled higher on the trade agreement as it eased the effects of big tariffs on Mexico that could disrupt supply chains and rail shipments all through North America.Shares of  (NYSE:  ) climbed 4.7% to end at 119.04 and successfully broke out of a flat base with a 115.01 entry point earlier this month. Rail giant Union Pacific Corporation () increased 1.8% to 152.78 and broke out of a flat base last month with a 148.43 entry point.  (NYSE:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) also rallied on the deal news, up 1.7% and 2%, respectively.Banking on such positives, investing in the stocks from the mentioned sectors seems prudent.

(Symbol: ORLY) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $292.33, changing hands for $299.23/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 12 different analyst targets contributing to that average for O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $240.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $330.00. The standard deviation is $26.345.But the whole reason to look at the  ORLY price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with ORLY crossing above that average target price of $292.33/share, investors in ORLY have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $292.33 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

The stock has advanced 34.4% compared with the industry's increase of 25% during the period.Let's see, how things are shaping up for this announcement. | Our proven model shows that O'Reilly Automotive is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

Additionally, O'Reilly raised the share repurchase authorization amount by an additional $1 billion to $10.75 billion.For the soon-to-be-released quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales per weighted-average store stands at $470,000, up from the actual figure of $450,000 in first-quarter 2018.However, O'Reilly Automotive's strategy to lower time-to-market for its products to meet the demand in professional installer marketplaces has resulted in logistical disadvantage compared with its competitors. Also, the company is experiencing continuous rise in SG&A expenses, majorly due to new store openings and maintaining the old ones, which might hurt margins.Here are a few other stocks worth considering from the same space, with the right combination of elements to outpace earnings estimates this time around:LKQ Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +2.43% and a Zacks Rank #1. Its second-quarter 2018 results are expected to be released on Jul 26.You can see  .Visteon Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +2.86% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company's second-quarter 2018 financial results are scheduled to be released on Jul 26.Oshkosh Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +2.85% and has a Zacks Rank of 2. The company is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jul 31.Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

(Symbol: ORLY) stock, but cautious about paying the going market price of $285.39/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2020 put at the $210 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $10.20. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 4.9% return against the $210 commitment, or a 3% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to ORLY's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $210 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. sees its shares fall 26.6% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $199.80 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $10.20 from $210), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $210 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2020 put at the $210 strike for the 3% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $285.39) to be 37%.

This will help it to penetrate in existing markets and expand in new and contiguous ones. In 2017, O'Reilly opened 198 new stores while planning to open 200 more outlets in 2018.Further, the company boasts a competitive edge due to the dual-market strategy by serving both Do-it-Yourself (DIY) and Do-it-for-Me (DIFM) customers. Its dual-market stores allow to expanding into large markets by offering professional knowledge for DIFM customers, including commercial service providers. It also caters to the scarcely populated areas that attract less competition by its well-known portfolio brands. | In fourth-quarter 2017, O'Reilly witnessed 4% year-over-year rise in sales to $2.19 billion and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, the adjusted earnings were $2.9 per share, beating the same. The bottom line was $2.59 in the prior-year quarter.The company anticipates earnings per share of $3.55-$3.65 for first-quarter 2018, which is expected to release on Apr 25, while the figure for full-year 2018 is expected to be $15.1-$15.2 compared with $12.67 in 2017.The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly and annual earnings being revised 0.3% downward and 1% upward, respectively, over the last 60 days.However, continuous rise in expenses, due to the payment of incentive compensation, professional service fees and additional capital expenditure, are hurting O'Reilly's profit margins. Also, much of its cash is locked in inventories, hampering a significant part of current assets that can affect the short-term liquidity of the company in periods of low sales.Moreover, the company's presence only in the United States, majorly in Texas and California, makes its business sensitive to the economic and weather conditions of these regions. Bad weather condition discourages customers, majorly DIY customers, from visiting company stores.In the last three months, shares of O'Reilly have outperformed the  it belongs to. During the period, its stock has edged down 10.6% in comparison with the industry's decline of 12.9%.O'Reilly carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the auto space are BMW AG  , Tenneco Inc.  and Standard Motor Products, Inc.  , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see BMW has expected long-term growth rate of 4.5%. In the last three months, shares of the company have risen 1.6%.Tenneco has expected long-term growth rate of 13.5%.

The level served as solid resistance for AutoZone stock from late 2015 through early 2017.Then, a little over a year ago, fears of  (NASDAQ:  ) sent auto parts retailers plunging. AutoZone stock briefly dipped below $500, rallied again to that $800 level, and as of this writing, has pulled back ~23% to the $610+ range.It's been a dizzying move, even by the standards of a retail space that has seen huge swings in sentiment over that time. And it leaves AutoZone stock in an interesting spot. AZO trades at less than 11x FY19 consensus estimates. It's notably cheaper than rivals  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) on an earnings basis. And while some AZO bears have pointed to  , AutoZone's leverage isn't notably different from those two peers.If an investor believes the Amazon fears are overblown, AZO looks like the right play. But that's a big 'if'.The auto parts industry has slowed a bit of late in terms of same-store sales. That said, the news here still is much better than in many pockets of retail. AutoZone posted same-store sales growth of 2.2% in its fiscal second quarter, after  . Both figures represent a solid acceleration from the 0.5% figure seen in full-year fiscal 2017 - and both at least are solidly positive, unlike those of many retailers in apparel and other areas.Still, the performance of late isn't as good as it was. And the question is why that is. Are AutoZone and its rivals losing sales to Amazon, or direct offerings from companies like  (NYSE:  )? Or are other factors at play?There's a strong case that the problem of late is cyclical - not permanent. New car sales  . That's a headwind for auto parts retailers, as new cars generally require less service - and fewer parts - than older models. Weather has been relatively good, particularly the last couple of winters, limiting maintenance needs. The bull case for the auto parts sector simply is that the industry is having a couple of bad years, driven largely by one-time factors.And those factors should reverse. The U.S. just experienced a much more difficult winter. New car sales are declining, if modestly, which raises the average age of cars on the road and suggests more demand going forward. The weakness in the industry, whether it's AZO's declining comps or the back-to-back negative prints posted by Advance Auto Parts, should turn into strength at some point. And that in turn suggests a potential rebound for the industry.Again, there's a strong argument for the bull case. But, personally, I'm not quite convinced enough to take a flyer on AZO stock just yet. Amazon may not be a threat right now - but it very well could become one. The retailers argue that it will take the online giant years to manage the same relationships auto parts retailers currently have with suppliers - which might be true. But Amazon has been able to manage similar negotiations across a range of industries.More broadly, the pressure on retail of late isn't just about Amazon. It's about the fact that e-commerce generally dampens margins and hits pricing. The ability to know everyone's price at every time leads to higher promotions and lower pricing. The auto parts space may be more protected than most - but there's likely to be some pressure in the mid-term from the changing state of retail. Longer-term, self-driving and electric cars could add further demand pressure as their adoption increases.That said, it's possible that I'm too pessimistic. And if that's the case, AutoZone stock does look like the right pick. Again, it's cheaper than rivals, with a forward P/E of 11x against 15x for struggling AAP and 17x for ORLY. As for debt, AZO stock doesn't really stand out.Adjusted debt (which adds capital leases and rent) to EBITDAR (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and rent) figures aren't much different. As of February 10, AZO's multiple stands at 2.5x. As of year-end 2017, ORLY was at 2.1x, and AAP 2.9x.AZO stock also has had the worst performance so far this year, dropping 9% while its rivals have gained. (AAP actually has jumped 19%, thanks to  .)So if investors see the auto parts sector as worth investing in, AutoZone stock undoubtedly is the play. I'm not quite convinced myself. But a cheaper AZO stock price and/or better news could change that in a hurry. And I wouldn't be at all surprised if AZO challenges that $800 mark once again in the not-too-distant future.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ig 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (  ) will begin trading ex-dividend on March 08, 2018.

For the PowerShares S&P 500 BuyWrite Portfolio ETF (Symbol: PBP), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $23.86 per unit.With PBP trading at a recent price near $21.58 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.56% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of PBP's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (Symbol: ORLY), Cerner Corp. (Symbol: CERN), and Franklin Resources, Inc. (Symbol: BEN). Although ORLY has traded at a recent price of $249.14/share, the average analyst target is 16.54% higher at $290.36/share. Similarly, CERN has 16.15% upside from the recent share price of $62.04 if the average analyst target price of $72.06/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting BEN to reach a target price of $44.22/share, which is 13.80% above the recent price of $38.86. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of ORLY, CERN, and BEN:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:\n  \nAre analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past. These are questions that require further investor research.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["nvestors considering a purchase of O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (Symbol: ORLY) shares, but cautious about paying the going market price of $250.37/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2020 put at the $175 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $11.00. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 6.3% return against the $175 commitment, or a 3.4% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to ORLY's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $175 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. sees its shares fall 30.1% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $164.00 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $11.00 from $175), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.4% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $175 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2020 put at the $175 strike for the 3.4% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $250.37) to be 34%. For other put options contract ideas at the various different available expirations, visit the  page of StockOptionsChannel.com.In mid-afternoon trading on Wednesday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 1.35M contracts, with call volume at 1.35M, for a put:call ratio of 0.73 so far for the day, which is above normal compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65. In other words, if we look at the number of call buyers and then use the long-term median to project the number of put buyers we'd expect to see, we're actually seeing more put buyers than expected out there in  so far today.  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ffice Depot, Inc.

In fact, this buyout is likely to result in a bigger brand with increased scale and a robust development pipeline in the long run.Yet, lingering political uncertainties in key international markets and currency headwinds might continue to limit revenue growth. Moreover, integration risks linked to Starwood purchase is an added concern.

Autozone stock closed at $654.47 on Tuesday.The company  , on revenues of $2.413 million. Analysts had been expecting earnings of $8.81 per share and  .The result helped send the whole auto parts retailing category down on the day.  (NASDAQ:  ) was down 6.4%.  (NYSE:  ) fell 4.4%.  (NYSE:  ) was down 2.4%.AutoZone revenues of $2.41 billion, however, beat estimates, and were up 5.4% year over year. Same store sales were up 2.2%, as the company opened 40 new stores and closed just one. AutoZone currently has 6,088 stores, 5,514 of them in the U.S. and the rest in Mexico and Brazil.Along with earnings, the company announced it was selling its Interamerican Motor Corp., a distributor of parts for imported cars, to  called  , and dumping  , an online parts retailer it bought in 2013,  a private equity firm.Some analysts were taking the action as a reason to buy Autozone stock. One cited technical reasons,  Another called for investors to  .AutoZone opened trading Feb. 28 at $658.40 per share, a price to earnings multiple of about 15, and a market cap of approximately $18 billion, less than twice its 2017 sales of $10.88 billion. The latest results indicate a pace of $10 billion in sales, but auto parts sell best in the spring and summer, with last year's August quarter bringing in $3.5 billion of revenue.Auto parts are an unusually profitable area of the retail sector. AutoZone's operating margins are near 20%, its profit margins over 10%, while retailers in other areas have trouble maintaining margins of 3%.Auto parts sales are also rising steadily, while other goods, like sporting goods and clothing, continue to fall and many stores go bankrupt. The fact that auto parts are often returned, and many buyers need help in understanding the inventory, also helps keep out online competitors such as  and may have led to the sale of AutoAnything.With the sale of InterAmerican and AutoAnything, neither of which had been with AutoZone for more than five years, the company is going back to its original strategy of blanketing the country with small retail outlets, many in out-parcels of strip malls. The seasonality of results should continue, with the summer months, \"shade tree mechanic\" season, standing in for Christmas.Autozone stock has been managed for steady growth, with the stock price maintained through stock repurchases. This continues, as the company spent $174.9 million during the quarter buying back 227,000 shares at $769 each. The fact that shares are now $100 below that figure would seem to be a near-term opportunity, especially as sales are bound to increase as the weather warms.For longer-term investors, however, the view should be more cautious.As more cars become electric, the number of parts they have goes down. As more cars become computerized, the ability of amateurs or even small shops to repair them goes down. Both these trends bode ill for the sector.Where the turn comes is unknown, but it's hard to see this sector growing as it has been for another decade. Unless Autozone starts distributing its profits in the form of dividends, it's hard for me to see any long-term future in it.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["One of the types of investments that I love is what I call \"infrastructure plays.\" I don't necessarily mean massive things like pipes and concrete, but instead the companies that handle things that other companies need. In the case of cars, it's auto parts stores like  (NYSE:  ).All machines break down and need maintenance. All machines need parts replaced. There are 268 million cars on the road in the U.S., and when we multiple that by the number of parts in those cars, you can see why this is big business.Also, auto parts stocks like Advance Auto Parts stock benefit no matter what the economy is like. If the economy tanks and people stop buying new cars, they shift to used cars. That's great because used cars need parts more often than new cars.AAP stock and its peers also benefit from lousy weather, especially cold and snow. The worse it is, the more pounding cars will take and the faster they need parts.Independent parts stores like Advance Auto Parts also provide a way for both consumer and commercial customers to get parts without going to the dealer or manufacturer for an expensive OEM part.However, it's tricky to value Advance Auto Parts stock and its peers because auto parts is an extremely competitive industry. Same-store comps and revenues will fluctuate based on who gets the upper hand in market share. So there isn't a straight-line growth chart you can expect from any of them.Advance Auto Parts stock has also floundered because it had trouble digesting a $2-billion acquisition of another parts chain in 2014. But things seem to be turning around.Comps fell 2.6%, which is not good at all. That triggered declines across the board. Q4 revenues were down 2.2%, gross margin fell to 42.9% down 69 bps, adjusted operating income fell 45 bps, and operating income fell to $87 million down 82 bps. However, operating cash flow rose 15% to $601 million for the full year, and free cash flow was $411 million, up from $264 million.Net income came in at $185 million for the quarter and $475 million for the year.Basically, AAP managed to optimize its working capital and cut expenses.2018 guidance suggests net income should come in a bit higher amid higher operating margins and improved same-store comps. With $547 million in cash and $1.04 billion in debt, Advance Auto Parts is in fairly solid condition.So with an $8.4-billion market cap, Advance Auto Parts stock trades at about 17.5x earnings, a bit under  (NASDAQ:  ) which trades at 19x. However, AAP stock trades at 40% below its all-time high, while ORLY stock trades at 20% off.I think AAP has a ways to go, but as opposed to many other companies in turnarounds that I don't care for because they are in tons of trouble, AAP has a real shot. There's a lot to like here, and while Advance Auto Parts stock feels a bit pricey, I think very patient long-term investors will see upside if they buy in here.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" reported adjusted earnings of $2.9 per share in fourth-quarter 2017, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.78.

(  ) fell 10%, and  (  ) tanked 41%.But while the eight-stock group collectively fell 34% in the first half of the year, it turned up sharply in July - just after major automakers reported a  .Those declines signaled that new car sales had peaked in 2016. They also signaled the average age of cars on the road was likely to increase more rapidly - traditionally a positive factor for auto parts retailers.Stock prices for auto parts chains reversed in July and collectively rallied 35% through the end of the year. In 2018, they climbed another 13% to the start of the market's January 29 pullback.As a result, and even after the market slipped into its correction, auto parts retailers held one of the 15 strongest gains among the  , in the six months through Thursday. Now analysts say the group, which investors often turn to as a defensive play in difficult markets, could be set for a continued rebound as industry headwinds abate.A severe winter across the U.S., after two warm ones in a row, is good news for these banged-up companies. Snowy, icy conditions are hard on cars, battering undercarriages, corroding parts and killing batteries, which drives up demand for replacement parts. Harsh winters also spur demand for windshield wipers and washer fluid, antifreeze and other regular replacement items.O'Reilly Automotive CEO Greg Henslee spoke during the company's Feb. 7 fourth-quarter earnings beat of healthy demand so far in 2018 \"driven by favorable winter weather conditions.\"Moreover, the number of cars in their \"sweet spot\" - six to 11 years old, when they're off warranty and in need of maintenance - is seen falling at a much slower rate over the next two years than it did in the past three. That points to a potential pickup in sales across the industry, according to Morgan Stanley.In addition, over the next two quarters, auto parts companies face the easiest comparisons in same-store sales since 2013.\"We see a recovery in the auto parts segment in 2018, and are constructive on the group\" as a result of this favorable setup, Morgan Stanley's Simeon Gutman wrote in a Jan. 17 note to clients.Shares of O'Reilly Automotive came through the recent pullback up 3.8% from Dec. 29 through Thursday. AutoZone was up 1.8%, while Advance Auto Parts showed an 8.4% gain. The S&P 500, by comparison, had gained 1.5%.Auto-parts providers ranked No. 18, as of Thursday, out of 197 industry groups tracked by IBD.In days of old, auto parts companies mainly lured the DIY - do-it-yourself - tinkerer. Professional mechanics and repair shops ordered their parts through dealership parts desks.But the retail chains have been gradually gaining more of the commercial or wholesale market, what the retailers now label the DIFM (do-it-for-me), market. At $74 billion, DIFM outweighs the DIY markets and is growing faster, though it was hard hit by the industry slowdown in 2017 and carries lower margins, experts say.AutoZone is No. 1 in the number of stores with roughly 5,465 locations across the nation. But O'Reilly Automotive sports the fastest growing earnings, with a five-year annualized EPS growth rate of 21%. AutoZone has a 13% corresponding rate, Advance Auto Parts 5%, and  (  ) 2%.Morningstar analyst Zain Akbari says O'Reilly Automotive boasts the most fully realized dual-market approach. The DIFM market represents about 42% of sales for O'Reilly Automotive vs. 20% for AutoZone.AutoZone is No. 1 in the $57 billion DIY market and is striving to grow its DIFM business. Advance Auto Part's commercial sales grew following its purchase of General Parts in 2014, but disruptions from the integration have weighed on its results.Genuine Parts is the group's sales king with roughly $15.3 billion in 2016 revenue. However, only 53% of its net sales were from auto parts, the rest was from industrial, electrical and office products.In auto part retailing, a price edge is hard to come by. So customer service, in areas such as convenient locations, diagnostics and knowledgeable staff, is a big differentiator. It is also critical that vehicle parts be readily and reliably available, especially for commercial customers.This puts large companies like O'Reilly Automotive, AutoZone, Advance Auto Parts and Genuine Parts at an advantage, Akbari says. They are able to spread out service and inventory costs over a larger sales base and negotiate lower prices to acquire products. They can stock slow-moving products at distribution centers and hubs, and quickly deliver to local stores as the need arises.On Feb. 7, O'Reilly Automotive announced record revenue and earnings for full-year 2017. Sales grew 4% to $8.98 billion. Net income rose 9% to $1.13 billion.\"As we head into 2018, we believe the long-term demand drivers for our industry remain intact, including steady improvements in miles driven and a growing and aging vehicle fleet,\" chief executive Greg Henslee said that day, which also brought news of a CEO change to come in May. The Missouri-based retailer expects to open 200 new stores this year and to increase same-store sales 2% to 4% year over year.O'Reilly Automotive should \"keep grinding higher\" on same-store and EPS growth, Morgan Stanley's Gutman said. But his top pick in this group is the under-earning Advance Auto Parts.\"AAP is fundamentally changing the way it does business both at the back end (supply chain) and at the front end via the customer,\" he wrote in December, saying the company is on the road to recovery under new management. Those changes include a tiered distribution model, including more e-commerce delivery options, use of telematics on fleets to improve order-to-delivery time, and a new business-to-business platform.Meanwhile, Genuine Parts' NAPA brand helps to make it a sales force. It sells NAPA-labeled automotive products such as filters and batteries, while a sprawling network of independently owned stores operate under the brand name.The company's long-standing, independent-driven business model contrasts with Advance Auto Parts' preference to own its stores, Akbari said.Advanced Auto plans to report its Q4 results on Feb. 21. AutoZone's results are scheduled for release Feb. 26.Other companies in the auto-parts industry group focus on different end markets.  (  ) consolidated the auto salvage trade, and now dominates the market for salvage replacement parts to body shops and mechanics.  (CPRT), the group's fastest running stock over the past year, auctions vehicles coming off lease, being repossessed or being sold on a salvage basis by insurers, or for dealerships who are managing their inventories.Advance Auto declined an IBD interview request, citing schedule conflicts and the upcoming Feb. 21 earnings report. O'Reilly Automotive and AutoZone did not respond to interview requests.Auto parts companies, like other retailers, face massive disruption from the influence of the internet. Last year, reports of entry by  (AMZN) to the industry  in the stocks.The Amazon threat may be overblown, analysts say. The size of these retailers and their clout with suppliers mean even Amazon might struggle to scale up, particularly in the DIFM market, Gutman said. Plus, their high levels of in-store service are difficult to replicate, helping to insulate them from digital-only competitors, Akbari noted.Regardless of Amazon, these retailers have growing e-commerce stakes. AutoZone describes digital integration as a growth priority. Advance Auto Parts enhanced its website to drive traffic.Gutman on Jan. 17 raised his price targets for several retailers, including Advance Auto Parts from 120 to 130, AutoZone from 700 to 800, and O'Reilly Automotive from 210 to 290. These companies are some of the biggest beneficiaries of the newly enacted corporate tax reform, though the benefits seem fully priced in for many, he said.An improving economy, increasing consumer confidence and solid wage growth also create tailwinds for the broad sector. But for auto parts retail, the No. 1 driver of growth is starting to look shaky.Total miles driven crossed 3.2 trillion in 2016, up 30% from 1996, according to O'Reilly. Growth in annual miles driven was flat from 2008 to 2013 but then resumed along with an improving job market and falling gas prices. The lack of a comprehensive mass transit system in the U.S. results in sustainable commuter miles driven, O'Reilly says. But growth in miles driven has moderated over the last two years, according to Morgan Stanley. Growth slowed from more than 3% in 2015 to under 2% in 2017 through October. And gas prices are on the rise again, which could crimp vehicle usage and dent demand for auto parts.The average age of vehicles - another key metric - hit a record 11.6 years in 2016. That's both good and bad for auto parts companies. An aging vehicle fleet means more upkeep and repairs. Yet vehicles are lasting longer as vehicle quality improves, and that is seen gradually depressing demand for aftermarket auto parts.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photoIn early trading on Thursday, shares of Fiserv (  ) topped the list of the day's best performing components of the Nasdaq 100 index, trading up 6.3%.

After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings - with the most up-to-date information possible - is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ORLY in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $2.79 per share for ORLY, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.78 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ORLY, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.50% heading into earnings season. | A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that ORLY has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 15 different analyst targets contributing to that average for O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $210.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $310.00. The standard deviation is $33.978.But the whole reason to look at the  ORLY price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with ORLY crossing above that average target price of $259.33/share, investors in ORLY have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $259.33 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

Further, in 2018, it has plans to open up 200 more outlets.The company also has a strong distribution network. O'Reilly Automotive's dual-market stores are more dynamic and provide the company with a scope to operate in smaller markets and cater to a larger customer base.However, high fixed costs, increasing wage rates and growing investments have induced an expenditure rise for the company.

Over the past three weeks, the stock's 50-day moving average has pushed back above the 200-day - and at present the 100-day is also getting close to crossing back above the 200-day.From a momentum perspective, the RSI trend indicator at the bottom of the chart continues to slope higher.As more investors wake up to the possible fact that O'Reilly Automotive is not going out of business anytime soon and could even seen both margin and top line growth, ORLY stock could gain further upside momentum and climb toward $300 and ultimately even toward $350.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["dvance Auto Parts Inc (  ) will begin trading ex-dividend on December 21, 2017.

(Symbol: ORLY) stock, but tentative about paying the going market price of $241.82/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2020 put at the $180 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $12.70. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 7.1% return against the $180 commitment, or a 3.4% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to ORLY's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $180 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. sees its shares fall 25.7% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $167.30 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $12.70 from $180), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.4% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $180 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2020 put at the $180 strike for the 3.4% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (considering the last 253 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $241.82) to be 33%.

While the  rose nearly 20%, the best-performing stock,  (NYSE: GPC) declined slightly; the most highly regarded stocks in the industry,  (NASDAQ: ORLY) and  (NYSE: AZO) declined around 14% and 10% respectively -- and  (NYSE: AAP) fell a whopping 41%.That said, it ain't all over until the fat lady stops needing to repair her car. There's reason to believe that better days are ahead for the sector, with or without competition from  (NASDAQ: AMZN) . Let's take a closer look at a sector set for a comeback in 2018.Image source: Getty Images.The industry is essentially in agreement on the causes of the slowdown in sales growth in 2017. According to Advance Auto Parts CEO Tom Greco, three key factors impacted the industry last year:The negativity around these issues has helped cause a sell-off in the sector, resulting in the stocks trading at a discount to ratings in recent years: data by  .There is little the industry can do about unfavorable weather conditions -- something that O'Reilly Automotive's CEO Greg Henslee calls the \"single most significant factor that drives variability in our business.\" But a combination of Trump's tax bill, improving economic growth, a  , and moderating growth in gas prices should lead to relative improvement in miles driven.However, the issue of car demographics is arguably the most interesting bullish point for the future of the industry.The following chart helps explain the underlying demographics. On the positive side, the average age of a car in the U.S. keeps creeping up -- this should be good news for auto-parts retailers.However, it's the demographic mix that really matters. In general, a car less than five years old requires little maintenance, while a car five to ten years old hits the sweet spot of the Do-It-For-Me (DIFM) market, and a car more than ten years old is in the sweet spot of the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) market. I'll return to this important distinction shortly.Data source: Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Chart by author. Car sales are in thousands and on left-hand scale. Age of automobiles is in years and on right-hand scale.Note that the slowdown in new car sales in 2008-2009 was eight years ago, suggesting that the DIFM market (which all four have exposure to, though to differing degrees) is facing some near-term weakness because of a dearth of cars in the sweet spot of five to 10 years of age. But here's the thing. The strong increases in car sales in 2010 should lead to \"meaningful improvement for industry growth in the future,\" according to Greco.The chart below shows how badly the industry is being impacted by this confluence of factors. Given that the sweet spot of DIFM sales is five to 10 years, it's reasonable to expect the more DIFM-focused retailers like Genuine Parts Company's (GPC) automotive group (which has around 70% to 75% of its sales in the DIFM market) to suffer more, relatively, than the DIY-focused retailers like AutoZone (around 80% of sales to DIY).Data sources: Company presentations. Chart by author. AutoZone's sales are adjusted to the nearest quarter.Indeed, as you can see above, GPC's automotive group has seen weak sales growth for some time, while AutoZone has performed relatively better. You can think of O'Reilly Automotive (58% DIY) and Advance Auto Parts (more than 50% DIFM) as having relatively balanced DIFM/DIY sales. The latter's sales growth has also been severely challenged by ongoing transformation, as management is still integrating its 2014 acquisition of General Parts International (Carquest and WorldPac) -- a process that has taken far longer than management expected.Despite acquisitions and DIFM/DIY sales mixes, all four companies have seen conditions deteriorate.If this wasn't bad enough, the deterioration was accompanied by  in the auto-parts space. It's easy to conclude that Amazon's moves are causing part of the slowdown in the industry. Moreover, the end-market difficulties will be masking any underlying improvements in Advance Auto Parts' turnaround strategy.While it's never a good idea to write off the impact of Amazon entering a market, the reality is that many DIY customers require in-store service and staff support in order to repair their cars. Meanwhile, DIFM purchases are typically time-sensitive, and it will be very difficult for Amazon to replicate the inventory management and supply-chain logistics necessary to compete with established retailers, in terms of delivering critical parts at short notice to customers.There's no reason that the calendar year should mark an immediate turnaround in sales for all four companies, but it may mark an improvement in investor sentiment toward the sector. The long-term outlook remains positive for the industry, and the Amazon impact is probably overstated.Nevertheless, if you are worried about Amazon, then it makes sense to avoid AutoZone, as DIY sales are seen as more at risk and DIFM sales are growing faster than DIY -- partly due to the increasing complexity of cars. Advance Auto Parts has the added complication of successfully executing on its integration plans; this is fine if you want it, but it's not entirely reflective of the investment theme discussed.All of this leaves Genuine Parts Company and O'Reilly Automotive as the best ways to play this theme. The auto-parts retailers aren't dead yet, and 2018 could mark a recovery in their stock prices.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is on pace to end the year up 17%-18%, not just defying expectations, but decisively knocking down early assumptions from several professional market handicappers that a Donald Trump presidency would torpedo stocks.However, not all equities hitched a ride on board the bullish train. Some of the market's most beloved blue-chip stocks have suspiciously moved against the grain, dishing out losses most shareholders weren't expecting, broad up-year or not.Here's a deeper look at what went wrong for 10 key companies in 2017, and to what extent shareholders paid the price for those missteps. It's a little shocking to see how much ground some of these respected blue chips were able to lose in just a few months.Year-to-date losses: 11%While the planned pairing of telecom giant AT&T (  , $38.04) and media company Time Warner (  ) has officially hit a wall in the form of the Department of Justice's antitrust concerns, don't think for a minute that's the only reason AT&T's stock has been struggling since the end of 2016.No, this blue chip was in trouble even when the market thought the acquisition was a done deal.Investors have been shedding their AT&T for an old-fashioned reason: The company hasn't been doing well of late, and seems unable to stop its bleeding. AT&T has logged three straight quarters of lower year-over-year revenue. Earnings are more or less staying level, but the organization can't maintain margin expansion forever.So what's really working against AT&T, if not a legal hurdle? More than anything right now, disappointing subscriber growth for its satellite TV arm DirecTV. Last quarter's net decline in the number of television subscribers AT&T prompted MoffettNathanson analyst Craig Moffett to warn, \"It is becoming increasingly clear that the wheels are falling off of satellite TV.\"However, AT&T bulls can find a silver lining: Each step lower is an opportunity to buy new positions or add to existing stakes for a higher yield (now above 5%) and cheaper price.Year-to-date losses: 12%One would think something as skill-specific and part-specific as the auto parts and maintenance business would be relatively immune to the growing dominance of e-commerce giant Amazon.com (  ). But one would be wrong.As One Click Retail's Nathan Rigby  , \"After long overlooking its ability to compete in the automotive aftermarket, industry analysts are finally starting to recognize Amazon as a serious player.\"Amazon only got serious about auto parts and car care in early 2017, so the realized threat still is relatively new. But for evidence of how Amazon may be a headache, one only has to look at O'Reilly's Automotive's (  , $245.92) results of late. The company reported disappointing same-store sales in Q2 that prompted a massive plunge in shares. While comps grew 1.8% in the third quarter to meet expectations, those expectations were a downgrade from previous guidance. And while companywide revenue was up around 5%, profit margins were down year-over-year. All this suggests the retailer is feeling the pinch from its online rival.O'Reilly's problems were alarming enough to drop the stock by as much as 39% at its low point this year. The company has recovered significantly, but still is on track to finish 2017 down by double digits.Year-to-date losses: 13%Target's (  , $62.67) decline of 13% in 2017 isn't particularly eye-popping, as the shares have been recouping some of what was lost early on in the year. Nonetheless, the retailer still is off 25% from its peak in July 2015, and is far from out of the woods.It's difficult to pinpoint the precise reason investors haven't been thrilled with the blue-chip stock of late. There's the lingering pushback from its 2016 decision to accommodate transgender customers by letting them use the restroom of their choice. There's also the not-so-small matter of a 2013 data breach that exposed credit card data of millions of customers; some of them have not trusted the retailer since. In the meantime, Target's deeper dive into the grocery game hasn't gone well, allowing rivals to become more relevant to consumers on that front.It's likely that all of these headwinds are contributing to the company's woes.In a bigger, philosophical sense, however, Target's shares have struggled because of increasingly competitive and notably larger rivals Walmart (  ) and Amazon.com, which have left Target out of the either/or argument in consumers' and investors' minds. The flip side? Based on recent buying, Wall Street appears to see promise in Target's December acquisition of Shipt, which will allow the retailer to offer same-day delivery in most of its stores by this time in 2018.Year-to-date losses: 13%This year has been a fruitful one for airline stocks, with the US Global Jets ETF (  ) up 16% since the end of 2016. However, not every airline company has contributed to that gain - shares of United Continental (  , $63.03) still are in the hole to the tune of 13%, even with a modest bounce-back from its August low.The knee-jerk assumption might be that United Continental's woes this year stem from an embarrassing incident that took place in April, when a passenger was dragged off a plane that had been overbooked. Truth be told, some consumers may have followed through on their in-response promise to avoid flying on a United or Continental flight ever again.However, UAL already was pushing into the headwinds of a tough turnaround effort that wasn't going especially well. \"There was a perception that management really backed off the earnings initiatives that they laid out last year,\" Stifel Financial analyst Joe DeNardi told Bloomberg following the carrier's most recent quarterly report. \"The numbers aren't adding up at this point. That really gives investors less confidence that they're going to be able to close the margin gap with Delta.\"Year-to-date losses: 17%Oil services giant Halliburton (  , $44.76) has worked its operations back into the black this year, though it was slower in doing so than most of its peers. With some help from the ongoing recovery in  since their 2014 meltdown, the company posted net income of $28 million in its second quarter, then widened that profit to $365 million in Q3.It hasn't been enough to appease investors, however. While HAL got the year started on a bullish front, it has been one of the worst energy blue-chip stocks since then, with shares losing 17% of their value with a couple weeks to go in 2017.The stock's weakness is somewhat defiant of analyst opinions. Deutsche Bank recently opined that fracking and the corresponding pressure-pumping market - and the likely rising prices in pressure pumping services - actually bode well for HAL shares. Halliburton also recently warned, however, that oil drillers haven't exactly stepped up their activity in a way that's commensurate with the rebound in crude prices.Year-to-date losses: 18%A year ago, beer brewer Molson Coors (  , $79.50) was on top of the world. Earnings were flowing like water, and the acquisition of the portion of MillerCoors - a joint venture with SABMiller - that it didn't already own set the stage for a great 2017.It never happened. The company missed three of its past four quarterly earnings estimates. The fourth - Q3 of this year - was a mere \"meet\" marred by the fact that its $1.34 in per-share profits still were notably less than the year-ago's $1.91. The stock is down almost 20% with most of 2017 out of the way, and still knocking on the door of lower lows.Molson Coors is struggling with a consumer base that's increasingly less interested in well-recognized beer brands, but it appears to have had enough. The company realizes it must cater to a more discriminating audience - and it is. Molson's Canadian arm announced in early November it was acquiring Quebec-based microbrewer Trou du diable, underscoring its willingness to move to where the industry is going rather than focusing on where it has been.There's still plenty of work to be done. But Molson Coors has accepted what the market looks like now, and is responding accordingly. We'll find out next year whether the strategy has promise.Year-to-date losses: 19%How hard can the soup business be? Tougher than you might think, judging from the results Campbell Soup (  , $49.19) has mustered since 2014. The company posted a third-quarter earnings miss in November, but more importantly, revenues declined for the 12th straight quarter.ConsumerEdge Research analyst Jonathan Feeney said that for the most recent quarter, \"(Campbell) simply lost a soup season to a surprisingly price competitive player over which they enjoy massive share leverage.\"General Mills (  ) was the competitive player Feeney was talking about. However, in a bigger sense, he also was talking about questionable decisions from the company's top brass.There's a marginal chance for a turnaround come 2018. For the first time in too long, the \"A\" word is being thrown around: activism. In fact, the idea of an activist investor - fed up with subpar performance - shaking things up has some real merit. It simply would be a tough hill to climb, as more than 40% of the company is held by Dorrance family members and other insiders.Year-to-date losses: 19%Drugmaker Allergan (  , $169.24) got the year started on the right foot, but that strength faded quickly, then outright reversed in August in response to so-so sales from its high-profile drugs like Restasis and Kybella. Some strange maneuvers in the meantime sustained the selloff.Chief among those decisions was the company's decision to transfer the key patent on eye drug Restasis to the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe as a means of extending the patent's effective life. The legal theory was, since U.S. patent laws arguably shouldn't apply to tribal Indian communities on their own sovereign land, competitors won't be able to introduce a generic form of the treatment.The ploy had some merits, but not enough. In October, a federal judge invalidated the drug's patent altogether, making the legal maneuver moot. Not only did Allergan lose its exclusivity on the drug, but it delivered a message of desperation that investors took to heart. Indeed, it was so off-putting, Regeneron (  ) Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer recently said of Allergan's strategy, \"I think it makes the industry, the country look bad.\"It makes Allergan look worst of all, though. AGN shares are down nearly 20% year-to-date, extending a slide that has slashed 44% of the company's value since July 2015.Year-to-date losses: 23%How does one pull the rug out from underneath the country's biggest grocery store chain? Let Amazon get into the business.Kroger (  , $26.69) shares are in the red to the tune of 24% year-to-date, and that even includes a big post-earnings bounce in late November. Most of the pullback in the blue chip stemmed from June's news that Amazon was aggressively stepping up its grocery game via an acquisition of Whole Foods Market. If Amazon - which cares little about actual profits - gets into an industry, most companies already in that industry tend to suffer.That said, Amazon already was chipping away at Kroger's proverbial bread and butter. It introduced consumer staples as a purchase option on its e-commerce site well before 2017, and that effort was getting traction before Whole Foods even came into the picture. Amazon's experiment with curbside pickup of groceries ordered online is another potential threat to Kroger.Never even mind that Walmart has improved its grocery operations. In response to Walmart's strong third-quarter results, reported in November, BMO Capital Market analyst Kelly Bania wrote, \"In our view, the acceleration in Walmart grocery comps despite similar inflation sequentially implies strengthening market share gains, which could be challenging for Kroger.\"Year-to-date losses: 44%General Electric (  , $17.91) may have been an all-American institution a few years ago, but it has struggled to remain relevant in the new digital age.That's not to say the world still doesn't need the aviation, healthcare and power products that General Electric still makes. But it is to say that without Jack Welch at the helm, the company has become oddly uncompetitive. Scott Davis, CEO and lead analyst at Melius Research, recently wrote, \"The company has been disgraced ... GE is in crisis mode and needs to clean house as fast as possible.\"General Electric already has undergone some house-cleaning, including installing a new CEO, John Flannery, and several senior executives have left the company. The company also plans to cut thousands of jobs and is looking at spinning off or selling some of its operations.A turnaround can't come soon enough for loyal GE investors, who have watched their stakes lose nearly 45% in value in 2017 alone. The salt in that wound? In November, the quarterly dividend of 24 cents - the one remaining reason many investors stuck with the beleaguered stock - was cut in half until further notice.James Brumley was long T as of this writing.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["SN, Inc.

(Symbol: ORLY) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $244.69, changing hands for $250.39/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 16 different analyst targets contributing to that average for O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average.

And so with ORLY crossing above that average target price of $244.69/share, investors in ORLY have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $244.69 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

As they have been for most of the year, results have been mixed, but good enough to keep the rally goingA few key companies in the consumer sector still are set to report fiscal Q3 results over the next few weeks. Black Friday sales looked solid, but the real test for brick-and-mortar retailers will come as the key holiday season rolls on.For the market as a whole, the news has been good enough. But many individual stocks in the consumer space still have their fair share of challenges - and a substantial amount of volatility.Three of those companies report next week, with eyes on calming investor nerves and driving their share prices higher. With consumer confidence rising, and the economy strong, performance needs to be strong - or else investors may send their capital elsewhere.From here, the fiscal first quarter report from  (NYSE:  ) on Tuesday morning looks like the most important of the week. The numbers will be of importance not just to AZO, but peers  (NYSE:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ).Those three stocks stalled out in 2016 - and have simply rolled over in 2017, with AZO stock down 14% so far this year. But the group has rallied of late, with all three stocks up at least 28% from 52-week lows touched this summer.The rally seems to make AZO, in particular, rather dangerous ahead of its report. The market sold off AutoZone after a fiscal Q4 beat in September, and shares plunged after the previous two earnings releases. But the stock has gained nearly 30% on basically no news since a 5% drop following that Q4 release.AZO now trades 6.5% above the average Street target price, and expectations are rising heading into earnings. Given continuing online pressure on the space, that seems a dicey combination. An AZO miss would reverberate across the sector, as has been the case for the past two years. As such, I'd avoid the sector next week, or even consider a short of ORLY, which I believe is the weakest of the three.Source: The fiscal Q2 report from  (NYSE:  ) on Wednesday morning very well could focus more on Washington, D.C. than Wall Street. HRB's numbers outside of tax season generally aren't material, and analysts aren't expecting much. Consensus estimates project a loss of 72 cents per share, and revenue growth of just 0.3% year-over-year.But the post-earnings conference call should draw some interest, particularly if Congress makes some progress on tax reform over the weekend. Reports have conflicted as to the impact of changes - notably the proposed increase in the standard deduction - on preparers like H&R Block and  (NASDAQ:  ).Still, I wouldn't expect much in the way of fireworks, even though HRB did fall a surprising 8% after a similarly quiet Q1 report in August. It's unlikely HRB management will have much to say on tax reform, even if there's enough of a plan from D.C. for management to be able to do so.More broadly, the key questions surrounding H&R Block simply haven't been answered. Will online DIY options like TurboTax from  (NASDAQ:  ) continue to take share? Does blockchain technology represent a long-term threat? The Q2 report isn't going to offer much in the way of additional information, beyond (possibly) the company's updated guidance for tax season.With implied volatility rather high - the options market is pricing in a 9%-plus move between now and Dec. 15 - the smart trade here might be to sell a straddle or buy an iron condor, both of which would bet on a limited post-earnings move for HRB.Source: ShutterstockThe Street's on-again, off-again, love affair with  (NASDAQ:  ) appears to be back on, as LULU stock sits near a seven-month high. I'd expect the fiscal Q3 report on Wednesday afternoon to keep the rally going.To be sure, I'm not quite convinced by LULU long-term. The stock isn't cheap by any means, trading at over 24x next year's Street EPS estimates. Growth has been choppy, and competition from companies like  (NYSE:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) banner Athleta will remain intense.But Q3 looks like it could drive the stock higher, at least in the near term. Expectations aren't particularly onerous, with analysts looking for 12% revenue growth (helped in part by new stores) and a similar rise in EPS. News for the retail space as a whole looks reasonably strong of late, and positive commentary on Black Friday should help. Investors appear to be asking for reasons to buy LULU stock at the moment, and the company seems to be performing well enough to satisfy the market.Longer-term, the story here isn't over by any means, and I'd expect fireworks in the Q4 report when Lululemon details its performance during the important holiday season. Until then, though, I don't see enough to believe that LULU's rally is ready to come to an end quite yet.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["-Mark Precious Metals, Inc.

Headwinds are strong for specialty retailers in an environment where  (NASDAQ:  ) is seemingly ready to cannibalize many of these niches, but from a price perspective on the charts, AZO stock could look higher still if it can overcome one specific hurdle. Source: So you know, early this year Amazon.com announced that it would get into selling automotive replacement parts. As you would expect, shares of automotive specialty stores like AutoZone,  (NYSE:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) immediately fell and despite the recent multimonth bounce through this lens remain trending lower.Click to EnlargeOn the multiyear weekly chart, we see that AZO stock for its part as a result of the year-to-date faltering by May snapped its multiyear up-trend line as well as its red 200-week simple moving average. Since then its 50- and 100-week (yellow and blue lines respectively) have begun to roll over and are all roughly coming together in the $650-$700 area, which will likely offer a heck of a lot of technical resistance.In other words, for the time being AZO stock's long-term chart is broken and it will take a herculean effort as well as time for this chart to turn back to long-term bullish.Click to EnlargeHowever, and as I point out daily in this column, a multi-time-frame approach allows us to spot opportunities in different time frames and also gives us great perspective. Keeping the above chart in mind, the rally off the July lows in the bigger picture so far really only is a counter-trend move in a broken longer-term chart.However, on the daily chart we see that AZO stock over the past few weeks has been in a consolidation phase just below the $610 area, allowing us to draw a simple black horizontal for reference. If and when AZO stock manages to break and hold above this area it could lead to a next push hither into the mid to high $600s.The blue zone on the chart marks a still unfilled down-gap from May of this year. This gap would get filled around the $660-$670 area, which for this trade idea could also serve as a well-defined upside target.Such gaps in charts often times are important tells about investor psychology in a stock and offer high-probability opportunities in all-time frames, including intraday. For those unfamiliar with the power of gaps I am holding a special webinar on Nov. 15 for  readers. Register  .So, should AZO stock manage to push and hold above the $610 mark on a daily closing basis it could open up into the mid to high $600s, where it then however would likely run into major technical resistance from the weekly chart above.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photoExpected Earnings Release: 10/25/2017, After-hoursAvg.

For the Retail ETF (Symbol: RTH), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $90.13 per unit.With RTH trading at a recent price near $81.29 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.88% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of RTH's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Macy's Inc (Symbol: M), O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (Symbol: ORLY), and Bed, Bath & Beyond, Inc.

For 2017, the gross margin guidance is anticipated in the range of 52.5-52.9% and operating margin is expected to be 19.1-19.5% compared with the previous estimate of 20.1-20.5%.Being concentrated in a few regions in the United States, O'Reilly's business is linked to the changes in the economic and weather conditions of these regions thus impacting its sales to a considerable extent.High inventory in current assets is likely to affect the short-term liquidity of the company in periods of low sales. Adding to its woes, O'Reilly has witnessed a rise in SG&A expenses in the first six months of 2017 to $1.47 billion. The company expects this rise to persist given the continued pressure from increasing wage rates, higher expected medical cost, additional investments in the company's internal information system capabilities as well as costs to convert the bond stores acquired in December 2016.Nevertheless, O'Reilly's is aggressively undertaking acquisitions in existing markets and new, contiguous markets, which are expected to boost sales. Also, the company is opening new stores for greater penetration. Along with this, the company pursues an aggressive share repurchase policy, which continues to boost earnings per share. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that O'Reilly is likely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this quarter.

(Symbol: ORLY) stock, but cautious about paying the going market price of $210.18/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the May 2018 put at the $170 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $5.50. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 3.2% return against the $170 commitment, or a 4.9% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to ORLY's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $170 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. sees its shares fall 19.1% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $164.50 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $5.50 from $170), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.9% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $170 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the May 2018 put at the $170 strike for the 4.9% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $210.18) to be 32%.

Volatility did spike a bit toward the end of August, but it still sits near historic lows. The  sits at an all-time high, but it is still up just 0.4% from early August levels. Source: ShutterstockU.S. stocks feel like they're still stuck in the late-summer doldrums, with the beginning of earnings season more than a month away. But there still are a few key companies reporting earnings next week. Three of them are dealing in various ways with the various challenges in the retail industry being quickly and dramatically altered by  (NASDAQ:  ).For each company, next week's reports are reasonably significant. But the significance of these earnings releases goes beyond the individual stocks. The lessons drawn from all three will give investors a clue as to the health of U.S. retail as a whole, and a better understanding of how that dynamic market is shifting at the moment.Those lessons could be key ahead of the coming earnings season - and then the always-important holiday period. Without further ado, here are three earnings reports to watch next week.The chart of  (NASDAQ:  ) looks like that of so many brick-and-mortar retailers over the past few years. Ugly. BBBY stock has lost one-third of its value in the last year. It's down 55% over the past three years.Those declines make BBBY stock look cheap. The consensus Wall Street earnings-per-share estimate for fiscal 2017 (ending February 2018) is $4.02, giving BBBY stock a price-to-earnings multiple just above 7. And I can see why there might be a contrarian case for BBBY, particularly at levels since just after the financial crisis.After all, the sheets, towels and home d\u00e9cor items sold at Bed, Bath & Beyond are easier to sell in-person, when a customer can touch and feel the products. Sales of those online products are shifting online, but Bed, Bath & Beyond is following that trend. Digital sales grew more than 20% in fiscal 2016, and again in Q1, helped in part by several small e-commerce acquisitions.Overall, comparable sales haven't been that bad, declining 0.6% in FY16 after a 1% increase the year before. And expectations are low, with consensus EPS estimates for Q2 of $0.71, a 16.5% decline year-over-year.But the lesson of retail over the past few years has been that low P/E multiples don't make a cheap stock. And BBBY's Q2 report on Tuesday afternoon is shaping up to be a potentially explosive report.Bed, Bath & Beyond already  badly, with a 2% decline in same-store sales and a 27% drop in adjusted EPS sending the stock down 12%. Meanwhile, it will announce full-year guidance after the Q2 numbers. Another miss will add to the narrative that declines are accelerating. Combining a Q2 miss with guidance that disappoints the Street easily could cause another double-digit drop in the stock.All told, it simply looks like it's too early to time the bottom - either in brick-and-mortar retail or in BBBY.Auto-parts retailers like  (NYSE:  ) were supposed to be protected from the e-commerce threat - if not actually benefit from it.While brick-and-mortar retailers elsewhere were plunging in 2015 and 2016, AutoZone and peers  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) held up just fine. AZO stock, in fact, hit an all-time high toward the end of 2016.The narrative has changed dramatically in 2017, one reason I recommended my subscribers sell ORLY in late June, just ahead of its  in early July. AutoZone itself missed Street estimates in its fiscal Q3 report in May, and Advance Auto completed the trifecta with a big Q2 miss in mid-August.But there's reason to see a glimmer of hope for AZO ahead of the fiscal Q4 report before the open on Tuesday. AZO shares bottomed out just below $500 with support holding until a recent rebound into Tuesday's report. At under 13x FY17 EPS, AZO looks reasonably cheap - and much cheaper than either ORLY or AAP.The Q4 report is a big one for AutoZone. A strong sales number and progress in managing higher expenses from new distribution centers can change the narrative here. With the stock still down 28% in 2017, expectations are low. A nice beat, and a good outlook, from AutoZone could send AZO soaring - and take ORLY and AAP with it.On the other side of the coin is  (NYSE:  ), which has benefited from the same e-commerce trends impacting BBBY and AZO.FedEx's Q2 report after the close on Tuesday isn't likely to produce much in the way of fireworks. The Street is looking for solid, but reasonable growth YOY: 8% in EPS and 5% in revenue. The post-earnings call may actually be more interesting to investors, given that FDX will give its outlook for the holiday season.That outlook might not move FDX stock all that much, but it could move others. After all, it will say a lot about how one of the world's premier logistics companies sees this year's key shopping season, from both an overall market standpoint and in terms of how much more share e-commerce will take. That could be a key piece of data for investors looking to understand how the rest of the year will play out - both in retail and the market as a whole.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["-Mark Precious Metals, Inc.

After all, who wouldn't want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let's put  stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock's current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, O'Reilly Automotive has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18.5, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 20.4. If we focus on the stock's long-term PE trend, the current level puts O'Reilly Automotive's current PE ratio much below its midpoint (which is 24.6) over the past five years.Further, the stock's PE also compares favorably with the sector's trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 28.6. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that O'Reilly Automotive has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year's earnings) of just 16.8, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for O'Reilly Automotive's stock in the near term too.Another key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock's price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, O'Reilly Automotive has a P/S ratio of about 2.2. This is somewhat lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.2 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is considerably below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading-at least compared to historical norms.In aggregate, O'Reilly Automotive currently has a Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes ORLY a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for O'Reilly Automotive is 1.2, a level that is marginally lower than the industry average of 1.3. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock's earnings growth rate. Clearly, ORLY is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.Though O'Reilly Automotive might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of C and a Momentum score of F. This gives ORLY a VGM score-or its overarching fundamental grade-of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  )Meanwhile, the company's recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. While the consensus estimate for the current quarter has fallen about 1.6% in the past two months, the full year estimate has inched up 0.3%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below: | This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.O'Reilly Automotive is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (bottom 26% out of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates, analyst sentiment and broader factors to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happen, this stock could be a compelling pick.Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on  (NASDAQ:  -  ).Here is a synopsis of all three stocks: (NASDAQ:  -  )is a $9 billion drug company focused on developing and commercializing innovative products to meet unmet medical needs in neurology, psychiatry, and oncology.On August 8, Jazz reported a weaker-than-expected quarter and guidance which knocked the shares down from $155 to $140. But I was licking my chops at the opportunity to buy this key franchise trading at just 11X next year's projected EPS of $13. This article will explain why.First, you have to understand where JAZZ has been successful. Their top commercially-successful drug is Xyrem for the treatment of narcolepsy. Xyrem will comprise nearly 75% of JAZZ's total projected sales this year of $1.64 billion.JAZZ's second most-important revenue generator is Erwinaze, part of a chemotherapy program to treat patients who have acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL, a type of blood cancer that affects the white blood cells that help fight infection. Erwinaze is used in patients who have had an allergic reaction to a different type of asparaginase treatment.Erwinaze is an alternate form of asparaginase. It is thought to help prevent leukemia cells from surviving and works in a similar way as other asparaginase treatments.And Erwinaze is part of the oncology pipeline that JAZZ is expanding rapidly and holds the most promise as JAZZ brings new drugs to market and reduces dependence on Xyrem for growth.Wells Fargo analyst Ike Bucherow reiterated his Outperform rating on shares of JAZZ and trimmed his price target just a half-percent, to $177 from $178, after the company reported Q2 EPS of $2.56, missing the consensus of $2.75, and missing on the top line too by about $10 million.The analyst stated \"revenues were lighter than what we expected, spending in line with our expectations, resulting in EPS lower than we forecast, but nothing seems to be significantly astray. Jazz reaffirmed its full year revenue guidance of $1.625 billion to $1.7 billion.\"But it was the news of August 3 that most large biopharma investors were focused on.That day, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the Jazz Pharmaceuticals drug Vyxeos for the treatment of adults with two types of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a rapidly progressing and life-threatening blood cancer.

And, as further testament to my ignorance of this great business story, they started in Springfield, MO in 1957, going public in 1993.While ORLY is a Zacks #5 Rank Strong Sell because estimates dropped sharply after weak sales comps in July, I want to share a little about this amazing growth story in case you were as ignorant as I was. We'll come back to the company and stock outlook in a moment.I borrow this little bit of history from the company website...Michael Byrne O'Reilly immigrated to America in 1849, escaping from the hard times of the potato famine, which struck Ireland in 1845-46. Settling in St. Louis, he worked his way through school to earn a law degree, and then pursued a career as a title examiner. His son, Charles Francis O'Reilly, attended college in St. Louis and went to work in 1914 as a traveling salesman for Fred Campbell Auto Supply in St. Louis.By 1924, Charles had become familiar with the Springfield area, having traveled by train to sell auto parts throughout the territory. He recognized the region as an area of growth and opportunity and asked to be transferred there. By 1932, he had become manager of Link Motor Supply in Springfield. One of his sons, Charles H. (Chub) O'Reilly, had also joined the company. Together they provided the leadership and management that made Link the predominant auto parts store in the area.In 1957, Link planned a reorganization, which would have included the retirement of 72-year-old Charles F. O'Reilly, and the transfer of C. H. O'Reilly to Kansas City. Since neither agreed with these plans, they made the decision to form their own company, O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.(end of history excerpt from O'Reilly website)From those humble beginnings, father and son created a business legacy that an any immigrant patriarch would be proud of.Now, let's get back to why this company, whose shares have soared from $80 to $290 in four years (summer 2012 to summer 2016), are down 29% YTD. My colleague Neena Mishra wrote about ORLY as the Bull of the Day back in July after their sales comps report and before their Q2 earnings report. Here's what she said then...On July 5, the company reported its Q2 comparable store sales results, which were much weaker-than-expected. The stock fell almost 20% and is down about 34% year-to-date (actually trading down to $170 after that report).\"After exiting the first quarter and entering April on an improved sales trend, we faced a more challenging sales environment than we expected for the remainder of the quarter. Our second quarter comparable store sales results of 1.7% represent an improvement over our first quarter, but fell below our guidance of 3% to 5%, due to what we believe were continued headwinds from a second consecutive mild winter and overall weak consumer demand,\" said the CEO.Analysts have slashed their estimates for the company after weak guidance. Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current and next fiscal year have fallen to $11.83 per share and $13.10 per share from $12.26 and $13.73 respectively, 30 days back.The company has missed in three out of past four quarters. The average negative quarterly surprise for the past four quarters is 2.3%.The Oakland regional office of the National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint against electric car giant  (NASDAQ:  -  ) on Thursday, claiming the automaker interfered with its employees' union activities at Tesla's Fremont, California manufacturing factory.The NLRB complaint reaches back to claims made in April, when the United Automobile Workers union filed four separate charges with the board claiming that Tesla had \"illegally surveilled and coerced factory workers attempting to distribute information about the union drive,\" The complaint filed yesterday by the NLRB provides more details on what happened earlier this year, noting things like security guards asking employees distributing pamphlets to show employee ID cards, then proceeding to tell them to leave factory premises, to naming three individual Tesla managers who questioned employees about union activities or tries to prevent employees from talking about union activities.NLRB's complaint also cites Tesla's restrictive confidentiality agreement, a document that prohibited employees from organizing or discussing their work condition,  While Tesla argues that this document is typical of any tech company, California lawmakers  the company back in February that the agreement was overreaching.Based on these findings, NLRB regional director Valerie Hardy-Mahoney wrote that the automaker \"has been interfering with, restraining and coercing employees in the exercise of their rights.\"Tesla has stood firm in its dismissal of the UAW's allegations, saying \"For seven years, the UAW has used every tool in its playbook: misleading and outright false communications, unsolicited and unwelcomed visits to the homes of our employees, attempts to discredit Tesla publicly in the media, and now another tactic that has been used in every union campaign since the beginning of time\u2026\".\"These allegations, which have been filed by the same contingent of union organizers who have been so outspoken with media, are entirely without merit. We will obviously be responding as part of the NLRB process,\" Tesla continued.The NLRB's complaint is likely the last thing Tesla wants, especially as production on its highly-anticipated Model 3 begins to ramp up. CEO Elon Musk already warned investors, however, that the electric car maker may face some manufacturing challenges in the coming months.The board's complaint is set to be reviewed by an administrative law judge at a hearing next week.Since 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

The SEC also requires that the filing includes not only the name of the company owned, but also the number of shares and the total market value of the position, among other details.It\u2019s an annoyance for money managers, especially since it lays out all of their cards, especially when it shows where they\u2019ve placed the wrong bets. For retail investors, however, especially those who love to mimic the likes of Warren Buffett, the 13F can be your best friend. And based on the recent disclosures, institutional investors have begun to reduce their risk.Should retail investors do the same? to S&P  Intelligence, which analyzed the latest 13F filings, the research firm discovered that six out of the eleven S&P 500 sectors were net sells during the second quarter, compared to the first quarter. Take a look at the chart, courtesy of S&P  Intelligence.The biggest decline during the second quarter was in consumer discretionary where almost $300 billion left the sector. This was followed by declines of $142 billion and $107 billion in healthcare and technology, respectively. Consumer staples lost $81 billion, while financials and real estate ended with respective declines of $77 billion and $22.5 billion, respectively.By contrast, among the biggest gainers where hedge funds placed their months during the quarter were sectors that underperformed in the first half such as energy, which saw $865 billion of net inflows. This was followed by $507 billion in the materials sector and $418 billion in industrials. Utilities and telecoms rounded out the gainers with $26 billion and $23 billion, respectively.The divergence between the buys and sells was evident with the recent pullback investors witnessed in the major indexes over the past several weeks. But not all of the buying and selling imply bullish or bearish sentiment.For instance, Microsoft (), which ranks as the top buy among hedge funds during the second quarter at $123 billion, also ranked third among the top-five list of largest sells at $115 billion. This means MSFT started the quarter as one of the largest holding in any sector.Interestingly, NXP Semiconductor (), which is in the process of being acquired by Qualcomm (QCOM), was second among the largest gainers with $118 billion. It was followed by Baker Hughes, which was just acquired by General Electric (). O'Reilly Automotive () and Wells Fargo () rounded out the top-five largest buys.Among the largest sells, Facebook () ranked No.1 with $146 billion, followed by Humana () with $132 billion. As noted, MSFT ranked No.3, followed by Alphabet () and PayPal (). These buys and sells could have occurred for a number of reasons, including the fact that a target price was reached or the buy/sell was to bring better balance to the portfolio. But without knowing the hedge fund managers\u2019 trading strategy, it\u2019s tough to pinpoint exactly what any of these funds could be thinking.But if you\u2019re thinking about mimicking these trades, it\u2019s important to note that the 13F\u2019s are backwards looking and is filed within 45 days of the end of a calendar quarter. This means by the time the 13F is made public, these hedge funds might have already exited their entire position or doubled-down. Nor does it disclose any short positions the funds might have taken to hedge their long bets.In short, the 13Fs are useful to the extent that it allows investors to gauge sentiment on a stock for a period of time. But it doesn\u2019t replace good fundamental research. Nor should it supersede investors\u2019 own method of appraising value.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ig 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (  ) will begin trading ex-dividend on August 30, 2017.

As you can see below, automotive and industrial replacement parts distributor  (NYSE: GPC) and industrial supply company  (NYSE: GWW) have significantly underperformed the S & P 500 so far in 2017, with  (NASDAQ: AMZN) playing a big role in both declines. Let's take a closer look at whether these stocks are worth buying right now. data by Based on the company's third-quarter earnings, its automotive group is responsible for around 53% of segment operating profits. Motion industries is next at around 32%, office products is at around 11%, and the rest comes from the electrical/electronic group. Unfortunately, the automotive group, which operates primarily under the National Automotive Parts Association (NAPA) brand name, is facing industry headwinds this year, and possibly an existential threat from Amazon.A quick look at comparable same store sales at its key rivals shows the impact of weakening consumer demand for automotive replacement parts. For more color, consider that  (NASDAQ: ORLY) was expecting comparable same store sales growth of 3%-5% in its second-quarter, only to report 1.7%.Data source: Company presentations. AutoZone data is for domestic same store sales and is adjusted to the nearest quarter.O'Reilly's CEO Greg Henslee puts the industry slowdown down to a combination of a second mild winter (warm winters are less damaging to cars), a slowdown in the growth of miles driven, and pressure on lower income consumers. In addition, Henslee drew attention to \"depressed new vehicle sales totals during the period from 2008 to 2011.\" This is an interesting argument because the sweet spot for demand for auto replacement parts is when an automobile reaches seven to eight years in age. If Henslee is right, then industry demand should pick up in the coming years as U.S. vehicle sales increased strongly from 2011-2016. data by While the arguments above sound reasonable -- they apply to General Parts Company as well -- they don't do much to address fears that Amazon's move into auto parts is  the auto parts retailer's lunch.Ultimately, if you buy Genuine Parts Company you are taking the view that the slowdown in end demand is merely temporary and that Amazon doesn't present some kind of long-term structural threat to the industry.A quick look at a chart of Grainger compared to fellow industrial supply companies makes for a sorry picture. data by As with its peers, Grainger's problem can be summed up in one word: \"margin.\" Industrial supply companies like  and  have faced the same issue in 2017. Essentially, end markets are picking up in terms of volume demand, but pricing power is still weak and raw material costs (steel, copper etc) have increased. The result is a squeeze on margin. data by However, Amazon has also played a role, as its encroachment into Grainger's marketplace has forced the company to make a strategic decision to cut pricing in order to win market share. On the second-quarter , CEO DG Macpherson said, \"We saw continued volume growth from our strategic pricing initiatives in the United States.\" However, the 5% increase in volume in the U.S. in the second-quarter was offset by a 4% decline in price, resulting in a 1% increase in sales.Of course, it's all supposed to be different for the industrial supply companies in 2017. Investors were surely hoping that a cyclical pick-up in end demand from an improving U.S. industrial economy would result in sales growth and margin expansion, but that hasn't been the case so far in 2017, and it's far from clear that Amazon isn't the reason behind the lack of pricing power.Image source: Getty ImagesI would argue that Genuine Parts Company is better placed than Grainger to deal with the potential threat from Amazon and other online merchants. The key difference is the importance of timely accessibility and delivery of auto parts. Customers usually require their cars to work immediately, so the brick and mortar retailers -- which frequently replenish products in their stores -- are likely to remain relevant for a long time to come.On the other hand, the timeliness of delivery is less of an issue for Grainger's customers, and the company's strategic price-cutting is already a sign of competitive pressure from Amazon and others. All told, Grainger's issue looks to be structural, while Genuine Parts Company's weak auto parts sales growth is more of a cyclical issue.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Net income improved 10% to $283 million (12.3% of sales) from $258 million (11.8% of sales) in the second quarter of 2016.Quarterly revenues went up 5% to $2.29 billion from $2.18 billion a year ago. Revenues were almost on par with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Comparable store sales increased 1.7% in the reported quarter compared with a 4.3% rise in the prior-year quarter.For the third quarter of 2017, O'Reilly projects earnings per share in the range of $3.10-$3.20.

The company anticipates revenues in the band of $8.9-$9.1 billion compared with the previous expectation of $9.1-$9.3 billion. For 2017, the gross margin guidance is in the range of 52.5-52.9% and operating margin is expected to be 19.1-19.5% compared with the previous estimate of 20.1-20.5%.O'Reilly reiterated its capital expenditure to be within the range of $470-$500 million. However, for 2017, it expects free cash flow to be between $830 million and $880 million compared with the range of $930-$980 million expected earlier. In her bottom line, Neena Mishra noted the rise of competition from Amazon and better quality vehicles as threats to the auto parts companies' terrific run in this bull market. As an  shareholder, I'm hearing that auto buffs are able to order any part, at the best price, anywhere around the world and the shipping is minimal using Alipay.

(NYSE: AZO) ,  (NYSE: AAP) , and  (NASDAQ: ORLY) posted roughly flat same store sales growth. This impacted earnings performance -- O'Reilly and AutoZone were able to squeeze out 9% and 6% earnings-per-share growth, respectively, while Advance Auto Parts earnings collapsed 36% year over year.Not surprisingly, shares of these companies have tanked since the beginning of the year after years of delivering market beating returns for shareholders. AutoZone, Advance Auto Parts, and O'Reilly are down 21%, 19%, and 12%, respectively, year to date. These stocks are even underperforming the  ETF, which is down 6% year to date.Auto parts stocks are running out of oil as quickly as this container. Image source: Getty Images.These results come after a January 2017 report from the  , which reported that  (NASDAQ: AMZN) is quietly penetrating the $50 billion do-it-yourself auto parts market where the top auto parts stores have long been dominant. AutoZone is the most vulnerable to potential competition with Amazon since 75% of its revenue comes from do-it-yourself customers. Advance Auto Parts and O'Reilly have no more than about 50% of their revenue exposed to this market.It's not surprising Amazon would be interested in auto parts, and not just because it's the \"everything store\". The major auto parts stores have experienced consistent growth over the last several years due to aging vehicles and car owners more willing to keep their current cars running longer rather than buy new ones. Just take a look at how well these stocks have performed over the last decade: data by But the good times could be coming to an end depending on the extent to which Amazon can take market share. At the very least, Amazon will likely make it more difficult for auto parts stores to find growth over time.AutoZone and O'Reilly blamed lackluster results partly on a delay in IRS tax refunds, which may have reduced the near-term spending power among lower income customers. However, Amazon, with its free shipping options and  to win market share, is not a competitor you want invading your turf. Especially one like auto parts, where the leading stores still control a minor portion of the total do-it-yourself market, leaving the door wide open for an aggressive disruptor like Amazon.Amazon may be applying its aggressive pricing tactics to auto parts retailers. The  story reported that Amazon has been paying manufacturers 30% more for merchandise, which means Amazon may be taking a loss on some parts. For example, a high-selling item like a five-quart container of Mobil Synthetic motor oil on Amazon is $37.00 (at the time of this writing) with free two-day shipping for Prime members, but the same product costs $43.61 from AutoZone including shipping (both prices exclude sales tax). Advance Auto Parts offers the same price as AutoZone, while O'Reilly charges one dollar more for the same product.As a sign that it may be feeling the heat from Amazon, AutoZone is offering a free two-day shipping option, but the catch is you have to spend $200 to join the program. Amazon offers Prime for $99 per year, and you get a lot more for your membership than just free shipping, such as streaming movies, music, and exclusive deals available only to Prime members.AutoZone and O'Reilly offer in-store pickup for certain items like the Mobil product mentioned above, but Amazon has already been rolling out same-day delivery to several major cities in the last few years. This might be  over these retailers long term. Amazon can spend billions getting closer to the customer by building its massive fulfillment centers near metropolitan areas, which gives customers same-day delivery on a vast selection of items.The only real advantage auto parts stores might be able to hold over Amazon is offering customers the option of talking to a knowledgeable staff member in-store. However, shopping for auto parts has actually become easier online, because customers can now visit any major auto parts retailer's website, including Amazon, enter the make and model of their car, and immediately find the product they need.The top three auto parts retailers have clearly been a fabulous investment in recent years, but with Amazon entering their territory on top of recent weak results, it brings a whole new level of uncertainty to auto parts retailers' future growth prospects.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Amazon wasn't one of them!

The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in one of the trailing four quarters, with a negative average surprise of 2.3%.Let's see how things have shaped up for the forthcoming announcement.O'Reilly's stores are concentrated in certain locations in the U.S. Thus, its business is exposed to the economic and weather conditions of these regions. The company's strategy of lowering the time-to-market for its products to meet the demand in the professional installer market, places it at a logistical disadvantage against competitors.Additionally, much of O'Reilly's cash is locked in inventories, which can affect its short-term liquidity in periods of low sales. Further, the company expects selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in 2017 from 2016 on rising costs.However, for second-quarter 2017, O'Reilly projects earnings per share in the range of $3.10-$3.20, compared with $2.65, recorded in second-quarter 2016. The company expects consolidated comparable store sales to increase 3-5%. For full-year 2017, it expects earnings per share in the band of $12.05-$12.15, higher than $10.73 earned in 2016.O'Reilly projects a consolidated comparable store sales increase in the 3%-5% range, during the year. The company anticipates revenues in the band of $9.1-$9.3 billion, higher than $8.59 billion, recorded in 2016.Our proven model does not conclusively show that O'Reilly is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below: The Earnings ESP represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. O'Reilly's Earnings ESP is -0.68% because the Most Accurate estimate of $2.91 is pegged below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.93. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . |  O'Reilly currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) from going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.O'Reilly has lost 29.9% over the last three months, underperforming the 24% decline of the  it belongs to.Here are some better-ranked companies you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Cummins Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +3.1% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is expected to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 1. You can see CNH Industrial N.V.  has an Earnings ESP of +12.5% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company's second-quarter 2017 financial results are expected to release on Jul 26.BorgWarner Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +1.12% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company's second-quarter 2017 financial results are scheduled to release on Jul 27.Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Wednesday, shares of O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.

Stocks of other auto parts suppliers fell on the news, too.\"Our second quarter comparable store sales results of 1.7% represent an improvement over our first quarter, but fell below our guidance of 3% to 5%, due to what we believe were continued headwinds from a second consecutive mild winter and overall weak consumer demand,\" said CEO Greg Henslee in the press release. \"The comparable store sales shortfall will also have a consequent impact on our operating profitability, which we will report in our full second quarter earnings release on July 26th.\"Whereas there are plenty of retailers that would love to have positive comparable-store sales in today's environment, and the figure was an improvement over the disappointing 0.8% growth in the previous quarter, O'Reilly shares have enjoyed a premium valuation on higher expectations, which partially evaporated on today's news. Last quarter, management blamed weather and late tax refunds for poor results, and this quarter's announcement made clear that there are longer-term issues in play.

Two years ago, Teradyne expanded from its traditional business of semiconductor test equipment to buy Universal Robot, the Danish pioneer and market-leading producer of \"collaborative robots.\" Cobots, as the company calls them, are low-cost, easy-to-program robots that can safely work side by side with humans in a production environment to \"automate almost anything,\" according to Teradyne.Although the robot business comprises only about 10% of Teradyne's revenue, it's growing rapidly. Last quarter, sales in the segment were up 117% and management predicted a full-year growth rate of over 50%.

With a rise of 16% in the first half of the year, the Nasdaq 100 has doubled the performance of the broader market, and tech stocks have been a big part of that outperformance. However, some stocks haven't participated in the rally and have suffered losses that have held back the Nasdaq 100 from even bigger gains.

In its most recent quarter, Tractor Supply added 24 new locations to its total, which now includes more than 1,600 stores.However, the net impact of Tractor Supply's store count growth hasn't been as favorable lately. The first quarter of 2017 brought just a 7% rise in revenue, and comparable-store sales dropped more than 2% on  . Although mainstay pet and livestock demand was solid, poor seasonal weather conditions throughout much of its core territory had a downward impact on lawn and garden sales. Higher internal costs also ate into profit, and rising inventory reflected the sluggish sales conditions for the business. If weather starts getting more favorable, then  , and a recent dividend increase shows the company's confidence in its own business prospects.Image source: Tractor Supply.Akamai Technologies has made a specialty out of optimizing distribution of content over the internet, and for years, the need to maximize efficient transfer of data has given Akamai a growing business.

In the first quarter,  led to a 5% rise adjusted earnings, and both numbers were actually better than investors had expected.Going forward,  . Guidance for the second quarter was less than investors had expected, and although the company sees itself staying in the media distribution business for the foreseeable future, that space is getting increasingly competitive. Bullish investors hope Akamai can bounce back on the strength of its rising security services business, but whether that can provide a share-price-increasing boost in the second half of the year is far from certain.Finally, O'Reilly Automotive has also posted substantial losses so far this year. Auto parts stores in general have seen poor performance in 2017, and O'Reilly's losses only make a small dent in its long-term returns over the past several years. The auto parts retailer's first-quarter results didn't inspire a huge amount of confidence among investors, with sales climbing less than 3%, and net income growing at a 4% clip. Industry watchers pointed to  as contributing factors to the poor performance for the quarter, and a mild winter reduced the need for repairs even as a cool spring discouraged people from heading out to their garages to do work.Yet O'Reilly has done a good job of reducing its share count, including a 5% drop in just the past year. That has helped bolster growth in earnings per share, and if the company can take advantage of the recent price drop to pick up shares on the cheap, then buybacks could add even more to longer-term gains for O'Reilly going forward.The Nasdaq 100 has done well this year, but these three stocks haven't been able to join in the party.

That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks! Let's get to the stocks on our radar this week. We'll start with our man Ron Gross. What do you have? Hold on tight here, Compass Minerals, CMP, leading producer of salt for highway de-icing, also a growing agriculture and fertilizer business. They have a unique asset, which is the largest salt mine in the world in Canada. They also have the largest dedicated rock salt mine in the U.K. 4.2% dividend yield, has increased that yield every year since going public since 2003. Salty! Steve Broido, question about Compass Minerals? What's your favorite mineral, Ron? Potash, obviously. Jason Moser, what are you looking at? Checking out United Natural Foods, ticker is UNFI. They are a national distributor of natural and organic groceries. We talked about all of these companies that are getting sold off thanks to this  deal. United Natural Foods is no exception, but they have a very diverse supplier base, for example,  accounted for 5% of their total purchases in 2016. The interesting thing is that Whole Foods Market accounted for about 35% of their net sales in 2016. So I'm trying to determine how this deal is actually going to affect them, because I could see it being a catalyst in the long run, helping them out if Amazon is going to grow out that consumer base with this Whole Foods acquisition. So I'm going to dig a little more into this one. Steve, question about United Natural Foods? Do you personally pay a premium for organics at the store? I personally do not, no. I don't really care if it's organic, I'm just going to cook it, and if it's good I'm fine with that. What about you, Steve? Do you pay up for organics? Not usually but sometimes. Matt Argersinger, what are you looking at this week? I'm going negative this week. Nice. The next industry to be disrupted in my opinion is going to be auto parts retailers, so I'm looking at Advance Auto Parts, ticker AAP, and O'Reilly Automotive, ticker ORLY. If you think about it, you have mobility disruption, which is going to take a lot of private vehicles off the road, and then you have the rise of electric vehicles, which have vastly lower moving parts in each vehicle, and I think that's bad news for the do-it-yourself auto parts guys or manufacturers or mechanic -- Or gal. Or gal. So that business looks really suspect to me right now. These two stocks in particular are trading at pretty high valuations. Steve, question about either O'Reilly or Advance Auto Parts? It's a broader question. Gas-powered cars go away altogether, we move to electric cars, how long is it going to take for that transition to happen? Faster in other countries, but probably by 20 years here in the U.S., they're off the roads. Compass Minerals, United Natural Foods, auto parts, do you have a stock you want to add to your watch list, Steve? These all sound a little weird, but I might go with Ron's mineral company.

It was the potash.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["dvance Auto Parts Inc (  ) will begin trading ex-dividend on June 21, 2017.

But do they have a longer-term problem?A full transcript follows the video.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and AutoZone wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys. to learn about these picks! Tough week if you are in the auto parts business. Third-quarter same-store sales were down for  (NYSE: AZO) , same story for  ' (NYSE: AAP)  first-quarter report, and both stocks down, Jeff, more than 10% this week. This is kind of a rough patch for two businesses that have really rewarded shareholders over the long term. For a long time. And add  (NASDAQ: ORLY) to that, and you have three, a trifecta, a disappointing quarter for these three companies. A few things have happened, Chris. One, as we talked about in the earlier segment, that tax refund was delayed. It's funny how these companies all really rely on consumers to get that refund. I was going to say, AutoZone called that out, whereas  went out of their way to give credit to the delayed tax return, like, \"Hey, people took their tax refund and spent it here!\" AutoZone went the other way and said, \"Yeah, tax returns were delayed, and they weren't spending money with us.\" Exactly, Chris. And they went further and said this last week that it never materialized. Once people got that refund, they didn't come in and spend it at AutoZone the way they expected. So, it was a one-two punch where it was delayed and then it didn't show up. Meanwhile, Best Buy is like, \"Hey, everybody just came in and spent their refund on tech!\" Clearly AutoZone needs to start selling video games. That's where the money is. People care about their cars less, maybe, in today's world. But what also happened is, the spring weather didn't materialize and stay the way they always depend on spring. April is usually a really strong month because it gets warmer, everyone thinks, \"Time to clean my car, do some maintenance.\" That didn't really happen this year. And that's on top of a mild winter, which decreased their sales as well. So, all these things. Weather is a very real thing here. The talk on Wall Street is,  is going to challenge these auto parts retailers. So far, that isn't happening at all, according to O'Reilly and AutoZone. It's just not really on the radar yet. You mentioned the mild winter. You have to figure, on some level, David, if you're one of these companies, you're rooting for potholes. They won't say that exactly, but you know in the back of their head, their fingers are crossed. When you look at the stock, it's down. And in the case of AutoZone, Advance Auto Parts, year to date, these stocks are down about 25%. Are they cheap? Is this an opportunity to get in at a lower price? Or is it still something that you want to see, put this on hold for three months and see how they do next quarter? They've done so well for so long that they had inflated multiples, you could say. And AutoZone now trades at 13 times price to earnings. Advance Auto Parts is 17 times forward estimates. So, they're not cheap yet, as far as retail goes.

Lack of updates related to the FBI probe into Mike Flynn's involvement with Russian sources over the weekend helped markets to recover from the losses it suffered due to events at the White House. Instead, Trump's first foreign visit continued to dominate headlines.Even as investors digested the full budget plan, they remained doubtful over the likelihood of its approval in Congress. Trump's budget seeks to cut federal spending by $3.6 trillion with a focus on balancing the budget over the next decade through cuts in healthcare and food assistance programs. The budget plan is expected to make changes to key programs such as Medicaid, food stamps and federal student loans through steep cuts in government spending in these areas. Defense and infrastructure are among the few areas where the budget proposes to increase funding.However, the budget assumes the Trump administration will lower tax rates for corporate and households. The White House has proposed to slash the corporate rate to 15% and reduce individual rates from seven brackets to three. Since Trump's budget plan came in largely as expected, it had a positive impact on the broader markets.The broader Financials Select Sector SPDR (XLF) advanced 0.8%, emerging as the best performing sector of S&P 500.

Any weakness in the broader market may cause investors and traders to take profits on stocks that have been making fast and aggressive moves higher.Today's three big stock charts zooms in on  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NYSE:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ) as all three of these stocks have made significant moves into overbought territory. This, along with other technical factors, put them on top of many trader's \"profit taking\" lists.Semiconductor shares have been putting together a rally of late as the earnings season has been kind to some of the names in the group. Advanced Micro Devices shares have put in a 27% run since bouncing from their 50-day moving average and hitting an oversold reading at the same time.The double-barreled support jettisoned AMD stock higher, right into the clutches of a mirror image. Now, Advanced Micro Devices stock is facing resistance from two factors.First, AMD's 50-day moving average, which is trending lower, is just overhead at $12.95.Second, the stock's RSI readings are nearing overbought readings as yesterday's close generated a reading of 63 for Advanced Micro Devices.This, along with a profit-taking mood hitting stocks should be enough to push AMD prices towards initial support at $11.Mastercard and Visa have traced similar chart patterns of late after some promising earnings reports. However, MA is showing signs of tiring as the stock is now placing a double top at $119. At the same time, the stock is encroaching on overbought readings, which should add selling pressure.Declining volume on Mastercard suggests that the buyers have crowded into the stock on the recent rally. With this volume beginning to ebb, the sellers are more likely to take control of the day-to-day movement.From the initial look at the chart, support for MA should fall into place at $113, which is the site of the stock's rising 50-day moving average and its lower Bollinger Band. Watch for opportunity buyers to step in at this point.Auto-related stocks have seen a lot of mixed action after a tough earnings season from the group. Despite the adversity, O'Reilly Automotive shares have rallied more than 8% in May after bouncing from an oversold and chart support level at $240.We saw ORLY shares hit resistance at $260 on Tuesday, which obviously sent sellers into the market as the stock reversed early gains. Now, a clear rollover of the shares appears to be in motion, despite the fact that O'Reilly stock never reached overbought readings.There is resistance just overhead from the 50-day moving average, which has been declining like a flyball into the outfield, putting pressure on ORLY shares from overhead. This is going to be a clear driver as the stock has been held down by the same trendline in April.Traders may take a little time to see if $252 will hold the wall of sellers at bay, as this was the April low.

Department store giants Macy's  , JCPenney  , and Sears are all shuttering store locations, while mall staples like The Limited and Bebe have closed down their entire brick-and-mortar fleet to focus on online sales.This is just the tip of the iceberg, as retailers, especially those that sell apparel, have been hit hard by years of declining sales and customer traffic due to the rise in online shopping and, of course, Amazon  . The e-commerce giant has certainly transformed the way consumers think about shopping, and this new mentality has affected business operations at many retailers, especially those based in malls.There are, however, some corners of the retail industry that Amazon still can't seem to dominate, helping companies operating in these parts expand their store count instead of shrink it. , a retail consulting firm, discount retailer Dollar General  has plans to open as many as 1,000 new stores this year, with its fellow dollar discount peer Dollar Tree  planning on opening about 650 stores in 2017.U.S. shoppers began shifting towards discount stores during the recession, with most never going back to shopping full price after the economy recovered. Other discount retailers like Ross Stores  , TJX Cos.  , which owns TJ Maxx and HomeGoods, and Burlington Stores  have directly benefitted, and are all opening stores in the double digits this year.German discount grocers Aldi and Lidl are expanding as well.

Other big box rivals like Target  and Costco  are expanding as well, according to IHL.Beauty giant Ulta  , one of the bright spots in the retail industry, is going to open 100 stores in 2017, with two huge locations opening on Chicago's Michigan Avenue and in New York City's Upper East Side. Ulta's main rival, Sephora, which is owned by luxury conglomerate Louis Vuitton Mo\u00ebt Hennessy, is also opening as many as 70 new stores this year.The beauty industry thrives, in large part, because of its reliance on brick-and-mortar. There's a specific level of trust with beauty products that you need to experience face-to-face, if you will. And, if you have ever been in to an Ulta or Sephora, the first thing you likely note is either how busy it is in the store, or how long the line is. Both companies also generate a ton of online business and have great rewards programs, a combination that keeps the shadow of Amazon  .Other retailers expanding this year include automaker parts companies O'Reilly Automotive  and Autozone  , Tractor Supply  , Hobby Lobby, Aerie, the lingerie division of American Eagle Outfitters  , Dick's Sporting Goods  , Nordstrom  , and Bonobos, which is  .Did you miss Apple's 9x stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?

I've also included the most directly applicable sales numbers for its peers,  (NASDAQ: ORLY) ,  (NYSE: AZO) and  (NYSE: AAP) . The disappointing sales performance of Advance Auto Parts is largely due to the effects of integrating a troublesome acquisition.Data source: Company presentations. Chart by author. AutoZone figures are adjusted to the nearest comparable quarter.As you can see, a 0.5% comparable-sales increase in the first quarter came up against a strong 3.5% increase in the first quarter of 2016 and indicates ongoing growth in the industry.Yes, it does -- and it's moderately positive news for the other auto parts companies. Why?The main reason is that investors had reasons to doubt auto parts sales in the quarter. Advance Auto Parts and O'Reilly Automotive both reported strong sales conditions in December due to the cold weather -- car parts sales tend to increase in harsh weather conditions -- their quarters ended on Dec. 31. However, AutoZone -- the last major auto parts retailer to report -- delivered flat comparable-sales growth in its most recent quarter to mid-February.He's going to need some new auto parts.

We are exiting this winter with two consecutive fairly mild winters.\"All told, automotive sales figures from Genuine Parts Company are a net positive and should allay fears that auto parts sales at its peers will turn negative in the quarter -- that's good news for the auto parts industry.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

For the iShares Morningstar Large-Cap Growth ETF (Symbol: JKE), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $142.97 per unit.With JKE trading at a recent price near $130.56 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.50% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of JKE's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are GGP Inc (Symbol: GGP), O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (Symbol: ORLY), and Dollar General Corp (Symbol: DG). Although GGP has traded at a recent price of $23.15/share, the average analyst target is 31.48% higher at $30.44/share. Similarly, ORLY has 22.74% upside from the recent share price of $251.99 if the average analyst target price of $309.29/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting DG to reach a target price of $82.82/share, which is 20.49% above the recent price of $68.74. Below is a twelve month price history chart comparing the stock performance of GGP, ORLY, and DG:Below is a summary table of the current analyst target prices discussed above:\n  \nAre analysts justified in these targets, or overly optimistic about where these stocks will be trading 12 months from now? Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.  and AutoZone, Inc.  were downgraded by Cleveland Research and saw their share prices declining 4.1% and 3.1%, respectively, on Apr 4. Meanwhile, Advance Auto Parts Inc  , CarMax Inc  and Genuine Parts Company  also witnessed declines of 1.9%, 4.3% and 2.2%, respectively.These companies face a number of concerns that may impact their financial results.A number of auto manufacturers reported U.S. sales, which came in weak. The U.S. light-vehicle sales fell 1.7% year over year in March with decline in sales at Ford, Honda, Toyota among others more than offsetting the increase at Nissan and General Motors.On a SAAR basis, annualized sales rate declined to 16.6 million, coming below expectations and the lowest pace of sales since Feb 2015. This decline has come amid rising discounts by auto makers to promote sales.While these manufacturers bear the brunt of the weak sales, auto part producers are anticipated to face headwinds due to this decline. Lower sales imply fewer parts that would need to be replaced, indicating low future sales for these companies.Per Cleveland Research, auto part manufacturers may also suffer currently as there are fewer vehicles that need to be repaired due to the low sales during the last recession.Cleveland Research has also reported weakness in demand from do-it-yourself (DIY) customers, which is likely to lead to a fall in comparable store sales for companies such as O'Reilly and AutoZone. Weak comp sales were witnessed in February as well as March, lowering outlook confidence in the sales for 2017.Moreover, increasing products offered at Walmart and Amazon add to the pressure faced by the companies.Morgan Stanley has projected the decline of used car prices by 20% over the next four years, and may also go as low as 50%. This expected decline is supported by the near end of lease terms for vehicles, which would then be sent back to car dealerships thereby increasing the supply of used cars. The competition is expected to help lower prices.Moreover, recently the auto industry has been experiencing a boom with car sales increasing consecutively for seven years. The large inventory of new vehicles is indicative of the fact that the requirement for used vehicles will be lower.In the past year, the Zacks classified  industry has underperformed the broader market. While the industry has lost 2.5%, the S&P 500 has gained 15%.While the above ideas are being shared with the public, other trades are hidden from everyone but selected members.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Monday, shares of O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (Symbol: ORLY) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 28.7, after changing hands as low as $253.86 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 47.7. A bullish investor could look at ORLY's 28.7 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. The chart below shows the one year performance of ORLY shares:    Looking at the chart above, ORLY's low point in its 52 week range is $248.02 per share, with $292.84 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $254.97.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, ORLY makes up 4.79% of the PowerShares DWA Consumer Cyclicals Momentum Portfolio ETF (Symbol: PEZ) which is trading relatively unchanged on the day Monday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photoIn early trading on Monday, shares of Incyte topped the list of the day's best performing components of the S&P 500 index, trading up 4.8%.

The company posted positive earnings surprise in two of the four trailing quarters, with a positive average surprise of 1.14%.Let's see how things have shaped up for the forthcoming announcement.For first-quarter 2017, O'Reilly projects earnings per share in the range of $2.78-$2.88, compared to $2.59 recorded in first-quarter 2016. The company expects consolidated comparable store sales increase of 2-4%. For full-year 2017, the company expects earnings per share in the band of $12.05-$12.15. O'Reilly projects consolidated comparable store sales increase in the range of 3-5% during the year. The company anticipates revenues in the band of $9.1-$9.3 billion. For 2017, the gross margin guidance is pegged at 52.8-53.2% and operating margin is expected to be 20.1-20.5%.However, O'Reilly's stores are concentrated in certain locations in the U.S. Therefore, its business is exposed to the economic and weather conditions of these regions. The company's strategy of lowering the time-to-market for its products to meet the demand in the professional installer market places it at a logistical disadvantage against competitors.Additionally, much of O'Reilly's cash is locked in inventories, which can affect its short-term liquidity in periods of low sales. Further, the company expects selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in 2017 compared to 2016, due to rising costs.Our proven model does not conclusively show that O'Reilly is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below: : The Earnings ESP represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. O'Reilly's Earnings ESP is -0.69% because the Most Accurate estimate of $2.86 is pegged below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.88. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . |  : O'Reilly currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) which when combined with a negative ESP lowers the predictive power of ESP. Note that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.O'Reilly underperformed the Zacks categorized  industry over the last six months. The company has posted a loss of 2.8% over this period, compared to the industry's decline of 1.6%.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Visteon Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +5.8% and sports a Zacks Rank #1. The company is likely to report first-quarter 2017 results on Apr 27. You can see CNH Industrial N.V.  has an earnings surprise of +33.33% and carries a Zacks Rank #2. The company's first-quarter 2017 financial results are expected to release on Apr 27.General Motors Company  has an earnings surprise of +3.5% and carries a Zacks Rank #3.

Barring the first quarter, the company has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second and third quarters by 18.3% and 13.4%, respectively. In the first quarter, the company posted negative earnings surprise of 5.9%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.The question lingering in investors' minds now is, whether Tiffany will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. In the trailing four quarters, Tiffany outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 7.5%. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $1.37, reflecting a year-over-year decline of over 6%. We noted that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has declined by 2 cents in the past 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,224 million, down about 0.8% from the year-ago quarter.We believe Tiffany's omni-channel platform, store expansion programs, tapping of new markets and venturing into new revenue generating avenues may help improve performance, as evident from back-to-back positive earnings surprises in the second and third quarters. These facilitated the stock to outpace the industry in the past six months. In the said time frame, the stock has surged 23%, while the Zacks categorized  industry has advanced 7.5%.However, the lackluster performance this holiday season raises concern. Management stated that soft consumer spending and lowered sales at Fifth Avenue Flagship Store on account of its proximity to the Trump Tower hurt sales. Further, the company pointed that though macroeconomic headwinds will prevail in 2017, it will counter the same through strategic initiatives and cost containment efforts. Management anticipates earnings per share for fiscal 2016 to decline by \"no more than a mid-single-digit percentage\" and reaffirmed that worldwide net sales is expected to decline by a low-single-digit percentage.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Tiffany is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

The 3.1% increase in comparable-store sales, after four straight quarters of declines, certainly suggests the company is starting to generate traction with its turnaround plans. On the other hand, the sales figures were flattened by a couple of non-recurring factors, and the adjusted operating margin decline to 6% from 7.7% in the same period last year says management still has a lot of work to do. Let's take a closer look at the earnings.For those unfamiliar with the  for Advance Auto Parts, we can start by observing that the company has an opportunity to play catch-up with the kind of operating margin, cash flow generation, and sales growth that peers such as  (NASDAQ: ORLY) and  .(NYSE: AZO) enjoy. Advance Auto Parts' management has set some aggressive mid-term targets, such as a 14.4% increase in adjusted operating income margin by 2021, from the 9.4% achieved in 2016, with $500 million in productivity savings achieved in those five years.Image source: Getty ImagesThe problem is that the company continues to experience difficulties with integrating Carquest, as it seeks to follow in the footsteps of O'Reilly Automotive by becoming a leading dual store, incorporating both do-it-yourself and do-it-for-me solutions.The latest results were mixed with comparable-store sales that turned positive after four straight quarters of declines. Moreover, the 3.1% increase was above the 0%-2% range forecast for 2017. However, operating income and margin continue to fall.\n  \nData source: Advance Auto Parts presentations. Adjusted operating income in millions of US Dollars.As Marvin Gaye once asked, what's going on?On balance, Advance Auto Parts had decent quarter of sales growth. As discussed, the 3.1% increase is impressive enough -- and the initial market reaction to the results was to send the stock up a few percentage points. However, there were a couple of favorable issues in the quarter.First, New Year's Day fell in the fourth quarter of 2015, but it will fall in the first quarter of 2017. That means the fourth quarter of 2016 had a normal day of sales compared with the same period in 2015, which had New Year's Day in it. The issue came up on the , with Evercore analyst Greg Merich positing that it was worth 100 basis points of revenue growth. In response, CEO Tom Greco wouldn't specify but said the positive impact was \"not insignificant.\"Second, cold weather in December created \"exceptional winter-related demand in December,\" according to Greco, as harsh weather tends to lead to an increased need for car-part replacements.As a consequence, Greco suggested, \"Net, it will be important to look at our business across Q4 and Q1 combined to get a true picture of our sales growth improvement.\" That's a particularly pertinent point, because the first quarter will contain New Year's Day and no one knows if an early spring will occur and reduce demand for auto parts.That said, a look at comparable-store sales growth compared with O'Reilly Automotive -- which wasn't affected by a New Year's Day shift but also saw strong weather-related sales in December -- shows that Advance Auto Parts finally had a sales quarter comparable with its closest peer. Even if you take off 100 basis points for the New Year's Day shift, Advance's adjusted 2.1% would be decent compared with O'Reilly's 4.8%.Data source: company presentations. Chart by author.Greco outlined three reasons for the margin decline, each of which was responsible for around a third of the decline.First, \"planned and proactive steps\" to reduce inventory levels hurt operating profits. Investors can't complain too much, because inventory reduction measures were  earlier, and as the following middle chart shows, Advance Auto Parts held much more inventory relative to its sales compared with O'Reilly Automotive and AutoZone.Incidentally, I've included the receivables and payables data so readers can get a better appreciation of the opportunity Advance Auto Parts has to improve performance simply by collecting money more quickly (reducing days sales outstanding) and taking longer to pay suppliers (increasing days payable outstanding). data by Second, management made \"incremental investments to better serve\" its customers. You can think of these measures as a necessary part of the turnaround plan.Third, and more worryingly, CFO Tom Okray referred to \"performance shortfalls in a few concentrated cost lines,\" with Greco describing them as \"completely unacceptable.\" While Okray has a plan to fix the issues and claimed they won't be a part of the company's cost structure in the future, the shortfalls are still a sign of how difficult the Carquest integration is proving to be.On balance, it was a positive quarter for Advance Auto Parts, but now the company needs to deliver a couple of quarters of solid sales growth -- comparable to its peers -- without any significant hits to margin from integration difficulties. Advance Auto Parts is on the right path, but it still has a long road ahead.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The company posted positive earnings surprise in two of the four trailing quarters, with a positive average surprise of 2.10%.Let's see how things have shaped up for the forthcoming announcement.O'Reilly aggressively pursues the opening of new stores for greater penetration in existing and expansion into new, contiguous markets. During the first nine months of 2016, O'Reilly opened 141 net new stores, in both new and existing markets across the country. A higher number of stores are likely to aid the company's fourth-quarter revenues.O'Reilly pursues an aggressive share repurchase policy, which continues to boost earnings per share. During the first nine months of 2016, the company repurchased 3.7 million shares for $960 million. From Sep 30 through Oct 26, it bought back 0.3 million shares for $71 million.However, O'Reilly's stores are concentrated in few locations in the U.S. Therefore, its business is exposed to the economic and weather conditions of these regions. Additionally, much of O'Reilly's cash is locked in inventories, which can affect its short-term liquidity in periods of low sales.For fourth-quarter 2016, O'Reilly projects earnings per share in the range of $2.44-$2.54, higher than $2.19 earned in the fourth-quarter 2015. The company expects consolidated comparable store sales to increase 3-5% in the quarter.For 2016, the company expects earnings per share in the range of $10.58-$10.68, higher than $9.17 recorded in 2015.

Livestock can be cyclical -- after all, commodity prices fluctuate considerably -- but recessions don't usually stop people from caring about their pets. It's not a foolproof argument, as economic slowdowns tend to cause people to visit veterinary practices a bit less, but the evidence is that animal health does well enough in a recession.For example, I've delved into  's annual reports, and here's how its animal-health sales fared between 2005 and 2012, after which Zoetis Inc  was spun off.Data source: Company accounts. Chart by author.To be fair, revenue did decline by 2% in 2009, but that was due to a 5% negative impact from foreign-exchange movements.Moreover, Zoetis isn't just a stock with defensive properties. Management forecasts revenue growth of between 5.1% and 8.7% from this year to 2017, with adjusted diluted EPS forecast to improve by 16.3% to 24.6%. In addition, now that Zoetis is separate from Pfizer, investors have a chance to get direct exposure to animal health without the regulatory and pipeline uncertainty inherent in big pharma stocks.Now, I know what you're thinking -- but bear with me. Gold, or in this case, the SPDR Gold Shares  ETF, is always touted as an anti-recessionary investment, but its importance is likely to increase should the global economy fall into a recession in future years. The rationale here is that the global economy is in uncharted territory with regard to current debt levels and recessions.The chart below shows debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) for some major countries and the eurozone.

Is this a sign that the company has finally turned the corner? And is it now ready to catch up with its sector peers  (NYSE: AZO) and  (NASDAQ: ORLY) ? data by  .Unfortunately, it's not been plain sailing, and same-store sales growth has lagged that of its peers, while operating margin is seemingly in a downward trend. So what exactly was it about the recent third-quarter results that got the market so excited?I think there were two key takeaways that prompted the market's reaction:Let's tackle each point in turn. As you can see below, the same-store sales decline of only 1% was the best result in three quarters. CEO Tom Greco claimed that \"to date, our investments have driven sales performance at a faster rate than expected\" -- some good news at last.AUTOZONE FIGURES ARE DOMESTIC SAME-STORE SALES AND ARE TO THE MOST RECENT COMPARABLE QUARTER. O'REILLY FIGURES ARE COMPARABLE SAME-STORE SALES. DATA SOURCE: COMPANY PRESENTATIONS. CHART BY AUTHOR.The key points from the company's earnings report included:To put these figures into context, analysts are forecasting $9.63 billion in sales for 2017 and assuming linear growth to a rate of 4% per annum in 2021, meaning revenue could be around $10.9 billion in 2021. Using the adjusted operating income margin of 9.7% in the third quarter as a base suggests that operating income margin could be 14.7% in 2021.In other words, operating income could be $1.6 billion in 2021. In contrast, the average ratio of market cap to operating income for O'Reilly Automotive and AutoZone currently stands at 13.2, and using this figure means Advance Auto's market cap would be $21.1 billion in 2021, representing a 72% increase from today's $12.25 billion.Of course, all of this sounds wonderful, but the previous management clearly thought it had a handle on the integration process as well. What makes things different this time?There are three key signs that the current management might make a better fist of it.First, although he was light on the details (for competitive reasons), Greco signaled that management now has a coherent and clear strategy in place, rather than reacting to difficulties created by the integration as the previous management appeared to be doing.Second, as you can see in the chart below, the pace of consolidations (Carquest stores are consolidated with nearby Advance Auto Parts stores) has slowed. Greco's words offered details: \"We dramatically reduced them by about a third, based on what we originally planned at the time of the deal itself.\" Meanwhile, conversions (Carquest stores are turned into Advance Auto Parts stores) have been \"much more successful overall,\" according to Greco.It's possible the disruptions caused by the pace of previous consolidations caused the faltering sales growth, and now the rate of consolidations is being slowed, Advance Auto Parts might get back to same store sales growth.DATA SOURCE: ADVANCE AUTO PARTS INC. PRESENTATIONS. CHART BY AUTHOR.Third, it appears that management previously overemphasized daily replenishment to stores in the Northeast. According to Greco, \"We had more stores than we should have assigned to them, at a delivery frequency that was very difficult for them to execute flawlessly.\"Shifting the distribution centers toward delivery three times a week has led to \"much better fill rates, like significantly better, much better accuracy, and the general managers are much happier, and they're selling more,\" Greco added.OLD CARS REQUIRE MORE MAINTENANCE -- GOOD NEWS FOR ADVANCE AUTO PARTS INC.

The company said that it expects to report revenue of $4.38 billion, which is down almost 10% from the year-ago period.Even worse, Community Health said that it believes adjusted earnings from continuing operations will show a loss of $0.35 per share, surprising those who were looking for a profit of nearly that much. Between a failure to cut costs as much as expected, reduced reimbursements from government programs, and lower patient volume, Community Health will have to redouble its efforts if it wants to have any chance of regaining the confidence of hard-hit investors.O'Reilly Automotive fell 9% in the wake of its third-quarter financial report Wednesday afternoon. The auto-parts company said that sales rose 7%, sending net income up 5% and reporting earnings of $2.90 per share. Those results weren't quite as good as most investors had expected, and O'Reilly also said that fourth-quarter results would likely come in between $2.44 and $2.54 per share on comparable store sales growth of 3% to 5%.Full-year 2016 guidance also looked weaker than investors wanted to see, including revenue of between $8.5 billion and $8.6 billion, comps growth of 4% to 5%, and earnings of $10.58 to $10.68 per share. With many market participants worried about the state of the auto industry more generally, O'Reilly will have to work to dispel fears that this quarter's performance is just the beginning of a less favorable trend for the retailer.Finally, Cliffs Natural Resources plunged 18%. The iron ore producer reported in its third-quarter report that revenue fell 7% from year-ago levels, and the company failed unexpectedly to post a profit during the quarter. Instead, further losses resulted from weak sales of iron ore in the U.S., and even though the company issued fairly solid guidance both for its domestic and its Asia-Pacific markets for iron ore, some investors are skeptical that Cliffs can hold up well in a tough steel market.Until conditions among the steel companies that buy iron ore from Cliffs become clearer, it will be hard for Cliffs Natural stock to build a lot of positive momentum.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

BABA followed a similar pattern ahead of last quarter's earnings just before making a move from the $80 level to $100 in the wake of a positive report.Because of the consolidation, Alibaba shares are just a few days of selling away from triggering an oversold condition that would help bolster any rally that may occur because of an inline report. In addition, BABA shares are hovering just above the 50-day moving average, which has been considerable support for the stock and it would serve as another technical signal to traders for another surge in prices.Sentiment ahead of the earnings release remains tepid, meaning that it will be easier for Alibaba to impress the Street. This is the same situation that we had last quarter, which resulted in a parabolic move as BA  's top Bollinger band was breached. The lowered volatility over the last two weeks provides a narrower set of bands again, foretelling a higher probability of a volatile move higher.Earnings aren't going to do Ford any favors today as shares are trading almost 2% lower early Thursday morning. F stock has been a market laggard as auto sales continue to see pressure and the implications of higher interest rates on future sales is taking a toll.Before the report, Ford was set in an intermediate-term downtrend identified by strong resistances from its 50-day moving average. Historically, F stock has been very sensitive to the direction of this trendline as the stock is down 2.7 days to each up day when the trendline is declining. The 50-day moving average held as strong resistance in September, triggering an 8% selloff.Today's earnings reaction is likely to set the course to another 7% decline as analysts adjust their price guidelines for Ford's outlook. F shares should find short-term (within the next month) support at the $11-level, which will also coincide with a short-term oversold signal. From there, a move back to $11.50 will likely precede another move lower to a $10.50-point that will begin to get the value proposition buyers involved with a longer-term bottom in Ford shares. Until then, the shorts will remain in charge of F stock.O'Reilly Automotive stock is also on the earnings front today as the company disappointed analyst expectations. ORLY shares were consolidating at the $280 level, setting O'Reilly up for a must-win  that would have provided limited upside. Instead, the earnings disappointment has resulted in immediate pressure to a key support level at $270.Chart support and resistance has been strong at $270 for the last year with ORLY shares finally punching through the price after its last earnings report, which was better than expected. Now, $270 becomes the neckline in an extended head and shoulders pattern that reaches as far back as February 2016.The shift from consolidation to decline on the earnings announcement will shift O'Reilly stock's MACD into a retraction, or negative momentum, adding intermediate-term selling to ORLY's outlook. Adding to this pressure is the fact that the trade has been crowded with bulls this year with nearly 80% of the analysts covering O'Reilly stock ranking it a buy.The clouded earnings reports will cause some target prices to be lowered as well as some likely downgrades.

Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 0.75%. It has delivered positive earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 5.23%.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.For third-quarter 2016, O'Reilly projects earnings per share in the range of $2.77-$2.87, which at the midpoint would represent a 7% increase over EPS of $2.64 in third-quarter 2015. The company expects consolidated comparable store sales to increase 3-5%. Further, O'Reilly pursues an aggressive share repurchase policy, which continues to boost earnings per share.Moreover, the company undertakes the opening of new stores for greater penetration in existing markets and to expand into new, contiguous markets. A higher number of stores are likely to aid the company's third-quarter revenues. In first-half 2016, the company opened 89 net, new stores across 28 states and is on track to hit its target of 210 net, new stores by the end of 2016.However, O'Reilly's stores are concentrated in a few locations in the U.S. Therefore, its business is exposed to the economic and weather conditions of these regions. Additionally, much of O'Reilly's cash is locked in inventories, which can affect its short-term liquidity in periods of low sales. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that O'Reilly is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below: The Earnings ESP represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. O'Reilly's Earnings ESP is -0.34% because the Most Accurate estimate stands at $2.91, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $2.92.

The colleagues have a history of collaboration: They have worked together since 2004, applying the same investment approach Broad Run uses today. As of June 30, 2016, Broad Run had $2.5 billion in assets under management in a sub-advised mutual fund and separately managed accounts (SMAs). The three portfolio managers' track record dates back to Sept. 1, 2009, when they assumed responsibility of the mutual fund.Broad Run manages a concentrated investment strategy with about 20 to 30 stocks and 60% to 80% of assets in the top 10 positions. According to the firm's website, Broad Run aims to invest in high-quality, growth-oriented businesses at discount valuations. The company manages concentrated portfolios because 1) finding superior businesses at discount prices is rare, and 2) it allows the investment team to focus its resources on the most promising businesses. The firm averages about 14% portfolio turnover, implying an average holding period of about 7 years.From its inception on Sept. 1, 2009 through June 30, 2016, Broad Run's Focus Equity Strategy has generated a gross annualized return of 16.2%, and a net (after fees) annualized return of 15.1%, compared to the Russell 3000's 13.5% return. Broad Run's outperformance is driven by its ability to pick winning stocks: It has captured 96% of the market's upside, but only about 85% of its downside.Motley Fool analyst John Rotonti recently interviewed Broad Run's portfolio managers about quality growth investing, valuation, and more. Here's what Macauley, Rainey, and Rothberg had to say.We are focused on finding what some in the industry might call \"compounders,\" or businesses with the competitive position, growth, and management to compound their \"owner earnings\" per share at a mid-teens annualized rate, or higher, for the next decade. There are very few businesses capable of this level of long-term compounding. By our numbers, just 8% of public companies in the U.S. have achieved this hurdle over the last decade, and of those, many started with high expectations / high valuations, so the return an investor received in the stock was quite a bit below the fundamental performance of the business.So we are looking for these compounders at discount valuations, when they are misunderstood, underappreciated, or out of favor. These are not typically the high profile growth companies that get a lot of media attention; we do not own  ,  ,  , or  . We find that businesses with exciting stories and high organic revenue growth rates are usually too expensive for our approach. We usually find opportunity in somewhat less obvious growth businesses. Our sweet spot tends to be businesses with mid- or high-single digit organic revenue growth, with significant operating leverage, free cash flow, and intelligent capital allocation that can get them to mid-teens or higher bottom-line results.Our five investment criteria provide a roadmap, or checklist, to help keep us oriented as we evaluate businesses in search of compounders. While very few, if any, businesses meet the criteria perfectly, it is still a very good litmus test in our research process. The five criteria are: a high-quality business, a large growth opportunity, excellent management, low tail risk, and discount valuation.We view a high quality business as a business possessing a unique, and hard to replicate, competitive position that allows for high returns on capital today and far into the future. A high quality business must have sustainable competitive advantages (high customer switching cost, low cost position, proprietary know-how, government license, network effects, etc.) and an ethos that seeks to enhance that advantage over time.We look to invest with management teams skilled at both operations and capital allocation, motivated with proper economic incentives, and possessing a long-term mindset. Of these considerations, it is hard to overemphasize the importance of skilled capital allocation. Consider a new CEO hired to run a 100-year-old business. If that business earns a 12% return on equity today, and that ROE can be sustained, then in six years time the firm's equity base will have doubled. In just six years, the CEO will be responsible for investing 50% of all equity capital ever invested in a century-old business. Over time, there is significant power to create -- or destroy -- shareholder value based upon what is done with a firm's profits and balance sheet.In investing, the power of compound interest is the investor's best friend. With enough time, the power of compounding can carry the investor to a wonderful outcome. So our first consideration in investing is to try to avoid mistakes that could interrupt the power of compounding. This means that we are ever watchful for \"tail risks\" that could wipe out an investment: excess financial leverage, unsustainable levels of demand, fad or obsolescence risk, excessive valuation, etc. We attempt to avoid businesses where rapid change or complexity make it too difficult for us to have a confident opinion about what the company, and its profitability, will look like in ten years.Our approach is business first, valuation second. We only want to own businesses we would be comfortable owning for five or ten years. If the business is not appealing, the valuation does not matter to us. If the business is appealing, then we use a two-pronged valuation approach to assess if it is trading at a discount price. We look for investments that can pass both of our valuation tests.First, as a blunt tool, we use price to owner earnings (\"P/OE\"), P/E, EV/EBITDA, EV/EBIT and other traditional valuation ratios that may make sense in the given circumstances. We look at these ratios on a trailing and forward year basis, and consider their current level in relation to the long-term levels for the company and its peers. Of these metrics, for most companies, our favorite is P/OE. We have traditionally been able to pay mid teens P/OE for these high quality compounders that we think will grow bottom line results at a mid-teens rate over the long term.Second, we create a five-year financial forecast of a business to determine a reasonable range of future values (and expected returns from today's stock price). This forecast incorporates our well-informed assumptions about revenue growth, margins / operating leverage, free cash flow generation, balance sheet changes, and management's capital reinvestment decisions. We stress test the forecast to understand potential upside and downside variance. We are typically trying to underwrite investments to a mid-teens expected annualized return in a base case scenario, with positive returns even in a downside scenario.We are willing to pay somewhat higher multiples, but are not stretching much. We are still finding and owning businesses that, for the most part, are trading at mid teens multiples of our estimate of next twelve month owner earnings.With our long-term investment horizon, we focus on what we believe to be the true underlying economics of a business, rather than EPS and GAAP accounting numbers that may or may not provide a good measure of economic reality. Our preferred metric is \"owner earnings,\" a term coined by Warren Buffett in his 1986 Berkshire Hathaway annual shareholder letter. Owner earnings is the amount an owner of a business could take out of the business each year without diminishing the competitive position or future earnings power of that business. In some cases owner earnings are the same as GAAP net income, but in other cases adjustments are required to get to the real economics of the business. For example, in certain situations, we believe book value per share growth at a financial institution, adjusted funds from operation (AFFO) at a real estate intensive business, or amortization-adjusted earnings at an acquisitive software company are better measures of economic profits and progress than GAAP accounting earnings.We are primarily focused on the U.S., where we can best understand the language, legal, regulatory, and business environment, and customer motivations. In the U.S., there are about 2,300 companies with greater than a $500 million market cap. About one-third of these companies are in industries that are clearly unattractive within our investment framework, leaving about 1,500 that could be investable.Beyond this, there is no single computer screen or formula that can identify companies that fit our mold, so we employ an eclectic search process. We systematically sort through industries looking for interesting businesses. Some ideas are the result of continuous reading of annual reports and periodicals, some spring from our travel to meet with companies in the field, and others are a product of one investment being tangential to the next.Over the last decade, we have accumulated several hundred businesses that are interesting to us and worth monitoring. We also maintain a more refined watch list of about 75 companies that we have studied closely, that measure well against our business criteria, and where we are waiting for attractive entry points.We have historically found the specialty financial, consumer, and business services areas fertile hunting ground for competitively differentiated businesses with large growth opportunities. Conversely, we do not find these traits in oil and gas, commodities, traditional banks, semiconductors, or computer and electronics hardware, so we avoid these spaces.There are four reasons we will sell a position: we find a better investment idea in which to invest the capital, we become concerned about the business's long-term prospects, valuation (our expected annual return in our five-year scenario analysis drops below 10%), or for portfolio-level risk management purposes. Of these, the vast majority of our sales occur because we find a better investment idea in which to invest the capital.Valuation and price targets -- which are implicit in our five-year 10% expected return scenarios -- rarely become a factor, because we typically swap out an existing idea for a new idea well before that point.We do not believe that debt is intrinsically bad, and cash intrinsically good. We believe a company's balance sheet needs to be viewed in the context of where that business is in its corporate lifecycle, and the predictability of its cash flow. A high growth business with lots of acquisition opportunity would be shortsighted to carry any meaningful financial leverage except to finance a highly accretive acquisition. Conversely, a slow growth business with highly predictable cash flow, little capex, and few acquisition opportunities would optimize returns to equity holders by sustaining some financial leverage. We want management to be thoughtful about using the balance sheet, and we try to avoid management teams that use too much or too little leverage in their given circumstances.Among other things, we consider debt-to-EBITDA, interest coverage, fixed versus floating interest obligations, and debt repayment / refinancing timelines. But again, the acceptable and appropriate level of leverage and balance sheet strength depends upon the nature of the business and the circumstances.We manage a concentrated, conviction-weighted portfolio. Typically we hold 20 to 30 total positions with 60% to 80% of assets in the top ten positions. While this is an unconventional approach -- most investment managers are much more diversified - we believe it allows us to provide magnified exposure to our best ideas while still maintaining adequate economic diversification across the holdings.When sizing individual positions, we take into consideration: 1) our confidence in the business's long-term financial prospects (a function of its fit with our investment criteria, the nature of the business, and our depth of knowledge) and 2) its valuation / expected long-term return profile.At the portfolio level, we contemplate how individual businesses interact as part of the whole. We attempt to limit overall exposure to any one industry or business factor risk. Our attempt is to build a portfolio in which we have high confidence in the component businesses, while also having high long-term expected returns. We seek enough diversification so that when one or several of these businesses encounter(s) a setback, the balance of holdings can carry the overall portfolio forward.Since we typically hold an investment for many years, we conduct our research with an eye toward understanding the opportunity for a business over the next decade. Most of our research is focused on evaluating those things that can make an important difference in the long term, i.e. demand, the competitive structure of the industry, management quality, and the sustainability of pricing and margins.To build this knowledge, we begin by conducting industry standard research by reading annual reports, SEC filings, financial statements, attending presentations, and meeting with senior management. But to really understand a business, we find it is important to dig deeper. So we often visit company facilities, meet with field level employees, talk to customers, interview former employees, attend industry trade shows, and speak with public and private competitors. While this is hard and time consuming work, we believe it gives us an understanding of a company and its industry that can build our conviction in an investment thesis, and lead to important investment insights.In most cases, when we find a high quality growth company it is not available at an attractive price. So we place it on our watch list where we monitor the business and wait -- sometimes for years -- for the market to present an attractive entry point.We have a small investment team and operate as generalists. We have a primary analyst assigned to each business in the portfolio and on the watch list, but we work as a team to understand those businesses and make investment decisions. We meet informally every day, and have a formal research meeting scheduled once a week. Most of the time consuming business research can be conducted in the office and over the phone, but we get out and travel several times a month for meetings with management, visits to company sites, and other due diligence efforts.It has been our experience that we get the best results by paying a good price for a great business, rather than a great price for a good business.Most of our losers have been businesses that didn't grow their earning as quickly as we expected, or at all. We have owned few businesses that have gone materially backwards with significant and sustained earnings declines. Since we try to buy businesses at modest valuations, our losers have underperformed the market, but have not delivered significant capital losses.On one hand, this confirms for us that we have a pretty good valuation and business analysis discipline in place. On the other hand, we still get businesses wrong. Every losing investment teaches you a new lesson. We try to learn from these experiences, but the reality is that every business, every situation is different, and no matter how many lessons we learn from past mistakes, we will find new mistakes to make in the future.We think our five criteria provide a good framework for not only picking winners, but also avoiding losers. If we can keep these criteria in mind -- buy well-run, quality businesses at good prices -- then we think our future mistakes can be moderated, and our losses contained.We like to see management compensation skewed to long-term results, with an important return on capital or return on equity component.As long as we pay a reasonable price for a business and that business is growing its owner earnings at a nice rate, we do not worry about a stagnant stock price. In fact, some of our best purchases have been in businesses where earning have been growing, but stock price has not. (NASDAQ: ORLY) O'Reilly is one the three largest aftermarket auto parts retailer-distributors in the U.S. We think O'Reilly has set up its business to win over the long term. Management has invested in a robust distribution network that allows the company to provide a very high level of service to retail and commercial customers. This network is unrivaled in the industry, expensive / hard to replicate, and has allowed O'Reilly to gradually gain market share and grow its geographic footprint over time. In the U.S., we think the company has 7-plus years of mid- to high-teens EPS compounding in front of it, with international growth opportunities beyond.We do not know if the business can sustain its current low to mid 20s P/E multiple -- it is elevated compared to the company's historical mid-teens multiple range. However, with our growth outlook, we think we will get an attractive long-term return in the stock, even if the multiple contracts to its historical range over time.We have no idea what the stock market will do in the short-term or even the next few years. But we do monitor long-term market valuation metrics to get a sense for how attractive or unattractive the overall environment is. Using long-term fundamental ratios (stock market capitalization-to-GDP, price-to-cyclically adjusted earnings [CAPE or Schiller PE], enterprise value to replacement cost [Tobins-q]) the market is modestly elevated relative to its long-term valuation history. However, we are in a very low inflation and interest rate environment, which at least partially -- and perhaps wholly -- justify this modest valuation premium.Our view is that even if the market is somewhat overvalued, it does not mean there will be a correction (although there of course could be!). It simply means that all investors should expect somewhat lower long-term investment returns from here, as valuation levels return to the mean over time. For us, it is clearly more difficult to find cheap stocks in this environment than it was several years ago, but our concentrated strategy serves us well, as we need relatively few compelling ideas to drive performance in the portfolio.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

What's going on, and what should investors make of it all?Image source: Getty Images.For those new to the company, the  for the stock sees the company as the value play in a sector experiencing favorable tailwinds. By integrating Carquest's Do It For Me (DIFM) heavy sales into existing Advance Auto Parts stores, the company is supposed to be transforming itself into a dual-store (DIY & DIFM) in the same way  (NASDAQ: ORLY) did in 2008 with its purchase of CSK.Unfortunately, the integration isn't  . The process of converting Carquest stores to Advance Auto Parts stores and consolidating (merging stores together) is causing customer disruptions, supply chain disruptions, IT integration issues, and inventory build-ups.As you can see below, the key issue is falling sales -- all the more disappointing because rivals like O'Reilly and the DIY-focused  (NYSE: AZO) continue to generate good same-store sales growth.Data source: Company presentations. AutoZone figures are domestic same-store sales figures and adjusted to Advance Auto Parts' quarters.As the chart above suggests (O'Reilly Automotive is the best comparator because of its mix of DIY and DIFM sales), Advance Auto Parts's problems are company specific rather than an industry issue. Indeed, CEO Tom Greco acknowledged the point on the recent : \"You know I think if you look at our comparative performance, you would say the majority of it is self inflicted.\"From an investment perspective, this means the stock probably has upside potential if management can execute its integration plan successfully.Unfortunately, the integration is not running to plan. The company's previous management started 2016 predicting low same-store sales growth and an adjusted operating income margin of 12% for the full year. Fast-forward to second-quarter earnings, and current management now expects \"annual comp store sales\" to be down 3% to 5% for the full year.It gets worse. As sales are falling, the company is suffering margin compression because of its high fixed-cost base. For example, adjusted operating income margin was 10.8% in the second quarter compared to 12% in the same period last year -- management has abandoned its target of getting to 12% for the full yearCFO Mike Norona discussed margin on the :In addition, there are other factors that are likely to impact earnings and cash flow in the next few quarters:Clearly, there is a lot more work to be done before sales starts stabilizing. The problem for investors is that, as sales fall, operating profits are likely to fall even more (because of the deleveraging discussed above). In other words, the current valuation could get more expensive if sales fall.The underlying investment case remains compelling. For example, if Advance Auto Parts closes the operating margin gap with AutoZone and O'Reilly Automotive, the upside potential is significant. Based on current revenue, if Advance Auto Parts gets back to 12% operating margin and is valued at enterprise value (market cap plus debt) to revenue comparable to O'Reilly Automotive (which also has good balance of DIY and DIFM sales), then the stock has a near 60% upside from current levels. data by  .The problem is the immediate outlook doesn't look good -- management has candidly prepared investors for potential margin compression -- and until the company demonstrates it can stem the tide of falling sales, investors have a right to be cautious.

For the SPDR MFS Systematic Growth Equity ETF (Symbol: SYG), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $68.09 per unit.With SYG trading at a recent price near $61.99 per unit, that means that analysts see 9.85% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of SYG's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Lear Corp. (Symbol: LEA), Michael Kors Holdings Ltd (Symbol: KORS), and O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.

Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

Among the largest underlying components of PWB, in trading today Ross Stores, Inc. (Symbol: ROST) is down about 0.1%, Yum! Brands, Inc. (Symbol: YUM) is down about 0.2%, and O'Reilly Automotive, Inc.

The chart below shows the one year price performance of PWB, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, PWB's low point in its 52 week range is $27.05 per share, with $32.49 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $31.83. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photoIn early trading on Friday, shares of Autodesk (  ) topped the list of the day's best performing components of the Nasdaq 100 index, trading up 4.1%.

However, it will gain from management's relentless focus on store expansion.Advance Auto Parts reported a 16.3% decrease in adjusted earnings to $1.90 per share in the second quarter (ended Jul 16, 2016) of fiscal 2016 from $2.27 earned in the prior-year quarter. The figure also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.13.Revenues dropped 4.8% year over year to $2.26 billion but surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.24 billion. The year-over-year decline in the top line was due to a fall in comparable store sales, store closures in 2015 and the effect of Carquest consolidations.Moreover, Advance Auto Parts is expected to deliver a poor performance in fiscal 2016. For fiscal 2016, the company expects comparable store sales growth to be in the range of negative 3% to negative 5%, weaker than flat comparable store sales in fiscal 2015. Moreover, it no longer expects to achieve its adjusted operating margin target of 12% and free cash flow of $500 million.Additionally, price competition poses a concern for Advance Auto Parts, as it competes with national and regional automotive retailers such as AutoZone, Inc.  , O'Reilly Automotive Inc.  and U.S. Auto Parts Network, Inc.  .However, Advance Auto Parts' consistent focus on store expansion helps it enhance profits.

HD has successfully thwarted AMZN's intrusion in several ways.First, HD sells a lot of extremely large items that are difficult to ship efficiently in small quantities.In addition, HD's customer base tends to be very hands-on. HD shoppers prefer to get a feel for what they are buying for their homes in-store rather than relying exclusively on photos and customer reviews.Finally, HD is no slouch itself when it comes to e-commerce. In fact, HD operates one of the 10 largest e-commerce businesses in the U.S. based  .With a delayed Millennial housing boom only beginning, HD's market looks poised to deliver long-term growth in coming years. The retail giant is one of few that have delivered impressive 20%-plus revenue growth in the face of competition from Amazon.ULTA has also figured out a way to offer in-store customers something that AMZN cannot: interactive experts. ULTA shoppers often like to try different makeup styles and brands while shopping. They can also get instant, personalized feedback and advice from in-store experts.According to Piper Jaffray analyst  , the experts are \"floating artists and sales people who can talk intelligently about a beauty trend who aren't (commissioned) to sell you a specific brand.\"Clearly, customers enjoy the in-store ULTA experience. The retail stock's bottom line reflects that success. Last quarter, ULTA delivered 23.7% revenue growth and an impressive 38.8% e-commerce growth.In addition, the company is collecting valuable data on its 18 million Ultamate Rewards members. ULTA is learning about shopping habits and constructing personalized sales messages. It seems to be embracing the best of both the in-store and online retail environments.Clearly, not even AMZN can slow the company down.ORLY and its rivals  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) may have out-Amazoned Amazon when it comes to distribution.Roughly two-thirds of ORLY's sales go to professional auto repair buyers. These buyers don't want parts in 24 hours or even in one hour. They want parts now. Otherwise, they will be sitting around the garage losing money.The \"big four\" auto parts suppliers have distribution networks set up around the country that can  parts in about a half hour. It would be very difficult for AMZN to do it any better.For larger customers like car dealerships and do-it-yourself customers who can afford to wait until the weekend, AMZN's free shipping can likely undercut ORLY's prices. However, discount online auto parts stores like  have been around since the late 1990s. If these online retailers haven't hindered ORLY's growth, why should Amazon? Once again, it seems there is very little for Amazon to disrupt.Of the \"big four\" auto parts retail stocks, ORLY has the best annual  over the last five years (25.4%). It also has the highest projected annual earnings growth over the next five years (15.4%).In April, ORLY reported 10% revenue growth for Q1.

The chairman of the committee sent a letter to Tesla CEO Elon Musk requesting a briefing by Jul 29, per Reuters. The Committee also wants to know the actions taken by Tesla following the incident.Tesla had earlier revealed that the vehicle was driving on a divided highway and the Autopilot was functional when a tractor trailer came across, perpendicular to the Model S. The Autopilot as well as the driver did not notice the white side of the tractor trailer due to the glare of the sun and hence, the brake was not applied.The electric carmaker is already facing a preliminary evaluation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for the performance of its Autopilot system due to the fatal crash. Recently, it was also reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is examining whether Tesla made a potential securities law breach by not informing its investors about the crash.Meanwhile, Musk revealed that a second crash involving Tesla's Model X that occurred on Jul 1 in Pennsylvania could have been prevented if the Autopilot system was activated. This crash has also been under NHTSA investigation to see if the Autopilot system was operational during the crash. However, Musk revealed that the system was not active in the car at the time. | Tesla currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 4.02%. It has delivered positive earnings surprises in all four trailing quarters, with an average beat of 5.75%.Let's see how things have shaped up for the forthcoming announcement.For second-quarter 2016, O'Reilly projects earnings per share in the range of $2.54-$2.64, higher than $2.29 recorded in the year-ago quarter. The company expects consolidated comparable store sales to increase 3%-5%. O'Reilly also pursues an aggressive share repurchase policy, which continues to boost earnings per share.Further, the company undertakes the opening of new stores for greater penetration in existing markets and to expand into new, contiguous markets. A higher number of stores will help enhance the company's second-quarter revenues.However, O'Reilly's stores are concentrated in a few locations in the U.S. Therefore, its business is exposed to the economic and weather conditions of these regions. In addition, much of O'Reilly's cash is locked in inventories, which can affect its short-term liquidity in periods of low sales.Our proven model does not conclusively show that O'Reilly is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below: The Earnings ESP represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. O'Reilly's Earnings ESP is -1.50% because the Most Accurate estimate stands at $2.63, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.67. O'Reilly carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. | Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Westport Fuel Systems Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +9.09% and a Zacks Rank #3.

In any case, there's no denying that NetEase has been one of the best investments to gain exposure to surging internet usage in China.A decade ago, alternative beverage specialist Hansen Natural counted Monster energy drinks as just a small part of a portfolio that included teas, sodas, lemonades, and sports drinks. But the highly caffeinated brand grew to dominate its finances to such an extent that the company renamed itself Monster Beverage in 2012.

This ruling has exposed the company to several additional liabilities.General Motors has long been facing the heat for delaying the recall of 2.6 million vehicles with defective ignition switches, which can lead to shutting down of the engine and prevent deployment of front airbags in the event of a crash. The defect has been linked to 124 deaths and 275 injuries. The company issued a recall in Feb 2014, although the problem was identified back in 2001. Lawfully, automakers are supposed to alert the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\"NHTSA\") about any safety issue in vehicles within five business days of recognizing the problem.The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said that General Motors was aware of the defective switches when it went bankrupt but had concealed the fact. The new company which emerged after bankruptcy was free of the claims against the pre-bankruptcy company, or Old General Motors. Thus, the automaker had stopped crash victims from claiming compensation, depriving them of their rights. With the new rule being effective, hundreds of pre-bankruptcy claims can go ahead, including some lawsuits claiming that the value of the automaker's vehicles has declined as a result of its actions.Around 1,000 death and injury lawsuits were awaiting the appeals court's verdict. In addition, the ruling may affect 399 injury and death cases which were settled by the automaker through compensation expert Kenneth Feinberg for $594.5 million in total. General Motors has already coughed up $2 billion as settlements for the defective ignition switches with the U.S. Justice Department, shareholders and consumers. | The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked automobile stocks include O'Reilly Automotive Inc.  , Spartan Motors Inc.  and U.S. Auto Parts Network, Inc.  , all carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The program guaranteed the resale value of a Tesla Model S after three years of purchase through one of the automaker's loan financing programs.The program which had been updated guaranteed that the value of the vehicle being resold will be higher than that of premium vehicles of manufacturers including BMW, Audi, Lexus, and Jaguar models. Tesla had introduced this program to reassure the buyers of Model S about the resale value of the vehicles in the market. The automaker also considered that this program would help it control its secondary market. Generally, premium vehicles' customers resell their old vehicles for latest upgraded models within a few years of purchase. This makes resale value an important point of consideration for customers.Tesla has undertaken this strategy in order to keep interest rates low as well as to offer a compelling lease and loan program to customers, per a company spokesperson. According to the company, the program was initially necessary to reassure customers, but now its vehicles are holding their value. Therefore, the program is no longer required.The resale value liability had been increasing over time, and this proved to be challenging for the electric carmaker. As of Mar 31, the liability due to the resale value guarantee was $1.58 billion. In fact, the resale value liability increased by more than 20% since year-end 2015.Simultaneously, Tesla announced a cheaper version of the Model X crossover.

The rear wheel drive Model S 60 has a base price of $66,000, which can go down to $58,500 after a $7,500 federal tax credit. The car offers a range of 210 miles and a top speed of 130 mph, which can be increased to 246 miles and 140 mph, respectively, with a 75 kWh upgrade.

But such a strategy does not always guarantee returns. A critical analysis of the company's financial background is always required for a better investment decision.A company's fundamentals should be sound enough to meet its financial obligations. This can be judged through coverage ratios - the higher these are the more efficient an enterprise will be in meeting its financial obligations. The focus of this article is on Interest Coverage which is one such ratio.Interest Coverage Ratio is used to determine how effectively a company can pay the interest charges on its debt.Debt, which is very important for most of the companies to finance operations, comes at a cost called interest. Interest expense has a direct bearing on the profitability of a company and the company's creditworthiness depends on how effectively it meets its interest obligations. Therefore, Interest Coverage Ratio is one of the important criteria to factor in before making any investment decision. . Interest Coverage Ratio suggests the number of times the interest could be paid from earnings and also gauges the margin of safety a firm carries for paying interest.An interest coverage ratio lower than 1.0 implies that the company is unable to fulfill its interest obligations, and could default in repaying debt. A company that is capable of generating earnings well above its interest expense can withstand financial hardship. Definitely, one should also track the company's past performance to determine whether the interest coverage ratio has improved or worsened over a period of time.Apart from having an Interest Coverage Ratio that is more than the industry average, adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a  of \"A\" or \"B\" to your search criteria should lead to better results.

These workers bribed Chinese shipbuilders, including those at shipyards, some of which are owned by the Chinese government, in order to gain business and profit themselves. The company had therefore voluntarily reported the situation to the SEC. It also conducted a detailed investigation into the issue and said that it will cooperate with the U.S. authorities.The SEC identified that during the period 2007 to 2013, around 19 workers of Johnson Controls' subsidiary, China Marine, used fake vendors to make payments of about $4.9 million. The agency further alleged that Johnson Controls incorrectly recorded the payments in its books and this transaction led to a profit of $11.8 million.The SEC put forward that Johnson Controls was aware of the bribery at the time of acquiring China Marine. This is a wholly-owned subsidiary that Johnson Controls gained through its 2005 buyout of York International. Though Johnson Controls implemented different strategies to address the issue, it could not stop the illegal practice.The company neither admitted to nor denied the findings of the SEC.

However, the company closed the day's trading a trifle lower at $47.02.Shares of this distributor of roofing materials and building products reached an all-time high on the back of expected benefits from acquisitions, focus on greenfield growth as well as sustained demand in re-roofing activity.The company has a market cap of $2.8 billion. It has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 31.10%. The average volume of shares traded over the last three months was roughly 765K, with a solid one-year return of over 49.8% and year-to-date return of 14.2%. | Beacon Roofing has expanded its business through strategic acquisitions and diversification of its product offering. In Apr 2016, the company acquired Atlantic Building Products and Lyf-Tym. It also announced the buyout of Fox Brothers Company, which sells complementary and residential roofing products. Further, its takeover of Woodfeathers will help in capacity expansion in the key Pacific-Northwest market.Notably, Beacon Roofing continues to focus on organic greenfield growth. It opened one new branch in 2016, six new Beacon branches in 2015, 26 new branches in 2014, and 10 new branches in 2013.

Net sales from re-roofing are expected to improve as the median age of owner occupied housing has increased from 23 years in 1985 to 38 years in 2013, according to the U.S. Census data. The aging U.S. housing stock, combined with below average roofing shingle volumes, supports a favorable supply/demand dynamic in the residential repair and remodel market in the coming years.These positive factors have led the company to enhance its revenues guidance to the range of $4.1-$4.2 billion for fiscal 2016.

(Symbol: ORLY) stock, but tentative about paying the going market price of $260.29/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the November put at the $230 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $6.60. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2.9% return against the $230 commitment, or a 6.2% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to ORLY's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $230 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. sees its shares fall 11.8% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $223.40 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $6.60 from $230), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 6.2% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $230 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the November put at the $230 strike for the 6.2% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $260.29) to be 23%.

This is especially true as sales dropped 6% year over year to an annualized 17.45 million units in May due to weak demand for sedans and fewer selling days, as per Autodata Corp. This marks the biggest monthly drop in nearly six years.Five of the six major American and Japanese automakers reported steep declines last month. General Motors  led the way with an 18% drop, followed by sales decreases of 9.6% for Toyota  , 6.1% for Ford Motor  , 4.8% for Honda  , and 1% for Nissan  . On the other hand, Fiat Chrysler sales rose 1.5% year over year last month.The numbers were discouraging as Americans generally boost their purchase of cars in May to take advantage of higher incentives and Memorial Day bonanzas ahead of the summer selling season. As a result, the decline could be a sign that U.S. auto sales are reaching  after six straight years of growth - a streak not seen since the 1920s (read:  ).However, the trends are still favorable for the automakers given that the momentum in the U.S. economy has picked up after a slowdown in the first quarter. Higher demand for sports utility vehicles, a plethora of new models, fuel-efficient and technologically advanced vehicles, low interest rates, easy availability of credit and the need to replace aging vehicles will fuel growth in the coming months.As such, investors could view the current data and the resulting fall in the share price of automakers as an entry point. For them, we have highlighted a couple of ETFs and stocks from this corner of the market that are in focus and could be excellent choices in the coming months.First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto ETF This fund offers a pure play global exposure to 37 auto stocks by tracking the NASDAQ OMX Global Auto Index. It is a large-cap centric fund and is highly concentrated on the top four prime automakers - Honda, Ford, General Motors and Toyota - that combined to make up for 31.3% share. In terms of country exposure, Japan takes the top spot at 36.1% while the U.S. and Germany round off the next two spots with 23.2% and 19.1% share, respectively (read:  ).CARZ has a lower level of $39.6 million in AUM and trades in a small average daily trading volume of around 9,000 shares. The product charges 70 bps in fees per year and has a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 or 'Hold' rating with a High risk outlook.While XLY provides broad exposure to the consumer discretionary space, investors could go for this product as it has at least 7% allocation to the auto industry. It holds 91 securities in its basket and some well know automakers like Ford, General Motor, O'Reilly Automotive  and Delphi Automotive  make up for a nice mix in the portfolio (see:  ).It is the largest and the most popular product in the consumer discretionary space with AUM of nearly $10.4 billion and average daily volume of more than 7.7 million shares. It charges 14 bps in annual fees and has a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 or 'Buy' rating with a Medium risk outlook.While all the auto stocks are in focus for the coming days, we have highlighted those that have the potential to move higher than their peers. To accomplish this, we have used our  to find out the best stocks in the auto space having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a VGM Style Score of 'A'. The combination of these two offers the best upside potential with strong momentum, cheap price and robust growth.Based in Southfield, Michigan, Lear Corporation is a global leader in designing, developing, engineering, manufacturing, assembling, and supplying automotive seating, electrical distribution systems, and related components primarily to automotive original equipment manufacturers worldwide.The stock has an above-industry earnings and revenue growth rate of 19.69% and 4.12%, respectively, for this year. The PEG ratio of 0.58 versus the industry average of 1.11 reflects that the company is a solid value play at the current levels (read:  ).Based in Chicago, Illinois, LKQ is the largest nationwide provider of recycled OEM automotive replacement parts and related services, with sales and processing facilities and redistribution centers that reach most major markets in the United States.The company's earnings and revenue are expected to grow at a respective rate of 27.46% and 27.77% for this year, much higher than the industry average of 24.88% and 3.03%. The PEG ratio of 0.98 is well below the industry average of 1.23, suggesting that the stock is a bargain hunt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download  .

O'Reilly will repurchase the shares from the open market. However, the timing and amount of the repurchases will depend on various factors including market conditions and share price.The hike in share repurchase authorization reflects O'Reilly's strong liquidity position.

In the first quarter of 2016, net cash flow from operations increased to $488.2 million from $406 million in the prior-year period.O'Reilly had approved another $750 million increase in its share repurchase program in Feb 2016.

The top four retail chains held about $36.4 billion of those sales. Parts sales through new car dealerships continued to dominate, with more than $60 billion in sales, according to the Auto Care Association (ACA).But the fastest-rising piece of the business came from Amazon and other online providers, including sites of auto parts retailers such as AutoZone, which together delivered $6 billion in auto parts sales. The ACA forecasts that online aftermarket auto parts sales will grow to $28.8 billion, or 20% of the $147 billion total, in 2023.The question is: Can AutoZone, O'Reilly Automotive and other auto parts chains continue to thrive as the Amazons of the world expand further into auto parts and services?Auto parts retailers say they are confident. They do things that Amazon and other large online retailers can't, giving them what they see as a tactical advantage, according to O'Reilly Automotive investor relations director Mark Merz.\"There are two dynamics that, in our industry, really do require the brick-and-mortar locations,\" Merz told IBD. \"No. 1 is the immediacy needs of our business. If a car is broken, you have to get it fixed now.\"And though Amazon can deliver a part within hours, an auto parts store is likely no more than 30 minutes away. More importantly, if the part doesn't fit it's just another 30 minutes to return to the store and exchange it for one that does.The second factor is a high level of service. Auto parts retailers carefully nurture relationships with customers -- particularly with high-volume wholesale customers. They make sure salespeople are knowledgeable and able to answer customers' questions and do minor servicing, such as battery testing and replacement.Factoid: The average age of light vehicles -- cars and pickups -- on U.S. roads rose from about 11 years old at the end of 2010 to roughly 11.5 years in 2015. And total miles driven rose to a record 3.12 trillion last year, up from 2.99 trillion in 2014.Both are good signs for parts retailers.Meanwhile, the auto parts retailers have been consolidating. Between 2007 and 2010, there were a total of 163 merger-and-acquisition transactions in the auto care industry, ACA said. That figure skyrocketed to 483 between 2011 and 2014.Brian Collie, a partner and managing director at Boston Consulting Group, said many of those deals were done by what he calls the \"Big Four\" auto parts retailers: AutoZone,  (  ), O'Reilly Automotive and  (GPC)-owned NAPA Auto Parts.The foursome accounts for almost 40% of industry sales, up from about 25% in 2005. They now address the bulk of the $47 billion in annual sales (in 2013) for do-it-yourself mechanics. They have also picked up a piece of the $89 billion (in 2013) annual sales to do-it-for-me mechanics and repair shops, a market still ruled by auto dealership parts departments.\"(The big chains) have done a nice job driving consolidation and picking up market share along the way,\" Collie said.Asked whether online retailers like Amazon are a threat to traditional brick-and-mortar retailers like AutoZone, Collie replied: \"Certainly you do see online emerging as a more popular channel. Its (sales are) still in single digits in the auto aftermarket channels, but it has been growing. It's something brick-and-mortar retailers are paying attention to.\"Others in the auto parts retailer group include  (CPRT), which conducts salvaged vehicle auctions for insurers, auto dealerships and others, and  (LKQ), which sells recycled and refurbished auto parts, mainly to mechanical and auto body repair shops.LKQ Chief Financial Officer Nick Zarcone said Amazon isn't a rival, it's a partner. \"Not every part they sell comes out of their warehouse. We are a partner of Amazon, but we don't use Amazon for delivery. Almost all of our deliveries are on our own vehicles.\"Collie says one challenge goes back to the vehicle age question. While the overall U.S. auto fleet is aging, the number of cars in the \"sweet spot\" for auto repairs -- five to 10 years old -- is at the lowest level in years, he said.Cars that are one to five years old are under warranty. For cars over 10 years old, owners often put off all but the most critical repairs. According to ACA data there were 103.7 million cars in the middle -- the sweet spot -- in 2011. The trade group expects that number to fall to 85.6 million this year and continue declining until 2018.Collie doesn't see that as a big hurdle though. \"We have had six years of great growth. That sweet spot will do just fine,\" he said.AutoZone, with roughly $10.4 billion annual sales, has reported double-digit earnings-per-share growth for 36 quarters in a row. Analyst consensus projects a 14% year-over-year EPS increase this quarter to $10.93 a share. Sales are forecast to rise 6% to $2.6 billion. The company reports its fiscal third quarter results on May 24.AutoZone shares briefly topped a cup-with-handle buy point in March and April, then eased back into a flat base with an 810.10 buy point. Shares traded 4% below that buy point on Friday, but they were wrestling resistance at their 10-week moving average.CEO Bill Rhodes told analysts on the company's March 1 fiscal Q2  that AutoZone has \"been aggressive on our technology investments,\" including its website and apps for  (GOOGL)-owned Google Android and  (AAPL) mobile devices. \"We realize as customers have become much more tech- and mobile-savvy, we have to have a sales proposition that touches all the ways they desire to interact with us,\" Rhodes said.Advance Auto Parts posted $9.7 billion revenue in 2015 but has struggled of late. The Roanoke, Va.-based company's fiscal Q4 earnings slipped 11%, not as bad as expected. But revenue also fell 9% to $2.03 billion, its first top- and bottom-line decline in more than three years. On April 4, the company named Thomas Greco CEO. He succeeded George Sherman, who had served as interim CEO since January. Advance Auto reports its Q1 results next Thursday, and shares are in need of a boost. The stock has declined in six of seven weeks since failing to retake support at its 40-week moving average in April.O'Reilly Automotive ramped up revenue to $8.2 billion last year, gaining market share and posting double-digit revenue growth for five quarters in a row, during which time rival AutoZone's sales grew in the single digits. Advance Auto's sales grew in single digits for three straight quarters prior to last quarter's decline.O'Reilly's stock boasts a 94 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed 94% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth in recent quarters. Shares have sagged since failing to successfully clear a six-month cup base in April, and they now face resistance at their 50-day moving average.Genuine Parts has $15.3 billion a year in revenue. Its sells office products, electronics and auto parts through 6,000-plus NAPA Auto Parts stores in the U.S. and subsidiaries overseas. Auto parts sales last quarter were $1.93 billion, putting it on par with O'Reilly and Advance Auto.Genuine Parts' quarterly EPS has been flat for four quarters in a row, and it's reported lower total year-over-year revenue two of the last four periods. Its shares are six weeks into a flat consolidation that could qualify as a base. But its Relative Strength Rating is a relatively weak 75, and its Accumulation/Distribution Rating -- an indicator of buying interest among institutional investors -- is a soft C-.S&P Global Market Intelligence analyst Efraim Levy says prospects are good for auto parts retailers, and he doesn't see Amazon as a threat for now.\"Automakers are selling more vehicles than ever, and consumers are driving them more too,\" as jobs and economic growth spur commuting and vacations, Levy said in an interview. \"Gas prices remain low, allowing people to drive more and putting more money in wallets that they can spend on products for their vehicles.\"Levy has a hold rating on AutoZone, with a 12-month price target of 820, and he rates O'Reilly Automotive a hold with a 289 target. He cited valuation for the hold ratings. \"I see upside for them, but not enough to outperform the (stock) market,\" he said. Levy doesn't track other auto parts retailers.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["uto parts retailer  (NYSE: AAP) has serially disappointed investors in the last year, while peers such as  (NYSE: AZO) and  (NASDAQ: ORLY) have powered ahead in terms of operational performance and stock price.Advance Auto parts is having difficulty integrating an acquisition that was supposed to transform the company's fortunes. Meanwhile, senior management have left and company guidance has been slashed for 2016. Is it madness to consider buying the stock? I don't think so, and here's why. data by  .I see three reasons to be positive on the stock:The auto parts market distinguished itself in the last recession by producing same-store sales growth throughout. The reason is simple: When times are hard, consumers are reluctant to purchase new cars, and older cars mean more demand for replacement parts. Not only is the industry relatively recession-proof, it's also experiencing favorable secular trends as well. For example, the average age of the U.S. automobile has continued to rise despite the post-recession recovery in auto sales.Data source: U.S. Department of Transportation.Moreover, as you can see below, although Advance Auto Parts' same-store sales growth has lagged its peers -- largely because of its difficulties integrating Carquest -- its peers are still reporting good growth -- an indication that the market remains favorable.Data source: Company presentations.Also, consider that Advance Auto Parts has, in common with O'Reilly Automotive, a well balanced mix of faster-growing but lower-margin Do It For Me (DIFM) sales and Do It Yourself (DIY) sales -- AutoZone sees around 80% of its sales from the DIY market.What's more, the stock is relatively cheap compared to its peer group. data by  .In addition, the company has an opportunity to play catch-up to its peers in terms of generating free cash flow from its assets and operating margin. Incidentally, note the kink in O'Reilly's metrics in 2008 as it dealt with integrating the CSK acquisition; in a similar way, Advance Auto Parts's metrics dipped following the 2013 acquisition of General Parts International (owner of Carquest and Worldpac). data by  .The stock is cheap, at present, for a reason. The integration has proven a lot tougher than expected (see the same-store sales chart above), and following a disappointing first-quarter results presentation, management announced it was no longer targeting $500 million in free cash flow and adjusted operating income margin of 12% for 2016.More detail on the  \u00a0can be found here. Advance Auto Parts is undergoing an ongoing process of consolidation (Carquest stores are merging with existing Advance Auto stores) and conversions (Carquest stores turning into Advance Auto stores), and the near-term negative effects are hitting same-store sales growth.Indeed, on the first-quarter , newly appointed CEO Tom Greco was candid on the issues: \" We continue to experience shortfalls on execution, driven by availability and service levels.\" Clearly, he has much work to do, but there are three reasons to believe current management can turn things around.First, a new management usually means a new approach. Greco's appointment in April follows the departure of Darren Jackson in January. In addition, activist investor and CEO of Starboard Value Jeffrey Smith is now the Advance Auto Parts Chairman, and the current CFO has agreed to leave the company.Smith is well known for his deep-value investing activism, and Greco's 30 years at  (NYSE: PEP) \u00a0(as CEO of Frito-Lay North America) stand him in good stead. Pepsico's \"Power of One\" strategy (whereby snacks and beverage are marketed and promoted together) requires extensive awareness of inventory management, logistics & distribution, and an integrated approach to in-store selling -- all qualities that will serve Greco well as he comes to grips with Advance Auto Parts's dual-store (DIY & DIFM) strategy.Second, given that Greco as been on the job for little more than a month, it would not be surprising if he has low-balled expectations in predicting full-year same-store sales guidance of negative 3% to negative 5%.Third, as discussed previously,  of O'Reilly Automotive shifting to a dual-store model is a good marker for what Advance Auto Parts can achieve.All told, the investment proposition is an attractive one, provided the new management can turn things around. On a risk/reward basis, I think the stock is a good value for investors looking for a deep value stock whose prospects are favored by attractive end market growth. Now the new management needs to execute, because if it does, the stock could soar.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed).

Win, baby! Long term.Larry Puglia has been at the helm of $30.7 billion  (  ) since mid-1993 and has been sole manager since May 1997.In that span, the fund has racked up a 9.97  average annual gain through April 29 vs. 9.02% for the S&P 500, says Morningstar Inc.Over the past three and five years through April 29, his fund's performance tops 94% and 97% of its direct rivals, respectively.The fund captures an A+ 36-month Performance Rating from IBD, which means that its performance is among the top 5% of all  in that time.And the fund is an  winner, shining in three categories - U.S. equity funds, growth funds and large-caps.Puglia is himself\u00a0among the tops in sheer longevity. He ranks 20th out of 558 managers of U.S. stock mutual funds that have had a single skipper.But he\u00a0is not immune to market volatility: Year-to-date through April 29, the fund was down 5.64%, topping just 21% of its peers.Puglia, 55, spoke\u00a0with IBD from his office in Baltimore about how he invests. What types of markets does your fund struggle in, Larry? We like to think we can perform well in most environments. When I first started to work with Tom Broadus (co-manager of Blue Chip from mid-1993 until leaving the fund on May 1, 1997), he warned me that your investment style will sometimes be out of sync (with the market). Your job, he said, is to recognize that and lose as little as possible.We paid a price for having less technology during the height of the tech bubble. But we were able to offset that ... when the market clobbered tech companies with very high valuations as the tech bubble burst.But our rolling three-year performance numbers have been solid against both the growth benchmark and the S&P 500. Our rolling five-year numbers have outperformed the benchmark 93% of the time. Sometimes things that seem unpopular -- like  (  ) in 2013 and part of 2014 -- can reward you if you're right in your long-term analysis. What does \"Blue Chip\" in your fund's name say about your overall approach? As we've talked about before, Paul, blue chips are those with leading market positions and seasoned management, and we pay close attention to management's ability to allocate capital. We've learned over time that if you have a great business that throws off superior returns, but management doesn't know how to reinvest wisely, the business is soon \"worsified,\" as I think Warren Buffett said.Having strong returns -- returns on invested capital, returns on equity -- is another characteristic we look for. And because there are vagaries to book accounting measures, we've always looked at free cash flow as an important measure for profitability. As a result, we tend to own the leaders or No. 2 companies in industries. (  ) is important to us, but so is  (  ). We're willing to own the No. 1 or No. 2 names in market share, especially if both are high-quality companies and well-managed. You're fairly reluctant to own smaller stocks. What are the exceptions? We have been willing to own midcaps or some rapidly growing companies. We've owned Amazon and  (  ) over a decade and  (FB) as a private placement, the only one in our fund. Some view it as an early-stage growth company, but we view it as a company with a unique leadership position in an area growing rapidly.We owned Genentech before it was acquired by  (RHHBY), so we're willing to own rapid growers. But we try to discern as early as we can that they will have durable growth. Is  (ROST) a play on a slow-growth economy in which consumers are careful about their spending? Or would this be an attractive stock even if the economy were growing gangbusters? Historically, Ross and  (TJX) have been dominant in off-price retail. They've done well in most economic environments. Some of that is due to the fact that they are well below their saturation points in number of stores in the U.S. and especially internationally.In a slow-growth economy, other retailers have to unload overstock. They make fashion misses. So Ross and TJX get more pack-away inventory -- they take unwanted merchandise off other retailers' hands, pack it away and sell it at good margins over time. (PYPL) is still trying to get back to where it went public. Where does this fit into your strategy? This is an example of where we started our conversation. This is a high-quality but emerging blue chip.They are leading in their area of expertise. But because it was born (went public) early in its gestation, it has certain frailties. If certain other payment companies wanted to gang up and hurt PayPal, they could succeed somewhat.But instead, PayPal has a collaborative relationship with  (V), where we also have a position.And PayPal has broadened itself. They bought Venmo, a consumer-to-consumer network (that lets users transfer money to each other). It's growing rapidly. And it cornered Braintree, which can process debit and credit transactions (for many devices, and is used by online and mobile firms such as\u00a0Uber and Airbnb). Which do you like more about Amazon -- what it is now, or what it has the potential to become? In the last three to four years, they've invested heavily in building out their network of warehouses, distribution centers and related inventory management capabilities. They've also built out their free-delivery ability and more rapid delivery to attract more Prime members, who spend over twice as much as other customers and have higher retention rates.We've felt that the company should be valued on free cash flow, and that's going to move up dramatically because the third-party business (selling and distributing products for third-party sellers) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) should grow very rapidly. And both have much higher margins than their core retailing business, which is doing fine. And we feel the third-party business and AWS' margins would improve over time.The real story is that the third-party and AWS businesses should pull their composite gross margin up very dramatically. That's happened, and we think it will continue.But predicting free cash flow for them is tricky because if they build, say, two more distribution centers, that can absorb a lot of free cash flow.Another way to think about the company is that AWS is, in our minds, worth well over half of the company based on our analysis of growth in that business. People don't appreciate that. Are you bothered by  's (AVGO) slowdown in earnings-per-share growth? The growth rate is slowing temporarily because we're coming out of a big downturn.Now, Broadcom's acquisition of Avago is going to be accretive to earnings over time. Avago management has shown the ability to improve the profile of their product set. There's talk that they might sell parts of the business and what we'll end up with is a higher-quality business.When they're finished with restructuring, they will look like  (TXN) but trade at a lower multiple.Just in the last year, we came back into both of these names (Broadcom and its now-subsidiary Avago). O'Reilly Automotive is a cyclical play because people want to fix cars in a slow-growth economy rather than buy new ones. It's also a secular play because they're taking share in the repair-shop market. Is there a third element you like? They are really extraordinarily well-managed. They key success factor is being able to distribute product to a mechanic or repair shop in a short time frame. They need parts within minutes, within the hour. And O'Reilly has distribution nodes and warehouses that can get product to repair shops in a very short time.That took a lot of investment and expertise. (AZO) is also moving aggressively into the do-it-for-me market. They've been in the do-it-yourselfer market. Both companies have performed well and are taking market share. They're well-managed and have room to penetrate the total addressable market. And these are businesses that are less likely to be disintermediated by Amazon. Home Depot and Lowe's are the same. Does  ' (STZ) growth come from acquisitions? The reason it's grown in the last 12 to 24 months is their fortuitous and smart acquisition of Corona and Modelo and Pacifico and other Mexican specialty beers that were spun out as a result of mergers elsewhere in the industry.They have a wine business that has been a slower grower. But they've acquired Prisoner Wines and other specialty wines. They're smart in wines, and that business is poised to grow. Some people love to doubt  (FB). You like the stock, right? Yes, we're constructive. While it is inevitable that growth will slow, it is being sustained at a very high level.The stock has been robust because they've managed the transition to mobile devices much better than people thought they could. That will constitute their next leg of (share-price) growth: having that transition understood.Also, they've made several acquisitions in recent years that are not well understood (by many investors). Instagram now has 400 million users. What's App now has 800 million users, up from 500 million. And Messenger has a ton of users. As those businesses are monetized, they'll provide a new level of growth layered onto their core business, which is already seeing rapid growth due to video, for example.They'll earn in the $4s -- call it $4.50 per share in calendar 2017. They could be pushing a $6 number in calendar '18. Can  (ALK) keep flying high despite the cost of the  (VA) takeover? This is an interesting situation. Some of the most difficult decisions are when we have a high-quality company like Alaska, with the best balance sheet of any major airline, and then they make an acquisition and pay more than we would like. But they didn't have much flexibility because  (JBLU) was trying to buy Virgin too.Less appreciated is that Alaska gets important gates in Newark, LaGuardia, Kennedy and Dulles. Those are important airports, especially in relation to the West Coast.We hate strategic deals when you pay too much. But the more we look at it, the more we think it will be accretive. If you had a mentor, who was it? I've had several. My father as a businessman who invested on his own over about 50 years. He had a growth-at-a-reasonable price style. He lived through the Depression, so he liked firms with earnings and cash flow. That influenced me.He also had an eye for new growth areas. He had seen new industries created, like TV and copying machines. And he never invested in gold. He always said, \"It can't innovate, it can't grow.\" That focus on looking for companies that compound and grow has been a great influence.Jack Laporte (who ran New Horizons Fund (PRNHX) from 1987 until 2010) taught me that a few winners can make a big difference in growth investing. They can offset many losing stocks.And I mentioned Tom Broadus (who ran and co-ran Blue Chip from June 30, 1993, through May 1, 1997, with a 21.64% average annual return topping 95% of its peers, and whose Oct. 31, 1985-March 1, 1994, tenure atop Equity Income generated a 14.98% average annual gain, topping 86% of its peers) taught me to make sure that the managers of companies we're interested in really follow through on things they say they're going to do.And I learned from Brian Rogers (T. Rowe Price chairman and chief investment officer, who ran Equity Income (PRFDX) from 1985 to 2015), even though he is a value investor.Rogers once said to me that consistent thought and action were important. The most grievous mistakes he had made were trades he knew he should have made (but hadn't). He taught me to make sure my portfolio reflected my best thinking. Now, several times a week, I review why I own every single name. If I don't believe in a holding, I reduce or end it. That's especially valuable for growth investors. If a growth name is not compounding, that is dangerous.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["uburban Propane Partners, L.P.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Chicago, IL - April 27, 2016 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog.

Stocks recently featured in the blog include  and Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .After Genuine Parts Company, Harley-Davidson, Inc., General Motors Co. and AutoNation Inc. kick-started the Q1 earnings season with positive surprises, investors are now looking forward to the next big players - The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, O'Reilly Automotive Inc., Ford Motor Co. and BorgWarner Inc., which are slated to report results this week.The general mood is somewhat pessimistic due to falling first-quarter estimates over the last three months. As per our  , total S&P earnings for the first quarter are expected to be down 9.4% on a 0.8% decline in revenues. Earnings growth is expected to be positive for only 6 of the 16 Zacks sectors. The outlook is bright for the Auto sector, which is anticipated to record the highest year-over-year growth among all sectors.The auto industry witnessed a good start to the year, with strong U.S. sales by big companies. Revenues of major automakers are expected to be driven by robust U.S. and China sales in the first quarter. Earnings will also gain from an increase in the sales of higher margin vehicle segments, such as SUVs and light trucks, due to low fuel prices.However, the adverse impact of foreign currency translation remains a major headwind for the auto sector. Sluggishness in many emerging markets and expenses related to safety recalls are other hurdles.Among the many companies scheduled to report this week, let's see what's in store for these major auto stocks gearing up to release their results.

The company is benefiting from lower raw material costs, strong economic trends in North America and continued cost savings. In Jun 2015, Goodyear signed an agreement to dissolve the global alliance with Sumitomo Rubber Industries, Ltd. The deal is expected to be accretive to its earnings from the first quarter of 2016 due to the removal of Sumitomo Rubber's minority interest in Goodyear Dunlop Tires Europe B.V.However, the company's revenue has been declining over the years due to unfavorable foreign currency translation, lower sales in other tire-related businesses, and a decline in price and product mix.

Sales in Europe increased 8.5% to 363,500 vehicles. Ford's impressive product launches are helping boost sales volume.However, Ford expects weak margins from North America and higher losses in South America this year.

Many on The Street believe the \"Sell in May\" rule takes precedence over profits. But that's not the case with us, as we follow the rule that there is always a bull market to be found.For the last five years, the top three sectors have been food and beverage, technology\u00a0and biotechnology, providing positive results 80% of the time through the summer. The answer to the \"where to invest in May\" lies in focusing on what's worked in the past, namely the seasonally strong summer stocks. Our database starts by looking at the sectors that thrive through the summer.For the last five years, the top three sectors have been food and beverage, technology and biotechnology, providing positive results 80% of the time through the summer.We are focusing our attention to these groups this spring, and we have used our behavioral valuation models to identify stocks that are likely to heat up through the summer based on seasonality, sentiment and their technical strength.The following are seven stocks to buy before summer. In no particular order \u2026Video game maker  (  ) got knocked down a peg when it lowered its guidance last quarter, but the stock is revving-up for a strong summer.Electronic Arts shares recently put in a consolidation at $65 and are now making moves toward $70 as sentiment remains tepid. Short interest is near its highest readings over the last two years as short sellers are trying to make a buck from future declines, but the fact is that a break above $68 is going to spark a short-covering rally that will add fuel to the stock.Electronic Arts stock averages a summer return of 18.4% over the last five years and the currently improving trend suggests that investors may want to hang on to this stock through the dog days.For many, the summer means lifting the hood on the car in their driveway for some fun. For others, the unpredictable economy means they would rather change their oil themselves to save a few bucks.For  (  ), it's all good as it all means a busy summer season.O'Reilly stock has averaged 9% in four of the last five summers, putting it on the list of seasonally strong summer stocks. Currently, the shares are trading back toward their all-time highs after taking a break in late 2015. The company has seen year-over-year revenue growth every quarter for the last two years while beating analysts' earnings expectations.Sentiment is bearish toward O'Reilly stock, as only 63% of the analysts covering it have it ranked a buy, despite its relatively strong leadership. Also, the short interest ratio weighs in at a heavy 9.2, telling us that a short squeeze rally is likely to be triggered when the stock moves above $280.Watch O'Reilly shares to motor through the summer. (  ) has been executing its business model extremely well over the last year as it continues to expand its brand. The results: eight consecutive quarters of earnings beats and a YOY revenue growth figure that approaches 205!Now that ULTA is trading above $200, many think there is nowhere to go but down, but the summer favors this stock as it has traded higher all five of the last summer seasons for an average of 8.7%.Our models continue to rank Ulta stock as a buy with a target move of 10% or more over the summer as analysts continue to upgrade the shares. Currently, only 64% of Wall Street has it ranked a buy, so there is room for this stock to move higher before becoming a \"crowded trade.\"The summer means travel for many, which is one of the reasons that  (  ) stock is among the seasonally strong stocks. Over the last five years, Expedia stock averages an 11.2% return, putting it near the top of the list for consistent performers.Our model has identified the $105 level as a recent consolidation level that has the potential to launch EXPE higher into the seasonally strong period. Resistance stands above at the $115 mark, but this still gives Expedia shares 9.5% of overhead room before dealing with technical hurdles.After a rough year of earnings, where Expedia missed analysts' EPS expectations three of four quarters, the company has seen an improvement in revenue that may provide a fundamental surge for the stock. This would catch the growing camp of short sellers off-guard and trigger a covering rally that would light the fuse on a hot summer for Expedia stock.The biotechnology sector has been taken out behind the shed over the last six months, but some of the names within the group are making a comeback, among them is  (  ).This stock is breaking through the $90 level, which will garner the attention of technical buyers. The shares are starting to take a leadership role among the biotechnology sector as we head into the summer.What makes BioMarin Pharmaceutical a standout is its record for summer trading. Over the last five years, the stock has averaged returns of 9.6% each of the last five summer seasons. Our technical models currently have a target of $105 over the next four months - a 15% gain from today's prices. (  ) will fly below most investor's radars, but you need to take a look at this summer performer. CALM stock has spent each of the last five summer seasons punching higher, as it averages a summer return of 17.2%.A positive earnings report recently shot the stock to the $55 level before pulling back to continue a consolidation at $52.50. That said, the trend in Cal-Maine shares is growing stronger as we head into the dog days.Investor sentiment is the kicker for Cal-Maine right now, as the short interest ratio is a whopping 16.3 and only 40% of the analysts are recommending the stock as a buy. We're expecting a push above $55 to open the gates on short covering and upgrades which will set Cal-Maine stock up for another strong summer with a target of $60. (  )  has mostly found its groove again as the stock is trading into a new stratosphere.

In the past, a rise in new car sales would have been bad news for the aftermarket auto parts business. New cars require less maintenance and repair work than older ones, meaning there is less demand for the kind of parts and services supplied by O'Reilly, as well as rivals such as  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).But that dynamic no longer applies, analysts say.\"The kinds of things that benefit new vehicle sales -- an improving economy, improving employment, higher income -- also benefit the auto parts sector,\" CRT Capital Group analyst Ali Faghri told IBD.The figures might seem daunting. In 2015, the U.S. auto industry posted sales of 17.5 million light vehicles, according to the Automotive News Data Center, breaking the previous record of 17.4 million set in 2000 and marking a 5.7% increase from 2014.But a rise in new car sales doesn't necessarily mean older cars end up at the junkyard. Thanks to advances in technology, cars last much longer nowadays.So when someone buys a new car, chances are his old car will be resold instead of junked. It's not unusual for vehicles with 120,000 miles or more to make their way onto used car lots.This trend has led to an ever-aging fleet of cars in the U.S. The average age of cars on the road is a record 11.5 years, according to industry researcher IHS Automotive. That figure is expected to creep up to 11.6 years in 2016.The obvious benefit to auto parts retailers is that as cars get older, they require more replacement parts, as well as repair and maintenance services. This feeds demand for the industry's Do-It-Yourself (DIY) segment, which targets home mechanics; as well as the \"Do-It-For-Me\" segment that targets professional technicians and installers.The sector has also gotten a lift from the improving economy and job market, which have given many consumers more cash to spend on replacement parts and repairs.Meanwhile, O'Reilly and its peers have benefited from lower gasoline prices, which encourage people to drive more.\"Low and declining gas prices are helping boost vehicles miles traveled -- leading to failure- and maintenance-related part sales -- and leading low-end DIY consumers to spend more on discretionary items for their vehicles,\" Wedbush analyst Seth Basham noted in a research report to clients.It all adds up to a robust market for O'Reilly. The company's stock price trades near 269 and has been creeping back up toward the high of 277.96 set in late October. Shares have risen about 6% since the beginning of the year.Financially, O'Reilly is in the midst of a years-long streak of double-digit earnings growth, helped by a stock repurchase program that began more than four years ago. Revenue has risen in double digits the last four quarters.The company earned $2.19 a share during the 2015 fourth quarter. That was up 24% from the prior year and well above consensus estimates. Revenue gained 10% to $1.95 billion, slightly above views. Comparable-store sales increased 7.7% vs. a 6.3% rise during the third quarter.\"Both our professional and DIY sides of the business were strong contributors to our comparable-store sales growth, with professional being slightly higher,\" O'Reilly Chief Executive Greg Henslee said on a conference call with analysts. \"For 2016, we expect to see positive tailwinds from continued modest improvements in total employment and low gas prices.\"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect O'Reilly to grow full-year EPS 16% in 2016 and another 13% in 2017.For all of 2015, O'Reilly's comparable-store sales rose 7.5% -- the biggest annual gain since it grew comps 8.8% in 2010. O'Reilly opened 209 stores in 2015, bringing the total store count to 4,571 at year's end. It plans to open another 210 stores this year.\"DIY market share gains have accelerated, and this is adding a new leg to same store-sales growth, which could lead to earnings upside,\" JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers said in a report.Many of those market share gains have come at the expense of Advance Auto, he says, especially in East Coast markets.Because the fourth quarter includes parts of the winter season -- when cars tend to undergo more wear and tear -- O'Reilly and other parts retailers benefit when the weather is severe. That wasn't the case during much of the 2015 fourth quarter, however.\"While O'Reilly noted that its retail business suffered slightly in November due to abnormally warm weather, pressuring demand for products like anti-freeze, it successfully captured this demand in December as temperatures fell,\" RBC Capital Markets analyst Scot Ciccarelli noted in a report. \"Management believes winter weather has been fairly neutral to its business.\"The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["taples, Inc.

But intellectually understanding that bull markets are followed by bears is not the same as actually living through a Wall Street crash and watching the value of your portfolio decline, sometimes sharply.That's when a mutual fund investor's discipline and patience can get tested -- but also rewarded over time, as the performance of the  recipients shows.The 2008 bear market was a prime example. Following a powerful bull cycle that began in March 2003, the financial and housing crisis triggered a downturn that saw the S&P 500 decline 58% from the peak in October 2007 to the bottom in March 2009.The top-performing stocks in the prior bull market suffered similar fates.  (  ) fell 61% from the end of December 2007 through January 2009, while Google, now known as  (  ), lost 67% of its value from November 2007 until finding its footing in November 2008.When you buy and sell individual stocks, you are your own fund manager. It's up to you to actively manage risk and reduce your exposure in a market downturn since the leaders in the prior bull cycle typically do not bounce back to lead in the next one.The cardinal rule for protecting your positions in individual stocks is to  .But when you invest in mutual funds, you're relying on a professional money manager to oversee and adjust the portfolio as needed over time.So when investing in a fund to achieve a long-term goal, such as  or college savings for a young child, your best bet is to buy right and sit tight.As IBD founder William J. O'Neil wrote in his classic book, \"How To Make Money In Stocks,\" \"a well-selected, diversified domestic growth-stock fund run by an established management organization will, in time, always recover from the steep corrections that naturally occur during bear markets. The reason mutual funds come back is that they are broadly diversified and generally participate in each recovery cycle in the U.S. economy.\"The table, below, listing the 10-year returns of the top five growth funds from 2006 to 2015 proves that point.As you would expect in a severe bear market, even these long-term, top-performing funds showed a decline in 2008 - from 25% to 46%.But look at the cumulative 10-year returns. Investors who sat tight in 2008 saw overall gains of 205% to 240% from 2006 to 2015, more than making up for the 2008 decline and more than doubling the S&P 500's 102% rise during the same period.As a fund's prospectus always says, past performance is not a guarantee of future results. But checking a mutual fund's long-term track record - through both bull and bear markets - gives you insight into the management team's ability to manage risk while also generating growth.Take for instance the  (  ), which had the smallest decline in 2008 among the  .Fund co-manager William Bell told IBD, \"We prepare for a bear market before it happens. \u2026 Our entire process is basically built around finding companies that are going to grow at an above-average rate, but also provide a lot of downside protection when things fall apart.\"Bell added that he looks for stocks like  (  ) that have a \"counter-cyclical component\" to them. Key to that is checking the company's long-term earnings record, particularly during weak economies.\"If a company is able to grow through a recession,\" Bell said, \"we have pretty good confidence that the stock is also going to do better than the rest of the market during a recession.\"The strategy of Bell and his co-managers and their focus on so-called \"steady-Eddie\" companies is reminiscent of a certain legendary investor. \"If you look at what we do,\" Bell noted, \"it's almost exactly what Warren Buffett does, just in the small- and mid-cap space.\"Dollar cost averaging - i.e., regularly investing a set amount of money in a mutual fund regardless of market conditions - can be an effective way for investors to protect themselves against market fluctuations.Rather than try to time the market and make a large investment in one lump sum at just the right moment, you increase your holdings incrementally, typically on a monthly basis.So during a bear market, you're buying shares in the fund at a lower price, helping to hold down your average cost-per-share and increase your returns over time. .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" is set to release its first-quarter 2016 earnings on Apr 27, after the markets close. The last quarter of 2015 saw reported earnings at $2.19 per share, 5.08% higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.07.The company has posted positive earnings surprises in all four trailing quarters, with an average of 6.43%. Sales for the last reported quarter were $1.95 billion which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.12%. Overall, the company performed well in the fourth quarter of 2015 as well as the full year.Let's see how things have shaped up for the forthcoming announcement.O'Reilly Automotive has reported comparable sales growth and record income for all 23 years for which it has been public. The company continues with its growth-led strategy to increase earnings for the coming quarters.In 2016, the company intends to open net 210 new stores across the existing geographical areas of business as well as in new areas. Total capital expenditure for 2016 is expected to be $460-$490 million.The company has also continued with it share repurchase program through 2015. From the end of last year to the middle of first-quarter 2016, the company purchased 0.6 million shares for $141 million. On Feb 10, the board authorized the company to further raise its repurchase program by $750 million.In the to-be-reported quarter, O'Reilly Automotive issued senior unsecured notes maturing in 2026. The proceeds will be used for general management as well as for the repurchase program. In the first quarter, the company expects higher gross margin due to lower LIFO charges leading to improvement in acquisition costs.A strengthening U.S. dollar is expected to impact the company positively by reducing costs as many goods are sourced globally. Modest improvement in employment and lower fuel prices are expected to increase total miles driven and improve vehicle demand in the industry, which should positively impact the company.However, selling, general and administrative expenses are expected to increase by 2% this year, compared to 1.5% through 2015. This increased cost includes higher estimated medical expenses, an intensive advertising program and investments in the internal information systems approach.The company expects earnings to increase 17-22% in the first quarter on a year-over-year basis. For full-year 2016, the company aims at estimated earnings of $10.10-$10.50 per share. These expected increases take into account all share repurchases completed through mid-Feb but not the ones expected thereafter.Our proven model does not conclusively show that O'Reilly Automotive is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below: Both the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are at $2.49. This lack of difference leaves the ESP at 0.00%. O'Reilly Automotive carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company's ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Here are some companies in the same space you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:LKQ Corp.  has an Earnings ESP of +2.38% and a Zacks Rank #1.Lear Corp.  has an Earnings ESP of +2.12% and a Zacks Rank #1.Ford Motor Co.  has an Earnings ESP of +11.63% and a Zacks Rank #3.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

But Hennessy Focus Fund (  ) -- which is an  award winner -- keeps outperforming by making big bets on its three portfolio managers' best ideas.The $2.2 billion mutual fund's 0.27% return year-to-date, going into Tuesday, tops 90% of its midcap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. That pack averaged a 3.83% loss. The S&P 500 is up 0.20%. And the fund is in the top 1% of its peer group over the past five years and top 7% over the past three years.Hennessy Focus aims to keep 60% to 80% of its assets in its top-10 holdings. The mutual fund's top 10 accounted for 63.5% of assets as of Dec. 31. And with its focused approach, the portfolio held only 21 names.The average IBD Composite Rating of the portfolio is a strong 75. Eleven of the fund's stocks have Comp Ratings of 80 or higher.Two holdings,  (  ) and  (  ), are in the IBD 50.Car-parts store chain O'Reilly is the fund's top holding, with a 9.8% weighting. O'Reilly illustrates another one of Hennessy Focus' key traits -- sticking with its bets. O'Reilly has been in the portfolio for more than 10 years. The company had about 1,300 stores when the fund opened its current stake, says manager Brian Macauley. Now it has more than 4,400, a lineup that could expand to as many as 7,000, Macauley says.In addition, the company has a lot of buying power compared with many of its smaller competitor. Its distribution system can provide faster delivery of critical parts. Same-day delivery enables repair shops to complete repairs that day, leading to customer satisfaction and faster billing, Macauley adds.EPS had grown over 20% annually over the past 10 years as of Dec. 31, with the stock appreciating at a similar pace, he says, adding, \"We also like company management.\"Macauley, David Rainey and Ira Rothberg have run the fund since about mid-2009.

Markel also profits on its underwriting, Macauley says.\"Markel is sometimes referred to as a baby  (BRKA),\" Macauley said, referring to the diversified company run by legendary investor Warren Buffett. \"Like Berkshire, Markel invests a lot of its float (from insurance premiums) in public companies instead of just plain-vanilla fixed income. It also invests in privately owned businesses, as does Berkshire Hathaway. So the business is very thoughtfully run, and it is a fraction of the size of Berkshire, so they don't have the law of large numbers working against them. They have a lot of opportunity in front of them because of relatively small scale.\"Markel EPS grew 39% and 76% in the past two quarters. The stock is forming a new base after a failed breakout.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $250.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $243.10 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ORLY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $256.62/share today.Because the $250.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

In this case, the company's integration of General Parts International (owners of Carquest and worldpac), and catching up with the kinds of margins boasted by rivals like  and  , have disappointed so far.In fact, while its peers are busy generating healthy same-store-sales growth, Advance Auto Parts has turned negative. What exactly is going wrong, and can it be fixed?DATA SOURCE: ADVANCE AUTO PARTS, INC PRESENTATIONS.Based on management's guidance and the potential to deliver margins closer to those of O'Reilly and AutoZone, the stock is  . Readers unfamiliar with the investment case can read more in the linked article, but now it's time to focus on what's going wrong:The shortfall in performance raises questions about the company achieving its 2016 guidance for adjusted operating income margin of 12%, coupled with low same-store sales growth and \"modest top-line growth.\" However, if the company merely comes close these targets, then the stock could appreciate substantially. There are three key factors to consider:Starting with the integration process, the following chart shows how same-store-sales growth has slipped as Carquest consolidations -- and, in particular, conversions -- have negatively affected growth.DATA SOURCE: ADVANCE AUTO PARTS INC. PRESENTATIONS.The key takeaway is that, as the conversions and consolidations take place, you can expect more deterioration. On the recent , Sherman outlined how the process immediately effects sales for about half a quarter before recovering: \"It's about five to six weeks that there's a negative impact and then the store begins to emerge with better results and that generally shows up in the form of double-digit comps, showing up in clearly consolidations and anywhere from single -- mid-single to a high-single to double-digit comps in our convergence stores.\"Advance Auto Parts started off with around 1,230 Carquest stores, but due to consolidations and conversions, its tally as of January 2016 is around 870. Moreover, management expects to do another 350 -- roughly split between conversions and consolidations -- in 2016.Investing takeaway: Although performance has been disappointing, Advance Auto's same-store sales growth is -- and will be in 2016 -- negatively affected by short-term waves of conversions; but once completed, growth will return. These two issues are somewhat more complicated. O'Reilly Automotive's model of distribution centers providing daily replenishment to its stores -- O'Reilly is a better comparator because it has a heavy DIFM mix, while AutoZone is primarily DIY -- would be ideal for servicing needs of commercial customers. Advance Auto management is clear that DIFM is the priority.However, Advance Auto is choosing a more bespoke solution that involves investing to improve inventory coverage -- something that could initially hit efforts to get to O'Reilly, like operating metrics -- while developing a field-centric approach to distribution. In plain English, this means local managers will be empowered to decide how individual store inventories are made up. Sherman noted that daily delivery would be provided where needed, but it's \"not an answer by itself.\"Advance Auto's efforts to improve operational performance will take time and effort to ensure efficient inventory delivery may hold back near-term improvement. data by  . All told, investors shouldn't judge the company's same-store sales performance too harshly. It's disappointing, but it's also part of the process. Think of it this way: Management could make numbers look better in the near term by slowing the pace of conversions/consolidations, but that would come at the detriment of its long-term objectives.The increasing share of revenue from DIFM, and the difficulties in integrating Carquest, indicate that Advance Auto won't turn into O'Reilly Automotive overnight. However, it may not need too in order to make investors money. The valuation discount and opportunity is attractive enough for long-term investors; just don't be surprised if there's more volatility along the way.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .The fourth successive monthly increase in retail sales was one of the most positive developments the U.S. economy has experienced in recent times. Powered by an improving job market, wage growth and low gasoline prices, retail sales increased more than estimated in January. Further, the decline reported for December was revised to an increase.Such data indicates that U.S. consumers are deriving confidence from strong economic fundamentals. They seem to be unperturbed by the turmoil the markets are going through. This is why it makes good sense to pick up select retail stocks at this time.Retail sales gained 0.2% in January, keeping up with the increase recorded for the month of December. This was also higher than the consensus estimate of a 0.1% increase. Initially estimated to decline by 0.1%, retail sales for December were revised upward to a 0.2% increase according to fresh estimates. After excluding the impact of low gasoline prices, the metric increased by 0.4%.Of the 13 broad categories, 8 experienced an upswing in demand over the month of January. Online purchases increased 1.6%, recording the strongest gain in 11 months. Grocery store sales increased 0.8% while motor vehicle and parts dealers experienced a 0.6% gain. Gardening equipment and building material supplies dealers experienced a 0.6% increase.A resurgent labor market and strong wage gains were a major factor fueling purchases. Even though the U.S. economy added only 151,000 jobs in January, missing the consensus estimate of 195,000, there were gains on other fronts. The unemployment rate declined from 5% in December to 4.9% in January, the lowest level witnessed since 2008.But more importantly, average hourly earnings gained nearly 0.5% in January from the previous month's figure to $25.39, higher than the consensus estimate of a 0.3% rise. Average hourly earnings witnessed a 2.5% rise from the year-ago figure.Another major factor increasing the purchasing power of the consumer is extremely low gasoline prices. Despite the occasional rebound, a widening demand supply gap is continuing to depress gasoline prices.According to the Automobile Association of America (AAA), the cost of gasoline was recorded at $1.69 per gallon on Tuesday. This is a 3 cent decline compared to last week and 21 cents or 11% lower than prices recorded about a month earlier. This has raised the consumer's purchasing power, giving them the freedom to spend on other goods and services.Continual growth in retail sales is indicative of the confidence being exuded by the U.S. consumer. A number of economic fundamentals are fueling this growth which means it is likely to be stable over the near future.This is why the retail sector makes for a good investment area at this point.

Powered by an improving job market, wage growth and low gasoline prices, retail sales increased more than estimated in January. Further, the decline reported for December was revised to an increase.Such data indicates that U.S. consumers are deriving confidence from strong economic fundamentals. They seem to be unperturbed by the turmoil the markets are going through. This is why it makes good sense to pick up select retail stocks at this time.Retail sales gained 0.2% in January, keeping up with the increase recorded for the month of December. This was also higher than the consensus estimate of a 0.1% increase. Initially estimated to decline by 0.1%, retail sales for December were revised upward to a 0.2% increase according to fresh estimates. After excluding the impact of low gasoline prices, the metric increased by 0.4%.Of the 13 broad categories, 8 experienced an upswing in demand over the month of January. Online purchases increased 1.6%, recording the strongest gain in 11 months. Grocery store sales increased 0.8% while motor vehicle and parts dealers experienced a 0.6% gain. Gardening equipment and building material supplies dealers experienced a 0.6% increase.A resurgent labor market and strong wage gains were a major factor fueling purchases. Even though the U.S. economy added only 151,000 jobs in January, missing the consensus estimate of 195,000, there were gains on other fronts. The unemployment rate declined from 5% in December to 4.9% in January, the lowest level witnessed since 2008.But more importantly, average hourly earnings gained nearly 0.5% in January from the previous month's figure to $25.39, higher than the consensus estimate of a 0.3% rise. Average hourly earnings witnessed a 2.5% rise from the year-ago figure.Another major factor increasing the purchasing power of the consumer is extremely low gasoline prices. Despite the occasional rebound, a widening demand supply gap is continuing to depress gasoline prices.According to the Automobile Association of America (AAA), the cost of gasoline was recorded at $1.69 per gallon on Tuesday. This is a 3 cent decline compared to last week and 21 cents or 11% lower than prices recorded about a month earlier. This has raised the consumer's purchasing power, giving them the freedom to spend on other goods and services.Continual growth in retail sales is indicative of the confidence being exuded by the U.S. consumer. A number of economic fundamentals are fueling this growth which means it is likely to be stable over the near future.This is why the retail sector makes for a good investment area at this point.

Curiouser still was the price tag: just over $1 billion. True, there is some value in the Pep Boys name, started by the \"boys\" themselves -- Manny, Moe and Jack -- just under 100 years ago in Philadelphia. But it's going to take more than history to win in the ultra-competitive world of auto repairs. Not only are there scores of national chains vying for Pep Boys' customers --  to name just one tough competitor -- but there are countless locally owned shops that can get folks' repair jobs done as well. So what is Icahn, who first made a name for himself in the 1980s buyout boom, plotting to do with his newly acquired auto repair chain?As former owners of Pep Boys were no doubt aware, consistent profits have been elusive:\n  \nData source: And, it should come as no surprise, in light of the inevitable price competition that occurs in service industries like auto repair shops, that the company has had to invest what little cash has been generated back into the business.The fact that Pep Boys doesn't frequently find itself in the green is well known: Not only has its hit-or-miss profitability scared off previous potential buyers, but it's spooked  . Back in 2012, after having agreed to buy Pep Boys for $804 million, private equity firm The Gores Group actually  and paid a $50 million breakup fee after getting a closer look at Pep Boys' books. Not exactly a ringing endorsement of Manny, Moe and Jack's future prospects. It should also be noted that in light of Pep Boys' subsequent results, it appears they were probably right to pay up and walk away. Or were they?The question now is not just what Icahn is thinking with his brand new $1 billion prize, but does he actually see something in Pep Boys that The Gores Group missed? While it's always tricky when mere mortals guess at the reasons why a billionaire does anything, we can sure try! After reading through scores of press releases and articles, it seems that the reasons why Icahn outbid rival suitor Bridgestone to snap up Pep Boys, are twofold:So, what could the auto repair business fetch? Pep Boys' auto service revenues came to $490.7 million in fiscal 2015, $457.9 million in fiscal 2014, and $446.8 million in fiscal 2013, or 30.8%, 28.5%, and 27.2% of total revenues, respectively.Valuing such a business is tricky, as it's decidedly low margin. Pep Boys noted in last year's annual report that service revenues came to $484.4 million, but yielded a gross profit of just $6.3 million. Those aren't exactly numbers that buyers will be lining up to bid for. Granted, maybe costs could be cut and operations merged with a more efficient auto repair service operator. But who are we to guess at the sales price? We can't, and neither can Icahn. However, he knows the operation is worth something -- and it should be enough to meaningfully reduce his outlay for the part of Pep Boys he wants.Monro Muffler, for example, currently trades for 2.23 times last year's total revenues. Such a multiple, assigned to Pep Boys' service operation, nets a $1.1 billion -- more than Icahn's total purchase price. Do I think he'll get that much? Of course not: Monro is an exceptional operation that generated $62 million in net income in fiscal 2015. The point is that even selling the auto service business at 1 times its 2015 revenue would net Icahn almost half a billion dollars -- not too shabby.Granted, I'm painting with a broad brush. But it is, most probably, at least an approximation of what Icahn is up to. His goal is to not only sell the service operations, but to then build up the retail parts operation to compete effectively with the likes of  , the not-associated-with-the-author  , and  . Make no mistake, it won't be easy -- but it's not impossible. After all, I don't really care which of these retailers sells me new windshield wipers or a car battery -- and you probably don't either.AutoZone, O'Reilly Auto, and AutoNation are extremely profitable, and have been rewarded with lofty valuations by investors. This is the reason Icahn is after the retail operations of Pep Boys. That side of its business generated $1.59 billion in sales in fiscal 2015, and produced a gross profit of $469.1 million.As with the whole of the Pep Boys operation, consistent profits there have been elusive. However, should Icahn steer it to some semblance of the success had by AutoZone or O'Reilly Automotive, he'd make an absolute killing. O'Reilly trades at a respectable 3.03 times LTM revenues, AutoZone trades for 2.03 LTM revenues, and AutoNation (in the wake of a recent sharp plunge) for 0.35 times LTM revenues. This is a fairly wide range, but should Icahn be successful in turning around at least the retail operation of Pep Boys, he stands to make a king's ransom. Valuing Pep Boys at just 1 times parts revenue nets the buyout artist over $1.5 billion -- not a bad day's work, to say the least.Most of us can't buy entire companies and sell off parts of them, in the hopes of turning around operations and boosting their value. What we can do is reflect on what Icahn did when analyzing Pep Boys: He focused on the business and what it could become in the long term with the right operational implementation.The fates of these companies may not rest in our hands, but we can judge which ones have managers who are behaving in ways we approve of, based on corporate actions and conference call transcripts, and invest accordingly. That's a philosophy we can all buy.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Same-store sales increased during the last recession for it,  , and  , and through its 2014 acquisition of General Parts International (owner of Carquest and Worldpac), the company has an opportunity to raise its margin to the level of its peers.Let's take a look at the latest fourth-quarter results and asses the investment proposition. Key points:Putting these points into context, consider management's target of 12% earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margin by 2017. Advance Auto ended 2015 with an adjusted EBIT margin of around 10%, so the intended move to 12% by the end of the year represents a significant step.Here's a look at enterprise value (market cap plus net debt) to EBIT: data by  .Analyst estimates are for $9.83 billion in revenue for 2016, so if Advance Auto hits the 12% target (for argument's sake, let's assume investors will price it as 12% for the full year) then EBIT gets to $1.18 billion.Arguably, Advance Auto should trade at a multiple closer to O'Reilly's than AutoZone's, because its DIFM and DIY sales are more balanced (actually, Advance Auto already has a larger share of revenue from DIFM), and AutoZone has more than 80% of its sales in the less-attractive DIY market.No matter, assuming AutoZone's 13.4 times multiple and O'Reilly's 17.3 times (and using the $1.18 billion figure above) gives an EV of $15.83 billion to $20.41 billion. These figures imply a price target range of $200 to $262 -- a 40% to 85% upside to the stock price. In the recent fourth-quarter earnings presentation, management did the following:The EBIT margin improvement is intended to include 100 basis points from selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses (including 50 basis points of cost synergies), and the rest is dependent on leverage from increased sales. Here's CEO George Sherman on the : \"Yes, we know the size of the improvement that it represents, 10% to 12%, and it certainly would be aided quite a bit by the top line that we expect. So the leverage portion of this is important, but we have clearly over-indexed on the expense side.\"Clearly, the company needs the \"modest\" revenue growth (which tallies with the 1% growth expected by analysts) management predicted for 2016 -- cost savings will not be enough. Unfortunately, the integration of Carquest is proving more complex than expected, and the company has reported three disappointing earnings reports in a row and cited customer disruptions caused by integrating Carquest.Consequently, sales growth has been hard to come by recently. Adjusted reported sales fell 2.6% in the fourth quarter, and same-store sales growth has turned negative.Data source: Advance Auto Parts presentations.Moreover, current trading isn't much better. According to Sherman on the : \"If you look at Q1 so far, sequentially we've seen some progress, but it is not up to what our expectations are right now.\"And this comes at a time when AutoZone's same-store sales increased 3.5% in its last reported quarter, while O'Reilly Automotive (recall that it's a DIFM-heavy company like Advance Auto) increased same-store sales by 7.7% in its fourth quarter. Looking ahead, there are two possible outcomes in 2016. The first involves a lowering of full-year expectations -- Advance Auto is searching for a new CEO, and he might do that if/when appointed -- which would hit the stock price in the near term.The second scenario is that the company successfully executes on its collocation (Carquest stores are closed and relocated in nearby Advance Auto stores) and conversion (Carquest stores are converted to Advance Auto stores) plans, and management hits 12% EBIT margin and sales growth in 2016 -- the stock would go higher. In a sense, it's a classic deep-value investing conundrum: near-term risk vs. long-term value. Frankly, I think investors should view the proposition favorably, because O'Reilly And AutoZone are giving good sales numbers -- evidence that the environment remains favorable -- and investing in a company that could benefit from low gasoline prices (more miles driven equals more automobile wear and tear) is a good place to be in the current environment. Advance Auto may well disappoint operationally, but on balance, it's a good value.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

If you do that math, that would be an average of 100 stores per state. That's pretty impressive for two brothers who opened their first store in Springfield, Missouri, in 1957.And ORLY hasn't looked back since then.By 1989, it had 100 stores throughout the Midwest and South, and it has continued to grow through acquisitions of big regional market players around the U.S., adding stores as well as distribution centers to its operations.One of the newest strategies for the company now is to look to exploit is current inventory of real estate holdings. Remember, when you have that many stores in such a wide array of states, you tend to end up with a lot of real estate as well.Given current low interest rates, selling off some its commercial real estate holdings is an ongoing opportunity in a strong market.ORLY stock also continues to drill down into its foundational markets with the DIY-er and the professional mechanics. When the economy is faltering, more people get under the hood of their vehicles for simple repairs, rather than taking their vehicles to a garage that will charge for parts and labor.And ORLY knows its market.Its recent quarterly and fiscal year numbers make 2015 the 23rd consecutive year that ORLY has realized same-store sales growth. That means it has sold more out of its stores, year after year, for more than two decades.Same-store sales growth for Q4 was 7.7% compared to 6.3% in the same quarter a year ago. Sales were up 12% from 2014. Operating income was up nearly 20%.What's more, ORLY stock just announced that it's committing another $750 million to its stock repurchase program, pushing the total to $6.25 billion. Most companies use the repurchase program as a way to maintain the stock price when the company isn't doing well. That certainly isn't the case for ORLY.And it makes this stock even more compelling for 2016.Forward guidance calls for ORLY to open 210 more stores in 2016. It also looks like comparable store sales growth may slow slightly in Q1, likely to do with the weather - fewer people are interested in working on their vehicles when it's winter.The stock has sold off big since the beginning of February, especially going into the week before it released its latest numbers. But it has now climbed this wall of worry, and momentum is on its side moving forward.This is a great opportunity.The post  appeared first on  .The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the iShares Russell Mid-Cap Growth ETF (Symbol: IWP) where we have detected an approximate $52.0 million dollar outflow -- that's a 1.0% decrease week over week (from 67,200,000 to 66,550,000).

Looking at how the markets responded, we can see two clear winners emerge: AutoZone and  . data by  .That's not happenstance, either. There are some very good reasons why, when comparing AutoZone and O'Reilly to competitors  and  , the former two excel.The aftermarket auto parts market is primarily comprised of two components: people who want to fix their own cars themselves (the do-it-yourselfers) and those who want someone else to do the work (or the do-it-for-mes).Both AutoZone and O'Reilly cater to the DIY portion of the market, though to varying degrees.AutoZone is the  , operating more than 5,600 retail stores in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Mexico, and Brazil selling automotive replacement parts and accessories for cars, SUVs, vans, and light trucks. While it has a commercial business that distributes parts to garages, dealers, and service stations who cater to DIFMs, AutoZone generates no money from repairing vehicles itself.O'Reilly Automotive also serves both the DIY and DIFM markets, and like AutoZone, it has no repair shops. Instead, it operates 4,523 stores in 43 states and supplies those shops that do repair services. But where O'Reilly skews slightly in favor of DIYers, generating 58% of its revenue from that market, AutoZone realizes some 82% of its revenue from them.In comparison, Advance Auto Parts falls the other way, getting 57% of its revenue from DIFMers, just like Pep Boys, which obtains about 56% of its revenue from the segment. That both of those aftermarket auto parts companies have lagged the industry is not surprising.Although hedge fund Starboard Value views the DIFM market as having the best growth potential because of the growing complexity of cars making it more difficult for people to do their own repairs, the sagging economy and dour prospects for the future suggest people will continue trying to fix their own vehicles while they can.AutoZone's heavy exposure to the DIY segment has translated into industry-leading market share. Although the marketplace is highly fragmented when including car dealerships, independent auto parts stores, and the like, one company rises to the top.Although Advance Auto Parts has an equal slice of the pie, because it skews to the DIFM side of the equation, its prospects don't shine as brightly as AutoZone's.Data source: Chart by author from data provided by Starboard Value from Morgan StanleyAnd if you look at which company's stock valuation is most attractive compared to its earnings, AutoZone is again favorably positioned. data by  .Although it's true that an economic downturn could make it difficult on the aftermarket auto parts industry as customers could be put in financial straits that make auto repair take a backseat to other priorities, it's also a fact that cars are essential, particularly in a downturn, to get and keep jobs.The industry has proven remarkably resilient in good times and bad, and Starboard Value notes there have only been three quarters in the past decade where one of the players reported declining same-store sales. Generally, business is always going up, and that should give investors encouragement that AutoZone will remain the leading aftermarket auto parts retailer.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

That momentum continued into Thursday, as ORLY surged ahead an additional 3% at the market open.Let's take a closer look at O'Reilly and see whether it gets the green light from me.For those of you who haven't heard of it, O'Reilly Automotive is one of the largest specialty retailers for aftermarket parts, automotive tools and professional service equipment in the United States. The company has more than 4,500 stores throughout 44 states as well as a lucrative online store.The company caters to both do-it-yourself customers and professional installers, selling everything from new and remanufactured auto parts (such as alternators, fuel pumps), maintenance items (oil, antifreeze), accessories (floor mats, seat covers) and auto body paint. O'Reilly Automotive also has a wind product offering. And the company specializes in locating hard to find parts, making them a go-to choice for car enthusiasts.Last quarter, business was brisk. Comparable store sales (which only counts stores open a year or longer) climbed 7.7%; 2015 marked the 23rd consecutive year of comparable store sales growth.Meanwhile, total sales jumped 10% to $1.95 billion. Analysts were looking for $1.91 billion in sales, so O'Reilly posted a modest sales surprise. Over the same period, earnings jumped 20% to $129 million, or $2.19 per share. This beat the $2.08 consensus EPS estimate by 5.3%.So it's easy to see why ORLY shares are climbing higher.However, I see plenty of upside potential from here. Looking ahead to FY 2016, O'Reilly expects to see comparable store sales climb between 3% and 5%. Meanwhile, the analyst community is calling for 7.2% annual sales growth and 14.2% earnings growth for the current fiscal year.The company also authorized a $750 million increase to its already generous share repurchase program. O'Reilly's total stock buybacks weigh in at $6.25 billion.O'Reilly's performance today proves that amidst general uncertainty, fundamental strength is king.

In the last quarter, the company had posted a positive earnings surprise of 11.86%. Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.O'Reilly has a positive trend of surpassing estimates. This is evident from the company's trailing four-quarter positive average earnings surprise of 6.33%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.For 2015, O'Reilly expects earnings per share in the range of $8.97-$9.01, significantly above $7.34 reported in 2014. Also, the company anticipates consolidated comparable store sales to increase 6.5%-7%. The company's revenue guidance range for 2015 is $7.85-$7.95 billion, higher than $7.22 billion generated in 2014. Higher annual guidance raises hopes about an improvement in the company's fourth-quarter 2015 results as well. O'Reilly also pursues an aggressive share repurchase policy, which continues to boost earnings per share.Further, the company undertakes the opening of new stores for greater penetration in existing markets and to expand into new, contiguous markets. A higher number of stores will help enhance the company's fourth-quarter revenues.However, O'Reilly's stores are concentrated in a few locations in the U.S. Therefore, its business is exposed to the economic and weather conditions of these regions. In addition, much of O'Reilly's cash is locked in inventories, which can affect the short-term liquidity of the company in periods of low sales.Our proven model does not conclusively show that O'Reilly is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below: O'Reilly has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both stand at $2.07. O'Reilly carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company's ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies in the automobile sector you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Tenneco Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +2.63% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is expected to release fourth-quarter and full-year 2015 earnings results on Feb 9.BorgWarner Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +2.78% and a Zacks Rank #3.

(Symbol: ORLY) shares, but cautious about paying the going market price of $238.93/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the August put at the $180 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $3.60. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 2% return against the $180 commitment, or a 3.5% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to ORLY's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $180 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. sees its shares decline 24.9% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $176.40 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $3.60 from $180), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.5% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $180 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the August put at the $180 strike for the 3.5% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $238.93) to be 23%.

However, earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Revenues dropped 3% year over year to $3.6 billion and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.79 billion. The year-over-year decline was due to unfavorable currency impact, partially offset by an increase in volumes in North America and Europe.Delphi Automotive regularly undertakes acquisitions and alliances to enhance its technological capability, increase its operating scale, augment its client base and expand geographically. The company's strong balance sheet and free cash flows allow it to follow an active capital deployment strategy. However, high dependence on original equipment manufacturers and weak auto production in South America are some concerns.Revenues are expected in the band of $14.9-$15.1 billion in 2015, down from $15.2-$15.6 billion predicted earlier and lower than $17.02 billion recorded in 2014. For 2015, adjusted operating income is anticipated in the range of $1.94-$1.97 billion, lower than the previous estimate of $1.98-$2.03 billion as well as $2.02 billion recorded in 2014.However, the outlook for earnings is favorable. For 2015, Delphi Automotive projects adjusted earnings in the range of $5.15-$5.25 per share, significantly higher than $5.09 earned in 2014.Based on the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.38, the company's fourth-quarter 2015 earnings are expected to increase 4.45% year over year.

It is the first concept car from Faraday.Faraday, based in Gardena, CA, will be making an investment of $1 billion for a manufacturing plant in North Las Vegas, NV, over the coming weeks. The plant will create 4,500 new jobs. With this, Faraday expects to start production of its first electric vehicle in a couple of years. The company is entering the electric vehicle market in order to meet the changing demand in the industry.The FFZero1 concept vehicle is based on Faraday's modular engineering platform, Variable Platform Architecture (\"VPA\"), in which the battery structure is arranged into strings. Altering the strings will change the battery capacity. The concept vehicle is a single seater and has four quad core motors with over 1,000 horsepower. This enables the vehicle to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in less than 3 seconds. The concept vehicle has a maximum speed of over 200 mph.Faraday claims to be a fast moving company. Founded just 18 months ago, the company is already gearing up for a 3 million square feet manufacturing plant in Nevada and aims to deliver its first electric vehicle in the next couple of years.The production vehicle, which will be launched in a couple of years based on the FFZero1 concept vehicle, will definitely stir competition in the market. However, Tesla, which was founded in 2003, has reached its position over the years. Further, by the time Faraday actually launches a production vehicle, Tesla is expected to announce new vehicles and technologies. In order to provide tough competition to Tesla, Faraday needs to work efficiently and at a rapid pace.Faraday stated that it will be focusing on customers of luxury gasoline-powered vehicles to expand in the small electric vehicle market in the U.S. In the growing market for non-gasoline vehicles, opportunity exists for both the companies to prosper.Tesla currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Better-ranked automobile stocks include Lear Corp.  , Autoliv, Inc.  and O'Reilly Automotive Inc.  , all carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Data source: Automotive News Data Center.However, the market will eventually work its way through pent-up demand from the past recession, when sales of vehicles plummeted. While sales will likely remain elevated for the near term, here are two investments to consider if you believe sales are going to move lower sooner rather than later.Sure, the automotive industry is cyclical, and that equals pain for auto manufacturers like  in the event sales take a downturn. However, that doesn't mean all investments in the auto industry are to be avoided, even now when sales could be peaking. BorgWarner is a great example, as the company is poised to benefit from industry trends that will stick around through up and down cycles.Thanks to many nations focusing on improving fuel economy, and regulations becoming more stringent, BorgWarner's future has upside. The company produces innovative powertrain solutions aimed at improving fuel economy, emissions, and performance.Currently, BorgWarner's revenue for the fiscal year will likely check in a little lower than $8 billion, but management expects that figure to jump to roughly $15 billion by the end of 2020. If BorgWarner can reach operating income margins, excluding special items, of 13% this year as originally forecast, it will be the sixth straight year of year-over-year improvement and closer to its goal of mid-teens by the end of 2020.Image source: BorgWarner's November Investor Presentation.While BorgWarner still operates in a fairly capital-intensive business, its return on invested capital has checked in around 20% annually since 2011 -- which suggests the company is investing in its business wisely.BorgWarner is far from (small-f) foolproof, as is any investment in the stock market, but if you're concerned about owning auto manufacturers in the event sales decline in the U.S. and/or worldwide, BorgWarner is one company still poised to benefit from an increased focus on improving fuel economy and reducing vehicle emissions.During the past recession, automotive aftermarket chains like O'Reilly Automotive actually fared well as many consumers put off buying new vehicles and instead did maintenance and repairs on their vehicles themselves. That meant consumers spent a lot of time perusing the aisles of O'Reilly or one of its competitors.O'Reilly operates a dual-market strategy, which means it generates roughly half of its revenue from the do-it-yourself market and half of its revenue from the commercial side, or the \"do-it-for-me\" market. At the end of 2014, its official split was 58% do-it-yourself and 42% do-it-for-me. O'Reilly was an early adopter of this strategy, which its competition is copying.It's a bonus that O'Reilly performed well during the last economic downturn, but the company appears to have upside regardless of the economy. During O'Reilly's analyst day presentation in August, it noted that year-to-date comparable-store sales were up 7.2%, compared to a 5.7% increase for the same period in 2014. During the same time frame, its operating margin increased to 18.7% versus 17.4% for the prior year.Much of that improvement is due to the rising number of miles driven in the U.S., which fuels demand for auto repairs and maintenance parts. Even with economic woes and unemployment pressures over the past seven years, total miles driven remained relatively flat -- and as the U.S. economy continues to add jobs and gas prices remain low, miles driven is starting to resume growth.Also, investors should keep in mind that growth can come in the form of increased operational efficiency. O'Reilly acquired CSK Auto in 2008, which added roughly 1,300 stores to its footprint, and the company has done a solid job of improving the practices and strategies to sell products in those acquired stores. However, the company has said that there is still room to continue optimizing these stores' performance, which should continue to drive overall same-store sales and margins higher.Ultimately, as great as it is for auto manufacturers right now, when new-vehicle sales are set to test the annual record of 17.4 million set in 2000, there will be plenty of opportunities for investors if those sales begin to decline over the next five to 10 years. BorgWarner and O'Reilly are certainly two options to keep on your watchlist.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Going forward, this auto retailer of used and new vehicles will continue to benefit from its aggressive store expansion and share repurchase strategies. However, rising competition and a weak financial position remain headwinds.CarMax's earnings per share increased 5% year over year to 63 cents in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 (ended Nov 30, 2015). The improvement in the bottom line was driven by lower shares outstanding. However, earnings fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents.CarMax's net sales and operating revenues in the reported quarter increased 4.1% year over year to $3.54 billion, mainly driven by higher sales of used and wholesale vehicles. Revenues, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.62 billion. The year-over-year rise was mainly driven by higher sales of used and wholesale vehicles.CarMax follows an aggressive store growth policy. During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, CarMax opened 2 stores and relocated 1 store. Subsequent to quarter end, the company entered the Boston market with two stores in Norwood and Danvers, MA. In fiscal 2016, the company plans to open 14 stores, including its third store in Westborough, and relocate 1 store whose lease is about to expire. The company also intends to open 13-16 superstores in each of the next two fiscal years. As of Nov 30, 2015, CarMax had 155 used-car stores across 77 markets.In addition, CarMax consistently enhances shareholder value through buybacks. During third-quarter fiscal 2016, CarMax spent $445.7 million to repurchase 7.7 million shares. As of Nov 30, 2015, the company had $1.55 billion of authorization remaining under its share repurchase program.However, CarMax has a weak financial position. Moreover, the company is witnessing declining new vehicle sales. In the first nine months of fiscal 2016, new vehicle revenues decreased 16.2% to $162.8 million owing to a 16% fall in unit sales to 6,039 vehicles. Also, the average selling price of new vehicles dropped 0.3% to $26,851.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock also witnessed downward estimate revisions over the last 30 days.

Revenues of $2.29 billion also fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.33 billion. Gross profit declined 0.2% to $1.032 billion, or 45% of sales in the quarter, from $1.034 billion or 45.2% of sales a year ago. The decrease in gross profit margin was attributable to higher inventory expenses due to product integration and modest supply chain expense.Based on the disappointing third-quarter results, continuing integration headwinds and soft sales volume recorded in the beginning of the fourth quarter, Advance Auto Parts reduced its guidance for fiscal 2015. The company now expects earnings per share in the range of $7.75-$7.90 in fiscal 2015, down from the previous forecast of $8.10-$8.30. The company also anticipates flat to slightly negative comparable store sales and flat gross margin rate in the fourth quarter. Further, earnings are expected to remain under pressure in the fourth quarter due to the impact of integration activities.Moreover, Advance Auto Parts is recording declining cash flow. During the first nine months of fiscal 2015, operating cash flow dropped to $520.1 million from $540.3 million in the same period of fiscal 2014.

Revenues of the Truck, Parts and Other segment as well as the Financial Services segment deteriorated in the quarter.PACCAR, the third-largest manufacturer of heavy-duty trucks in the world, is likely to be affected by the declining heavy-duty truck industry sales in South America. PACCAR expects heavy-duty truck demand in South America to range around 70,000-80,000 units in 2015, down from 129,000 units sold in 2014. Demand is expected to be around the 2015 level next year as well.Although Class 8 industry retail sales for the U.S. and Canada are anticipated to rise to 275,000-285,000 units in 2015, the figure is expected to drop to 240,000-270,000 units in 2016.Moreover, PACCAR's earnings outlook does not seem promising. Earnings per share are expected to decline 5.06% year over year in fourth-quarter 2015, while the figure is projected to fall 4.4% in the first quarter of 2016.In fact, analysts do not seem too hopeful about PACCAR's performance in 2016.

Image source:  via Flickr.So who will  pursue now? The Japanese tire maker finally bowed out of the bidding war for  after billionaire investor Carl Icahn trumped its  with one for $18.50 a share and made it clear he was willing to spend what it took to win.Although Bridgestone had gamely  Icahn's offers in a series of tit-for-tat exchanges, with Pep Boys bemusedly sitting back and saying first one side's offer was superior, then the other, it became quickly apparent the tire maker was tiring of the game. It had attempted to  between Pep Boys and Icahn by including language in its amended offer precluding the aftermarket auto-parts and service center from negotiating any further with the investor. It also increased the breakup fee Pep Boys would have to pay if their deal fell through. But Icahn returned with a follow-up bid Pep Boys couldn't ignore.And so Bridgestone finally relented and said it would not match or top Icahn's last offer, which effectively valued Pep Boys at around $1 billion. It was reaching a peak valuation, anyway, as even Icahn was getting leery of the breakup fees that the auto-parts retailer was going to have to pay if he won. The hedge fund operator noted that if Bridgestone parried his offer and upped the termination fee again, even he would have to reconsider staying in the game.Yet it was the tire maker that blinked first, and that ought to lead investors to wonder if Icahn overpaid for the opportunity. It was said  had been in the early bidding on its rival, but it quickly got out after the bids surpassed $13 per share.Whereas rivals  ,  , and O'Reilly are all profitable to varying degrees, Pep Boys has lost money over the past year, and any profits it has made have been dwindling quickly. In its third-quarter earnings report, Pep Boys said sales fell 2%, as comparable-service revenues from DIFMs (\"do-it-for-mes\") dropped 2.5% while comparable-merchandise sales from the DIYers fell 1.6%.That, of course, was part of the attraction of buying the auto-parts retailer. Because there is a vibrant, growing, and potentially lucrative market for people needing someone to fix increasingly complex autos, finding the right components to turn the retailer around could be a profitable endeavor. It's one of the reasons Advance Auto Parts was also seen as a  itself after an activist investor established a stake in the company.The DIFM market represented by Pep Boys and Advance Auto Parts hasn't performed as well as the DIY end. Image source:  via Flickr.Hedge fund Starboard Value has said Advance's stock could double to around $400 a share if operational and structural changes were made to the business. Like Pep Boys, which realizes almost 56% of its revenues from repair services, Advance Auto Parts also focuses more on the DIFMs, generating 57% of its revenues from the segment. In contrast, rivals AutoZone and O'Reilly are the opposite, concentrating more on the DIYers, where they generate 82% and 58% of their revenues, respectively.It was also one of the reasons tire maker Bridgestone was after Pep Boys. The tire maker doesn't just sell tires: It also operates a network of 2,200 tire and automotive service centers. The auto-parts retailer would have added 800 more. But that's why Icahn wanted it, too.The activist investor purchased Auto Plus this past summer and laid out at the time a strategic plan of growth to quickly build its \"revenue and geographic impact\" by making large acquisitions.Bridgestone also has geographic growth ambitions, meaning it's a situation that could lead the tire maker to pursue Advance Auto Parts instead. But because it is substantially larger and financially healthier, Bridgestone might have to pony up more for an offer, and O'Reilly was rumored to be interested, too. Advance has more than 5,300 locations all across the U.S. and in Canada.The main problem facing Pep Boys, and to a lesser extent Advance -- but benefiting AutoZone and O'Reilly -- is the sluggish economy that keeps driving people to fix their own cars instead of taking them to the shop. With little prospects for a change in that dynamic, Bridgestone may end up being happy it lost the bidding war, particularly if it finds a better partner with a better balance skewed toward do-it-yourselfers and away from do-it-for-mes.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

With Pep Boys board of directors agreeing Icahn's latest offer is superior to Bridgestone's previous one of $17 a share, delivered just before the deadline when  would have been accepted, it's now on the tire maker to sweeten the pot once again.The bidding war quickly heated up following Bridgestone's original $15-per-share offer in October after Icahn said he'd pay $15.50.

In agreeing to Bridgestone's offer prior to Icahn raising his, the tire maker got Pep Boys to agree to pay it $39.5 million as a breakup fee if the retailer ultimately accepted Icahn's offer, more than $4 million more than it had originally agreed to pay. Icahn now says that while he's willing to continue this game of one-upping Bridgestone, if Pep Boys agrees to pay a breakup fee that's higher than what it is now, he'd have to reconsider because it \"would prevent a truly robust auction.\"Pep Boys' management has seemingly wanted to be sold to Bridgestone more than to Icahn, but has been forced to admit the billionaire's offers have been superior.

There were a few good reasons the billionaire might have walked away from the Pep Boys battle, but Icahn's pugnacious nature ultimately won out and he bumped up his bid from $15.50 per share to $16.50 per share.And with Pep Boys declaring Icahn's bid superior to Bridgestone's, the ball on matching the counteroffer once more or exceeding it is now in the tire maker's court. The market is bidding up the auto-parts retailer's stock well above Icahn's offer, suggesting investors think Bridgestone hasn't given up yet, but the company's reluctance last time to do more than just match Icahn's offer may mean we've reached a limit.The tire maker had tried to cut off discussions between Pep Boys and Icahn when it filed its  last time. In a section titled \"Termination of Discussions with Icahn,\" Bridgestone demanded:\"The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any activities, discussion, or negotiation with Icahn or any other Person conducted heretofore by the Company, the Company's Subsidiaries or any of the Company's Representatives with respect to any Competing Proposal received prior to the execution of this Amendment.\"Of course, Pep Boys has a fiduciary responsibility to shareholders to obtain the best price for its company, but it seems Bridgestone is weary of the back-and-forth and might not want to go through it again.Certainly the deal's value is approaching a peak premium. O'Reilly was reportedly scared off from making a play for Pep Boys once bids exceeded $13 per share, and the tire maker may feel similarly put off. Indeed, while Advance Auto Parts lost all the gains it had made following the rumors of a potential takeover subsiding as no deal materialized, it may be more in play now than ever.Could Advance Auto Parts serve as a backup plan for Bridgestone's global growth strategy?A recent Bloomberg  offered up a number of good reasons O'Reilly Automotive might want to buy Advance Auto Parts:While it's tempting to think Bridgestone could just as easily pursue Advance as it did Pep Boys, there are a few differences between the parts-and-repair service retailers that would make it unlikely.A Pep Boys merger would add approximately 800 locations to Bridgestone's existing network of 2,200 tire and automotive service centers, but Advance is substantially larger. Following its acquisition of Carquest last year, the aftermarket parts retailer operates more than 5,300 locations all across the U.S. and in Canada. That alone might make a takeover bid bigger than what was offered for Pep Boys.Still, like its rival, Advance focuses more on the do-it-for-me market rather than the do-it-yourself side of the business. While the growing complexity of cars ought to make that business model preferable, a tough economy is pushing the DIFM market higher, and experts O'Reilly and AutoZone are the ones benefiting. Whereas the stocks of those two have gained between 20% and 30% over the past 12 months, Advance Auto Parts has fallen 7%. Its depressed valuation could make it attractive.When Icahn acquired Auto Plus this past summer, he laid out a plan of growth by acquisition through large mergers to quickly build its \"revenue and geographic impact.\" Pep Boys fits the bill for the investor.It also suits Bridgestone's own efforts to accelerate a global growth strategy, but there may be more than just one path to achieve it.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The year-over-year decline in revenues was due to lower motorized unit shipments.Revenues from the towables segment increased 24.1%, backed by a 49.5% rise in unit volume, partly offset by a 175.5% fall in average selling price.

Gross profit improved to $25.2 million or 11.8% of sales from $24.4 million or 10.9% of sales in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year increase in gross margin was backed by better motorized product mix, higher contribution from towables, lower workers' compensation expense and the realization of cost-saving benefits related to Winnebago's strategic sourcing initiative. This was partly offset by continued labor-related manufacturing inefficiencies and unfavorable trends in warranty expense.Winnebago had cash and cash equivalents of $55.7 million as of Nov 28, 2015, compared with $70.2 million as of Aug 29, 2015.In first quarter fiscal 2016, Winnebago's cash used in operations stood at $8.1 million, down from $19.6 million in the year-ago period.

The former has been under pressure from hedge fund Starboard Value to make changes to its operational performance, as it believes Advance Auto Parts stock could be worth double its price, or $400, if it could get margins to match those at O'Reilly.O'Reilly is rumored to be one of the possible suitors, as is Icahn, which would mean he has given up on his Pep Boys takeover. As Icahn is not known as someone who gives up easily, that seems hard to believe, but it's possible that with Bridgestone having matched his offers, Pep Boys management urging shareholders to accept their bid, and his reluctance to raise his offer in the first place, he may view Advance Auto Parts as an easier target with similar prospects for growth.Advance Auto Parts says it doesn't comment on speculation but considering the pressure Starboard Value has been putting on the company, investors should watch for further developments both here and at Pep Boys.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

This also includes a fine of $900 million imposed in third-quarter 2015 for the Deferred Prosecution Agreement.Kenneth Feinberg, the lawyer hired to assess the claims, said that about 91% of the proposed awards were accepted by the victims. General Motors stated that in 74% of the death claims and 61% of other eligible claims, the drivers were not careful. They were either - not wearing a seat belt, driving at high speed, driving in an inebriated state, or falling asleep at the wheel.General Motors has been facing the heat for delaying the recall of 2.6 million vehicles with defective ignition switches, which can lead to shutting down of the engine and prevent deployment of front air bags in the event of a crash. The company issued a recall in Feb 2014 although the problem was identified back in 2001. Yielding to both legal and political pressure, General Motors launched a program in Jun 2014 to compensate the victims and families affected by crashes due to the ignition switch defect.However, General Motors is not responsible if the mishap occurred before it emerged from bankruptcy restructuring in Jul 2009, or if the victims were partially responsible.

The aftermarket auto repair specialist had been forced to admit the activist's investor's bid was superior to the $15-per-share offer made by Bridgestone in late October, but on Friday it said the tire maker had added an additional $28 million in cash consideration, and Pep Boys said Icahn's offer was no longer a \"superior proposal.\" Investors stand to benefit if a bidding war breaks out between Icahn and Bridgestone, but it's not clear exactly how much more the billionaire -- or the tire maker, for that matter -- would be willing to pay. It's telling that Bridgestone only matched Icahn's offer and did not exceed it. The challenge for either buyer will be waiting for the aftermarket parts market to turn in Pep Boys' favor. Where  and  realize more than half their revenues from DIYers, Pep Boys and  cater more to the do-it-for-me crowd, generating 57% and 56% of their revenues, respectively, from this segment. However, despite the growing complexity of cars and the difficulty of doing your own work on them, both Pep Boys and Advance lag their peers as the DIY segment remains strong in a difficult economy.The market, though, seems to think a counteroffer will be made by Icahn, as Pep Boys' stock is trading well above the current offer from either suitor. Pep Boys cash flow is valued at about half that of the other parts suppliers, suggesting bids could go higher, but it is also the only one of the four that's losing money, so it may fast be approaching a ceiling.Pep Boys recommends investors accept Bridgestone's deal, as they did previously, which seemed to encourage Icahn to finally raise his own after long refusing to do so. He's proven in other deals not to give up easily without a fight, and the tire maker, which already seems to be limiting its vulnerability, may not have the fortitude to do battle for very long.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Customers can book the vehicle through the automaker's website for a payment of 80,000 pesos ($4,701.2). The prices of Model S for the country are expected to start from $75,000 plus taxes, according to sources.Tesla's decision to begin operations in Mexico was based on the interest of the country's government and sustainable transport. In addition, Mexico City is one of the major luxury markets. Mexico's automotive industry is a mature, dynamic market, which has been witnessing continuous growth. In 2014, light vehicle production reached a new historical record of 3 million vehicles. The Mexican automotive industry is expected to expand in the future and reach a production level of 4 million units by 2018 and 5 million by 2020, according to Mexican Automobile Industry Association (AMIA).Tesla is also reportedly planning to expand its Superchargers network in Mexico to facilitate longer trips. The automaker further aims to open a formal store in the country by the second quarter of 2016. Earlier this year, Tesla declared that it will commence operations in Mexico from the latter half of the year. Tesla thinks that Mexico's automobile market offers substantial demand for both new and used vehicles. Hence, after the establishment of service centers and Superchargers, the country may import a wide range of used Tesla vehicles.Tesla's Model S, featuring advanced technology, can reach 0 to 100 km / h in just 3 seconds and up to 425 kilometers without recharging. The automaker improved the car's safety features by adding three layers of protection under the battery pack, which, it believes, will reduce the safety risk due to any underbody impact to almost zero. In Mar 2015, Tesla added Automatic Emergency Braking, Blind Spot Warning and Side Collision Warning to Model S via a software update, further increasing its safety.Tesla is actively undertaking international expansion. The company started the delivery of Model S in Europe in Aug 2013 and in China in Apr 2014. The electric carmaker also started taking orders for Model S and Model X in Japan in Nov 2013. Tesla launched the right hand drive (\"RHD\") Model S in the U.K. in June and in Hong Kong in July. Further, it started delivering vehicles in Australia and opened its first retail store and service center in the continent in Dec 2014. Additionally, Tesla plans to start manufacturing cars in China over the period 2017-2018. This will help it to avoid the 25% import tariff imposed by China, thus reducing car prices in the nation. Also, this will likely boost sales. Tesla's global operations will expand further with the opening of new stores and service centers, and the expansion of the Supercharger network.Additionally, Tesla intends to expand in India, which is gaining market share and is expected to become the third-largest automotive market in the world. However, the high price range of the company's vehicle is a major impediment. Moreover, there is energy shortfall issues in India. Thus, an electric vehicle is not likely to find too many takers there. Hence, Tesla is designing an affordable sedan, code-named 'Tesla Model 3' for emerging markets.

Revenues also decreased 10.8% year over year to $2.54 billion. The top line was hurt by lower export truck and parts sales, reduced revenues at the Global Operations segment and the company's exit from the Blue Diamond Truck joint venture.Navistar's results have been affected by lower volumes in Brazil, stemming from economic uncertainties. Revenues from the Global Operations segment plunged 45.4% in the first nine months of fiscal 2015 owing to the Brazil rout, decline in engine shipments in South America and restructuring charges, along with unfavorable foreign currency exchange and impairment charges. Moreover, the company is under considerable pressure owing to the sluggish Mexico truck business which has been facing the brunt of lower government spending and devaluation of the peso.In addition, Navistar is incurring additional costs due to the ongoing changes in the on-highway emissions standards concerning fuel efficiency, noise and safety. Also, conforming to additional environmental requirements will lead to a further increase in the company's engineering and product development costs. The final regulations on greenhouse gas emission and fuel efficiency will add to the manufacturing costs of engines and vehicles apart from raising administrative costs.Additionally, Navistar operates in a highly competitive market. The intensity of this competition is expected to continue, resulting in price discount and pressurized margins.

It's an attractive proposition because Advance currently trades at a substantial discount to its peers. In my view, closing the gap could result in a near doubling of the stock price. But can Advance really achieve its aims? Here is what you need to know before buying the stock. In a nutshell, Advance's aim should be to replicate O'Reilly Automotive's improvements of the past few years. O'Reilly is a good benchmark because it has a far higher proportion of do-it-for-me (DIFM) sales compared with, say, AutoZone. In addition, O'Reilly built up its DIFM business following the acquisition of CSK Automotive in 2008. CSK wasn't an established DIFM retailer -- on the contrary, its primary end market was DIY, but O'Reilly built out a distribution network allowing the purchased stores to pursue a dual DIY and DIFM market strategy.In comparison, Advance's early 2014 acquisition of General Parts International, owner of Carquest and Worldpac, immediately gave the company more DIFM sales -- General Parts had 80% of its sales in the DIFM market. The key point is that Advance is following O'Reilly's dual-market strategy, reaching the same endpoint from a different angle.A breakout of each company's sales:\n  \nSOURCE: COMPANY PRESENTATIONS.There are three key distinctions between DIFM and do-it-yourself (DIY). To understand what Advance needs to do, let's look at what O'Reilly has done and, in passing, look at where Advance has been left behind in recent years. First, I'll start with the EBITDA margin.O'Reilly's margin took a hit after the 2008 acquisition of CSK, and similarly Advance's has come under pressure as it integrates Carquest and Worldpac. Clearly, creating a dual-market model doesn't come without teething problems. However, O'Reilly's margin has improved dramatically from 2010, and Advance's management is aiming for an operating margin equivalent to 15% EBITDA margin by 2017. data by  .Second, there's no doubt that O'Reilly's purchase of CSK led to increased capital spending -- partly on building out a distribution network. data by  .However, the extra investment was worthwhile, as O'Reilly's return on invested capital (ROIC, which is net operating profit less taxes, divided by invested capital) has increased markedly, while Advance's has floundered. AutoZone's ROIC increased because of the post-recession popularity of DIY. data by  . Third, Advance needs to improve its working capital management. For example, let's take a look at receivables turnover (net receivable sales divided by average net receivables). It's a measure of how well a company is collecting cash from sales made, and a high number is good. Again, note O'Reilly's improvement while Advance has floundered. data by  . The preceding analysis goes some of the way toward demonstrating the feasibility that Advance can improve its operational metrics in building out a dual-market model -- not least because O'Reilly already did it. Moreover, if Advance hits its 12% EBIT margin target (around 15% EBITDA margin), the stock will look cheap.Analysts have revenue coming in at $9.94 billion in 2016, and a 15% EBITDA margin would generate $1.49 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Based on the current enterprise value (EV, which is market cap plus net debt) of $13.14 billion, the stock would then trade at a forward EV/EBITDA multiple of 8.8 -- O'Reilly currently trades on a multiple of almost 1.9 times this figure, suggesting Advance's stock could perhaps double in the future. data by  .All told, there's no guarantee that Advance will hit its targets, and recent results have demonstrated its difficulty in integrating Carquest. However, the case for the stock is attractive, and O'Reilly's experience suggests Advance could achieve its aims.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Recently, South Korea levied a fine on the automaker and issued a notice, ordering the company to recall 125,522 vehicles. With this, South Korea became the first country outside the U.S. to charge Volkswagen for cheating on emissions tests.South Korea tested the emission levels of affected vehicles and detected that the German automaker had manipulated devices that detect emission levels. Therefore, the nation fined Volkswagen 14.1 billion won ($12.31 million) - the biggest financial penalty to be imposed on an automaker in the country.In addition, Volkswagen needs to submit a recall plan by Jan 6, 2016. The vehicles to be recalled in South Korea are Euro 5 engine vehicles with 2,000cc and 1,600cc diesel EA189 engines, primarily sold over the period 2008-2015, including the popular Tiguan model.Earlier, diesel-powered German imports recorded good sales in South Korea. However, the market share of imported vehicles declined from 15.7% in September to 12.3% in October, marking the lowest percentage since Jul 2013. Volkswagen sales also dropped from 2,901 vehicles in September to only 947 units in October. This decline in sales adversely affected the automaker's market share.

These vehicles were produced at a Ford plant in Hermosillo, Mexico over the period Jul 21, 2008 to Mar 4, 2011. Of the total vehicles recalled, 411,205 are from the U.S., 33,605 from Canada and 7,055 from Mexico.Ford said that the problem is related to the fuel system. The midsize sedans have a purge valve which sends excess fuel vapor to the engine for combustion. These valves may function improperly in the affected vehicles, causing changes in fuel pressure inside the fuel tank. Frequent fluctuations in pressure may lead to a crack at the top of the tank, in turn leading to fuel leak. Further, this fuel spill may catch fire if it comes into contact with a spark or flame.However, there have been no reports of any causalities or fires related to this issue. Ford announced that dealers will update the powertrain control module software, inspect the valve and test the fuel tank for leaks. The company will also replace parts as required.Recalls have become a frequent phenomenon for Ford as well as other automakers to ensure the safety of their vehicles. Frequent product recalls not only reduce consumers' confidence in a brand, but also add to expenses.Ford currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Buy).

According to the company, the seat belt may not be properly connected to the outboard lap pretensioner in some of the vehicles. Thus, it is recalling all vehicles to check if a repair is needed. Currently, Tesla has nearly 90,000 Model S vehicles on the road.The problem was reported earlier this month by a Tesla customer in Europe after the car's front passenger seat belt detached from the seat. The issue was likely due to improper bolting of the seat belt anchors, per the company. However, there was no accident or injury related to it.Moreover, Tesla's technicians have checked nearly 3,000 vehicles so far and did not find the issue in any of these. The company also stated that the rear seat belts of the car are not affected by this problem. Additionally, none of the seat belts of Model X or Roadster are affected.Nevertheless, Tesla has informed the concerned government agencies in various nations about the problem. It has also clarified that the recall will not have any major impact on the company's earnings.

The authority demanded the additional recall as it considers that more Volkswagen vehicles do not meet emissions standards.The authority detected that vehicles with the 3-liter, V-6 diesel engines are equipped with illegal emission software which discharges more pollutants on the highway than permissible limits. The vehicles covered under the proposed recall are of model years 2009 to 2015.The engines of the affected vehicles are manufactured by Audi and distributed to Porsche and Volkswagen. Audi Q7 and Volkswagen Touareg SUVs of model years 2009 to 2016, and the Porsche Cayenne of model years 2013 to 2016 feature this software. Other vehicles having this software include Audi A6, A7, A8 and Q5s of model years 2014 to 2016. Volkswagen needs to submit the recall plan of the affected vehicles within 45 business days.Earlier the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the California Air Resources Board found that around 85,000 vehicles with 3-liter, six-cylinder engines of model year 2009 are equipped with the emissions cheating software.Recently, South Korea levied a fine of 14.1 billion won ($12.31 million) on Volkswagen and issued a notice, ordering the company to recall 125,522 vehicles. The automaker needs to submit a recall plan by Jan 6, 2016.Volkswagen has been much in the news after the EPA revealed that it had developed a software algorithm to deceive U.S emission tests. The company admitted that its diesel vehicles are installed with software which makes the engines appear to have low emission levels during tests. According to the EPA, Volkswagen vehicles emit nitrogen oxides, or NOx, at almost 40 times the standard amount.

But a deep-value company is rarely one firing on all cylinders, and Advance Auto Parts has challenges ahead, as its management seeks to close the valuation gap with rivals  and  . Let's take a closer look at the value proposition. In a nutshell, the case for buying Advance Auto Parts rests on the idea that it can improve its operational metrics to the levels O'Reilly and AutoZone have achieved.Sales in the auto-parts market are split into two areas: do-it-yourself (DIY), and do-it-for-me (DIFM). The latter represents the commercial market, which tends to be lower-margin but looks set for higher growth -- Advance Auto Parts' management has estimated DIFM growth at three times DIY.Of course, it's not a pure comparison, because AutoZone has around 18% of its sales going to the DIFM market, while O'Reilly has around 42% and Advance has around 54%. Given that Advance has the highest percentage of DIFM, why is it trading at a discount to the other two stocks? data by  .The answer is twofold. First, Advance's operational metrics are simply not up to AutoZone's or O'Reilly's. For example, here's the EBITDA margin: data by  .And here is free cash flow-to-assets -- an indication of how well each company is generating cash out of its stores: data by  .Second, Advance Auto Parts' integration of the 2014 acquisition of General Parts International -- owner of Carquest and Worldpac -- is not entirely going to plan. In fact, the integration demands caused comparable same-store-sales growth to slow to just 0.5% in the third quarter, and management was forced to reduce its full-year EPS guidance to a range of $7.75 to $7.90 from a previous range of $8.10 to $8.30. Indeed, this is the second time this year that guidance was cut because of the complexity of the integration. For reference, Advance started the year predicting EPS of $8.35 to $8.50. The disappointing third-quarter results caused a mid-teens decline in the stock price and came accompanied by the news that eight-year CEO Darren Jackson will retire in January. Moreover, the company also announced that CEO Jeffrey Smith of Starboard -- a deep-value investment firm holding around 4% of Advance -- was appointed to the Advance board with immediate effect. In addition, Starboard is to designate two more independent directors.Starboard has a plan to release value in the stock. Key highlights:Starboard's plan involves a combination of implementing a distribution model similar to O'Reilly's -- which requires distribution centers to supply stores with stock -- implementing working capital improvements, and unlocking value at Worldpac -- a distributor of parts for high-end import cars acquired as part of Carquest.In short, Starboard's proposals, if successful, will release even more embedded value in the stock than Advance's management originally planned when it bought Carquest. The long-term case here is compelling. O'Reilly's comparable-same-store sales rose 7.9% in its third quarter, while AutoZone's increased 4.5% -- there is nothing wrong with the auto parts market. It's also an indication that Advance's problems are largely limited to the integration. Meanwhile, the operational metrics at AutoZone and O'Reilly clearly set industry targets for Advance to aim for.However, don't be surprised if there's more short-term weakness as management integrates Carquest. Moreover, the complexity of the integration suggests a risk that the initial targets may need to be realigned -- something the market would not like initially. On balance, Advance is an attractive stock for value investors, but be mindful of near-term risk.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

According to these analysts, Tesla enjoys competitive advantage with regard to its software capabilities.However, the automaker may not have enough cash to invest in software development if it does not manage the expenses related to Model 3 development more efficiently. The analysts also believe that Tesla's strategy of vertical integration is leading to significant capital expenses for the company.Analysts at Morgan Stanley think that the automaker will spend almost $1 billion over the next 12 months. Meanwhile, Tesla envisions capital expenditures of $500 million in the fourth quarter of 2015.Tesla is investing heavily in increasing production capacity, the development of Model S and Model X, the Gigafactory construction and expansion of its sales, services and Supercharger network. Both research and development (R&D) and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses have been rising steadily over the past few quarters. Although R&D expenses declined sequentially in the third quarter of 2015, total operating expenses increased 5%.In the fourth quarter, operating expenses are expected to increase marginally due to higher costs related to the expansion of Tesla's global sales capability and development of Model 3, partially offset by lower expenses associated with Model X development.Moreover, the capital expenditure projection for 2015 was raised to $1.7 billion from $1.5 billion due to accelerated investments in the Gigafactory, further vertical integration of seat assembly and other manufacturing activities, as well as faster milestone execution by certain suppliers for Model X manufacturing equipment and tooling.Moreover, Tesla's cash flows from operations as well as free cash flows are negative. The company's problems are further compounded by the fact that it has been incurring high losses.However, Tesla's expenses should reap rich rewards for the company in the long run, if we go by the popularity of its current products.

In 2014, the Buick line sold 919,582 vehicles in the country - almost four times higher than 228,963 units of Buick sold in the U.S. General Motors believes that its sales volume for Buick in the U.S will not be large enough to justify the establishment of a plant in the U.S. In such a situation, the efficient and cost-effective solution would be to import the vehicles from China.Many U.S. automakers, including Ford Motor Co.  , are gradually considering a shift in production of vehicles from the U.S. considering the cost benefits involved.General Motors currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other well-ranked automobile stocks include O'Reilly Automotive Inc.  and Pep Boys - Manny, Moe & Jack  .

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on  and Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: (  ) is a Business Process Services provider-providing business process outsourcing (BPO) and IT services-mainly to financial services and manufacturing industries.Their focus is on analytics, data management, and risk management services. Genpact-which stands for \"generating business impact\"--began as a unit of GE in 1997, was spun-off in 2005 and listed on the NYSE in 2007.Headquartered in New York City, the company now has more than 70, 000 employees worldwide and global operations in 25 countries. With more than 800 clients, including more than 25% of Fortune Global 500, Genpact is one of largest analytics providers in their industry.The company reported its third quarter results on November 4. Total revenue for the quarter came in at $617.8 million, up 5% year over year and up 7% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted income from operations was $97.1 million, up 10% from the same quarter a year ago.Adjusted earnings were $0.33 per share (per Zacks calculations), beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.28 per share. The company has delivered a beat in three out of last four quarters, with an average positive quarterly surprise of 8.4%.During the quarter, they signed three new large deals, including one with Boeing, bringing the total for the year to seven.The management now expects 2015 total revenue to be ~ $2.46 billion and adjusted income from operations margin to be in the range of 15.1% to 15.3%.During the quarter, Genpact repurchased 3.5 million of its common shares for a total of $78 million under its $250 million share repurchase program.According to Genpact  Business Process Services industry is expected to continue to grow in low teens and reach ~$430 billion TAM (total addressable market) by 2019. The market has low penetration currently with no single market leader. They plan to capture high value opportunities through strategic investing in order to grow their market leadership.As a result of continued solid performance, analysts have started raising the estimates for the company after results. Zacks Consensus Estimates for current quarter and year have increased to $0.30 per share and $1.12 per share, up from $0.29 per share and $1.09 per share, before the results. Rising earnings estimates sent the stock back to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).In the current age of increasing regulatory oversight and all-time high shareholder activism, companies need to be nimble to transform and leverage new technology. This has created an excellent opportunity for Genpact to grow their market leadership using their more than 17 years of business domain expertise and experience running complex operations for more than 800 large companies.Further, with a diversified client base of blue chip companies and favorable industry trends, the company seems to be well positioned to reward its investors. The stock was earlier featured as the \"Bull of the day\" on August 20, it is up almost 12% since then and we expect this uptrend to continue in the coming months. :Falling commodity prices and a slowdown in China have created a very challenging environment for mining and energy companies like BHP. However, the latest troubles for the company are emanating from a deadly dam spill in an iron ore mine jointly owned by them with Vale.Headquartered in Melbourne, Australia,  is one of the world's largest producers of major commodities, including iron ore, metallurgical coal, copper and uranium, and has substantial interests in conventional and unconventional oil and gas and energy coal.Iron ore prices recently fell to their lowest level since July on account of fresh worries regarding declining demand from China. The company also expects the pricing picture for  to continue to be weak for some time to come. BHP is one of the world's largest exporters of metallurgical coal.Last week, it was reported that a pair of dams burst in an iron ore mine in Brazil, submerging the surrounding area in water and mineral waste. According to BHP, Samarco, a 50-50 joint venture between BHP Billiton and Vale, was responsible for operations of the mine.Analysts estimated Samarco to account for about  revenue. The mine is expected to remain shut at least until 2019 fiscal year and cost of cleaning is estimated to exceed $1 billion. The spill has already  at least three lives.Due to weak outlook, analysts have revised their estimates for the company sharply downwards. Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current and the next fiscal year $0.89 per share and $1.46 per share, respectively, down from $1.53 per share and $2.10 per share 60 days ago.Mining-Misc industry is currently ranked 222 out of 265 (Bottom 16%) Zacks industries. Further, uncertainty related to financial implications of the Brazil dam spill will continue to weigh on the shares. It is safer to avoid investing in this stock for the time being.I wrote last month the U.S. bull is old, but not dead. Boy was I right!

I don't even have to make the case for a rally here, all you have to do is look at the market. The last hurdle for the S&P 500 that everyone was worried about was the 200-day moving average that was camped out around 2060. Well guess what? That thing is long gone as now we've surpassed the top of last Friday's trading range. Next stop, 2102, after that, the ATH. What a quick turnaround from the September lows!But the root of my optimism isn't even the S&P 500 chart, it's the Russell 2000, affectionately referred to as the R2K. While the S&P 500 has been bouncing back, the R2K has been taking its time. In fact, the September low on the R2K was lower than the August low. Something that wasn't a characteristic of the S&P chart.From that lower low, shares have begun to rebound, putting in higher lows and higher highs over the last month of trading. It's looking more and more like a breakout in on the horizon for the small caps, which should help boost the rest of the market as well. I'm looking for a rally from now until the end of the year. That means it's time to load the boat.I've uncovered five stocks at or very near their 52-week highs with a ton of momentum that are breaking out to the upside. They are also Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks that have had recent earnings estimate revisions to the upside from analysts. All of these are popular names I'm sure you've all heard of.Amazon.com, Inc. operates as an online retailer in North America and internationally. It operates through the North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) segments. The company serves consumers through retail websites, such as  ,  , and  , which primarily include merchandise and content purchased for resale from vendors and those offered by third-party sellers.Another big time earnings report from Amazon was enough to catapult shares above the July highs and get over $600. In the days following the report, shares have still remained below the top of the earnings gap day but there hasn't been any violent rejection at that level. In the short term that could provide some resistance but give the two days of support the stock saw down at $600, I think it provide a short term base below the stock.CBOE Holdings, Inc., through its subsidiaries, operates as an options exchange and creator of listed options in the United States. The company provides marketplaces for trading options on various market indexes; futures on the VIX Index and other products; options on the stocks of individual corporations comprising equity options; and options on other exchange-traded products that include ETP options, such as exchange-traded funds and exchange-traded notes.Shares are currently butting up against resistance at the 52-week rear $68. The base it established around $65 held for several weeks before this recent bullish attitude has forced shares higher. A crossover above the zero line on the CCI happened just as shares began to break higher. I think the 52-week high lets go over the next couple of days and you see the stock well into the $70s.Delta Air Lines, Inc. provides scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo worldwide. The company operates in two segments, Airline and Refinery. Its route network comprises various gateway airports in Amsterdam, Detroit, Los Angeles, Minneapolis-St. Paul, New York-LaGuardia, New York-JFK, Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Salt Lake City, Seattle, and Tokyo-Narita.The airlines were hot all year as  made life easy for the entire industry. That an economy where more and more people were flying the friendly skies on trips and vacations. Delta benefited along with the rest of the business. A fierce move in October to a fresh 52-week high near $51.50 has been met with a couple of down days here as the CCI has come down from 200 to 43. I expect a bounce at the zero line and a continuation of the short term bullish trend for shares of DAL.McDonald's Corporation operates and franchises McDonald's restaurants in the United States, Europe, the Asia/Pacific, the Middle East, Africa, Canada, and Latin America. The company's restaurants offer various food products, soft drinks, coffee, and other beverages. As of December 31, 2014, it operated 36,258 restaurants, including 29,544 franchised restaurants comprising 20,774 franchised to conventional franchisees, 5,228 licensed to developmental licensees, and 3,542 licensed to foreign affiliates1 and 6,714 company-operated restaurants.The McDonald's story has been pretty interesting. After replacing their CEO, shares wandered in the dessert and spent most of 2015 in a consolidation range in the high $90s. The volatility in August took shares all the way down to below $88. From there it's been nearly straight up. Guess that having breakfast available all day was a good idea. As an aside, take half an egg McMuffin and put it on half a quarter pounder next time you hit the golden arches. You're welcome in advance.O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, engages in the retail of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment, and accessories in the United States. The company provides new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, including alternators, starters, fuel pumps, water pumps, brake system components, batteries, belts, hoses, temperature controls, chassis parts, and engine parts; maintenance items comprising oil, antifreeze products, fluids, filters, wiper blades, lighting products, engine additives, and appearance products; and accessories, such as floor mats, seat covers, and truck accessories.This stock just keeps on trucking. It's a slow and steady wins the race sort of stock that has continuously broken out to new highs again and again over the course of the year. The 200-day sits $40 off the current price, providing support well below the current bullish trend line that sits around $250. Personally, it's my favorite auto parts store as well.The best way to profit from an index that's breaking out is to buy stocks that are breaking out.

The first stock the dynamic duel discuss is Lancaster Colony (LANC) a specialty foods company that is probably best known for the New York brand of Texas Toast.

Brian noted that the stock is benefiting from some macro tailwinds, but he took an extra bit of time in this video to discuss the fact that Pep Boys (PBY) was recently part of an M&A deal.

Cheap gasoline prices, an increase in miles driven and an aging fleet of cars on the road have helped leading players such asO'Reilly Automotive (  ),AutoZone (  ) andAdvance Auto Parts (  ) maintain decent growth.They've accomplished that even as vehicle sales are at their highest point in over a decade -- something that normally would act as a headwind to the auto parts sector.Auto parts chains have also largely avoided competition fromAmazon (  ).O'Reilly, the sector's biggest by market cap, has shown particular strength, with a years-long streak of double-digit earnings growth. It extended that streak after Wednesday's close, logging a 28% year-over-year EPS gain and breezing past consensus views.O'Reilly shares touched a new high of 263.66 on Wednesday and moved even higher after hours. AutoZone shares set their own new high Wednesday, while Advance Auto hit a new record last week.IBD's Retail/Wholesale-Auto Parts group -- which also includesGenuine Parts (  ) andLKQ (LKQ), among other stocks -- ranks No. 8 out of 197 industries surveyed.The group is doing so well that even members considered to be laggards are attracting attention.Case in point: Monday's news that auto parts supplier Bridgestone will acquirePep Boys -- Manny, Moe & Jack (PBY) for about $835 million. Bridgestone will pay $15 a share in cash, a 23% premium over Pep Boys' Oct. 23 closing price. The deal is expected to close early in 2016.Bridgestone paid the premium even though Pep Boys has underperformed for most of this decade. The company's annual revenue has barely budged over the last three years, and it hasn't grown annual earnings since 2011. The fact that Pep Boys brought such a rich buyout offer says a lot about how much auto parts retailers are valued right now, analysts say.\"It certainly signifies the health and strength of the industry when you see a company pay that much for Pep Boys, which historically has been a laggard in the industry,\" Sterne Agee analyst Ali-Ahmad Faghri told IBD. Faghri follows several auto parts stocks, including O'Reilly and AutoZone, but not Pep Boys.The industry's strength is the result of several dynamics, analysts say. One is the average age of cars on U.S. roads: a record 11.5 years, according to research firm IHS Automotive. Older cars require more of the replacement parts, maintenance and repair work that auto parts retailers provide.The aging fleet has also put more vehicles on the road -- a record 250 million, according to Bloomberg. More cars lead to higher demand for auto parts and services.Lower gas prices have been a boon as well. When consumers pay less for gas, they have an incentive to drive more, which increases demand for parts and services.\"Miles driven has been a critical growth driver -- we've seen a nice uptick there,\" Morningstar analyst Adam Fleck told IBD. \"Consumers are increasing their miles driven, which increases the wear and tear on cars.\"Meanwhile, a growing number of consumers are outsourcing maintenance and repair to auto parts retailers rather than doing it themselves. This Do-It-For-Me (DIFM) side of the business has provided an additional revenue stream for auto parts retailers, which used to rely almost exclusively on the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) market.\"We continue to see growth in the Do-It-For-Me market, which has been a major growth driver for these companies,\" Fleck said.Finally, auto parts retailers -- unlike most other retailers -- have not been hurt by Amazon and other e-commerce sites. That's mainly because when someone needs an auto part, he or she doesn't like to wait around for it to arrive by mail.\"Given the focus of service and speed, online retailers like Amazon haven't disrupted the auto parts retailers,\" Faghri said.These favorable trends have helped offset what is normally a headwind for auto parts retailers -- rising vehicle sales.U.S. auto sales climbed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 18.2 million in September, the highest rate in more than a decade.September was particularly strong because it included the full Labor Day weekend. Some experts expect the pace to slow in October, though the annual rate should still be the highest since before the Great Recession.Last week, auto industry consultants J.D. Power and LMC Automotive raised their forecasts for 2015 auto sales to 17.3 million vehicles from 17.2 million.And while more new cars on the road previously translated into less demand for replacement parts and maintenance services, previous conditions no longer prevail.One thing that's different these days: older cars aren't being sent to the graveyard just because their owners are buying new ones. Instead, owners are trading their old cars in or selling them.\"You've seen this boom in new-car sales, and yet the average age (of cars) has continued to tick up,\" Fleck said. \"Cars last longer than they used to, so there's a secular shift going on there. There's still a growing need for auto parts as the age continues to rise, and that's a big positive.\"The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["hicago, IL - November 11, 2015 - Stocks in this week's article include:  and  . Kevin Matras shows why stocks with new analyst coverage are stocks you want to have.Every week the government and other entities release economic reports that cover all areas of the economy - from retail sales to housing, to international trade to consumer sentiment.In fact, on virtually any given day there could be anywhere from one to a handful of reports.And while the financial media does cover them, they usually focus on headline numbers without doing a deeper dive.This is unfortunate because within these reports often exists money-making details that can quickly be uncovered with just an extra few minutes of reading.For example, in the Employment Situation report, it details what sectors saw the most new jobs or labor force expansion, and which ones contracted.I can remember countless times where that report got me into the right sectors and industries at the right time before anybody else was talking about them.In fact, I still remember getting into housing in early 2012 while everybody else was staying as far away from it as possible. But, after seeing construction jobs continue to rise in report after report after report, I knew the housing market had turned. And that was one of the first alerts to the housing recovery - for those who knew where to look.But the headline number and the obligatory one-or-two-sentence write ups on many news sites missed the best part of the story by not going the extra mile (or paragraph).Well here we are again, with more stock-picking insight, straight from last week's Employment Situation report. Last week it showed that some of the biggest job creation came from these three industries:1) Professional and Business Services +78,000(up 624,000 over the last 12 months)2) Health Care +45,000(up 495,000 over the last 12 months)3) Retail Trade +44,000(up 300,000 over the last 12 months)4) Food Service and Drinking Places +42,000(up 368,000 over the last 12 months)5) Construction +31,000(up 233,000 over the last 12 months)Once these reports point you in the right direction, you can then plug in the appropriate sectors and industries to capitalize on this information and find the best stocks within those groups.This is just one very specific way to do top down analysis. But you can go to any screener (like the one on Zacks.com or the Research Wizard) and locate the sector, then industry of interest.Then you should add in your favorite and most successful stock-picking criteria to drill down to the best ones, such as Zacks Rank 1s or 2s (Strong Buys or Buys); market-beating growth rates; below industry valuations; upward earnings estimate revisions, etc.Here are 5 stocks from some of the industries singled out as the biggest job creators in last week's Employment report:(  ) Core-Mark Holding(Professional and Business Services)(  ) LHC Group(Health Care)(  ) O'Reilly Automotive(Retail Trade)(  ) Ruth's Hospitality Group(Food Services and Drinking Places)(  ) Universal Forest Products(Construction)Profitable stock ideas can come at any time and any place.

This fault can stop the engines from functioning. To repair this defect, the automaker will be recalling about 3,300 big pickup trucks and SUVs in North America.This time General Motors identified the defect before anyone was harmed. The company stated that the ignition switch problem may cause the engines to shut down and disable power steering, power brakes and the airbags. The automaker revealed that the trucks have ignition lock gears with an outer diameter larger than specifications which makes them difficult to turn. The keys may get fixed in the start position at high interior temperatures. If the vehicle is driven in such a condition, it could slip into \"accessory\" position.The vehicles covered under the recall mainly include certain 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light-duty pickups, along with 2015 heavy-duty pickups and the 2015 Chevy Suburban and Tahoe SUVs.One of the employees at General Motors first detected this defect in his truck and reported the issue to management. This eventually led to the announcement of the recall. The company has received five reports of engines turning off. However, no casualties have been reported. General Motors confirmed that dealers will replace the ignition lock of the recalled vehicles.The ignition switch issue is similar to last year's problem which led to the recall of 2.6 million vehicles with defective ignition switches which could lead to shutting down of the engine and prevent deployment of front airbags in the event of a crash.In Sep 2015, General Motors reached a settlement over the ignition switch issue with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. The automaker signed a deferred-prosecution agreement as part of the settlement. Per the agreement, the U.S. Attorney's Office agreed to delay action on the charges against General Motors for three years. Moreover, if the company manages to fulfill the terms of the agreement, the federal prosecutors may eventually dismiss the charges. Per the terms laid down, General Motors will have to cooperate with the federal government that will create an independent monitor to analyze the automaker's policies and procedures associated with safety issues and recalls. The company will also have to pay a fine of $900 million, which is likely to be reflected in its third-quarter 2015 results. Additionally, General Motors is conducting an efficient internal investigation and providing the details to the government.Currently, General Motors carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked automobile stocks include Penske Automotive Group, Inc.  , O'Reilly Automotive Inc.  and Superior Industries International, Inc.  , all carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

I don't even have to make the case for a rally here, all you have to do is look at the market. The last hurdle for the S&P 500 that everyone was worried about was the 200-day moving average that was camped out around 2060. Well guess what? That thing is long gone as now we've surpassed the top of last Friday's trading range. Next stop, 2102, after that, the ATH. What a quick turnaround from the September lows!But the root of my optimism isn't even the S&P 500 chart, it's the Russell 2000, affectionately referred to as the R2K. While the S&P 500 has been bouncing back, the R2K has been taking its time. In fact, the September low on the R2K was lower than the August low. Something that wasn't a characteristic of the S&P chart.From that lower low, shares have begun to rebound, putting in higher lows and higher highs over the last month of trading. It's looking more and more like a breakout in on the horizon for the small caps, which should help boost the rest of the market as well. I'm looking for a rally from now until the end of the year. That means it's time to load the boat.I've uncovered five stocks at or very near their 52-week highs with a ton of momentum that are breaking out to the upside. They are also Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks that have had recent earnings estimate revisions to the upside from analysts. All of these are popular names I'm sure you've all heard of.Amazon.com, Inc. operates as an online retailer in North America and internationally. It operates through the North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) segments. The company serves consumers through retail websites, such as amazon.com, amazon.ca, and amazon.com.mx, which primarily include merchandise and content purchased for resale from vendors and those offered by third-party sellers.Another big time earnings report from Amazon was enough to catapult shares above the July highs and get over $600. In the days following the report, shares have still remained below the top of the earnings gap day but there hasn't been any violent rejection at that level. In the short term that could provide some resistance but give the two days of support the stock saw down at $600, I think it provide a short term base below the stock.CBOE Holdings, Inc., through its subsidiaries, operates as an options exchange and creator of listed options in the United States. The company provides marketplaces for trading options on various market indexes; futures on the VIX Index and other products; options on the stocks of individual corporations comprising equity options; and options on other exchange-traded products that include ETP options, such as exchange-traded funds and exchange-traded notes.Shares are currently butting up against resistance at the 52-week rear $68. The base it established around $65 held for several weeks before this recent bullish attitude has forced shares higher. A crossover above the zero line on the CCI happened just as shares began to break higher. I think the 52-week high lets go over the next couple of days and you see the stock well into the $70s.Delta Air Lines, Inc. provides scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo worldwide. The company operates in two segments, Airline and Refinery. Its route network comprises various gateway airports in Amsterdam, Detroit, Los Angeles, Minneapolis-St. Paul, New York-LaGuardia, New York-JFK, Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Salt Lake City, Seattle, and Tokyo-Narita.The airlines were hot all year as  made life easy for the entire industry. That an economy where more and more people were flying the friendly skies on trips and vacations. Delta benefited along with the rest of the business. A fierce move in October to a fresh 52-week high near $51.50 has been met with a couple of down days here as the CCI has come down from 200 to 43. I expect a bounce at the zero line and a continuation of the short term bullish trend for shares of DAL.McDonald's Corporation operates and franchises McDonald's restaurants in the United States, Europe, the Asia/Pacific, the Middle East, Africa, Canada, and Latin America. The company's restaurants offer various food products, soft drinks, coffee, and other beverages. As of December 31, 2014, it operated 36,258 restaurants, including 29,544 franchised restaurants comprising 20,774 franchised to conventional franchisees, 5,228 licensed to developmental licensees, and 3,542 licensed to foreign affiliates1 and 6,714 company-operated restaurants.The McDonald's story has been pretty interesting. After replacing their CEO, shares wandered in the dessert and spent most of 2015 in a consolidation range in the high $90s. The volatility in August took shares all the way down to below $88. From there it's been nearly straight up. Guess that having breakfast available all day was a good idea. As an aside, take half an egg McMuffin and put it on half a quarter pounder next time you hit the golden arches. You're welcome in advance.O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, engages in the retail of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment, and accessories in the United States. The company provides new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, including alternators, starters, fuel pumps, water pumps, brake system components, batteries, belts, hoses, temperature controls, chassis parts, and engine parts; maintenance items comprising oil, antifreeze products, fluids, filters, wiper blades, lighting products, engine additives, and appearance products; and accessories, such as floor mats, seat covers, and truck accessories.This stock just keeps on trucking. It's a slow and steady wins the race sort of stock that has continuously broken out to new highs again and again over the course of the year. The 200-day sits $40 off the current price, providing support well below the current bullish trend line that sits around $250. Personally, it's my favorite auto parts store as well.The best way to profit from an index that's breaking out is to buy stocks that are breaking out. With this rally, there are so many popular names that are on the move, you don't have to dip into the unknown companies.

Earnings benefited from solid automotive distribution business results and better sales in the Office and Electrical distribution businesses, partially offset by foreign currency headwinds and challenging global economic conditions.Genuine Parts recorded net income of $188 million in the third quarter of 2015, down from $190.5 million in the prior-year quarter.Revenues in the reported quarter dropped 2% year over year to $3.92 billion, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4 billion.Operating profit increased 2.6% to $348.5 million from $339.6 million in the third quarter of 2014. On the other hand, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to $834.4 million from $850.2 million a year ago.Revenues at the Automotive Parts segment fell 2% to $2.06 billion from the year-ago level of $2.1 billion. Revenues gained from core automotive growth, offset by currency translation headwinds. The segment's operating profit increased to $202 million in the reported quarter from $193.3 million a year ago.Revenues at the Motion Industries or Industrial segment went down 4% to $1.17 billion owing to declining performance and currency headwinds, partially offset by synergies from acquisitions. The S. P. Richards or Office Products segment's revenues rose 3% to $510.8 million on the back of general improvement in performance. The Electrical (EIS) segment's revenues improved 2% to $196.8 million on the back of benefits from acquisitions, offset by a decrease in core sales and the negative impact of copper pricing.Operating profits at the Motion Industries or Industrial segment declined 5.4% to $90.1 million. Meanwhile, operating profits at the S. P. Richards or Office Products segment increased 9.3% to $36.4 million from $33.3 million a year ago.

The major culprit, China, has spread fears of global repercussions.The sluggishness in other developed and developing economies, lower  , strong dollar, and a slump in commodities further added to the financial market instability. Now with the Q3 earnings season having kicked in, investors remained wary of the impact of these issues on the earnings picture (read:  ).As per the  , Q3 earnings from all the S&P 500 members are expected to decline 5.6% on an annual basis on 5.5% lower revenues. According to Thomson Reuters, S&P 500 companies are expected to report a 4.2% drop in earnings that would be the biggest decline in six years. Despite weak corporate earnings and huge levels of stock market volatility, many investors still want to bet on an improving U.S. economy, which is backed by a healing job market and increasing consumer confidence.For these investors, we have looked into the Zacks ETF Rank to find the best picks. The system takes into account factors such as industry outlook and expert surveys; and then applies ETF-specific factors (like expense ratios and bid/ask spreads) to spot the best funds in each sector. Using this system, we have found a handful of ETFs that have earned a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) in the latest ratings update, and could thus outperform (see:  ).In fact, a couple of funds have seen their Ranks surging to the top hierarchy from #3 (Hold) and could be great picks in the coming months.The twin attacks of the recent  rout and Hillary Clinton's tweet took away the sheen away from the broad healthcare sector. While biotech stocks were hit hard, the medical device corner showed stability even amid turbulence. This is primarily thanks to solid industry fundamentals, including rising mergers & acquisitions, emerging market expansion, positive demographic trends and innovation of new products.Further, all the four industries under the MedTech umbrella have a strong Zacks Rank in the top 35%, suggesting healthy growth. Given this, the medical device ETF looks like an intriguing pick heading into the earnings season. The fund provides exposure to U.S. companies that manufacture and distribute medical devices by tracking the Dow Jones U.S. Select Medical Equipment Index (read:  ).In total, the fund holds 51 securities in its basket with double-digit allocation to the top two firms - Medtronic (  ) and Abbott Laboratories (  ). Other firms do not hold more than 8.73% of assets. In terms of industrial exposure, medical equipment accounts for over 86% share while life science tools & services takes the remainder. IHI has managed assets worth $689 million while charging 43 bps in fees per year. Volume is moderate as it exchanges about 83,000 shares in hand per day. The fund was down 6.2% over the past three months.The consumer discretionary sector is expected to gain the most in Q4, especially given the higher spending power and the fervor of the upcoming holiday shopping season. Cheap fuel and rising income are leading to fatty wallets, which along with an improving U.S. economy, better job prospects and increasing consumer confidence is making the consumer segment a great space to stay invested in.While there is a few options available in this space with a Zacks Rank #1, PEZ gathered maximum attention as it has seen its Rank surging by two notches. This fund follows the DWA Consumer Cyclicals Technical Leaders Index and provides exposure to 38 consumer stocks having positive relative strength (momentum) characteristics. It is slightly skewed toward the top firm - O'Reilly Automotive (  ) - at 5.2%, while other securities have a spread-out exposure, with each holding less than 4% share (see:  ).About 29% of the portfolio is dominated by specialty retail while hotel restaurants and leisure, textiles apparel and luxury goods, and airlines round off the next three positions with double-digit exposure each. PEZ is less popular and less liquid in the consumer discretionary space with AUM of $180 million and average daily volume of 39,000 shares. The expense ratio came in at 0.60%. The product lost 2.5% in the trailing three-month period.These sector ETFs could be the fall season winners and investors should definitely look at them or the other funds in the sector that have recently seen their Zacks Rank surging to #1.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

No. 3 was general concern about the pace of economic growth.\"Rich Weiss, senior portfolio manager of American Century's target-date One Choice Portfolios, said, \"China's growth is decelerating.\"No one outside the Chinese government knows the exact size and pace of the slowdown or whether it has bottomed, he said. \"That uncertainty makes the market nervous. And it creates more uncertainty about China's ability to manage the slowdown so it does not become worse than it is.\"How much China's ills will affect America is what investors want to know. \"How bad can it get? In September the market was very frightened by that question,\" said Jim Swanson, MFS Investment Management's chief investment strategist.Vanguard 500 Index , tracking the broad market, lost 2.49% in September.Q3's top-performing nonleveraged U.S. diversified stock fund with more than $100 million in assets was $555 million Polen Growth Institutional.It edged up 0.7% despite losing 0.53% in September.A focused large-cap growth fund holding 22 names, it has top holdings such asStarbucks (  ), which has IBD's Composite Rating of 99;Nike (  ), with a Comp Rating of 97; andO'Reilly Automotive (  ), with a Comp Rating of 98.Composite Ratings range from 1-99, with 99 the best.The two best performing funds with more than $1.5 billion in assets year to date are $2.2 billion Janus Forty and $1.7 billion  Small Cap Growth , up 3.95% and 3.46%, respectively.So what lies ahead?Investors are looking for signs that China's slowdown has leveled off. Finding reliable signs is dicey.Many investors believe that the Chinese government cooks its numbers for political reasons. \"Official data comes through a filter,\" said Weiss. \"And there are questions about their integrity. Is the government trying to make things look better than they might (really) be?\"To compensate, investors watch data that are harder for the government to fudge. \"Investors watch indicators of economic activity, such as electricity consumption, car sales and transportation industry data,\" Doll said.Swanson keeps an eye on China's monthly retail sales data, which have been improving. He also watches the purchasing managers' index. \"If that keeps falling, it shows their economy is still getting worse,\" he said.As for the U.S., despite the stock market's doldrums the economy is in good shape -- for the moment.Signs of improvement could emerge in mid-October as the third-quarter earnings report season starts. Investors are expecting mixed to good results, Doll says. Anything less would likely have a chilling effect on the market.Swanson notes that the Q2 GDP estimate was revised upward in late September to a strong 3.9%.\"New housing starts have accelerated,\" he said. \"Retail personal consumption numbers show Americans making more money and spending it. Week by week, even through this whole period of (stock market) sell-offs, unemployment claims fell and the composite picture you get is that, so far, the U.S. hasn't missed a beat due to China.\"Investors generally expect the Fed to act in December, says Swanson. Investors will take additional foot dragging as a clue from the Fed that the economy is not strong enough to withstand a rate hike.\"The market wants (the Fed) to raise rates,\" he said. \"Like taking a patient off antibiotics, it will indicate that the patient is healthy.\"Mindful of macro events in China and the U.S., American Century's asset allocation team has begun adjusting its funds' holdings.\"We were generally 5% overweight toward growth funds and 5% underweight in value. We're now equal-weighted to 1% overweight growth,\" he said.He added: \"We're not bracing for a recession. We haven't moved into utilities and financials, but we've taken some cyclical positions off the table.\"In sectors, his group has trimmed consumer discretionary to a market weight and trimmed its tech overweight.In  , his group has boosted its allocation to TIPS, especially shorter-term TIPS, \"directly in response to a rate-hike prospect,\" he said. \"We're replacing some diversified bonds with TIPS.\"He added: \"We've battened down the hatches.\"Real estate funds topped sectors in September, gaining 2.22%, one of the few sectors up last month.As the market sold off, many investors shifted money to REIT funds for the sake of dividend yield. Utility funds, seen by many investors as even more of a proxy for bonds, did not fare as well. They lost 1.09%.Weiss likes U.S. defensive sectors best, given slowing global demand.The only happy story in foreign stock funds in September was the 1.35% gain by India region funds.All others lost ground.Latin American funds lost 6.64%, easily the worst laggards among foreign stock funds.For Q3, no nation or region gained ground.Latin American funds lost the most, 21.69%. That left them down 27.44% for the year.China region funds were not far behind in the loss department in Q3, surrendering 21.18%.\"My view is that we've seen the worst of the decline,\" said Nuveen's Doll, referring to the overall market's tumble, much of which was made in China. \"But that doesn't mean the market is prepared yet to go back up.\"He added, \"The breakout to new highs probably won't be until next year.\"Swanson's outlook is brightest for developed markets, which stand to benefit from low prices on input commodities like oil.Low costs for goods should keep consumers spending.U.S. consumer spending accounts for 15% of global GDP, more than China's GDP.Weiss' team has cut foreign stock allocations \"across the board.\"The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["taples, Inc.

In the last quarter, the company had delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.33%.O'Reilly has a positive trend of surpassing estimates. This is evident from the trailing four-quarter positive average earnings surprise of 4.78%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.For third-quarter 2015, O'Reilly projects earnings per share in the range of $2.29-$2.33. The company expects consolidated comparable store sales growth of 4%-6% in the quarter. O'Reilly pursues an aggressive share repurchase policy, which continues to boost earnings per share.Further, the company undertakes the opening of new stores for greater penetration in existing markets and to expand into new, contiguous markets. A higher number of stores will help boost third-quarter revenues.However, O'Reilly's stores are concentrated in a few locations in the U.S. Therefore, its business is exposed to the economic and weather conditions of these regions. In addition, much of O'Reilly's cash is locked in inventories, which can affect the short-term liquidity of the company in periods of low sales.Our proven model does not conclusively show that O'Reilly is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below: O'Reilly has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both stand at $2.36. O'Reilly carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company's ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies in the automobile sector you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Cooper Tire & Rubber Co.  has an Earnings ESP of +7.90% and a Zacks Rank #3.

(Symbol: ORLY) saw new options become available this week, for the May 2016 expiration. One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 240 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the ORLY options chain for the new May 2016 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $160.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.20. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $160.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $158.80 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of ORLY, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $245.14/share today.Because the $160.00 strike represents an approximate 35% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 95%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of ORLY stock at the current price level of $245.14/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $250.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.96% if the stock gets called away at the May 2016 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if ORLY shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing ORLY's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $250.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $250.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 50%.

Rowe Price Group and manager of the T. Rowe Price New Horizons Fund , uses to select winning stocks.The $16 billion fund returned an annual average of 18.35% in the past five years -- which coincides with Ellenbogen taking over the fund's management in 2010.Ellenbogen, 42, likes buying small companies that can get large. Several of the fund's holdings have done just that and are the reason why the fund is the largest small-cap fund among its peers.He shared with IBD his  -- what has contributed to its strong performance as well as his outlook for the future. Your fund has outperformed the S&P 500 and the Russell 2000 Growth this year. What's been the biggest contributing factor? I think it's a result of our overall investment process: being successful in different types of markets. The goal of the fund is to invest in small companies that have the ability to become much larger. We believe that if you invest in strong businesses that are compounding, they can perform well in different types of markets. What areas have provided the best returns? When I look at the performance this year, companies that demonstrated consistent performance driven by business model innovation and durable growth really did well this year.To give you two examples:Allegiant Travel (  ) is a very unique airline, unlike most airlines that are high fixed-cost, low variable-cost businesses. Allegiant Air is basically the reverse. It has a unique business model run by a strong entrepreneur and because of its scale, it's able to serve markets that other airlines can't serve. It has a very consistent history of profitability.Another example would beSS&C Technologies (  ). It's what we would classify as a company that has a core platform in providing financial technology and services to asset managers. It has a strong technology and a history of acquiring other companies, and basically leveraging its platform, both from a technological standpoint but also from a people standpoint, to deliver consistent returns to shareholders. Going forward, what is your outlook? We don't really change what we're doing based on the market. I always laugh; it seems that the market changes a lot more than we do.If you look at traditional risk measures, you'll see that we run a diversified portfolio and then we're just trying to find strong entrepreneurs and strong businesses that will continue to compound well.What I would point out: We closed the fund (to new investors) at the end of 2013. At the time -- one of the reasons we closed the fund -- we said we thought that small-caps were trading at a premium, a historic level premium vs. the market. In particular, at that point we said we thought that early-stage stocks, which is about one-third of our portfolio, were particularly expensive.I think since then small-caps have underperformed the market and early-stage growth stocks have not fared well. In general, when I look at the overall portfolio, small-caps are still slightly expensive vs. the market, but it's not as extreme. We believe that at this point, performance is going to be driven by individual stock selection. It's been a tough environment for all investors. What do you do to dodge the bullets? There are two things that you do. When economies are more volatile, and certainly we've seen a more inconsistent economy over the last year, you learn about individual companies.If we learn something that's inconsistent with how we think a company should perform in the environment, that will obviously inform us as to what to do with the company. So you're constantly learning, and harder environments expose weaknesses in companies, so we react that way on an individual company basis.I believe there are two things going on. One is cyclical and one is secular. There's clearly cyclical growth that's harder, given what's going on with energy, industrials and companies involved with import-export growth.The second thing that's happening is that the pace of change continues to increase, not only in traditional sectors like technology, but it's spreading into other areas of the economy rapidly, like financial services, transportation -- and basically rippling through the whole economy. And I believe that durability is becoming more scarce.Some people would say the market is paying a premium for growth. I would agree with that. But I think actually what the market is increasingly going to do is pay a premium for durability, because of how rare it is and because of the rapid nature of change that's going on in the companies. That means it's even more challenging for you to pick stocks then? If you really define durability, it's a reflection of competitive advantage. I think the market does a reasonable job of examining competitors that are in the same market space. I think what the market is increasingly going to struggle with is disrupters, those that disrupt either individual competitors or entire sectors of a market. And that's what's going to make this increasingly more difficult for investors. That's where you invest in, disrupters, right? We do two things. If you look at the portfolio, about one-third is in early-stage growth companies, which my people would say are disrupters. And about two-thirds of the portfolio is based on durable growth.We believe that skill set in both is self-reinforcing. So the knowledge of what's going on with disrupters really helps you understand the durability of the companies you invest in.So when we look at a company likeO'Reilly Automotive (  ), which is the largest holding of the fund and has been a terrific investment this year, we would say that's a very durable business and it's run by excellent people and they've really continued to outshine their existing competitors. Which is one of the reasons it's been such a terrific stock this year and over the last five and 10 years.But the second thing we would say is: The ability to examine the overall disruption and the risk that's going on in the auto industry, by Uber or driven by electric vehicles, is really key to the confidence that we have in O'Reilly. What part of the big-cap/small-cap outperformance cycle are we in? What can we expect next year? I think now -- if you look at historic measures, the outperformance of large-caps over the last few years -- small-cap relative valuations are still somewhat above average but have improved given the outperformance of large-caps over the last few years. I would say your view on the small-caps at this point has to be more of a view of the market as a whole. So if the markets do well over the next year, I suspect small-caps would do well. And if the markets don't do well, I suspect large-caps will outperform small-caps just because of the diversity of large-caps.In general, we're not positioning the portfolio for any type of outperformance, one way or the other. What is your message to investors? One thing I'm always careful to point out is: Certainly the performance of the New Horizons Fund has been very good this year and really excellent over three, five and 10 years, but the fund is really being run for shareholders who have a longer time horizon. We measure the performance of companies over five and 10 years and our average holding period is five years.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photoW ith the U.S. auto industry eyeing its best year of vehicle sales in at least a decade, you'd think Wall Street would cast a wary eye on auto parts dealerships like O'Reilly Automotive.New cars require less maintenance and repair work than older ones, which means less demand for the kinds of products and services offered byO'Reilly (  ) and peers likeAutoZone (  ),Advance Auto Parts (  ) andGenuine Parts (  ).Normally, this would be bad news for the auto parts industry. But this isn't a normal industry cycle. Yes, the U.S. auto industry is on pace for its first full year of 17 million-unit sales since before the Great Recession, and could record its best year of sales since 2000.At the same time, the average age of cars on the nation's roads stands at a record 11.5 years, according to research firm IHS Automotive. An aging fleet of cars means higher demand for replacement parts, maintenance and repair work.Whatever rules used to apply to the auto parts business don't necessarily apply anymore, analysts say.\"Historically, increasing new vehicle sales have been a headwind for the parts industry,\" Sterne Agee CRT analyst Ali-Ahmad Faghri told IBD. \"But sales have been rising for four or five years now, and this group has been one of the best. The kinds of things that benefit new vehicle sales -- an improving economy, improving employment, higher income -- also benefit the auto parts sector.\"Meanwhile, falling gasoline prices have provided another lift. Lower prices at the pump lead to more cars on the road for longer periods of time, which means more demand for repairs and parts.The upshot is that IBD's Retail/Wholesale-Auto Parts group has been on a steady climb this year, reaching a record high on Aug. 19. The broader market sell-off sent the group down a bit, but it's still up 13% since the beginning of 2015.O'Reilly, the highest rated stock in the group with a 98 IBD Composite Rating and the biggest by market cap, has performed better. Its stock price is up about 22% for the year. Shares set a record high of 258.15 on Aug. 19 and currently trade near 235.The company operates 4,465 stores in 43 states. It targets both do-it-yourself (DIY) mechanics as well as professional installers and technicians in the do-it-for-me (DIFM) market, offering everything from alternators and starters to motor oil, antifreeze, floor mats and body paint.O'Reilly's sales growth has been steady if unspectacular, with 10 straight quarters of low double-digit or high single-digit gains.However, profit growth has been much more robust. The company has delivered a yearslong streak of double-digit EPS gains, with most exceeding 20% year-to-year.In contrast, other auto parts retailers -- including Advance Auto, Genuine Parts andLKQ (  ) -- have seen EPS growth dip into single digits in recent quarters.O'Reilly's EPS have benefited from a stock repurchase program that began four years ago and continues today. In May the company approved a resolution to raise the authorization under the program by an additional $500 million, raising the aggregate under the program to $5.5 billion.But the company also has moved to improve its financial performance and gain market share. Much of this effort has centered on growing its DIY business, which it had neglected earlier, Faghri says.He points to initiatives such as extended store hours, increased store staffing levels and the rollout of a customer loyalty program. All are designed to bring more DIY foot traffic into O'Reilly stores.\"They're working to catch up with AutoZone, which has historically been the leader on the DIY side,\" Faghri said.In the past O'Reilly was hesitant to do some of the things that competitors have done, such as chanage windshield wipers or add wiper fluid, Faghri says. \"But as they saw competitors offer more DIY services, they've worked to follow suit, and they're really starting to gain traction right now.\"On a second-quarter conference call with analysts, O'Reilly CEO Greg Henslee said the firm's DIY transaction count growth \"was a strong contributor to our comparable store sales increase\" of 7.2%.At the same time, he said the professional DIFM side of the business \"is growing a little faster than the DIY side. But both sides of the business are growing well.\"The DIFM business sells parts to professional auto technicians and provides repair and maintenance services to customers who don't want to or can't do it themselves.O'Reilly was an early adopter of selling into both the DIFM and more traditional DIY markets, Morningstar analyst Adam Fleck noted in a report. This gave the company an edge over rivals that entered the market later.\"We believe the $59 billion domestic DIFM market presents greater growth opportunities than its $47 billion DIY counterpart, since there is more room for the largest companies to capture share from the industry's numerous subscale competitors,\" Fleck said.Rival parts suppliers are busy trying to grab more share of the DIFM market by investing in their supply chains, Sterne Agee CRT's Faghri says. O'Reilly has responded by upping its own investments.\"They are increasing their parts availability and adding distribution centers,\" he said. \"They certainly are not standing still as competitors add to their supply chains. I'd say that O'Reilly has maintained their share on the DIFM side while gaining share on the DIY side.\"JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers offers a similar view, noting in a report that O'Reilly's \"DIY market share gains have accelerated, and this is adding a new leg to same-store sales growth, which could lead to earnings upside.\"He also said O'Reilly has \"significant balance sheet capacity to buy back stock as well. Finally, if gas prices stay low for a long period of time, this could lead to both sales and valuation upside.\"The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["errellgas Partners, L.P.

Parts chains led byO'Reilly Automotive (  ),AutoZone (  ) andAdvance Auto Parts (  ) offer their do-it-yourself (DIY) and commercial customers elements of value that are difficult for online rivals, including giantAmazon.com (  ), to duplicate: They can provide parts, advice and services in real time and on an as-needed basis.Therein lies their edge over Amazon, says Northcoast Research analyst Nicholas Mitchell.\"The auto-parts retail world is nearly immune from the Amazon effect,\" Mitchell told IBD. \"Auto parts are usually a need-based purchase in response to a failed part or a required maintenance item, which both need to be addressed sooner rather than later.\"That makes consumers less willing to wait for delivery of an online order. And commercial installers need the parts as soon as possible in order to complete repairs and free up the bay, Mitchell said.That bricks-and-mortar edge over Amazon, combined with other factors such as lower gas prices, has helped fuel the stocks in the auto parts group, which in the past eight weeks posted one of the 10 best gains among the 197 industry groups tracked by IBD.\"A lot of investors are looking for places where they can put their money to work and not have to worry about the long-term threat of Amazon,\" said Mitchell.Overall, the group, which as of Friday ranked No. 29 among IBD's industry groups, has been turning out solid and steady financial gains.A number of factors have been contributing to the group's performance. Among them are lower gasoline prices, a trend that has prompted people to drive more and put more wear and tear on their cars, sparking more demand for auto parts.O'Reilly and AutoZone have been on a long-running winning streak with double-digit earnings growth. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect double-digit quarterly profit gains from both AutoZone and O'Reilly through the end of 2017.Advance Auto Parts is still digesting last year's roughly $2 billion acquisition of privately held General Parts International, a distributor that supplies original equipment and aftermarket replacement products to commercial markets under the Carquest and Worldpac brands.The deal made Advance the largest automotive aftermarket parts provider in North America. Analysts expect a 9% rise in earnings for all of 2015 as the company integrates the buy.But analysts see it picking up the pace with double-digit earnings growth in each quarter in 2016 and 2017.What's been driving the group's impressive performance?\"We're seeing some of the best trends we've seen in years,\" Wedbush analyst Seth Basham told IBD.\"One of the most important statistics indicating the industry's health is the number of miles traveled by vehicles on U.S. roads,\" he said. \"We're seeing growth in that metric in the 3% range year to date. That's the best trend we've seen since 2004.\"An improved economy and lower gas prices are driving the trend, Basham adds. The more miles driven, the more likely that parts will break, which leads to more sales for the auto parts retailers, he says.Gasoline prices continue to drop. The 2015 summer driving season ended with the national average gas price at its lowest point for the Labor Day holiday in more than a decade, according to an AAA report out Sept. 8.Motorists paid an average price of $2.40 per gallon at the pump on Labor Day, a savings of $1.04 per gallon in comparison to last year's holiday. The national average price for regular unleaded gasoline has fallen for 22 consecutive days, reaching an average of $2.39 per gallon on Sept. 8, the report said.\"Prices are expected to continue to slide as driving demand experiences a seasonal decrease heading into the fall, provided the price of crude remains relatively low and refineries are able to conduct routine maintenance without issues,\" the report said.The average age of cars continues to rise, also creating higher demand for replacement parts, maintenance and repair work.The combined average age of all light vehicles on the road in the U.S. has risen slightly to 11.5 years, according to the most recent estimates from industry researcher IHS Automotive.IHS forecasts that the average age is likely to hit 11.6 years in 2016 but not reach 11.7 years until 2018.Another positive driver for the group: \"Cars are also becoming increasingly complex, which necessitates broad inventory across all categories,\" said analyst Ben Bienvenu of the financial services firm Stephens.He cites the fact that O'Reilly and Advance have invested heavily in their inventories.The requirement for such investment has created \"big barriers to entry\" into the space, he says.\"It normally requires a lot of cash flow to invest in inventory,\" he said, \"and (the big players) have developed vendor finance programs in their accounts payable to fund their inventory cash flow requirements.\"Bienvenu says that he's \"very positive\" on the space and has buy ratings on O'Reilly and AutoZone, and a hold on Advance.In addition to lower gas prices and a brighter jobs picture, consistently good same-store sales performance and good expense controls supplemented by share repurchases have helped fuel AutoZone's and O'Reilly's stock price, he says.Bienvenu adds that the big story for Advance is its acquisition of General Parts, which made the company larger and stronger. The acquisition also increased Advance's commercial business to about 57% of sales in 2014, compared to 40.4% in 2013, according to a company filing with the SEC.\"The reason that's important is when you look at where the industry's growth is coming from, it's in the do-it-for-me (commercial) business,\" said Bienvenu.Basham says the reason why the do-it-for-me side of the business is growing faster than the do-it-yourself side is because of the \"complexity\" of new cars and the need for a professional garage to handle repair and maintenance.The companies in the auto parts retailer space are \"performing decently,\" he says.\"But the trend is that O'Reilly is executing extremely well and taking share from some of the larger guys and some of the smaller ones,\" he said.O'Reilly \"grew up\" servicing commercial customers, he says. Its business has \"shifted\" over the years, he adds.In 2014, O'Reilly derived about 58% of sales from its DIY customers and about 42% of sales from its professional service provider customers, according to a company filing with the SEC.Its distribution is set up to \"most effectively\" serve commercial customers with features such as next-day delivery on parts.\"At all their stores, they're able to carry a large breadth of product with little depth,\" he said. \"When you have breadth, you can more often say yes to commercial customers,\" he said.\"That's a key competitive advantage. They're staying ahead of the competition's ability to provide that level of service cost-efficiently. That's helping O'Reilly win on the commercial side.\"Basham says that Advance Auto Parts' results showed \"incremental improvement, execution-wise\" in the second quarter relative to the first quarter, when it hit a \"speed bump.\" Only 20% of AutoZone's customers are commercial and the rest is DIY, he adds.He says that because the company is \"geared\" more to the DIY customers, particularly those in the low- and middle-income brackets, it's the one in the space that has seen the biggest benefit from lower gas prices and the improvement in the jobs picture.AutoZone is also investing more to grow its commercial business, he adds.\"AutoZone has a bigger opportunity than its peers to increase its commercial sales, since the per-store volumes are currently much lower than peers',\" he said.Bienvenu says that there is also plenty of room for growth. AutoZone, Advance and O'Reilly, he says, have around 15,000 stores in the U.S., which is only slightly more than 40% of the total. The remaining seven of the top 10 chains have only slightly more than 3,000 stores, he adds.\"There's a lot of opportunity for (AutoZone, O'Reilly and Advance) to continue to grow and take market share,\" he said.J.D. Power & Associates and LMC Automotive project that new vehicle sales will grow 3.6% to 17.1 million units in 2015.Basham adds that the rise in new car sales is not a \"significant concern.\"He adds: \"The rate of new vehicle sales growth is slowing, which is an incremental positive near-term, indicating consumers are not upgrading to new vehicles at an accelerating pace and therefore spending to keep their cars on the road; the average age of vehicles continues to inch higher, despite a strong rebound in new car sales in recent years.\"If there's a concern as it relates to vehicle demographics, it's that there's a growing dearth of vehicles ages six to 10, which historically was considered prime repair time for auto aftermarket retailers.\"However, this has yet to become an issue as the prime repair time has extended, with vehicles lasting longer, meaning drivers are spending greater sums on older vehicles to keep them on the road, offsetting the slowdown in sales of parts for cars ending that six-to-10-year-old age range.\"The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ig 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (  ) will begin trading ex-dividend on August 28, 2015.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  the  (  ),  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ). Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .The economic turbulence in Europe and the dwindling Chinese stock market are compelling investors to look for safe havens, and for consumers to exercise caution. Though concerned with global financial health, analysts hinted that the U.S. economy may withstand the jolt.A gradual recovery in the housing market and the manufacturing sector, along with an improving labor market, are playing key roles in raising buyers' confidence. These indicate that the economy is gaining traction. We expect this positive sentiment to propel consumer spending, which accounts for over two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.As many as 215,000 jobs were created in July and the unemployment rate is hovering around 5.3%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The economy is gaining momentum, as is evident from the July retail sales data released by the Commerce Department. Retail sales inched up 0.6%, as consumer spending on car, home and apparel increased. People also preferred to dine out more often.The U.S. economy is sending out signals of growth that is further validated by second-quarter 2015 real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 2.3% - the advance estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. This fared far better than a 0.6% increase registered in the first quarter. Experts believe that with temporary factors - such as inclement weather and port disruption that hampered economic growth - taking a backseat, the recovery looks convincing, although it may have to endure a stronger dollar for some time.The uptick in GDP numbers reflects contribution from improved consumer spending (+2.9% in Q2 vs. +1.8% in Q1), higher real state and local government spending (+2% vs. -0.8%), increased residential fixed investment (+6.6% vs. +10.1%), and a rise in exports (+5.3% vs. -6%). Imports increased but the rate of growth decelerated to 3.5% in the second quarter of 2015 compared with 7.1% in the first quarter.With an expected rebound in the economy, declining unemployment rate, cheap gasoline prices and improving consumer spending, the retail space is bubbling with optimism.

This time, the company will be recalling 181,000 vehicles from the U.S. and Canada. Of the total, 160,000 vehicles are from the U.S. while the remaining 21,000 will be from Canada. General Motors was compelled to recall the vehicles after U.S. safety regulators sent the company a list of consumer complaints about headlight failures.The recall aims to rectify the problem of overheating and possible melting of the headlight module when exposed to high temperatures. This can also cause the low-beam headlamps and daytime running lights to stop functioning.The vehicles covered under this recall mainly include the 2005 Buick LaCrosse and the 2007 Pontiac Grand Prix in the U.S. along with the 2005 Buick Allure in Canada. General Motors may also have to mend many of the vehicles for the second time as the first repair may not suffice.Notably, 316,357 vehicles were recalled and repaired under the first recall made in Nov 2014. The vehicles covered under the recall mainly include LaCrosse, Chevrolet Trailblazer, GMC Envoy, Buick Rainier, Saab 9-7X and Isuzu Ascender from model years 2006 through 2009.General Motors' dealers, for the time being, will replace the module temporarily and later figure out a permanent solution. Meanwhile, there is no report of any crash or injury related to this problem.General Motors undertakes frequent recalls to address safety issues, which impacts consumer sentiment to a certain extent. The company recently announced a recall of 73,424 Chevrolet Cobalt compact cars in the U.S. and Canada owing to wiring issues which may obstruct the deployment of the roof-mounted driver side airbag after a crash. Of the total number of vehicles recalled, 59,474 were from the U.S. and 13,950 from Canada.

The recalled vehicles were produced at the Escobedo Assembly Plant between Feb 14, 2011 and Apr 28, 2015. 25,941 of the recalled vehicles are in the United States and federalized territories, and 417 vehicles are in Canada.According to Ford, the front passenger and center seat belts of the recalled vehicles may not be anchored correctly. This raises the risk of injury in case of an accident. However, the company has not received any reports of such accidents or injuries.Ford is still in the process of developing the service procedures to be followed to correct the error. The procedure is taking time due to the large number of cab and seat configurations offered on the recalled vehicles.Safety recalls have become a frequent phenomenon for Ford as well as other automakers to ensure the safety of their vehicles. Last month, Ford announced a safety compliance recall due to a problem in the body control module of some Focus, C-MAX and Escape vehicles of model year 2015.

Though concerned with global financial health, analysts hinted that the U.S. economy may withstand the jolt.A gradual recovery in the housing market and the manufacturing sector, along with an improving labor market, are playing key roles in raising buyers' confidence. These indicate that the economy is gaining traction. We expect this positive sentiment to propel consumer spending, which accounts for over two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.As many as 215,000 jobs were created in July and the unemployment rate is hovering around 5.3%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The economy is gaining momentum, as is evident from the July retail sales data released by the Commerce Department. Retail sales inched up 0.6%, as consumer spending on car, home and apparel increased.

Experts believe that with temporary factors - such as inclement weather and port disruption that hampered economic growth - taking a backseat, the recovery looks convincing, although it may have to endure a stronger dollar for some time.The uptick in GDP numbers reflects contribution from improved consumer spending (+2.9% in Q2 vs. +1.8% in Q1), higher real state and local government spending (+2% vs. -0.8%), increased residential fixed investment (+6.6% vs. +10.1%), and a rise in exports (+5.3% vs. -6%).

On Aug 13, 2015, Tesla revealed its plans to offer $500 million worth of shares in an underwritten registered public offering, with a 30-day option to the underwriters to purchase another $75 million worth of shares. The company also revealed that CEO Elon Musk would purchase shares worth $20 million at the public offering price.In a SEC filing made on the same day, Tesla revealed that around 2,100,000 shares will be issued (including 83,974 shares to be purchased by Musk), leading to net proceeds of $492.6 million. The quantity could increase to 2,415,000 shares, or $566.5 million, if the underwriters exercise all their options to purchase additional shares.However, the next day, Tesla made another SEC filing which raised the number of shares to be issued to 2,694,934 (including 82,645 shares to be purchased by Musk), leading to net proceeds of $641.9 million. The quantity could increase to 3,099,173 shares, or $738.3 million, if the underwriters exercise all their options to purchase additional shares.Tesla plans to use the proceeds from the offering to accelerate global growth of its business, including the expansion of its stores, service centers, Supercharger network and the Tesla Energy business; for the development and production of Model 3 and the Gigafactory and for other general corporate purposes.While the news of the stock issue raised Tesla's share price by 2.1% on Aug 13 and 14, the stupendous increase in target price by Morgan Stanley to $465 from $280 led to a 4.9% upside in the price on Aug 17 and another 2.3% on Aug 18.Tesla currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Not only are there a wide range of choices, but the space can be extremely volatile and fraught with risk as well. But thanks to our new  we have been able to identify a few growth stocks which have incredible potential in the near term.One such company that stands out in this regard is undoubtedly  (  ). Not only does this company have a favorable growth score, but it is ranked as a buy too. And while there are numerous reasons why ORLY is so attractive right now, we have highlighted three of the most important-and pertinent to growth investors-below:Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, earnings growth in the double digits is definitely necessary and it is often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) ahead for the company in question.While ORLY has put up a historical EPS growth rate of 24.77%, investors should really focus on the projected growth. Here, ORLY is looking to grow at a rate of 20.77%, thoroughly crushing the industry average which calls for EPS growth of just 18.09%  in comparison.Cash is the lifeblood of any business, but especially so for growth oriented companies. A positive figure here indicates that cash is flowing into the business (obviously a good thing), while a negative reading here means that net cash is exiting the company.Right now, ORLY's current cash flow growth is an impressive 13.90%, a level that is far higher than many of its peers, and the industry average. In fact, the industry average sees cash flow growth of just 10.77% in comparison, suggesting that ORLY is a better pick from a cash flow look.If the metrics outlined above weren't enough investors should also consider the positive trends that we are seeing on the analyst estimate revision front. Analysts have been raising their estimates for O'Reilly Automotive lately, and now the earnings picture is looking a bit more favorable for the company.Over the past 30 days 12 EPS estimates have been revised higher compared to none lower, at least for the current year time frame. And the magnitude of these revisions has also been impressive, as the consensus estimate for the full year has surged from $8.69 per share to $8.86 per share today.For the reasons outlined above, investors shouldn't be surprised to note that O'Reilly Automotive has earned itself a growth score of 'B' as well as a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This means that we believe O'Reilly Automotive stock is a potential outperformer that is an impressive choice for growth investors, making it a security that you need to keep on your radar in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The move came on pretty good volume too with far more shares changing hands than in a normal session. This reverses the recent trend for ORLY as the stock is now up around 7% from Jul 22 to Aug 19.Although this slump was obviously disappointing, the retail auto-parts company has seen 13 positive revisions and its current year earnings consensus has moved higher over the past few weeks. This suggests that the recent slump might be a temporary blip on the radar for ORLY.

The year-over-year rise in sales was driven by benefits from the addition of new stores over the last 12 months and an increase in comparable store sales that inched up 1% in the reported quarter compared with 2.6% growth a year ago.Gross profit improved 2.4% to $1.09 billion, or 45.9% of sales in the quarter, compared with $1.06 billion or 45.2% of sales a year ago.

Free cash flow in the period amounted to $216.3 million against $214.3 million in the same period a year ago. Capital expenditures in the said period amounted to $114.5 million compared with $106.3 million a year ago.Advance Auto Parts envisions adjusted earnings per share in the range of $8.10-$8.30 in fiscal 2015. The company plans to close 50 stores in the second half of fiscal 2015 to meet its comparable operating profit target of 12% in 2016.

The company posted adjusted earnings of 28 cents per share that increased 55.6% from 18 cents recorded in the comparable quarter of 2014. Earnings also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 15 cents.Net income on reported basis stood at $6.5 million or 24 cents per share compared with $5 million or 18 cents in the year-ago quarter.Superior Industries' second-quarter results were affected by lower costs due to the closure of the Rogers, AR manufacturing facility and reallocation of production to other plants like the newest facility in Mexico. Meanwhile, earnings benefited from the cost efficiency at the other manufacturing facilities of the company.Revenues for the quarter decreased 7.6% year over year to $183.9 million and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $186 million. The decline resulted from lower volume, partially offset by higher aluminum prices. Unit shipments decreased to 2.7 million from 3 million units recorded in the prior-year quarter.Gross profit increased 26.6% to $19.9 million (10.8% of sales) from $15.7 million (7.9% of sales) in the prior-year quarter. The increase can be attributed to improved operating costs and savings from the closure of the manufacturing facility and reallocation of production to other cost-efficient plants of the company. However, this was partially offset by lower unit volume.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $8.9 million (4.8% of sales) in the quarter from $7.3 million (3.7% of sales) in the prior-year quarter. The increase was due to higher legal and general consulting fees related to the current year proxy contest and higher employee termination costs.Operating income was $11 million (6% of sales) compared with $8.4 million (4.2% of sales) a year ago.During the second quarter of 2015, Superior Industries completed the repurchase of 285,966 shares for $5.5 million. From Jan 1 through Aug 3, the company bought back 557,643 shares for $10.4 million, under its previously announced repurchase program worth $30 million, announced in Oct 2014.In the reported quarter, Superior Industries announced a quarterly dividend payment of 18 cents per share.For the six months ended Jun 28, 2015, Superior Industries' cash flow from operations was $25.2 million compared with $1.5 million in the first half of 2014. The increase in cash flow was driven by favorable changes in accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable.In 2015, Superior Industries expects net sales in the range of $725-$800 million. Value-added sales, which are the net sales less the value of aluminum that is passed through to customers, will likely be in the range of $325 million to $360 million. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margins are expected to increase by 100-200 basis points over 2014. Adjusted EBITDA margin, as a percentage of value-added, is anticipated to increase 350 to 500 basis points year over year.

In the last quarter, the company had posted a negative earnings surprise of 22.03%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Honda is witnessing declining sales volume in its domestic market, Japan. Sales in the Japanese market went down 17.9% year over year in the first half of 2015. Moreover, higher selling, general and administrative (SG&A) and research and development (R&D) expenses are affecting Honda's operating income. In addition, the company is facing recall-related headwinds.In Jul 2015, Honda reached an agreement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\") and the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") to settle accusations of overcharging interest on car loans from minority buyers. Per the agreement, the company will create a $24 million fund to compensate customers considered entitled by the CFPB and the DOJ. This will weigh on the company's bottom line.However, Honda will benefit from the popularity of its vehicles in America. The automaker is also focused on introducing new products and expanding its business in Asia to attract more customers.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Honda is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below: The Earnings ESP represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Honda's Earnings ESP is 0.00% because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both stand at 65 cents. Honda carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:BorgWarner Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +1.21% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The company will report second-quarter 2015 earnings on Jul 30.Tower International, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +1.00% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company will report second-quarter 2015 earnings on Jul 30.O'Reilly Automotive Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

However, the loss was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.39.The company's second-quarter 2015 adjusted results exclude the impact of non-cash interest expenses related to convertible notes and other borrowings of 14 cents per share, and deferred gross profit of 49 cents for Tesla's Model S cars due to lease accounting. On the other hand, Tesla's second-quarter 2014 adjusted results had excluded the impact of non-cash interest expenses related to convertible notes and other borrowings of 17 cents per share and deferred gross profit of 13 cents for its Model S cars due to lease accounting. Including these items, the company reported net loss of $1.45 per share in the second quarter of 2015, compared with net loss of 44 cents per share in the second quarter of 2014.Adjusted revenues improved a strong 40% to $1.2 billion in the reported quarter and steered past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.16 billion. On a reported basis, revenues increased 24.1% to $955 million.Tesla delivered 11,532 cars in the reported quarter, almost in line with the expectation of 11,507 deliveries. Meanwhile, Tesla manufactured 12,807 vehicles in the quarter, 46% higher year over year and also above the projected production of 12,500 vehicles.Revenues (on a reported basis) from Automotive sales jumped to $878.1 million in the quarter from $727.8 million a year ago. Revenues benefited from improved vehicle deliveries, partially offset by a decrease in vehicle prices. Revenues on an adjusted basis were $1.12 billion in the reported quarter. In the second quarter of 2015, the electric automaker directly leased 631 cars worth $63 million. The company partnered with more banks thus reducing the percentage of vehicles directly leased by Tesla.Revenues (on a reported basis) from the Services and other segment increased 85% to $77 million from $41.5 million in the year-ago quarter.Tesla's second-quarter 2015 adjusted gross margin was 23.4%. Also, the second-quarter automotive gross margin (excluding ZEV credits) was 23.9%. Quarterly gross margin was marred by higher manufacturing and part costs related to the ramp of the small drive unit line and the deferral of revenue recognition. Second-quarter Services and other segment's gross margin were pegged at 2.2%. Gross margin benefited from efficient production and improved margins from services and merchandise sales.Tesla had cash and cash equivalents of $1.15 billion as of Jun 30, 2015, compared with $1.91 billion as of Dec 31, 2014. Long-term debt totaled $2.6 billion as of Jun 30, 2015, versus $2.4 billion as of Dec 31, 2014.Cash outflow from operating activities amounted to $291.3 million in the first half of 2015, compared with cash inflow of $57.1 million in the year-ago period. Capital expenditures increased to $831.2 million from $317.1 million in the first half of 2014.Tesla will launch the Model X in Sep 2015.Tesla is optimistic about growth opportunities in 2015. Production volume for the third quarter of 2015 is expected to cross 12,000 vehicles, highlighting a 60% increase year over year. In the third quarter, the company expects to deliver same number of vehicles as in second quarter. Tesla also expects to directly lease the same number of vehicles as it has leased out in the second quarter. The company also plans to sell about $45 million of its regulatory credits in the third quarter, including about $30 million of ZEV credits.However, revenues in the third quarter will be affected by a decline in average transaction price due to the strengthening of the dollar against other currencies and shifts in delivery mix. The company will focus on reducing the production costs in order to compensate for the low selling price. Thus, automotive gross margin (excluding ZEV credits) is expected to be lower than second quarter owing to low selling prices.On Apr 30, 2015, the automaker launched a $250/kWh industrial Powerpack and a $350/kWh residential Powerwall. Tesla will start high volume production of these products by the third quarter of 2015 at its Fremont factory. With this, Services and other segment revenues will likely increase in the third quarter of 2015 and gross margin from the segment will be in line with the Q2 level. The company will also expand its Energy battery module and pack production at the Gigafactory in the first quarter of 2016.For full-year 2015, Tesla expects to deliver about 50,000-55,000 Model S and Model X globally. The company is continuing with its final testing of Model X. As Model S and Model X are produced in the same assembly line, the challenges faced in producing Model X will hamper Model S' production.In the third quarter, operating expenses are expected to increase 5%-10% sequentially. For 2015, operating expenses are anticipated to rise 45%-50% compared with the 2014 level. The expense hike will likely arise from increased investments in product development, including Model 3 and sales capability expansion. The company expects capital expenditures of $1.5 billion in 2015 for the expansion of production capacity, Model X tooling purchase, the building of the Gigafactory and expansion of stores, service centers and the Supercharger network.Currently, Tesla carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other favorably-ranked automobile stocks include Ford Motor Co.  , O'Reilly Automotive Inc.  and PACCAR Inc.  . All the stocks also carry a Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Earnings also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.55. Meanwhile, net income improved 5.6% to $471 million from $446 million in the second quarter of 2014.

The revenue figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.98 billion. The year-over-year improvement can be attributed to higher demand in on-highway markets and distributor acquisitions in North America, partially offset by currency headwinds mainly because of a strengthening U.S. dollar.Operating income increased 18.1% to $723 million from $612 million a year ago. Earnings before interest and taxes (\"EBIT\") improved to $721 million (14.4% of sales) from $657 million (13.6% of sales) a year ago.Sales in the Engine segment rose 2% to $2.8 billion on increased demand of trucks and buses in North America, partially offset by sluggish demand in the global industrial markets and the truck market in Brazil.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because O'Reilly Automotive is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings-with the most up-to-date information possible-is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ORLY in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $2.27 per share for ORLY, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.26 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ORLY, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 0.44% heading into earnings season.A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that ORLY has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for O'Reilly Automotive, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. BorgWarner currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.BorgWarner's Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP make us reasonably confident of a positive earnings beat on Jul 30.BorgWarner expects to generate about $2.9 billion worth of new powertrain business in the 2014-2016 period. This is anticipated to drive growth of around 26% over the last three-year period in the powertrain business. Net new business-related revenue is estimated to be $850-$950 million in 2015.Moreover, a healthy balance sheet and ample cash flows help BorgWarner return capital to shareholders and undertake acquisitions. These actions have a positive impact on earnings per share.Additionally, BorgWarner is restructuring its Drivetrain segment. This is leading to enhanced profitability. The company expects this restructuring to lead to adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes and non-controlling interest margin improvement of 100 basis points in the segment.However, net sales for 2015 are projected to decline 0%-4% due to the weakening foreign currencies.

Further, the company undertakes the opening of new stores for greater penetration in existing markets and to expand into new, contiguous markets. Store expansion will boost the second-quarter revenues of the company.However, O'Reilly's stores are concentrated in a few locations in the U.S. Therefore, its business is exposed to the economic and weather conditions of these regions. In addition, much of O'Reilly's cash is locked in inventories, which accounted for a significant 83.3% of current assets as of Dec 31, 2014.

The company also has strategic relationships with three of the world's top four engine producers. These relationships allow the company to utilize its collaborators' manufacturing plants, supply chains, back office systems, and distribution and sales networks, thereby aiding significant cost savings.Moreover, Westport Innovations regularly makes investments and acquisitions related to technologies and businesses that complement or help in commercialization of its products. In Dec 2014, it acquired Netherlands-based Prins Autogassystemen Holding B.V., a developer of high-quality alternative fuel systems. This acquisition will expand Westport Innovations' product portfolio, boost sales volume in Europe, Asia and North America, help it enter into new markets such as Turkey and Africa, and provide cost efficiencies.However, Westport Innovations has been incurring losses over the past several years. The company has witnessed a declining revenue trend in the recent past, and revenues are projected to decrease in 2015, thereby leading to expectations of a drop in the second quarter as well.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Westport Innovations is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below: Westport Innovations' Earnings ESP is 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are both pegged at a loss of 26 cents. Westport Innovations carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP.

The owners who bring in the referral are also entitled to receive an incentive of $1,000 in their Tesla account which they can use to purchase a new vehicle or accessories, or for accessing certain services.This additional $2,000, being offered as incentive, is equal to the cost incurred by Tesla to sell a car through a company-owned store. The electric automaker believes that by offering the incentive, it is merely passing the costs as benefits to its customers. If this plan proves successful, it will drive sales for the company.Tesla announced that orders for the new vehicle need to be placed by Oct 31 to avail this offer. The company considers this incentive plan as a guerrilla tactic which will help it counter the auto dealer franchise laws that restrict it from selling its luxury electric vehicles directly to customers.In addition to the incentive, Tesla announced that the first owner who persuades 10 friends to buy the Model S in North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific regions will receive a Model X SUV free of cost. Also, the next person to provide 10 successful referrals will be able to purchase the special version of the Model X called the Founders Series, which will not be accessible to the general public.

One interesting put contract in particular, is the November put at the $220 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $6.70. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 3% return against the $220 commitment, or a 7.6% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to ORLY's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $220 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. sees its shares decline 5.6% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $213.30 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $6.70 from $220), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 7.6% annualized rate of return.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $220 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the November put at the $220 strike for the 7.6% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $233.02) to be 20%.

In the last quarter, this tire manufacturer had posted a positive earnings surprise of 20.00%. Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Our proven model shows that Goodyear is likely to beat earnings estimates this season because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients. :  , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at +1.32%. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. Goodyear currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Goodyear's Zacks Rank #2 and positive ESP, when combined, make us reasonably confident of a positive earnings beat on Jul 29.Goodyear regularly launches innovative products and services to boost sales. In May 2015, the company introduced the Goodyear EfficientGrip SUV tire in Latin America. In Mar 2015, Goodyear unveiled two concept tires. Also, in the first quarter of 2015, the company introduced the new Kelly Edge line of tires as well as the Fuel Max LHS. These product launches are expected to enhance sales volumes for the second quarter.Goodyear expects tire unit volumes to grow 1-2% in 2015.The company anticipates annual segment operating income to increase 10-15% this year. These indicate the possibility of higher tire unit volumes and segment operating income in the second quarter as well.However, Goodyear's revenues have been declining over the years due to unfavorable foreign currency translation, lower sales in other tire-related businesses, a decline in price and product mix, and lower tire volume. This trend of declining revenues is expected to continue in the second quarter. Moreover, the continuing economic and political uncertainty, difficulty in importing raw materials and finished goods, fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, government price and profit margin controls in Venezuela, are expected to adversely impact Goodyear's operating income from Latin America.Here are some companies in the automobile sector you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Gentherm Incorporated  has an Earnings ESP of +3.70% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The company's second-quarter 2015 results are scheduled to release on Jul 29.O'Reilly Automotive Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.89% and a Zacks Rank #2.

This is because summer months (from May end to early September) have been historically weak for the stock markets with sluggish trading volumes.True to the most popular trading proverb \"Sell in May and Go Away\" investors feel the lazy summer lull during these months. Most of the investors believe in this old saying and might want to avoid the seasonal decline in the stocks. Additionally, current economic fundamentals have been signaling a huge volatility and uncertainty in the coming months.This is especially true as a raft of upbeat economic data and an accelerating job market indicate that the world's largest economy is improving after the first-quarter slump. This has raised speculations for the first rate hike since 2006 sometime later in the year. On the other hand, disappointing consumer spending data, weak consumer sentiment in May, and downward revision to the first quarter GDP growth raises questions on the health of the economy.Further, the U.S. dollar - the major culprit of the revenue weakness in Q1 -resumed its rally in recent weeks while oil price might fall in the days ahead on deteriorating demand/supply trends. Moreover, an aging bull market, lofty stock valuations, as well as the Greek debt drama are weighing on investor sentiment (read:  ).In such a backdrop, investors could be well served by looking at the ETFs of the top-performing sectors.While identifying the top-performing sector is a daunting task, the Zacks Industry Rank makes this process simpler. First, we have to find out the best industries that have earned the top Zacks ranks. The Zacks Industry Rank is determined by calculating the average Zacks Rank for all the stocks in the industry and then assigning a rank to it.A top Zacks Industry Rank means that more stocks within that group are seeing upward earnings estimate revisions. Since an industry is a group of stocks in a similar business, this is the perfect way to size up an industry (read: all the  ).The Zacks Industry classification divides the business world into 16 sectors comprising 60 medium or M-level industries and 260 plus or X-level industries. We rank all 260 plus X-level industries based on the earnings outlook of the constituent companies in each industry. Lower scores are always better. The industry having a rank of 2.00-2.64 and 2.65-2.81 indicates that these are very attractive and attractive, respectively, and thus the top-performing ones.We have found a number of ETFs that have the top Zacks ETF Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) in these top-performing sectors and are thus expected to outperform in the months to come. The trio has enjoyed a strong momentum and is leading the broad market fund (  ) by wide margins from a year-to-date look. As such, these could be excellent picks for summertime as well.Computers and technology is the most attractive sector at present with electronics, computer-office equipment, and telecom services leading the way. One interesting way to tap these industries is with IGN, which provides exposure to telecom equipment, data networking and wireless equipment companies (read:  ).The fund tracks the S&P North American Technology-Multimedia Networking Index. Holding 23 securities in its basket, it is highly concentrated on its top 10 holdings with 70% of total assets with the largest allocations going to Palo Alto Networks (  ), Juniper Networks (  ) and Cisco (  ). However, the product has a wide exposure to various market cap levels with 55% in mid caps, 27% in small caps and the rest in large caps.The fund has accumulated $151.7 million in assets while sees light volume of around 42,000 shares a day. It charges 47 bps in fees per year and has added 7.7% in the year-to-date time frame. The product has a Zacks ETF Rank of 1 with a High risk outlook.The health care sector is considered a defensive play as it is unaffected by the economic cycles. While drugs and medical products are expected to perform in line with the market, medical care will be the outperformer in the health care space. As a result, XHS seems to be an interesting pick to play the space.The fund uses equal weight methodology to each security by tracking the S&P Health Care Services Select Industry Index. Holding 56 stocks in its basket, each security accounts for no more than 2.61% of total assets. Humana (  ), Omnicare (  ) and Select Medical (  ) are the top three holdings in the basket (read:  ).From an industry look, health care services, health care facilities, and managed health care collectively make up for 85% share while health care distributors take the remainder. The fund has amassed $177.5 million in its asset base and trades in light volume of around 36,000 shares a day. Expense ratio came in at 0.35%. The ETF has gained about 13.8% so far this year and has a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 with a Medium risk outlook.Consumer discretionary is also expected to outperform with consumer electronics, other consumer discretionary and apparels at the top, followed by media. While there are several options that could provide nice exposure to these industries, PEZ could be an intriguing pick for investors seeking to profit in the dull summer months.This fund provides exposure to 36 consumer stocks having positive relative strength (momentum) characteristics by tracking the DWA Consumer Cyclicals Technical Leaders Index. It is pretty spread out across securities with none holding more than 6.1% of assets. O'Reilly Automotive (  ), Domino's Pizza (  ) and Dillard's (  ) are the top three elements (see:  ).About 30% of the portfolio is dominated by specialty retail while hotel restaurants and leisure, and textiles apparel and luxury goods round off the top three positions with double-digit exposure each. PEZ is often overlooked by investors as depicted by its AUM of $99.5 million and average daily volume of 24,000 shares. The expense ratio came in at 0.60%. The product is up 4.7% so far this year and has a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 with a Medium risk outlook.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download  .

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: (  ), maker of RF chips for smartphones, optical components for servomotors, and enterprise-level networking equipment, has consistently been a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) or #2 Rank (Buy) since I first began buying shares at $70 last July.And the company keeps knocking the cover off of Wall Street's ball. Whether it's an average 19% positive EPS surprise for the past 4 quarters or the latest key acquisition, analysts seem to find themselves continually scrambling to raise sales and earnings estimates for the next quarter.Last week, AVGO shares surged 11.5% after the company reported another strong quarter and their intent to acquire Broadcom, maker of broadband semiconductor solutions, for $37B in cash and stock. Oppenheimer analysts noted that this chip-maker \"megadeal appears transformative for AVGO and the industry, creating the third-largest semi company by revenue.\"That \"third-largest\" quote may be in question now after yesterday's confirmation that Intel will indeed buy Altera for $16.7 billion in cash. But I doubt it since Intel probably held the top spot anyway.The company began as part of Hewlett Packard over 40 years ago, then was spun off as Agilent Technologies. In 2005, KKR and Silver Lake partners took Agilent's semiconductor group private as Avago Technologies, which later had its IPO in August 2009.With such an impressive pedigree, one would think it obvious that the company would be loved by investors and viewed with high expectations. But the fact that shares have more than doubled in the past year means that the \"inefficient\" market missed this gem. : (  ) was already a Zacks #4 Rank (Sell) in late March when it was trading above $65. But the company's disappointing earnings report and below-consensus guidance on May 21 only inspired analysts to lower EPS estimates even further.Consensus EPS projections for the current fiscal year ending March 2016 were brought down 5.6% to $2.18. But next year was hit even bigger as the consensus dropped 8.3% from earnings of $2.77 to $2.54.Investors have to wonder what the analysts see that would cause them to go beyond company guidance and knock down 2016 estimates so much.According to the \"second estimate\" released by the Commerce Department last Friday, the GDP shrank 0.7% in the first quarter. This was only the third contraction in the post-recession period. The GDP number was revised downward from the \"advance estimate\" of a 0.2% rise. However, the contraction of 0.7% came in better than the consensus estimate of a 0.8% decline. Decline in exports, weak inflation and a harsh winter were believed to be the major reasons behind the contraction.Meanwhile, a significant decline in business spending and a slower rate of growth in consumer expenditures also had a negative impact on first quarter GDP. According to the report, business spending declined 2.8% in the quarter, compared to a 4.7% rise in the fourth quarter. Moreover, personal consumption expenditures rose at a sluggish pace of 1.8% in the quarter, significantly lower than 4.4% rise in the previous quarter.Strength in the U.S. dollar had a huge impact on the trade deficit over the first quarter. While a stronger dollar dragged down the export demand in the first quarter, it also boosted import demand as it made foreign goods cheaper. The report showed that exports of goods and services slumped 7.6%, its biggest drop since the first quarter of 2009. The plunge comes after a 4.5% rise in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, imports of goods and services surged 5.6% during the first quarter, revised upward from the \"advance estimate.\"Moreover, the stronger dollar affected first quarter earnings results, especially revenue figures of companies that have significant international exposure. As of May 29, total earnings for 492 S&P 500 members were up 2.2% on 3.4% lower revenues, with 65.4% beating EPS estimates and 44.5% coming ahead of revenue expectations. These numbers indicated that the first quarter earnings season turned out to be very weak compared with previous quarters.It is speculated that the divergent trend of monetary policies between the U.S. and other major economies is one of the major reasons behind the dollar strengthening. While the Fed is preparing for a rate hike this year for the first time since 2006, major economies including Europe and Japan opted for the intensified asset buying program to boost their respective economies.Meanwhile, upbeat labor market conditions, inflation and housing market data pushed the dollar further against major currencies. As a result, the U.S. dollar was almost at a 13-year high against the yen while the Euro fell to a one-month low on the return of Greek debt worries. Though the Fed blamed \"transitory factors\" for the dismal economic conditions in the first quarter, impacts of factors including the stronger dollar are likely to continue for a significantly longer time frame.In this scenario, companies that are generally focused on the domestic economy are less affected by a stronger dollar. Moreover, several data released recently showed that the labor and housing market are improving at an impressive rate. According to the U.S. Labor Department, the unemployment rate declined to its lowest level since May 2008 to 5.4% in April. Separately, most of the housing market data were encouraging, indicating a strong recovery in this section.Improvements in these important sections of the economy will help the domestic demand to increase in coming days. Companies that derive most of their revenues from the U.S. are poised to gain from this favorable environment.Below we highlight three stocks that investors may find profitable. Their domestic operations make them less vulnerable to the strengthening dollar. Each of these stocks have a favorable Zacks Rank. Also, with our new style score system we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to.

Results in the reported quarter were weaker-than-expected due to the impact of integration activities.Revenues went up 2.3% year over year to $3.04 billion, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.06 billion.

This was only the third contraction in the post-recession period. The GDP number was revised downward from the \"advance estimate\" of a 0.2% rise. However, the contraction of 0.7% came in better than the consensus estimate of a 0.8% decline. Decline in exports, weak inflation and a harsh winter were believed to be the major reasons behind the contraction.Meanwhile, a significant decline in business spending and a slower rate of growth in consumer expenditures also had a negative impact on first quarter GDP. According to the report, business spending declined 2.8% in the quarter, compared to a 4.7% rise in the fourth quarter. Moreover, personal consumption expenditures rose at a sluggish pace of 1.8% in the quarter, significantly lower than 4.4% rise in the previous quarter.Strength in the U.S. dollar had a huge impact on the trade deficit over the first quarter. While a stronger dollar dragged down the export demand in the first quarter, it also boosted import demand as it made foreign goods cheaper. The report showed that exports of goods and services slumped 7.6%, its biggest drop since the first quarter of 2009. The plunge comes after a 4.5% rise in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, imports of goods and services surged 5.6% during the first quarter, revised upward from the \"advance estimate.\"Moreover, the stronger dollar affected first quarter earnings results, especially revenue figures of companies that have significant international exposure. As of May 29, total earnings for 492 S&P 500 members were up 2.2% on 3.4% lower revenues, with 65.4% beating EPS estimates and 44.5% coming ahead of revenue expectations. These numbers indicated that the first quarter earnings season turned out to be very weak compared with previous quarters.It is speculated that the divergent trend of monetary policies between the U.S. and other major economies is one of the major reasons behind the dollar strengthening. While the Fed is preparing for a rate hike this year for the first time since 2006, major economies including Europe and Japan opted for the intensified asset buying program to boost their respective economies.Meanwhile, upbeat labor market conditions, inflation and housing market data pushed the dollar further against major currencies. As a result, the U.S. dollar was almost at a 13-year high against the yen while the Euro fell to a one-month low on the return of Greek debt worries. Though the Fed blamed \"transitory factors\" for the dismal economic conditions in the first quarter, impacts of factors including the stronger dollar are likely to continue for a significantly longer time frame.In this scenario, companies that are generally focused on the domestic economy are less affected by a stronger dollar. Moreover, several data released recently showed that the labor and housing market are improving at an impressive rate. According to the U.S. Labor Department, the unemployment rate declined to its lowest level since May 2008 to 5.4% in April. Separately, most of the housing market data were encouraging, indicating a strong recovery in this section.Improvements in these important sections of the economy will help the domestic demand to increase in coming days. Companies that derive most of their revenues from the U.S. are poised to gain from this favorable environment.Below we highlight three stocks that investors may find profitable. Their domestic operations make them less vulnerable to the strengthening dollar. Each of these stocks have a favorable Zacks Rank.

This is in keeping with recent trends, following the Fed's soft stance on rate hikes. A weak jobs report also had a positive impact on investor sentiment as it raised hopes of a delay in an interest rate hike.In this environment, shorting stocks has failed overall as an investment strategy. But as valuations peak and returns hit a plateau, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  has provided three criteria which could be used to pick the right stocks for short selling.The first of Goldman Sach's criteria is relatively better known. Stocks with high valuations are easy picks for short selling. According to the financial major, companies with the highest enterprise value to sales multiples generally underperform industry peers over a year as well as the three-year and five-year periods.Also, Goldman says a number of pricey stocks which are overvalued per certain criteria are lagging the S&P 500 by 5% on average on a yearly basis. This is true for 25 of the last 35 years. Goldman believes that not only is valuation a good rule in general to pick short sells, but the surge in growth stocks presents an opportunity in this regard.For instance, frequently overvalued growth stocks have outperformed the market this year. While the Russell 1000 Value Index is down 0.2% over the period, the Russell 1000 Growth Index has gained 4.7%. Weak economic data has led investors to betting on growth stocks since returns are low overall. The financial major believes that this trend will change once the economy bounces back later this year, hitting growth stocks hard.Betting against stocks which hold low weightage in mutual fund portfolios is another strategy, according to Goldman. The financial major believes mutual funds do a good job of picking such candidates. According to Goldman data collected since 2013, a clutch of stocks held by large-cap mutual funds which hold the lowest weights have underperformed the S&P 500 by 12%. This is radically opposite to the biggest hedge fund short positions whose performances have largely matched market returns in the past few years.The third of the Goldman short-sell criteria is related to company risk. Stocks whose movements are mostly directed by company-specific events and are highly risky propositions are good short sells. These stocks seldom move in line with market and sectoral trends, which offer good opportunities to rake in gains from such trades.Goldman believes 19 stocks represent good short-sell opportunities. The list of those which it believes are overvalued includes O'Reilly Automotive Inc.  Celgene Corp.  and Red Hat, Inc.  . Those which hold low weights on mutual fund portfolios include CenturyLink, Inc.  and Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.  . Similarly those which may not follow market and sectoral trends include Coach, Inc.  and KLA-Tencor Corp.  .Below we present three stocks which we think Goldman got wrong.

In addition, much of O'Reilly's cash is locked in inventories, which accounted for a significant 83.3% of current assets as of Dec 31, 2014. The high proportion of inventory in current assets can affect the short-term liquidity of the company in periods of low sales.Our proven model does not conclusively show that O'Reilly is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below: : The Earnings ESP represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. O'Reilly's Earnings ESP is 0.00% because the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both currently stand at $1.93. : O'Reilly carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Though a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company's ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:General Motors Co.  has an Earnings ESP of +4.17% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company will report its first-quarter 2015 results on Apr 23.American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +7.02% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company's first-quarter financial results are scheduled for release on May 1.Meritor, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +3.03% and a Zacks Rank #3.

It has 26 regional distribution centers.O'Reilly's stock has been enjoying an impressive run. The company's share price shot up 50% in 2014. It's risen 8% so far this year.Why the investor enthusiasm?\"The industry had very favorable weather last year, which helped create a lot of demand,\" said SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Robert Higginbotham. \"Everyone's revenue grew nicely. Just as that tailwind seemed to fade, gas prices fell. So there was a nice handoff from weather to lower gas prices.\"O'Reilly and other auto parts retailers have been \"consolidating\" the industry and taking share from the mom-and-pop players, he adds, which has increased their negotiating power with a very \"fragmented\" vendor base.\"That has driven big gains in margin and working capital efficiency, which has also (helped) the stock performance.\" he said. \"With longer and longer payment terms from their vendors -- having more days to pay -- players like O'Reilly have been able to fund inventory at almost zero cost, which allows them to take even more share from the mom-and-pops. (That) leads to even better negotiating leverage and so on, a dynamic which (I refer) to as the 'auto parts retail virtuous cycle.'\"O'Reilly's stock popped around 8% on Feb. 5, following a strong fourth-quarter report late the day before.Earnings climbed 26% to $1.76 a share, ahead of the consensus view of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 9% to $1.76 billion, also beating forecasts.Same-store sales rose a hefty 6.3% from a year earlier.O'Reilly management did not respond to a phone call requesting a comment for this story.The company announced that it approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under its share repurchase program by an additional $500 million, raising the aggregate authorization to $5 billion. The additional $500 million is effective for a three-year period beginning on Feb. 4.Robert W. Baird & Co. analyst Craig Kennison calls O'Reilly a \"wonderful\" company.\"At the end of the day, commercial repair shops are in the business of fixing cars and the best way to serve them is to have the right part at the right time at the right price when they need it,\" he said. \"It's about parts fulfillment. I think O'Reilly has the right distribution infrastructure to get parts to consumers and repair shops when they need it.\"If you look at the financial metrics, (O'Reilly generates) a tremendous return on capital, it has very strong cash flow and a good (stock) buyback strategy to return capital to shareholders,\" he added.What differentiates O'Reilly from the other auto parts retailers is that it has the \"strongest history and most consistent execution of a mix of retail and commercial businesses,\" adds Higginbotham.He says that auto parts retailers that historically have had a retail focus are \"moving more\" into the commercial business.\"O'Reilly has the most dense distribution of all the players,\" he added. \"It has the most distribution centers per store. That allows them to fulfill orders more efficiently, more often, which is more crucial in the commercial business than the retail business.\"The commercial business, Higginbotham adds, is a \"different ball game\" in terms of having to be able to say yes to as many requests as possible. He says that having the supply of products to meet the requests means investing a lot in inventory and distribution.\"O'Reilly is best at doing that,\" he said.Higginbotham says that several years ago, store growth was the big driver of O'Reilly's strong performance.More recently, it's been a function of the company's \"superiority\" in terms of execution, which has helped it gain a lot of market share, he adds.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect O'Reilly to see a 16% rise in full-year 2015 earnings to $8.55 a share. They expect a 13% gain in 2016 and a 14% increase in 2017 -- lower growth than in years past but still strong.Lower gas prices should be a nice tailwind for the industry, says Higginbotham.\"Lower gas prices are an important driver because if gas is cheaper, people tend to drive more and it puts more wear and tear on their cars,\" he said.They tend to benefit the low-income consumer -- the do-it-yourself customer -- the most, he adds.Lower gas prices can have a \"meaningful\" impact on spending on car repairs, adds Kennison.\"In a tough economy people will defer spending on car repairs,\" he said. \"At some point the deferment catches up.\"Lower gas prices give consumers the resources to fix some deferred maintenance items.\"O'Reilly is part of IBD's Retail-Wholesale-Auto Parts industry group, which also includes Advance Auto Parts, AutoZone,Copart (  ),Pep Boys (  ) and a handful of others. O'Reilly gets the highest IBD Composite Rating of those companies, a 98 out of a possible 99, factoring in metrics such as earnings growth and stock price gains.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["meriGas Partners, L.P.

After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings-with the most up-to-date information possible-is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ORLY in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.71 per share for ORLY, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.67 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ORLY, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 2.40% heading into earnings season.A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that ORLY has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

Banking on these positive developments, we can expect higher revenues and net income for AutoNation in the fourth quarter.However, AutoNation's results are adversely impacted by a shift in mix from premium luxury and domestic vehicles to import vehicles, which have lower average selling prices owing to the increased inventory levels of vehicles manufactured by Japanese manufacturers.Our proven model does not conclusively show that AutoNation is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen.

First, a big acquisition.Advance (  ) in early 2014 completed its $2 billion buy of General Parts International, a distributor and supplier of both aftermarket auto parts and original equipment operating under the Carquest and Worldpac brands. The deal provided Roanoke, Va.-based Advance with greater scale and market share. It proved a key driver of top-line expansion last year, analysts say.Those polled by Thomson Reuters on average expect to see earnings rise 45% to $7.70 per share for 2014 with EPS of $1.48 for the fourth quarter. Revenue is forecast to lift 52% for 2014 to nearly $9.9 billion. For 2015, analysts expect a 13% rise in earnings but only a 2% rise in revenue.After the acquisition and the accompanying jump in revenue, the firm's goal in the year ahead is to trim out costs from areas where it and GPI overlap, bolster efficiency by meshing the operations' products and staffs, and funnel the savings to the bottom line, analysts say.Following the GPI acquisition, Advance's network of stores increased substantially. The company had a little more than 4,000 locations, but after the deal closed in January 2014 it picked up more than 1,200 Carquest locations across the U.S. and Canada. General Parts also serviced some 1,400 independently owned Carquest locations. And Advance also added 105 facilities from Worldpac, which imports and distributes equipment and parts across North America.Advance has benefited from combining with GPI, analysts note. They say over the next several quarters it stands to make gains on cost-savings and synergies that should fuel profits, as the large-scale integration continues to play out.The company, for example, said in mid-2014 that it planned to consolidate 100 Carquest stores that overlap with its legacy stores.Advance spokeswoman Shelly Whitaker said an executive could not comment for this story because the company had entered a customary quiet period ahead of reporting earnings. But the company has previously told analysts that the initial store closure plan marked a first wave of an ongoing assessment that could lead to further savings.After reporting third-quarter financial results, executives said on a call with analysts that the company was on track to produce first-year cost savings between $45 million and $55 million, and within three years, annual savings of roughly $160 million.Advance will ultimately keep the lion's share of Carquest stores, deepening its presence across the U.S. and Canada, and, importantly, strengthening the firm's foothold in the commercial auto parts market, which includes professional mechanics.That segment is ripe for faster long-term growth than the \"do-it-yourself\" segment, analysts say, because cars and trucks are increasingly built with more electronics and sophisticated machinery and therefore more often require mechanics' expertise to be fixed.Prior to the deal, Advance derived about 40% of its sales from the commercial market. General Parts, which had been based in Raleigh, N.C., generated a greater share of its sales from the commercial segment and should over time boost Advance's share from commercial customers to more than 50%, analysts say.In the fourth quarter Advance started efforts to draw on Carquest's strengths and its own to broaden product offerings and brands in its combined network of stores. That process will continue through 2015 and should drive greater future sales, CEO Darren Jackson told analysts on the company's last , in November.Morningstar analyst Liang Feng told IBD that the acquisition of General Parts \"is the big thing\" separating Advance from its competitors. He said that in recent years Advance's same-store sales growth had underperformed competitors such asAutoZone (  ) andO'Reilly Automotive (  ). With the acquisition, Advance gets the added scale, synergies and savings it needs to boost sales and ultimately its profit margins, Feng said, adding \"that's certainly the goal.\"Advance's stock rose 44% in 2014. It's down about 3% this year and trades near $155.Deutsche Bank analyst Mike Baker said in a note to clients this month that he's raised his price target on Advance from $150 to $180 on high ongoing expectations from the acquisition and a favorable impact from low gasoline prices.Prices at the pump have plummeted across the country in recent months as oil supplies have swelled and crude prices have dropped below $50 per barrel. Analysts such as Baker and Feng note that when drivers save money on cheaper fuel, their discretionary spending power increases and many use the extra money to invest in car repairs or upgrades that they had put off.\"When they have that extra money in their pocket, they are more likely to take care of that deferred maintenance,\" Feng said.He adds that when fuel costs are lower, people tend to drive more. And over the long haul, more miles on cars tend to lead to an increased need for repairs.More Americans may also have more discretionary income to spend on parts and repairs this year than in the recent past, observers say, because as the job market improves more people are becoming gainfully employed.The U.S. Labor Department this month said nonfarm payrolls rose at a seasonally adjusted rate of 252,000 in December, while employment gains in October and November got an upward revision. The economy grew at a 5% clip in the third quarter of 2014, according to the government's latest estimate.\"The combination of more jobs and lower gasoline prices can make that decision to invest in car repairs easier,\" Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James, said in an interview.Brown notes that the average age of U.S. autos hovers at a historic high, as many people held onto older vehicles amid the sluggish economy of the past several years. \"And of course the older cars do start to wear down and that creates natural demand\" for parts, he said.Brown notes that new-car sales have blossomed alongside the improving economy. Autodata says U.S. sales of cars and light trucks rose 5.9% in 2014 to over 16.5 million, the best showing since 2006.New cars tend to need fewer repairs, and if the strong new-auto sales continue, that could pose a headwind for the likes of Advance. But Brown said that recent anecdotal information suggests that even as more Americans buy new cars, there is still a great deal of slack among American consumers -- meaning that there is plenty of room for those relying on public transportation to upgrade to used cars, for example, and it could take years to bring down the average age of the U.S. auto fleet even if new-car sales remain strong.Expectations are running high for the Federal Reserve to boost short-term interest rates in the second half of 2015, Brown says, and it could make auto loans more expensive, affecting new-car sales. IHS Automotive predicts that the average age of U.S. autos will stay at a record high of 11.4 years in 2015.\"From a macro perspective, our industry continues to show stability as average age of vehicles continues to hold along with increases in miles driven supported by favorable fuel prices,\" Advance's Jackson said on the last .New cars eventually need repairs, so as long as sales of new vehicles do not dramatically alter the age of the U.S. fleet, they should over time help fuel Advance's sales.\"The uptick in new car sales is also a positive overall,\" Jackson said. \"It should eventually put more cars into the system and result in a net gain for our industry.\"The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) is set to report fourth-quarter 2014 results on Feb 4.

Sales improved 6% year over year in North America and surged 12% year over year in China. Further, sales in India are expected to increase 5-10% for 2014. Thus, we can expect improved sales figures for the fourth quarter of 2014, which should boost revenues and earnings.However, General Motors' results will be adversely impacted by a $0.8 billion charge related to the redemption of 156.1 million Series A Preferred Stock from the UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust (UAW VEBA) and Canada Gen Investment Corporation.

A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. O'Reilly currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.O'Reilly's Zacks Rank #2 and positive ESP make us reasonably confident of a positive earnings beat.O'Reilly pursues an aggressive share repurchase policy, which continues to boost earnings per share. Further, during the first nine months of 2014, O'Reilly opened 145 net new stores, which should help boost sales.The company expects consolidated comparable store sales (comps) to increase 5%-6% year over year for 2014. Thus, we can expect comps to increase in the fourth quarter as well.O'Reilly has a positive trend of surpassing estimates. This is evident from the trailing four-quarter average surprise of +4.21%, greatly aided by the 5.64% surprise in the last-reported quarter, which was possible because O'Reilly did a good job of increasing its store count.

Customers were locked indoors and the stock market fell like the temperatures outside. But just like spring can't be far behind if winter comes, the economy too gradually became cheerful and is now ready to steer the wheel. But what about the global economy that often follows the U.S. markets?Although the U.S. economy looks quite stable, the year 2015 started on a cautious note with investors skeptical about tensions and turmoil overseas. This is because of a beleaguered Russian economy, a stagnating European financial system and the ambiguity in China that raised concerns in the big financial houses.The Russian economy is marred by sliding oil prices, currency devaluation, the Ukrainian crisis and western sanctions, while the European economy crumbled due to its long-time sovereign debt crisis. Coming to China, the economy is stressed by a slump in real estate, heavy debt load across companies and government bodies, industrial overcapacity and high dependence on investment and exports. Quite clearly, the Chinese government's attempts of a facelift by shifting to a consumption driven model are yet to payoff.The International Monetary Fund (\"IMF\") trimmed its global growth forecast to 3.5% for 2015 from 3.8%, while the World Bank lowered its projection for this year to 3% from 3.4%, as the sharp drop in oil prices failed to counter the all-pervasive softness. IMF also revised its forecast for 2016 to 3.7%, 30 basis points lower than what was projected before. Waning investments, sluggish trade and plummeting commodity prices compelled economists to adopt a conservative approach.\n  \nWell, it is the demand of time that policy makers and analysts sit together and chalk out major monetary and structural reforms to revive the dwindling global economy. It is highly anticipated that the European Central Bank will unveil a quantitative easing program today to stimulate growth and tackle deflation, despite German opposition. Such monetary stimulus has already been tried and tested by Bank of Japan, Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve to fight financial turmoil.It is quite apparent that the ongoing earnings season is characterized by a number of events. On the one hand, plunging oil prices and economic growth on the domestic turf raised confidence, but on the other, overseas political and economic woes derailed the same, thus leaving investors perplexed.Here, the Zacks formula of a profitable mix comes into play, helping investors to identify stocks with the potential to be market winners.

General Motors reported record global sales of 9.92 million vehicles in 2014, up 2% from 2013.Toyota had first earned the top position in 2008 and maintained it for the next two years. However, it lost significant market share in 2011 due to product recalls in the U.S. and problems with parts suppliers owing to the earthquake and tsunami in Japan. As a result, General Motors took the lead in 2011, followed by Volkswagen. However, Toyota surpassed General Motors and Volkswagen to become the largest-selling automaker again in 2012. Also, the automaker retained the leading position in 2013 due to strong demand in both the Japanese and international markets.The feat was repeated in 2014 courtesy of a 3% improvement in sales, driven by a 3% increase in sales outside Japan and a 1% rise in Japanese sales. However, Toyota projects sales decline of 1% to 10.15 million units this year.

With a rebounding economy and increased consumer confidence the retail space was charged up but it did not hear the cash registers jingle.Data compiled by the Commerce Department revealed that retail sales dropped 0.9% in December - the biggest decline since Jan 2014 - and missed the forecast of a 0.1% drop by miles. The dismal results followed a 0.4% jump in November that also was revised down from 0.7% growth originally reported. The major contributor to this decline was the sizeable 6.5% decrease in sales at gas stations due to plummeting gasoline prices.A panel of experts believes that weak income gains and the cloud of obscurity gradually engulfing the global economy thanks to the beleaguered Russian economy, a stagnating European financial system and ambiguity in China may have also stopped consumers from spending freely.However, the only ray of hope was the data from National Retail Federation (NRF) that portrays an impressive holiday season since 2011. According to NRF, holiday retail sales for the November-December period increased 4% to $616.1 billion, falling shy of 4.1% projected earlier.It is quite apparent that the ongoing earnings season is characterized by number of events. On the one hand, plunging  and economic growth on domestic turf raised confidence; on the other, overseas political and economic woes derailed the same, thus leaving investors perplexed.Here the Zacks' formula of a profitable mix comes into play, helping investors in identifying stocks that have the potential to be market winners. This increases the chance of getting higher returns even when market conditions are not congenial.A favorable rank indicates positive estimate revisions by analysts optimistic on the future performance of companies. Moreover,  is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement. It shows the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.For investors seeking to apply this strategy to their portfolio, we have highlighted 3 Retail/Wholesale stocks that may stand out this earnings season.

In the last quarter, it had posted a negative earnings surprise of 5.26%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Honda is currently focused on introducing new products and expanding its business in Asia, especially in India and Indonesia, to attract more customers. For fiscal 2015, operating income is likely to rise 2.6% to \u00a5770 billion. These should translate into higher revenues and operating income in the third quarter as well.However, Honda reduced its net income guidance by 5.8% to \u00a5565 billion or \u00a5313.49 per share for fiscal 2015. The company also reduced its revenue guidance to \u00a512.75 trillion from \u00a512.8 trillion projected earlier. Honda, like most automakers, faces the challenge of frequent product recalls over the last few years. It is the largest customer of the Takata, whose faulty airbags have resulted in massive recalls by many automakers. The company has recalled nearly 13.4 million vehicles due to this problem, which will increase its expenses. Honda has also agreed to pay a cumulative fine of $70 million to the U.S. safety regulators for its failure to report hundreds of injuries, deaths and other consumer claims related to its vehicles.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Honda is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below: The Earnings ESP represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Honda's Earnings ESP is 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate both stand at 55 cents. Honda carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions, as is the case with Honda.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:O'Reilly Automotive Inc. (  ) has an Earnings ESP of +2.40% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company will report its fourth-quarter 2014 results on Feb 4.Lear Corp. (  ) has an Earnings ESP of +1.46% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company's fourth-quarter financial results are scheduled for release on Jan 30.AutoNation Inc. (  ) has an Earnings ESP of +1.10% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

They are poised to produce steady financial gains this year as well. This is because the average age of cars is expected to remain at a record high of 11.4 years in 2015, according to IHS Automotive.According to the latest report by the Department of Transportation, U.S. vehicle miles driven increased 2.6% year-over-year in Oct 2014, its eight straight month of gains. The number of miles traveled also went up 0.9% year to date through Oct 2014.Increased traveling and aging vehicles have also resulted in wear and tear. This in turn increased demand for automotive service and maintenance parts. According to Auto Care Association, the U.S. light vehicle auto care market is positioned to accelerate to $254 billion this year, more than $246 billion last year.According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), the price elasticity of motor gasoline is within the range of -0.02 to -0.04 in the short term. This means a 25% to 50% decline in price of gasoline will result in 1% rise in automobile travel.At present, average price for unleaded gas in the U.S is $2.12 per gallon. Hence, from 2014's peak of $3.70 a gallon on Jun 23, the fall in gasoline price is more than 70% to date.Moreover, the EIA estimates gas prices will average $2.60 per gallon in 2015, a drop of 23% when compared to last year. The slump in  resulted in a drop in gasoline prices. Abundant supply of oil dragged oil prices below the psychological level of $50 a barrel.The Gulf of Mexico (GoM) is home to promising U.S. oil facilities around the world. It is also often exposed to hurricanes. However, of late the GoM hasn't seen much hurricane activity. This has resulted in less supply disruption of oil leading to low gasoline prices. Further, U.S. refineries make \"winter-blend\" gasoline between September and October every year. Winter gasoline is the cheapest, and Americans use this until spring.Low gasoline prices also compel consumers to use a repair shop rather than service their vehicles on their own. This results in a shift from Do-It-Yourself segment to Do-It-For-Me segment. Additionally, lower gas prices increase disposable income, freeing up more than $40 billion for deferred vehicle maintenance. These factors put the auto parts industry in an advantageous position.GDP has gradually recovered from the 2.9% contraction in the first quarter of 2014 to 5% growth in the third quarter of 2014. The economy also added 2.9 million jobs in 2014. This turned out to be the strongest year for jobs growth since 1999. These factors contribute toward increasing the purchasing power of the consumer.Currently, Americans are experiencing severe winter weather. Cold weather becomes a boon for the auto parts market as it is hard on vehicles. Severe winter damages car batteries, increases viscosity of motor oil, and freezes transmission oil and brake fluid. Similarly, demand for windshield wipers also goes up.U.S. light vehicle sales touched 16.44 million units in 2014, the highest level since 2006. Further, sales of light vehicles are expected to hit 17 million units this year. In theory, the aftermarket parts industry suffers as its demand falls on a rise in new vehicle sales. However, the industry is not being affected -- people who are buying new cars are keeping old cars or selling them to others.E-commerce is also supposed to adversely affect the aftermarket parts industry. However, most consumers are impatient. Hence, when it comes to fixing their cars they prefer purchasing parts immediately, rather than waiting for online deliveries.

So has demand for replacement parts and repair work. The upshot for the aftermarket parts industry has been a consistent flow of new business.Leading auto parts retailers such asAutoZone (  ),O'Reilly (  ),Genuine Parts (  ) andAdvance Auto Parts (  ) have produced years of top- and bottom-line growth. They continued to do so in 2014, and are expected to keep it up this year.Meanwhile, the stocks -- all part of IBD's Retail/Wholesale-Auto Parts group -- generally have enjoyed a steady rise in value. The group touched a record high on Dec. 31, and on Friday was up 23% from an October low.The industry's new wrinkle is that the stocks have kept climbing even as new-vehicle sales in the U.S. reached their highest point since the middle of last decade.U.S. light vehicle sales hit 16.44 million units in 2014, according to a Jan. 5 report from Sterne Agee. That was the highest total since 2006. Those numbers are expected to keep ticking higher this year.Numerous industry forecasters -- including Kelley Blue Book, TrueCar, LMC Automotive and J.D. Power & Associates -- project that new-vehicle sales will reach about 17 million units in 2015.In theory, a rise in new-car sales should hurt the aftermarket parts industry. In the past, more new cars on the road meant less need for replacement parts and repair work.That's no longer necessarily the case. Morningstar analyst Liang Feng points out that a rise in new-car sales doesn't translate into fewer older cars on the road.\"Investors have been concerned that new vehicle sales will reduce aftermarket parts demand, but what we are seeing is that even people buying new vehicles are keeping older cars as second vehicles or selling them to someone else. So you still see demand,\" Feng told IBD. \"We've also seen an increase in the overall used-car market because vehicles are lasting longer.\"The average age of light vehicles on the road in the U.S. stands at 11.4 years, according to the most recent estimates from industry researcher IHS Automotive. That figure is expected to hold steady this year and then tick up to 11.5 years by 2017 and 11.7 years by 2019.Meanwhile, the auto parts market has gotten another lift from lower prices at the gas pump.\"With gas prices at multiyear lows, we expect vehicle miles traveled to continue to grow, increasing demand for auto parts while providing relief to the low-income consumer,\" Sterne Agee analysts Ali Faghri and Michael Ward noted in a recent report.They cited AAA data showing that the average price for unleaded gas in the U.S. in November was $2.77 a gallon. That was around 15% lower than a year earlier and the lowest price in over four years.Sterne Agee also cited Department of Transportation data showing that U.S. vehicle miles traveled in October increased 2.1% from the previous year. It was the eighth straight month of gains. The number of miles driven was up 0.9% year to date through October, the latest month for which data are available.IBD's Retail/Wholesale Auto Parts group includes nine stocks and, on Friday, ranked No. 45 out of 197 industries tracked by IBD. That ranking is up from No. 117 as recently as 13 weeks ago.O'Reilly rates highest in the group with a Composite Rating of 99 from IBD. Others in the group with Composite Ratings of 90 or higher are Advance Auto Parts, Genuine Parts and Copart.Not all stocks in the group are parts retailers.Copart (  ) conducts salvage vehicle auctions for insurers, charities, dealerships, banks and other organizations.LKQ (LKQ) is an auto recycler, with a national network distributing salvaged auto parts to repair shops.The retailers themselves do more than just sell parts to weekend Do-It-Yourself (DIY) mechanics. They also provide wholesale parts to mechanics and auto shops, and some also provide in-house auto repair and maintenance services -- all of which falls under what the industry calls its Do-It-For-Me (DIFM) segment -- for customers who don't want to do the repair work themselves.Although some investors might view the aftermarket auto parts sector as a defensive play -- one that does best in shaky economies -- the current years-long run of gains and financial success has outlived that notion.\"The trend toward the aftermarket has been going on for a long time,\" Feng said. \"There might be some cyclical factors, but the long-term trend has been favorable.\"The U.S. light-vehicle auto care market is expected to reach $254 billion this year, according to data from the Auto Care Association (ACA), an industry trade group that represents parts manufacturers, distributors and retailers as well as repair shops. That's up 3% from about $246 billion in 2014. The figure is seen climbing to around $273 billion in 2017.\"The thing we see that's most interesting is that, even in the face of high gas prices, the industry has done very well. With gas prices going down, it only stands to benefit,\" said Ron Rossi, the ACA's director of market intelligence.Sterne Agee's Faghri expects retailers with strong commercial programs -- namely, O'Reilly and Genuine Parts -- to outperform the group as a whole when 2014 fourth-quarter results come in.Changes in technology are affecting the aftermarket parts industry in a few different ways. The most prominent has to do with the cars themselves: they work better than they used to, and they are equipped with systems that make them easier to diagnose, maintain and repair.\"No question cars are being built to last longer,\" Rossi said. \"Technology is playing a part both in terms of what's in the car to keep it on the road longer and also in terms of diagnostics available both on-board and in the shops.\"E-commerce is having an effect as well. As more consumers look to save money by purchasing auto parts online -- either direct from manufacturers or through third-party distributors -- retail shops will likely see a drop in business.Though that poses a threat to the auto parts business, just as it has for other retail businesses, Morningstar's Feng warns against overstating the threat.\"The main concern with e-commerce is, if you want to buy the part cheaply you can get it for a much lower price online,\" he said. \"At the same time, it takes longer to get the part when you order it online, and most consumers are impatient when it comes to getting their cars fixed. Most would rather go the shop and purchase the part immediately than wait for it to come in the mail.\"Lower gas prices should have the most immediate impact on the aftermarket auto parts industry, watchers say.\"Gas prices are down significantly, and that will encourage people to use their vehicles more, so we assume miles will increase and lead to more wear and tear and business volume for our industry,\" the ACA's Rossi told IBD. \"Things look very positive for our industry going forward.\"In addition to boosting the number of miles people drive, lower gas prices \"also have a positive effect on discretionary spending, especially for the low income consumer,\" Sterne Agee's Faghri and Ward noted.\"The extra disposable income could help unleash the over $40 billion\" in spending on deferred vehicle maintenance, they said. This in turn \"could provide even more growth\" to the aftermarket auto parts industry.In a separate report, the two analysts said lower gas prices \"will also help expedite the shift towards the larger and fast-growing Do-It-For-Me segment and away from Do-It-Yourself, as consumers are more likely to use a repair shop rather than service their vehicles on their own.\"The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["he board of  (  ) has authorized a new share repurchase program for $1.5 billion.

Prior to that, the electric carmaker may attain profits after excluding special items. However, the CEO asserted that the losses incurred are due to the significant investments made toward developing new vehicles and technologies, and the establishment of a retail network. Barring these, the company could be in the black even today.The Model 3 is slated to be launched in 2017. It will help Tesla in achieving annual sales of 500,000 units by 2020. Thereafter, the company hopes to double its production every year for a few years to attain annual sales of several million vehicles by 2025.Tesla also plans to start manufacturing vehicles closer to its key markets. The CEO is considering establishing three new production plants in Asia, Europe and the eastern U.S. However, these plants will likely be built after the Fremont plant attains full production capacity.Musk also revealed that Tesla's sales in China were below expectations in the fourth quarter of 2014 as people were worried about the charging method for electric cars. However, the CEO plans to clear the misconception and hopes that sales will improve thereafter. This is important for the company's success because apart from being the world's largest automobile market, China also offers significant opportunities for electric cars due to its pollution issues.The CEO anticipates that Tesla will be the first company to sell a fully self-driven car. He expects the car to be ready in 5 years, although obtaining regulatory approval might take an additional 2-3 years.Musk also expressed his praise for General Motors Company's (  ) CEO Mary Barra for encouraging the development of the Chevrolet Bolt electric car. However, he stated that the car should not pose significant competitive threat to Tesla in view of the total number of cars and trucks manufactured in the industry every year.Further, Musk revealed that he might step down as Tesla's CEO after the launch of the Model 3.

Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is  (  ), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in PBY.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen 1 estimate moving down in the past 30 days, compared to no upward revision. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from 17 cents a share a month ago to its current level of 7 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Pep Boys has seen 1 downward estimate revision versus no revision in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 3 cents a share from 6 cents over the past 30 days.The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 14.4% in the past month.So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don't have a long time horizon to wait.If you are still interested in the Retail/Wholesale-Auto Parts industry, you may instead consider O'Reilly Automotive Inc. (  ). Further, moving on to the broader Construction sector, America's Car-Mart Inc. (  ) and Rush Enterprises, Inc. (  ) are some of the better-ranked stocks. While America's Car-Mart holds a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), O'Reilly Automotive and Rush Enterprises carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

For 2014, the company reduced its organic sales growth guidance to 11.5% from the previous projection of 12%-13%.

Fourth-quarter adjusted earnings declined over 14% year over year to 48 cents per share owing to lower gross margins from reduced selling prices due to weak demand and a continued unfavorable shift in sales mix to lower margin direct shipment and commercial business. Earnings also fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 61 cents.The company's reported earnings came in at 48 cents per share, decreasing 12.7% from 55 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.The distributor of residential and non-residential roofing materials posted record fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 sales, driven by the success of 26 new greenfields opened in the current year.Total revenue increased 6.3% year over year to a record $726.5 million and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $732 million. Complementary product sales increased 14.5% followed by a 5.1% rise in residential roofing products while Non-residential roofing product sales went up 4.9%.Geographically, Beacon Roofing witnessed organic growth in five out of the seven reported regions in the quarter. The Midwest and Northeast led the way with double-digit gains fueled by storm and greenfield volume from the 2013 and 2014 openings. The company also viewed solid growth in the West, Canada and mid-Atlantic regions, whereas the Southeast and Southwest regions, both down double digits in the quarter, continued to struggle with volume as a lack of normal storm volume, lower residential reroof and new construction work has impacted overall demand and pricing.Cost of goods sold went up 7% year over year to $563 million. Gross profit was $163 million, compared with $157.7 million in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin contracted 60 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter to 22.5% primarily due to decline in total pricing, mainly seen across the residential roofing products and commercial roofing products.Operating expenses for the quarter increased 9% year over year to $120 million. The company posted an operating profit of $43.2 million, down 9% from $47.6 million in the prior-year quarter.Beacon Roofing shares have declined over 29% in the last 12 months because of company's poor performance in fiscal 2014. Soft demand in the residential market, tough weather conditions and pricing pressure led to the slump.Beacon Roofing posted adjusted earnings of $1.08 per share for fiscal 2014, which slumped 25.5% from $1.45 a share in fiscal 2013 due to softer overall demand following the adverse and extended weather conditions during the first half of 2014 along with incremental operating expenses. Earnings, however, came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.21. Including special items, earnings were $1.08 per share for the year compared with $1.47 in fiscal 2013.However, revenues for the full year increased 3.8% year over year to a record $2.33 billion from $2.24 billion in fiscal 2013.

Further Beacon Roofing's continuous investment in the business through opening of the new greenfield branches will drive sales growth.Solid progress on elements of strategic plan driven by new acquisitions, greenfield branch openings and organic growth in all lines of business will remain tailwinds for Beacon Roofing. The company went above its internal goal of 20 to 25 branches by opening 26 branches in fiscal 2014. However, the company continues to experience pressure on gross margins due to a soft residential market coupled with heightened competition.Peabody, MA-based Beacon Roofing is one of the major distributors of residential and non-residential roofing materials as well as complementary building products in the U.S. and Canada, with more than 90% of sales coming from the U.S.Beacon Roofing currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

Both of them are continually finding new ways to appeal to customers while finding new locations to set up shop, and shareholders have been awarded with record-high stock prices.O'Reilly Automotive and AutoZone both have market caps around $18 billion, but one looks a bit more attractive than the other.For the quarter ended Aug. 30, AutoZone reported a 4.5% increase in calendar-adjusted sales to $3.0 billion. Same-store sales rose 1.5%. Net income jumped 7.4% to $374 million, while diluted earnings per share jumped 16% to $11.28 partly due to the effect of stock buybacks.For O'Reilly Automotive, percentage growth in the most recent quarter was more pronounced. Sales leaped 9% to $1.88 billion. Same-store sales rose 6.2%. Net income climbed 16% to $217 million while diluted earnings per share shot up 22% to $2.06, again partly from the effect of buybacks.AutoZone is the bigger company, with 5,391 stores, while O'Reilly ended the quarter with 4,311 stores. It's not a monster difference, which means AutoZone is doing much better in sales and net income on a per-unit basis, while O'Reilly's faster growth suggests it may be gaining a bit of market share at AutoZone's expense.CEO Bill Rhodes of AutoZone explained the results in the company press release were due to providing \"exceptional customer service and trustworthy advice.\"Source: O'Reilly Automotive.Similarly, CEO Greg Henslee of O'Reilly stated in his company's press release an \"unwavering commitment to providing excellent customer service This type of focus from management and message delivered may help set each chain apart from smaller chains and mom and pops but not necessarily as much from each other.Both companies are growing in the neighborhood of 200 new locations per year and in the most recent quarter AutoZone notched roughly 27% more in per-unit sales than O'Reilly. This means O'Reilly's game of catch-up is more focused on same-store sales gains, but it would seem it still has a way to go just to be on par with AutoZone. Both companies sport gross profit margins close to 50%, so the race is really all about sales.One thing that differentiates the two companies is where they are expanding. Both are expanding in the United States, but only AutoZone is expanding internationally as well. For example, in the recent quarter it opened its 400th location in Mexico, where O'Reilly doesn't have a presence and no current opportunity to take market share there. Autozone also has five stores in Brazil.During the recent conference call and without offering details, AutoZone execs remarked that its Mexico stores \"continue to perform well\" with returns and profit growth in line with company expectations. The company expects ample unit growth opportunities internationally as well as domestically..All in all, AutoZone trades with a lower P/E than O'Reilly yet what appears to be the same or better growth prospects. They're both growing units at around the same number annually, but the market is therefore pricing O'Reilly to grow significantly big enough to match AutoZone on per-unit sales. Both are great companies, but I lean more toward AutoZone as the better buy since they both have similar market caps yet AutoZone has less speculation built in or needed in its stock price.

Then the economy started to rebound and the Federal Reserve hinted at a recovery by winding up its stimulus program which was initiated to boost economic growth and keep interest rates low.The economy now looks to have enough steam to carry the momentum, in spite of a slowdown in China, turmoil in Russia, sluggishness in Japan and a struggling Europe. The confidence in an uphill ride amid a shaky international front came mostly from the third and final data for real gross domestic product (GDP) that unveiled the fastest rate of economic growth since the third quarter of 2003, giving the market sufficient impetus.The economy registered growth of 5% during the third quarter of 2014, according to the \"advance estimate\" by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The rate fared better than the second and first projections of 3.9% and 3.5% increases, respectively. Higher business investment and export along with improved consumer spending laid the foundation for a strong GDP.Gradual recovery in the housing market, a strengthening manufacturing sector, an improving labor market and falling gasoline prices also favored the economy, and boosted consumers' disposable income. Consequently, the economy returned to the growth trajectory in the second quarter, when it increased 4.6%, after falling 2.1% in the first quarter due to inclement weather. Market experts believe that improvement in global economy hinges upon the U.S., which is expected to grow at a pace of over 3% in 2015.Low  and rising wages are good for U.S. consumers. And with consumer confidence - a key determinant of financial health - reaching its recent heights, the future looks bright for the economy. The data released by the University of Michigan and Thomson Reuters showed that the consumer sentiment index buoyed up to 93.6 in December from the November reading of 88.8, and was at its highest since Jan 2007. According to the recent Conference Board data, the Consumer Confidence Index increased to 92.6 in December from 91.0 in November.321,000 jobs were created in November, and the unemployment rate is lingering around 5.8%, its lowest level in six years, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The impressive jobs report confirms that the U.S. economy's fundamentals are strong enough to sustain the momentum. And we expect this positive sentiment to encourage consumer spending, which accounts for over two-thirds of the U.S. economic activity. The Commerce Department revealed that consumer spending increased 3.2% in the third quarter from the initial estimate of 2.2%.With bullishness widespread, the Federal Reserve is now contemplating raising interest rates. Analysts, however, still believe that the Fed will not be in any rush to increase the near-zero rates for fear of hitting the brakes on the pace of economic recovery. Industry analysts see the encouraging economic data finding reflection in interest rates sometime in mid-2015 but keep their fingers crossed over the market reaction to the move. Last year, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 8.4% and the S&P 500 advanced 12.4%.With the economy in high gear, we could witness more upbeat numbers in the quarter to be reported.

Though the roofing material distributor has successfully expanded its business through strategic acquisitions and diversification of its product offering, its performance might be affected by softer residential demand, difficult pricing environment and volatile exchange rates.Notably, Beacon Roofing's third-quarter of 2014 earnings were impacted by lower gross margins from reduced selling prices due to weak demand and a continued unfavorable shift in sales mix to lower margin direct shipment and commercial business. This trend is expected to continue through the rest of 2014.The residential market will remain difficult amid soft volumes and price deflation, consequently affecting Beacon Roofing's performance. Hence, the company lowered its 2014 revenue growth guidance to 4-5% from 5-8%.Nonetheless, Beacon Roofing's acquisition of Wholesale Roofing Supply (WRS), Applicators Sales & Service (Applicators) and All Weather Products Ltd. (AWP) will aid growth. However, higher construction costs, labor shortage, lack of funds for real estate projects and adverse effects of sequestration will affect the non-residential construction sector and in turn hurt the company's performance.Further, Beacon Roofing belongs to a highly competitive industry. The maintenance, repair, & operations (MRO) supply market is highly fragmented with many smaller local players competing directly on price. Moreover, general market softness, volatile exchange rates and uncertainty regarding weather conditions remain matters of concern.Furthermore, the estimates for Beacon Roofing moved downward in the past 90 days.

This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock reported a positive surprise of 1.07% in the last quarter.Advance Auto Parts reported a 27.7% rise in adjusted comparable earnings to $1.89 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2014 (ended Oct 4, 2014) from $1.48 in the prior-year quarter. The figure also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.87.Advance Auto Parts enhances profits through its relentless focus on store expansion. During the 40-week period ended Oct 4, 2014, Advance Auto Parts opened 101 stores and closed 14. As of Oct 4, 2014, the company's total store count stood at 5,414, including 109 Worldpac branches. The increase in store count ensures higher availability of parts to customers, thereby leading to higher sales volume.The company expects earnings to increase to $7.50-$7.60 per share in fiscal 2014 from $5.67 per share in fiscal 2013. Based on the sales performance in the first nine months of 2014, full-year comparable store sales are expected to be in the low-single digits. The company also intends to collectively open 120 to 140 Advance Auto Parts stores, Autopart International stores and Worldpac branches by 2014-end.Advance Auto Parts is also poised to benefit as the industry continues to show stability with the increasing average age of vehicles, along with the increase in miles driven, supported by favorable fuel prices. The average age of cars on U.S. roads is rising and this is expected to lead to an increase in the demand for auto parts.However, we are concerned about price competition as Advance Auto Parts competes with national and regional automotive retailers such as AutoZone, Inc.

(  ). This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock reported a negative 3.8% surprise in the last quarter.Standard Motor reported an 8.6% rise in adjusted earnings per share to 76 cents in the second quarter of 2014. However, earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 79 cents. Meanwhile, profits went up 8.4% to $17.7 million from $16.4 million in the year-ago quarter.Standard Motor enjoys competitive advantage owing to its brand recognition and sizeable customer base. Well recognized brand names help in expanding the consumer base further.Standard Motor is also poised to benefit from the expansion of its business through acquisitions. In Apr 2014, the company acquired certain assets and liabilities of Annex Manufacturing, a distributor of a wide range of temperature control products for $11.5 million. The company expects the acquisition to boost future earnings, excluding the one-time transition costs.Further, Standard Motor announced a 50/50 joint venture with Gwo Yng Enterprises - a China-based manufacturer of air conditioning accumulators, filter driers, hose assemblies and switches. The company will leverage the Gwo Yng collaboration to penetrate into the rapidly growing Chinese Temp Control market.However, Standard Motor is facing the brunt of the competitive automotive aftermarket. The company has to compete on the basis of price, product quality and customer service. The price competition prevailing in the market mars the profit margin of the company substantially.In addition, a large portion of Standard Motor's sales are derived from major customers like NAPA Auto Parts, O'Reilly Automotive Inc. (  ) and Advance Auto Parts Inc. (  ). Thus, the loss of any key customer could significantly affect the company's results. Moreover, rising demand for fuel-efficient vehicles or electric vehicles can affect aftermarket sales and thereby the long-term performance of Standard Motor.Investors interested in automobile stocks can also consider Genuine Parts Company (  ), which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Deemed to be the Norway of Asia by the company, China offers substantial growth opportunities.Tesla currently employs 50 people and expects to double the strength by the end of the year. The company has also hired a country director for China. Moreover, the Chinese government's support for electric vehicle production for sustainable transportation encourages the company.Being a small territory spanning across 10 miles, customers in Hong Kong are expected to charge their vehicles only once a week, which is an added advantage apart from the environment angle.Notably, Tesla started operating in China this year and is undertaking different measures to expand its dealerships and charging stations in the country. It also expects that China sales will be on par with that of the U.S. by 2015.

However, earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 67 cents.Net sales and operating revenues in the quarter rose 10.9% year over year to $3.60 billion, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.55 billion. The year-over-year improvement was mainly driven by increased used vehicle, new vehicle and wholesale vehicle sales.Used vehicle revenues appreciated 10.6% to $2.9 billion in the quarter, driven by higher unit sales. Unit sales of used vehicles increased 6.3% to 143,325 vehicles and their average selling price increased 4.1% to $20,215. Comparable-store used vehicle unit sales rose 0.2% in the quarter. The improvement can be attributed to improved footfall in stores. However, one less Saturday in the quarter in comparison to the last-year quarter has adversely affected comparable-store used unit sales by approximately 1%.New vehicle revenues improved 16.6% to $69.9 million on higher unit sales. Unit sales of new vehicles increased 18% to 2,581 vehicles, while average selling price decreased 1.2% to $26,991.Wholesale vehicle revenues rose 11.7% to $530.3 million. Unit sales increased 7.4% to 97,989 vehicles. Average selling price of wholesale vehicles climbed 4.1% year over year to $5,249.Other sales and revenues rose 10.8% to $78.8 million on improved net third-party finance fees, driven by a reduction in the percentage of sales financed by third-party sub prime providers. The increase was, however, partially offset by decline in extended protection plan (EPP) revenues including extended service plan (ESP) and guaranteed asset protection revenues. The deterioration of EPP revenues was led by higher cancellation reserves rates and a decline in the EPP penetration rate, partially offset by an expanded store base.Gross profit increased 6.6% to $463.3 million or 12.9% of sales from $434.7 million or 13.4% of sales in the year-ago quarter.CAF reported a 9.7% increase in income to $92.6 million from $84.4 million in the year-earlier quarter. The improvement was primarily driven by an increase in average managed receivables, partly marred by a lower total interest margin rate.During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, CarMax opened four stores. Three stores were opened in new markets - Madison, WI, Lynchburg, VA and Portland, OR, while the fourth store was inaugurated in the existing market of Dallas, TX. The company intends to open 13 used car superstores in fiscal 2015 and 10-15 superstores in each of the next two fiscal years.During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, CarMax spent $201 million to repurchase 4 million shares under its existing share repurchase program. As of Aug 31, 2014, the company had $907 million of authorization remaining under its repurchase program.CarMax had cash and cash equivalents of $354.6 million as of Aug 31, 2014, down from $750.0 million as of Aug 31, 2013. Total debt (including financing and capital lease obligations, and non-recourse notes payable) rose to $8.2 billion as of Aug 31, 2014 from $7.1 billion as of Aug 31, 2013.In the first six months of fiscal 2015, CarMax had a cash outflow of $436.6 million from operations compared with $263.6 million in the prior-year period. Meanwhile, capital expenditures increased to $135.3 million from $136.0 million in the first six months of fiscal 2014.

In the last quarter, the company had posted an earnings surprise of +3.2%. Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.O'Reilly aggressively pursues the opening of new stores for greater penetration in existing markets and expansion into new, contiguous markets. During the first half of 2014, O'Reilly opened 91 net new stores in 28 states. The company plans to open a total of 200 stores in 2014. This helps in increasing the sales volume.Further, O'Reilly pursues an aggressive share repurchase policy, which continues to boost earnings per share. In Aug 2014, the company approved a $500 million increase in its share repurchase program. The increase in share repurchase authorization reflects O'Reilly's strong liquidity position. This is the second increase in share repurchase authorization this year.However, much of O'Reilly's cash is locked in inventories, which accounted for a significant 77.6% of current assets as of Jun 30, 2014.For full-year 2014, the company raised the earnings per share guidance to $7.00-$7.10 from the previous estimate of $6.82-$6.92. O'Reilly expects consolidated comparable store sales to increase 3.5%-5.5%, up from the previous estimate of 3%-5%.Our proven model does not conclusively show that O'Reilly is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. The Most Accurate estimate stands at $1.95 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $1.96. Hence, there is a difference of -0.51%. O'Reilly's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements:American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings Inc.

While the analyst believes that Tesla's shares are worth more than its current price in the long run, he is concerned that the reasons for the rapid rise in the share price may not be appropriate.The analyst mentioned four factors related to Tesla that investors should mull over. The first factor is that electric cars in general have not been successful. Moreover, Tesla's sales growth in China depends on the development of sales and service infrastructure in the nation. Even if it becomes successful in China, the company might not be able to meet the demand for Model S and Model X cars from the nation for several quarters or even years.Further, the analyst does not consider Tesla to be a mass manufacturer at present and believes that investors are overestimating the company's production capacity. Lastly, he believes that in 15 years, cars will be fully automated and \"crowd sourced mobility and mega fleets\" will be popular. People may even stop buying cars by then. It is difficult to predict Tesla's future market position in such a scenario.However, despite these concerns, the analyst has conferred an overweight rating on Tesla and considers it to be \"the world's most important car company\". However, he does not expect a consistent upward movement in the stock price going forward.The analyst's concerns related to the rapid rise in Tesla's price mirror CEO Elon Musk's recent statement of the share price being too high.

According to the charges, the company infringed the sales-license waiver issued by the state of Georgia. As per the waiver, the company had to abide by a direct sales limit of 150 electric vehicles per year. However, Tesla sold 5,200 Model S sedans in the U.S. this year, with 173 vehicles sold in Georgia alone, in the October to June period.Thus, the association, which represents approximately 500 car dealers in Georgia, has appealed to the authority to reject Tesla's initiatives to renew or reapply for a dealer or manufacturer license.Tesla has defended its stance by pointing out that the sales restriction is applicable on a calendar year basis.

According to the court, they did not have the legal standing to file the case.The lawsuit was seeking to ban Tesla from directly selling vehicles to consumers in the state. The association claimed that the automaker was operating a showroom in the state without the requisite license and was also violating a law that bans auto manufacturers from operating dealerships in the state.However, the court contended that the law covers only those auto manufacturers and distributors who have an affiliated dealer or dealers in the state. It is meant to protect the dealers from unfair trade practices of such manufacturers and distributors.Since Tesla does not have such an affiliation with any dealer in Massachusetts, it is not subject to this law. Moreover, the company has obtained a license to operate a sales office in Natick, MA.Tesla is facing opposition to its direct-selling model in some other U.S. states as well, including New Jersey and Texas. In June, the New Jersey Assembly voted in favor of a bill that allows direct selling by zero-emission vehicle manufacturers, provided they run a service center in the state. However, the bill needs to be approved by the New Jersey Senate before it becomes a law.Ohio has passed a bill to allow Tesla to directly sell cars, although it has restricted the maximum number of stores to three. Even in New York, the company is not allowed to open new stores, although the five existing stores have been permitted to sell cars. Tesla will have to use the dealership model for new stores in the state.Tesla believes that direct selling reduces car prices and encourages buyers to opt for electric vehicles.

This is same as the warranty on the battery pack. Moreover, the electric carmaker has not put any restriction on the number of owners the car can belong to during the warranty period. Further, the warranty extension is being implemented on a retrospective basis to all Model S sedans.Earlier, Tesla provided a warranty for four years or 50,000 miles on the car. In comparison, most gasoline cars offer a standard three-year/36,000-mile warranty.The extension of the warranty reflects Tesla's belief that electric motors are more reliable than gasoline engines due to the lower number of moving parts and absence of oily residue or combustion byproducts. The electric carmaker believes that it should have provided this warranty from the beginning itself.Tesla also acknowledges that the move will have an adverse effect on its earnings in the short term due to the increase in warranty reserves. However, it believes that the move will have long-term beneficial effects.The extended warranties will ease consumers' concerns following recent revelations by Consumer Reports and Edmunds.com that Model S cars have been found to develop certain snags during long-term usage. Moreover, it will likely boost resale values of Model S, per some analysts.Currently, Tesla sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Other auto stocks worth considering include CarMax Inc.

This took almost a year since the opening of the first European Supercharger in Norway in Aug 2013.However, Tesla is rapidly expanding its Supercharger network in the continent. Since last week, it has opened 4 more Superchargers in Europe, taking the total count to 54.Tesla is focusing on developing a Supercharger network in its main European markets like the U.K., Scandinavia, the DACH region, Benelux and France. The electric carmaker has connected most major cities and highways in Europe, from Scandinavia to the French Riviera, including popular routes such as Oslo-Stockholm-Copenhagen, Hamburg to Geneva and Berlin to Frankfurt.These Superchargers provided over 600MWh of energy to Model S sedans in Europe in July, thus helping save 380,000 liters of petrol. This also helped in preventing carbon dioxide emissions of almost 1,100 tons in the month.Tesla's Superchargers not only provide free charging to Model S owners, but also charge faster than normal electric charging stations. They can restore half the battery charge in just 20 minutes and full charge in about 75 minutes, in comparison to normal charging stations that take as much as 9 hours for a full charge.At present, Tesla is expanding the Supercharger network with admirable speed.

According to the deal, the two companies will jointly set up 400 charging stations at China Unicom stores in 120 Chinese cities. Additionally, they will build Supercharging stations in 20 cities.China Unicom will provide the space for the stations, while Tesla will provide the charging equipment. However, the charging stations will only provide charging facility to Tesla's vehicles. Moreover, the service will be provided free of cost.Tesla has been focusing on gaining a share in the lucrative Chinese market. The company started delivering vehicles in the nation from Apr 2014. Moreover, it has plans to unveil 10 to 12 stores in China by the end of 2014, out of which its flagship store in Beijing was opened in Nov 2013. The electric carmaker also hopes to establish a Supercharger network in the nation.Tesla also has deals with Chinese property developers Soho China Ltd and China Yintai Holdings Ltd to build charging stations in the nation. However, the deal with China Unicom is the automaker's largest investment in charging stations in the nation.Apart from being the world's largest automobile market, China also offers attractive growth opportunity for Tesla as the Chinese government is trying to increase the popularity of electric cars in the nation to reduce the pollution level of its cities as well as increase its energy independence. The country already offers significant subsidies on purchase of electric cars and has limited the number of gasoline vehicles that can be sold in certain cities, in order to check pollution.Recently, the government also made it mandatory for 30% of government vehicle purchases to be electric vehicles (EV). Further, China announced a waiver of 10% purchase tax on domestic and imported electric, plug-in hybrid and fuel-cell vehicles in the nation from Sep 2014 to Dec 2017.The Chinese government aims to have 5 million green vehicles on the road by 2020. However, shortage of charging stations is one of the biggest hurdles in increasing the popularity of electric cars.

The news doing the rounds was a result of Consumer Reports' revelation that Model S cars have been found to develop some snags during long-term usage.Some of the flaws discovered include blanking out of the center touch screen (which performs several key functions), noise from the roof and problem with the front trunk lid release. Most of these problems were found to emerge after the car was driven more than 10,000 miles. Additionally, the car's outside door handles, which automatically extend when the driver approaches or touches them, failed to work on occasions. Tesla fixed this problem through a software update.Edmunds.com, a California-based automotive data and pricing company also recently reported some problems with Model S including stalling of the car, which required replacement of the main battery pack; freezing of the touchscreen; a creaky steering wheel and problems in opening the sunroof.However, Tesla fixed all these issues free of charge for both Consumer Reports and Edmunds.com, as the cars were covered by warranty. Moreover, the company admitted that the early models of the car had some flaws which have been fixed in the later models. Tesla conducts a product excellence meeting on a weekly basis to actively address any flaw pointed out by customers.It is worth noting that Consumer Reports had earlier named Model S the best car of 2014 in its survey of about 260 vehicles. It evaluated cars on the basis of over 50 tests along with reliability ratings provided by subscribers and scores earned by the cars in government and insurance industry crash tests.The electric sports sedan also scored 99 out of 100 in a consumer satisfaction survey by the magazine. This is the highest score in the last few years. Results are based on the response of 350,000 Consumer Reports subscribers who own a car. Around 637 of them were owners of the 2012 or 2013 versions of Model S.However, Consumer Reports is not reducing the car's average reliability rating yet, although it believes that a downgrade is possible, depending on the frequency and severity of the problems reported by subscribers.Meanwhile, a Deutsche Bank analyst raised Tesla to Buy from Hold and increased the target price to $310 from $220. The analyst expressed the opinion that Tesla's annual production will hit 1 million units by 2025 driven by the expected acquisition of 1-2 assembly facilities in the next 3 years. As a result, the company's growth will likely surpass expectations. The rating upgrade drove Tesla's shares up 4.51% to $259.32 on Aug 11.Tesla currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Last quarter, it posted a surprise of +1.90%. Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Our proven model shows that O'Reilly Automotive is likely to beat earnings this quarter because it has the right combination of two key components. , which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is poised at +0.54%. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks of #1, 2 and 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. However, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of O'Reilly Automotive's Zacks Rank #3 and +0.54% ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.O'Reilly enjoys a competitive edge owing to its dual market strategy. Also, the company is continuously benefiting from a strong distribution network. The company aggressively pursues new store openings for greater penetration in existing markets and expansion into new, contiguous markets. For full-year 2014, O'Reilly raised the earnings per share guidance to $6.82-$6.92, based on good operating performance and announcement of an additional share repurchase program.The positive trend has been seen in the trailing four quarters, over which O'Reilly posted an average surprise of 4.11%.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because O'Reilly is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings-with the most up-to-date information possible-is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ORLY in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.86 per share for ORLY, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.85 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ORLY, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 0.54% heading into earnings season.A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that ORLY has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for O'Reilly, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Auto parts retailers enjoy consistent demand from auto shops, which can pass on costs to their customers. Demand for auto repairs is expected to increase as both average age and the number of cars on the road rise. Analytics firm IHS forecasts the average age of U.S. autos to rise nearly 3% over the next five years from 11.4 years in 2014 to 11.7 years by 2019.The total number of vehicles in operation rose 1.5% last year to more than 252.7 million, as of Jan. 1, according to IHS. About 11.5 million vehicles were scrapped in 2013, representing an 18% decline from 2012, when a record 14 million were junked.\"We see the total VIO (vehicles in operation) growing by 6.5% between now and 2019,\" said Mark Seng, director of aftermarket solutions at IHS Automotive, based in Southfield, Mich. \"As the number of vehicles on the road increases and the average age increases -- people are hanging onto their vehicles longer -- that is all good news for the aftermarket repair business.\"On average Americans are financing auto purchases longer and keeping their vehicle about 22 months longer compared with 10 years ago, Seng added.Thanks to improved quality and extended ownership periods, the number of cars 12 years and older will rise 15% by 2019, IHS estimates. Meanwhile the number of cars less than five years old will jump nearly a third. But the number of autos between six and 11 years old will drop by roughly a fifth given that new car registrations crashed 40% between 2008 and 2010 because of the recession.Growth in new car sales is expected to pick up just 2.6% in 2014 vs. 7.6% and 13.4% in the prior two years, according to JPMorgan.Cars tend to need the most repairs when they're six to 10 years old -- known as the industry sweet spot -- after manufacturer warranties have expired and before people dump their cars.U.S. vehicle sales dropped from 16 million to 17 million annually before the recession to a record low of 10.4 million in 2009, which means this year slightly more cars will exit the sweet spot than enter it, Christopher Horvers and colleagues at JPMorgan, said in a research note April 9 headlined \"Autoparts Bull vs. Bear.\"\"This represents a sharp reversal from a much larger beneficial trend over the past decade and it gets worse in 2015 when 3 million cars exit on a net basis,\" they wrote. \"We've also hit a cliff given that the peak repair age starts at six years.\"What's more, the typical do-it-yourself customers -- single males ages 50 to 59 with annual household income between $30,000 and $49,999 -- are struggling more than most, according to JPMorgan. \"This customer is not getting better and they will continue to drag on an already weak DIY segment,\" Horvers and colleagues wrote.Horvers also sees potential risks in Advance Auto Parts' ability to integrate the newly acquired General Parts International stores, which could drive customers to competitors. If the economy weakens, consumer spending would drop off, especially in the DIY business.Advance Auto Parts announced June 18 that it will hold an investor and analyst conference in Boston on Wednesday, to be webcast live from its website.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["O'Reilly Automotive (  ) and Advance Auto Parts (  ) have both rapidly and profitably expanded their store bases through a mix of acquisitions and organic growth, enhancing their cost advantages in the process. These developments have led us to upgrade the economic moat ratings of O'Reilly and Advance to narrow from none. From our view, industry dynamics have become increasingly favorable for the largest auto-parts retailers; including AutoZone (  ) and NAPA [operated by Genuine Parts (  )], we now think there are four auto-parts retail businesses that have achieved the scale to obtain narrow moats.Macro conditions have become more favorable for the auto-parts retail market in recent years, but the industry's gains have been highly concentrated on just a few companies. In fact, while each of the narrow-moat retailers has expanded rapidly, the total number of auto-parts retail outlets has remained static over the past decade. Moreover, public disclosures of (formerly) private competitors (General Parts, for example) and other smaller publicly traded companies suggest that competitors are generating much lower profitability levels.We believe the narrow-moat retailers' gains are structural and reflect the increasing costs to manage the auto-parts category's complexity. Because of increased SKU proliferation and the rising average age of vehicles (to a record high of 11.4 years at the end of 2013), auto-parts retailers must carry an ever-growing breadth of parts. From our perspective, these trends have elevated the importance of the cost advantage moat source, since narrow-moat retailers can leverage their increased purchasing power and superior distribution network to offer much greater availability levels at a lower internal expense, and this divide will only widen over time, in our view. In the long run, we expect that the domestic auto-parts retail market will continue to evolve into an oligopoly, which should result in highly attractive economics for the leading retailers.O'Reilly was an early adopter of the dual-market approach, historically generating a 50/50 mix of sales in the do-it-yourself and commercial/do-it-for-me markets. We believe this strategy presents unique challenges and is generally more capital-intensive than either of the single-market approaches. However, the payoff can be quite high since a successful implementation can strengthen scale by expanding the market opportunity and increase asset productivity by leveraging existing infrastructure.These advantages became apparent after O'Reilly acquired CSK Auto in 2008, which added more than 1,300 Western stores to its portfolio, catapulted the company's scale, and transformed O'Reilly from an efficient regional retailer to a formidable national one. O'Reilly quickly sought to increase commercial sales at CSK, which represented only 10% of sales at the time of acquisition, by implementing best practices and investing substantial resources in CSK's distribution infrastructure and commercial sales force. The subsequent boom in DIFM sales continues to improve productivity at Western stores and has contributed to more than 500 basis points of margin expansion since 2008.Advance began as a retailer focused on the \"do it yourself\" market but transitioned to a dual-market approach to capitalize on the consolidation potential in the fragmented \"do it for me\" market. This approach has generated strong results, as Advance has annualized 17% DIFM sales growth over the past decade, raising its DIFM sales mix from 15% to over 40% (55% including the General Parts merger). Advance achieved productivity gains since it could build on top of its retail infrastructure and has accelerated the rollout of its new DIFM-centric concept store, which targets a 70/30 DIFM-DIY sales mix.Advance's comparable sales have stumbled in recent quarters, though, as it struggled with its transition from a DIY to a dual-market retailer as DIY sales productivity has faltered, while rolling out DIFM concept stores in its core markets. Advance has also built up its commercial inventory inefficiently in its haste, in our view, and is testing the limits of its hub-centric distribution strategy. However, we continue to think that Advance can remedy these issues as it gains experience and optimizes its infrastructure for the dual market. In the long run, we expect Advance can reaccelerate its growth in the DIFM market, due to its robust cost advantages over smaller competitors. However, we believe O'Reilly holds a considerable lead over Advance thanks to its expertise, customer relationships, and extensive infrastructure lead. Competitors are still figuring out the workings of the business and are experimenting with less capital-intensive strategies (such as eschewing distribution centers for hubs) to circumvent the significant capital expenditures O'Reilly has already made.After increasing our moat rating to narrow, we raised our fair value estimate for O'Reilly to $140 from $125, as we have adopted more favorable long-term return on incremental capital assumptions. We are maintaining our long-term debt/capital target at 20%, reflecting our view that O'Reilly can take on more leverage in the future (beyond what it has added over the past year) and are keeping O'Reilly's weighted average cost of capital at 8.6%. Our fair value estimate implies calendar 2014 price/earnings of 20 times, enterprise value/EBITDA of 10 times, and a free cash flow yield of approximately 5%.Over the next five years, we project that revenue will grow more than 7% annually, driven by same-store sales growth over 4% and the net addition of approximately 200 new stores per year. During this time, we believe O'Reilly's primary growth drivers will be improved productivity at CSK stores and accelerated store expansion in the Western and Northeastern U.S. Over the next decade, we project O'Reilly will average 7% annual revenue growth as it adds almost 1,900 stores to its domestic store base (to more than 6,000 total stores).O'Reilly's operating margins have increased about 550 basis points to 16.6% over the past five years, thanks to nearly 500 basis points of gross margin expansion (to 50.7%). Some of the lowest-hanging fruit (for example, lower procurement costs from increased scale) has already been leveraged, but we expect operating margins will continue to rise as a result of increased scale efficiencies and improved commercial productivity at CSK outlets.After raising our moat rating to narrow, we increased Advance Auto Parts' fair value estimate to $130 per share from $115, as we have adopted more favorable long-term return on incremental capital assumptions. Our updated valuation represents a forward fiscal 2014 price/earnings ratio of 18 times, an enterprise value/EBITDA of 9 times, and a free cash flow yield of 4%.Advance remains vulnerable to numerous integration risks, since General Parts' Carquest and Worldpac businesses do not overlap as directly with Advance's core business as previous mergers in the sector. However, we remain optimistic that Advance can drive significant cost and productivity synergies from the integration. The acquisition will help Advance saturate some of its existing markets, but should also accelerate its expansion into untapped markets, such as the West Coast. We project store expansion will temporarily slow as Advance digests the General Parts acquisition, but still expect the firm will average 150 net new store openings annually over the next decade.We have raised O'Reilly's economic moat rating to narrow from none because of improved cost advantages and the strength of the firm's intangible assets. The company was one of the primary innovators of the dual-market approach and has leveraged this strategy to gain significant share in the auto-parts retail sector.We have also raised Advance Auto Parts' moat rating to narrow from none, since we expect the acquisition of General Parts to further solidify the company's scale-endowed cost advantages and intangible assets. Pro-forma for the GPI acquisition, Advance generated the highest sales and operated the largest store footprint, among any of its domestic peers in 2013.Pricing is relatively stable in the auto-parts aftermarket, since most consumers are relatively price inelastic regarding their auto-parts purchases and care more about the retailer's parts availability, convenience, and service offerings. These dynamics limit the efficacy of price competition, so mass merchants and e-commerce retailers have struggled to capture share beyond the industry's most price-sensitive consumers.Inventory availability drives productivity in the auto-parts retail sector, so specialty retailers locally stock tens of thousands of slow-moving SKUs, contributing to some of the retail industry's lowest inventory turns. However, large industry players can offset much of this cost by negotiating significantly lower product acquisition expenses and more favorable payment terms from vendors. For instance, though O'Reilly's inventory only turned 1.4 times in 2013, the company mitigated the working capital burden by achieving an 87% accounts payable/inventory ratio and earned gross margins exceeding 50%. By reducing these costs, O'Reilly can economically invest in more inventory than smaller peers and drive increased traffic through greater availability.Likewise, though Advance's inventory only turned 1.3 times in 2013, the company offset the working capital burden by achieving an 85% accounts payable to inventory ratio and earned gross margins approaching 50%. The acquisition of General Parts should further augment Advance's purchasing power and enable it to negotiate even more favorable terms from vendors. These factors should help Advance provide greater availability at a lower cost and should drive continued share gains.Both firms' distribution capabilities have also reduced the cost of providing greater availability, as they are able to shift inventory more efficiently to their most productive locations. Auto-parts retailers carry few duplicate SKUs to maximize overall breadth, so each distribution point must interact with each other frequently to minimize SKU count depletion.By the end of 2014, we expect that O'Reilly will operate 26 distribution centers, 240 hub stores, and over 4,000 retail locations. These investments enable O'Reilly to deliver industry-leading availability to its customers, as the firm's distribution centers and hubs are able to deliver SKUs and replenish local inventory every day (multiple times per day in some urban locations). Auto-parts retailers carry few duplicate parts to maximize overall availability, and the increased rate of replenishment enables O'Reilly to carry even greater inventory breadth.Advance's distribution build-out includes 10 distribution centers, 19 Parts Delivered Quickly warehouses (nine of which are located in the distribution centers), 363 hubs, and over 4,000 stores; the acquisition of General Parts will add 2,600 stores (including 1,400 franchisees), over 100 Worldpac warehouses, and 38 smaller, more manual distribution centers.In addition to delivering hard parts, O'Reilly and Advance also provide ancillary services to independent repair shops to increase customer loyalty, including free electronic parts and repair catalogs (which doubles as an online ordering platform), knowledgeable sales associates, and quick delivery of maintenance and service tools. Both firms can leverage their connections with customers to push their own in-house brands (representing 30% of sales for each firm).Both O'Reilly and Advance have been assigned a positive mat trend, since they both should continue to benefit from the commercial auto-parts retail market's consolidation. O'Reilly was one of the early innovators of the balanced dual-market approach and still benefits from an infrastructure and commercial expertise lead over many of its peers, assisting its rapid share gains. Large competitors, including Advance, are beginning to adopt many elements of O'Reilly's approach, so we think the relative advantage over large peers will narrow over time. However, O'Reilly has accumulated significant scale-endowed cost advantages in the process and should continue to enhance its competitive advantages by capturing share from subscale competitors. And though Advance has experienced numerous growing pains as it has rapidly increased commercial sales and transitioned toward the dual-market approach, we believe the firm is well-equipped to iron out these inefficiencies over time, as management leverages General Parts' reputation and expertise in the commercial market. More importantly, Advance's scale-endowed cost advantages should continue to drive organic consolidation gains.We assign O'Reilly an Exemplary stewardship rating. Through a series of well-executed acquisitions, management has transformed the company from a regional entity into a top-three national player. We believe management has proved itself to be highly adept, as it has been very successful at extracting synergies and increasing the productivity of its acquisition targets. As a result, we think O'Reilly has established itself as one of the most efficient commercial auto-parts retailers and is poised to be one of the main beneficiaries of industry consolidation trends. The majority of the executive staff has decades of experience working at O'Reilly, which gives us greater confidence that management will execute on its strategic initiatives.Gregory L. Henslee became CEO and co-president in 2005 and is the first non-O'Reilly family member to hold the CEO position. Henslee started as a parts specialist at O'Reilly 25 years ago and had a variety of internal leadership roles before adopting his current position. We like that the CEO and chairman roles are split. Since the O'Reilly family continues to hold more than $100 million in O'Reilly equity, we think this third-party oversight will prevent egregious abuses by management. However, we are concerned about the family's extensive influence. The board consists of four O'Reilly family members, and the firm leases a few stores from the family. In addition, the company's bylaws employ a staggered board and poison pills, limiting minority shareholders' voice. As a result, the O'Reilly family's incentives may not entirely be aligned with shareholders', although we have not seen any significant abuses.We have assigned Advance Auto Parts' management team a Standard stewardship rating. Darren Jackson took over as CEO of the firm in 2009 and had previously served as the company's president (since 2008) and director (since 2004). Before he joined Advance, Jackson was the executive vice president of Customer Operating Groups at Best Buy, and he recruited several executives from his old firm to join him at Advance, including, but not limited to, Michael Norona, the current CFO and executive vice president, and George Sherman, the president. In fact, the current executive team is largely composed of members who joined after 2008 and were recruited by Jackson; while the majority of these executives have retail experience, few members had directly worked in the auto-parts retail industry. In contrast, the majority of AutoZone and O'Reilly's executive teams have served at their respective companies for over a decade. Consequently, we think Advance's management team, while sharp, is still ramping up the learning curve, a factor that may have contributed to some of the firm's recent operational missteps.In our view, outperformance in the auto-parts retail industry depends largely on the company's efficient scale and management's ability to consistently execute and improve distribution efficiency. Since there is no need to reinvent the wheel, we think Advance can reduce the profitability gap between the firm and its larger peers by observing and adopting its rivals' best practices. Several of the recent initiatives, including, but not limited to, the insourcing of the commercial credit program, smaller commercial-oriented stores, and the adoption of a traditional hub and distribution center model (and the concurrent move away from PDQ warehouses) seem to take a page directly from O'Reilly's playbook. We remain optimistic that should Advance remain a stand-alone entity, management will continue to narrow the gap between itself and the other large industry participants.Executive compensation is slightly higher than the peer average, but compensation practices seem reasonable, in our view. We are pleased that management's performance is measured using economic profit-added metrics, and roughly two thirds of compensation is tied to long-term incentive compensation. We like that the chairman and CEO positions are split, as we think it should help prevent potential conflicts of interest. Advance has a good track record of curbing repurchases when shares are pricey, and aggressively increasing repurchases when shares are weak. Although we typically avoid reading too much into any company's share repurchase activity, we would follow Advance's share repurchase initiatives, since we think it provides a greater signal into management's confidence on the company's operating performance.See also  on seekingalpha.comThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["meriGas Partners, L.P.

But both share defensive traits that have powered them ahead of other retail segments and bolstered the stocks even as the general market has skidded.As a group, drugstores are up 13% year to date, compared with only a 1% gain for the S&P 500 Index and a 5.11% decline in the S&P Retail Index.What's the draw? Potential benefits from the Affordable Care Act, an aging U.S. population and the opportunity to boost margins amid a new wave of generic drugs coming to market have helped spark investor enthusiasm over the group, which includes chains such asCVS Caremark (  ),Walgreen (  ) andRite Aid (  ).All three chains are trading at all-time highs. Rite Aid's share price has rocketed to its highest level in 13 years.\"The backdrop for all three (drugstore chains) is a rising tide lifts all boats,\" said Jefferies analyst Mark Wiltamuth. \"Health care reform could add 3% to the industry's prescription volumes over time once the new insurance coverage is digested by the market.\"There's also a \"nice macro trend with the aging of the baby boomers,\" who will require more medication when they reach Medicare age at 65.Wiltamuth notes that consumers ages 65 and over spend an average of $1,300 a year on prescription drugs vs. $150 for those 18 to 44.Another plus: There's likely a new wave of generic drugs coming to market in late 2014 into 2015. \"Generic drugs carry more profit dollars for a pharmacy even though they go for a cheaper price,\" Wiltamuth said.He adds that pharmacies generally make 50% or more per prescription selling a generic drug vs. a branded drug.The auto-parts retail and distributors group includesO'Reilly Automotive (  ),AutoZone (  ) andAdvance Auto Parts (AAP). O'Reilly and AutoZone have been on a long-running winning streak with double-digit earnings growth.As a group, the industry's shares are up 8% year to date.What's revving up their performance? While a long, tough winter has dragged on many retail segments, it has increased wear and tear on cars and trucks, driving up demand for auto parts.The economic recovery's initial surge in new car sales has slowed, and the overall age of the U.S. auto fleet continues to inch higher.\"The primary driver in the near term has been weather,\" said Wedbush analyst Seth Basham.The extremely cold winter and early spring weather in several parts of America have led to a lot of stress on car parts, particularly batteries, starters and alternators, Basham says.That stress results in stalling and breakage. That means more business for the auto-parts retailers from the do-it-yourself customers and the commercial garages that fix the cars.Batteries and starters need to be fixed immediately, says Basham. And the do-it-yourself customer, typically a lower-end consumer, needs to fix the car so he or she can get to work.\"That's led to a nice pop in sales (for the do-it-yourself auto sector) in the fourth quarter and into the first,\" he said. \"Our expectation is we'll continue to see strong sales in the second and third quarters.\"The cold and snowy winter also means more potholes and salt on the roads. They cause stress on under-car parts, Basham says, creating many problems that will be addressed in the spring and into the summer.A hot summer would compound those issues and lead to additional part failure.Another driver: New car sales continue to rise but at a slower pace. The seasonally adjusted annual rate of car sales in units rose 2% in the first quarter. It's a drop from an 8% rise in the first quarter of 2013 and even higher levels in 2012, wrote Basham: \"We view this as an incremental positive for DIY auto sales, as not as many consumers purchase or consider purchasing new cars and instead repair and maintain existing vehicles.\"Another trend that helps the auto parts retailers: People are holding onto their cars longer.Last year, the average age of light vehicles was a record 11.4 years, according to auto research firm Polk.Another defensive retail segment is the variety discounters such asDollar Tree (DLTR),Family Dollar Stores (FDO) andDollar General (DG).As a group, they're down 5% year to date. But that is among the best performances among retail industry groups.And variety discounters continue to outrun the broader industry in same-store sales growth, according to Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics.\"The dollar stores have great value and convenience,\" said MKM Partners analyst Patrick McKeever. And \"overall they're doing better than other retail sectors.\"However, growth is slowing from two years ago, when the group was generating mid-single-digit same-store sales growth, to low single digits now, he says.He adds that Family Dollar Stores is the weak link in the group now. Family Dollar's earnings slipped 30% in its second quarter ended March 1, and its same-store sales fell 3.8%.It's going through a restructuring, which includes closing around 370 stores and job cuts.Overall, dollar stores continue to strike a chord with consumers by offering ultralow prices on everything from food to home goods.But their core low-income consumer is feeling pressure on a number of fronts.\"Some of it is macro,\" McKeever said. \"The weak recovery in some instances has left the core dollar-store customer behind.\"Added Piper Jaffray analyst Peter Keith: \"We've seen bifurcated recovery, with asset appreciation in home prices and stock market gains largely benefiting mid- and upper-income consumers. The lower-half income demographic is not participating in the wealth effect, because this demographic has much lower ownership rates in home and equities.\"A headwind: what McKeever calls a pullback in government assistance to the dollar stores' core customers, including cuts in extended unemployment benefits and a reduction in food-stamp assistance effective Nov. 1.The climate for the drugstore chains continues to be favorable.\"Retail pharmacies make more profit per generic drug dispensed than branded drugs,\" said UBS analyst Steven Valiquette. \"From 2011 to 2015, there is the biggest generic opportunity in the history of the industry to capitalize on.\"He estimates that $115 billion worth of branded drugs will have gone generic in that period, compared to an estimated $79 billion from 2006 to 2010.\"A big part of why these stocks are doing well has to do with their ability to capitalize on this current generic drug wave,\" he said. \"Our view is that most investors believe the generic opportunity will slow down dramatically from 2016 to 2020. However, our $82 billion view for this time period still creates an excellent opportunity for retail pharmacies.\"Added Wiltamuth: \"These health care themes, including the new generic drug wave, the aging baby boomers and the Affordable Care Act, all help the sector against a more sluggish economic recovery.\"Auto retailers are likely to continue seeing a boost from the weather.John R. Lawrence at the financial-services firm Stephens says he likes the stocks and the group. The question, he said, is \"how long will the harsh weather continue to favorably affect the purchase of auto parts as far as creating demand? There could be a long tailwind.\"The variety discounters could continue to face challenges.\"2014 is going to continue to be a challenging year following a tough 2013, given the pressure on the lower income demographic, which is their core customer,\" said Wedbush analyst Joan Storms.\"There's going to continue to be a negative mix shift toward lower-margin consumables because that demographic is buying what they need when they need it, and they're not buying discretionary products like apparel.\"The shift toward lower-margin consumables \"has the potential to put pressure\" on same-store sales, she added.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["taples, Inc.

The reiteration was based on improving earnings, strong brand recognition, recent acquisitions and savings through optimization of product costs, which offset the headwinds.Standard Motor reported an 8.2% rise in adjusted earnings per share to 79 cents in the third quarter of 2013 from 73 cents in the year-ago quarter. Earnings per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 76 cents.Standard Motor enjoys a strong competitive advantage due to its brand recognition and sizeable customer base. Moreover, the company is expanding its business through acquisitions.Further, Standard Motor is not significantly exposed to the cyclical nature of the automotive industry since it is focused on the aftermarket. Demand for repair products are expected to rise, thanks to the increasing number of vehicle models with different features, increased complexity in modern vehicles, expansion of the used vehicles market and an increase in the average auto age in the U.S.However, rising demand for fuel efficient vehicles or electric vehicles can mar aftermarket sales and hamper the long-term performance of Standard Motor. Moreover, the company is adversely affected by the price competition in the market.Standard Motor's sales are mostly concentrated on its major customers like  (  ), NAPA Auto Parts and  (  ). The top 5 customers of the company represented about 64% of consolidated net sales in 2012.Thus, the loss of any key customer could significantly affect the company's results.Standard Motor currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The company is focusing on boosting sales through the expansion of stores and also follows an aggressive share repurchase program. However, AutoZone's rising debt and interest burden, rising gas prices and the company's heavy reliance on its private label brands may affect its margins.AutoZone uses its significant cash flow to open new stores every year and maintain a mid-single-digit square footage growth rate. In the first three quarters of fiscal 2013, the company opened 84 stores in the U.S. and 20 stores in Mexico.The ample cash balance also facilitates capital deployment through share buybacks. In the first three quarters of fiscal 2013, AutoZone repurchased more than 2.2 million shares for $827 million.Moreover, the average age of cars on the road is rising (reaching 11.3 years), which is increasing the demand for auto parts. However, AutoZone has a high degree of reliance on its private label brands (50%), which could hinder its commercial business.Rising gas prices are also a threat to the company as it has a negative impact on miles driven and leads to deferment of purchases by its customers. AutoZone is suffering from rising debt. The company's total debt increased to $4.0 billion as of May 4, 2013, from $3.6 billion as of May 5, 2012.

The downgrade was based on the company's high dependence on some customers and price competition prevailing in the market. Both the top and bottom lines increased year over year in the second quarter of 2013, but they missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.On Aug 7, 2013, Standard Motor reported an 18.6% rise in adjusted earnings per share to 70 cents in the second quarter of 2013 from 59 cents in the year-ago quarter. However, earnings per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 76 cents.Total revenue increased 0.5% to $270.1 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $283 million. Revenues from Temperature Control segment declined marginally while the Engine Management segment reported an improved performance.Following the release of the second quarter results, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2013 decreased 5.6% to $2.20 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2014 dropped 1.6% to $2.51 per share. Currently, Standard Motor retains a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).We are concerned about the adverse effects of price competition prevailing in the market. This price competition is a result of imports from China and the price-cut strategy adopted by competitors. This leads to lower selling price; thus adversely affecting the profit margin of Standard Motor.Moreover, sales of Standard Motor are mostly concentrated on its major customers like  (  ), NAPA Auto Parts and  (  ). The company's sales to these customers accounted for about 19%, 18% and 15%, respectively, of total sales in 2012. The top 5 customers of the company represented about 64% of consolidated net sales in 2012. Thus, the loss of any key customer could significantly affect the company's results.Meanwhile, Standard Motor enjoys a strong competitive advantage due to its brand recognition and sizeable customer base. It distributes parts through established brand names and also under private labels.In addition, Standard Motor is not significantly exposed to the cyclical nature of the automotive industry since it is focused on the aftermarket, where it is a leading player.

The $272 million buy closed May 1.Sator's parts are used by more than 6,000 customers, served from 11 distribution centers.\"It's clearly a strategically significant acquisition,\" said LKQ spokesperson Joseph Boutross. \"It increases our European footprint and puts us on the continent.\"At the end of the second quarter, Europe accounted for 27% of the company's parts and services revenue, up from zero before its foray into Britain less than two years ago.Sator almost surely won't be LKQ's last buy in Europe.\"Acquisitions are core to our story,\" Boutross said. \"The pipeline is robust. We have tremendous amount of runway in North America and Europe.\"LKQ, which stands for \"Like Kind Quality,\" has expanded its footprint in North America for years. In 2012, it acquired a record 30 outfits.LKQ's biggest buy at $810 million remains 2007's Keystone Automotive Industries, which nearly doubled its revenue and added more than 160 distribution warehouses .\"They know how to make an acquisition and integrate it effectively and speedily,\" said Elliott Schlang, managing director of Great Lakes Review, an institutional research boutique.Great Lakes Review likes to focus on \"best of class\" midsize companies in the Midwest. LKQ is one.\"They're 20 times the size of their nearest competitors. That alone gets our attention,\" Schlang said.The market for alternative car parts in the U.S. is highly fragmented, with lots of mom-and-pop operators. Schlang says LKQ has 25% to 30% share of that market.In North America, LKQ is largely involved in collision repair parts such as headlights, fenders and doors, followed by mechanical components such as recycled engines, transmissions and body assemblies.That puts it in a different market than do-it-yourself auto retailers such asAutoZone (  ) andO'Reilly Automotive (  ), Schlang says.Insurance companies typically pay for collision repairs and encourage repair shops to use some alternative parts to save money since they're 20% to 50% cheaper than original parts.And since LKQ is the largest distributor, it often gets the business.\"It basically has an unmatched distribution network that reaches most major markets in the U.S. and Canada within the next day,\" Schlang said. \"Their network of warehouses around the country and their ability to deliver with their own fleet of trucks gives them a leg up over everybody else.\"LKQ has more than 3,500 trucks in North America to move parts from warehouses to repair shops.Its close ties with insurance companies and repair shops spur sales.\"In North America, LKQ is building partnerships that make it easier for repair shops to source parts,\" said analyst Craig Kennison of Robert W. Baird, in an e-mail.LKQ recently forged a new partnership with CCC Information Services, for example, which provides software connecting repair shops and insurance companies for looking up the cost of parts.After checking the CCC One database, repair shops would phone LKQ or other suppliers for parts. Now they can order online straight from LKQ via the CCC One system.Kennison expects LKQ inventory to be accessible to more than 4,000 repair shops through CCC One, resulting in higher demand.LKQ is trying to replicate its business model in Europe.\"In Europe, LKQ is building its distribution footprint and partnership with the insurance industry to develop demand for collision parts, which is driving robust growth,\" Kennison said.Unlike the U.S., LKQ's European business is more skewed to mechanical parts than parts for collision repairs. But that's changing as LKQ adds more collision-focused components to its network.\"LKQ is positioned to be a leading distributor of alternative parts in Europe as the market for less expensive parts takes off,\" Kennison noted.Because collision repairs are paid mostly by insurance companies, LKQ's business hasn't been as susceptible to the ups and downs of the consumer economy.\"They've had 12 years of consistent growth right through the recession,\" Schlang said. \"The consistency is unbelievable.\"Earnings and revenue over the last four years have grown 23% a year on average. In the second quarter, revenue jumped 24% to $1.25 billion. Organic growth (excluding acquisitions) was up 13% for parts and services, with Europe accelerating 37.8% and North America 7.3%.Earnings in the quarter rose 19% to 25 cents a share. LKQ stock jumped nearly 12% after the Aug. 1 report that gave new 2013 guidance.Management raised the outlook, expecting organic revenue growth of 8.5% to 10.5% vs. 6.5% to 8.5% previously and EPS of $1.03 to $1.10, up from its earlier view of $1 to $1.09. LKQ earned 87 cents a share in 2012.Besides Sator, it made six buys in the quarter of local or regional parts distributors in the U.S. and Canada.LKQ is the fourth-largest firm by market cap in IBD's Retail/Wholesale-Auto Parts industry group, after AutoZone, O'Reilly andGenuine Parts Co.

When people put off buying new cars, it means they put their money into maintaining and repairing old ones.This works in the favor of companies likeAutoZone (  ). It's the nation's largest auto parts retail chain with nearly 4,800 stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. It also has 341 stores in Mexico and one in Brazil.AutoZone sells auto parts and accessories to consumers in the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) market and repair shops in the Do-It-For-Me (DIFM) market.Like other auto parts companies, includingO'Reilly Automotive (  ),Genuine Parts (  ) andAdvance Auto Parts (  ), AutoZone tends to flourish when the nation's fleet of cars on the road grows older.That's been happening for several years now as recession-weary consumers decided to stick with their old vehicles rather than trade them in for something newer.Not coincidentally, AutoZone has delivered a years-long run of double-digit earnings gains and steady revenue growth.\"Because people are keeping their cars longer, they're doing more maintenance on them. Cars are also lasting longer because they're much more durable,\" said Aaron Lowe, vice president of government affairs at the Automotive Aftermarket Industry Association, or AAIA. \"This has all been good for the parts industry.\"The average age of cars and trucks on the road is at a record high of 11.3 years, says Ron Rossi, the AAIA's director of market intelligence.He points out that over the last five years, the number of vehicles 11 years and older has grown at a 3.95% compounded annual rate.Meanwhile, the number of vehicles less than five years old has declined 6.5% over the same period, and the number six to 10 years old has dropped 1.3%.The reason is simple: Younger cars are getting older, and older cars are staying on the road.\"The 11-year-and-older category is the aftermarket sweet spot,\" Rossi said. \"It plays well into the DIFM and the DIY markets, both of which AutoZone is very interested in.\"Even so, there are signs that consumers are changing their buying habits. U.S. auto sales in May rose 8% to an annualized 15.3 million vehicles, according to Autodata, above expectations.It is unclear how these trends will affect the auto parts industry.New cars typically come with warranties that let consumers get repairs at dealerships for a certain number of years rather than having to take them to independent repair shops or fix the cars themselves. Those trends work against auto parts retailers.But even with rising sales of new cars, some watchers say there is still plenty of business left over for the aftermarket parts industry.\"In the interim, there are enough older vehicles on the road that the aftermarket should continue to see steady business in the years ahead,\" Rossi said.The aftermarket parts industry is expected to grow at a rate of 3.4% a year through 2016, according to a report recently released by the AAIA and Automotive Aftermarket Suppliers Association.Still, there are signs auto parts retailers are facing more head winds than they did a couple of years ago.AutoZone's quarterly earnings growth has decelerated or been flat in eight of the last nine quarters. Sales growth has decelerated or been flat nine quarters in a row.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect annual earnings this fiscal year to climb 18%, down from 21% growth in fiscal 2012 and 30% in 2011. Yearly earnings are seen rising 13% in both 2014 and '15.\"Certainly, the industry is growing slower than it did in 2010-11,\" noted Christopher Horvers, an analyst at JPMorgan. \"But we believe results from AutoZone, Genuine Parts and O'Reilly show that 2013 is positioned to benefit from easier comparisons and a more normalized winter.\"There are certainly far worse problems than dropping from 20%-or-better EPS growth to growth in the low to midteens. AutoZone has managed to deliver consistent gains because of its operational prowess, analysts say.\"AutoZone has used the cyclical boom in the category to fund commercial investments and as a means to buffer any potential slowdown in sales,\" Horvers noted. \"Strong growth runway in DIFM, coupled with best-in-class execution in the DIY business, places AutoZone in a favorable position.\"Meanwhile, the company continues to deliver solid financial results. It reported earnings of $6.27 a share for its fiscal third quarter, which ended May 5. That was up 16% from the prior year and 2 cents above analyst views.Overall sales climbed 4.5% to $2.2 billion -- above estimates for $2.13 billion -- though same-store sales declined 0.1%.AutoZone shares rose 6% to a record high of 435.35 on the day the company reported results.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2014 also climbed 4.8% to $6.50 per share.O'Reilly benefits from its dual market strategy and strong distribution network. A mix of commercial sales offers the company with greater exposure to less discretionary sales of hard parts and allows it to operate in smaller markets.O'Reilly will primarily benefit from the aggressive store expansion strategy and share repurchase policy.

Nevertheless, earnings were higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.61 per share. Net earnings fell 8.8% to $121.8 million from $133.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2012.Revenues went up 3.0% to $2.02 billion, nearly meeting the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.01 billion. The increase was driven by the acquisition of BWP Distributors and the net addition of 163 new stores in the last 12 months, partially offset by a decline in comparable store sales of 3.2% versus an increase of 2.1% during the first quarter of fiscal 2012.Comparable store sales in the quarter were hurt by unseasonably warm weather, which had deferred the maintenance on vehicles. Further, payroll tax increases, delayed income tax refunds and a very slow start to the spring selling season led to softer business.Gross margin was 50.0% during the quarter compared with 50.1% a year ago. The eight basis-point decrease in gross profit rate was driven by planned increases in supply chain costs related to the full operations of the company's new distribution center and the impact of BWP sales, which have a lower gross margin rate as a result of higher mix of their sales to commercial customers. These were partially offset by improved shrink rates.SG&A was 39.9% of sales during the quarter compared with 38.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. The 127 basis-point increase was driven by lower expenses due to the company's 3.2% decline in comparable store sales and increased new store openings. These were partially offset by lower advertising expenses and a decrease in credit card fees because of the in sourcing of the company's commercial credit program.Operating income decreased 9.1% to $204.1 million from $224.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Operating margin was 10.1% versus 11.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2012.During the quarter, Advance Auto Parts acquired 124 BWP stores and opened 56 stores, including 7 Autopart International stores, and closed 5 stores.

As of Feb 9, 2013, the company had 4,735 stores in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in the U.S., 334 stores in Mexico and one store in Brazil.The company's inventory grew 7% in the quarter, driven by an improvement in store count and continued strategic investments in hard parts assortment. Inventory per store increased a mere 2.6% to $544,000 from $530,000 in the corresponding quarter of last year.During the quarter, AutoZone repurchased 513,000 shares for $185 million, reflecting an average price of $361.

It has robust, growing markets.\"Actually, O'Reilly operates a modest number of stores in the northern part of the state, close to distribution centers in Mobile, Ala., and Atlanta.Tampa is a sharp turn south. A new distribution center in the works in Lakeland, Fla., will better serve that market as well as others expected to open in central Florida and farther south.The distribution center is on track to open early next year. Management has said that about 25 new stores would open initially and up to 350 in the state, longer term.O'Reilly is one of the largest auto-parts chains in the U.S., smaller than No. 1AutoZone (  ) but now slightly larger thanAdvance Auto Parts (  ) in sales and store count.Of the three, O'Reilly is growing the fastest on both the top and bottom lines. In 2012, earnings rose 25% over the prior year to $4.75 a share.Double-digit profit growth is being driven in part by geographic expansion, as Morgan Stanley analysts said in a Feb. 8 report on O'Reilly, titled \"Pulling Away From the Pack.\"O'Reilly drove into another new region recently, New England. Its acquisition of Maine-based VIP Parts, Tires & Service at the end of December gave it 56 retail stores in Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts, plus distribution centers.The company plans to make use of those distribution centers to expand farther into New England and other northeastern markets, such as New York State.Morgan Stanley analysts figure that the Northeast and Florida account for about 25% of industrywide auto-parts retail revenue based on total light vehicle registrations. They say the two major markets could ultimately translate into $1.5 billion to $2 billion in annual revenue for O'Reilly.Last year, O'Reilly took in nearly $6.2 billion, a 7% gain over 2011.Analysts expect O'Reilly's revenue to grow 8% this year, to nearly $6.7 billion.They estimate that AutoZone and Advance Auto sales will grow slightly less this year, 7%, according to Thomson Reuters, with AutoZone's to total $9.2 billion and Advance $6.6 billion. Advance's profits are seen growing the slowest, at 7%.O'Reilly plans to open 190 new stores this year, on top of 180 last year. Management has said it could open around 200 new stores a year for the foreseeable future.\"We've more than doubled our size in the last five years,\" said Merz. Top states currently are Texas and California.A swift acceleration occurred in 2008, when more than 1,300 stores were acquired from CSK Auto, giving O'Reilly a new presence in the Western half of the U.S.Those stores were viewed as underperforming with average annual volume of $1.35 million a year.As O'Reilly integrated its systems and culture, CSK stores have been posting stronger sales, outpacing growth at the firm's mature stores.Since most of the CSK stores are in major metro markets compared to O'Reilly's larger mix of legacy stores in smaller markets, management thinks CSK stores can reach $1.8 million in per-unit volume. They're not there yet.Average unit volume chainwide is now $1.6 million.Same-store sales and margins should continue to get a lift from improving performance at CSK acquired stores, analysts say.O'Reilly's operating margin in 2012 was a record 15.8%.A little more than half of sales are from do-it-yourselfers with the rest from mechanics on the commercial, or professional, side.Sales in the fourth quarter rose 7% to $1.49 billion, while earnings jumped 21% to $1.14 per share.After Q4 and full-year results were released late on Feb. 6, shares jumped 8% in the next day's trading session.In contrast, AutoZone's stock fell nearly 2% on Tuesday after it reported disappointing results for its second fiscal quarter ended Feb. 9. At the close, shares were down less than 1%, however.Though earnings beat views, AutoZone's revenue came in below Wall Street's consensus, rising 2.8% to $1.85 billion. Same-store sales fell 1.8% vs. O'Reilly's 4.2% gain in the fourth quarter.Analysts estimate O'Reilly's earnings will rise 20% this year to $5.72 a share and go up 13% in 2014, according to Thomson Reuters.Expense controls have contributed to strong profits, from negotiating better prices from suppliers based on greater scale to keeping travel budgets down. For example, managers share hotel rooms when they are away on business. Even the CEO and CFO have shared a room, Merz says.Comparisons could get easier this year over last year, when an unusually mild winter caused less stress on car parts.After noticing softer demand for products, management announced June 27 that it wouldn't meet earlier guidance of 3% to 5% same-store sales growth in Q2, sending shares tumbling 14%.Benefits of this winter's cold weather and snowstorms will likely be \"felt in spring/summer,\" said Stifel Nicolaus analysts in a Feb. 8 note. Since then, heavy snowstorms hit major O'Reilly markets in Kansas, Missouri, Texas and others especially hard.A cold snap, a Stifel Nicolaus report said, \"warms our hearts to auto parts.\"The company's stock, though volatile, has benefited from a share buyback program begun in January 2011. Some 32 million shares were bought through the end of December, for $2.4 billion. Over that time, shares rose nearly 50%. Shares are up 14% year-to-date.Management plans to use excess cash to keep purchasing shares.\"We're able to generate more free cash than we can use to grow our business organically (and profitably),\" Merz said.On the downside for the company's near-term prospects, analysts say, new-car sales continue to pick up. More new cars on the road mean fewer repairs and parts are needed, at least in the first few years.O'Reilly's take is a bit different. Management says that better engineered new cars will stay in use longer, meaning today's new-car customer \"is going to be our customer five or six years down the road,\" as Merz put it.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ick's Sporting Goods Inc (  ) will begin trading ex-dividend on March 06, 2013.

With interest rates having remained near zero for the past few years, investors have earned just about nothing on their money market funds.But that hasn't stopped U.S. companies from hoarding the green stuff -- more than $3.5 trillion in cash is parked on their balance sheets right now, according to Yahoo! Finance. Some are holding the cash because, though the economy has come a long way since the financial crisis, they remain extra cautious, not wanting to get caught with their pants down should another shockwave hit the financial system. Some fear the sluggish recovery is indicative of a \"New Normal\", one in which there won't be enough demand for their products and services to merit expansions of their businesses. In addition, much of the cash is parked overseas, and bringing it back to the U.S. means paying repatriation taxes on it.The fact that they're not seeing enough of their companies' green has many investors seeing red, including Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn. The hedge fund guru is suing Apple over the way it plans to use -- or not use -- its huge pile of cash.But not all firms have been hoarding their cash. Over the past couple years many companies have increased their dividend payouts or bought back significant amounts of their own shares, both of which enhance shareholder value. Of course, such efforts alone aren't reason to invest in a stock. Any stock you buy should have strong fundamentals, and the underlying business should have strong financials and a good track record. That's why I recently used my Guru Strategies, each of which is based on the approach of a different investing great, to find some companies that have been putting their cash to work and also have strong financial and fundamentals. Here are some of the companies that made the grade. As always, keep in mind that stocks like these should be considered as part of a well diversified portfolio. This Sugar Land, Tex.-based firm ($1.9 billion market cap) is a master limited partnership that produces nitrogen fertilizers. If you want access to the cash the companies you invest in are generating, you get it with CVR -- it has a policy of paying out all available cash in quarterly distributions. In the past year, it has paid out $1.81 per share, which amounts to a yield of 6.9%.CVR has more going for it than just that yield. It trades for a reasonable 13.9 times trailing 12-month earnings per share and has a 37.3% long-term EPS growth rate. (I use an average of the three-, four-, and five-year EPS figures to determine a long-term rate.) Mutual fund legend Peter Lynch famously used the P/E-to-Growth ratio to find bargain-priced growth stocks, and when we divide CVR's P/E by its growth rate, we get a PEG of 0.37. That falls into this model's best-case category (below 0.5).Another good sign: CVR's debt/equity ratio is a reasonable 27%. Based in Arlington, Va., CACI provides IT and professional services in the defense, intelligence, homeland security, and IT modernization and government transformation arenas. The $1.2-billion-market-cap firm has taken in more than $3.7 billion in sales in the past year, and has more than 120 offices across North America and Western Europe. Over the past five years, CACI has implemented multiple share repurchase programs, decreasing its number of shares outstanding by more than 20%.CACI is an unloved stock that's a favorite of my Joel Greenblatt-based approach. Yes, its government dealings could be impacted if the defense budget sequestration occurs. But the stock is so cheap that much of the impact appears to be priced into shares. The Greenblatt approach -- a remarkably simple one that looks at just two variables -- likes its 14.8% earnings yield, for example. The strategy also likes CACI's 61% return on capital. Those two figures make it the 14th most-attractive stock in the market, according to the Greenblatt model. Missouri-based O'Reilly ($11.6 billion market cap) sells aftermarket auto parts, tools, supplies, equipment, and accessories to both professional service providers and do-it-yourself customers. The 55-year-old company has about 3,700 stores in 39 states. O'Reilly bought back about 16 million of its own shares in 2012 as part of a $3 billion share repurchase program. It still has about $400 million left on that authorization.O'Reilly gets is another favorite of my Lynch-based model. It's been growing EPS at a 28.5% rate over the long haul. That and its 21.4 P/E ratio makes for a PEG ratio of 0.75, which comes in under this model's 1.0 upper limit, a sign the stock is a good value. O'Reilly also has a 52% debt/equity ratio, which comes in well under the model's 80% limit. Houston-based Conoco is an integrated oil and gas firm that has operations in more than two dozen countries. The $70-billion-market-cap firm, which spun off part of its business into Phillips 66 last year, has significantly upped its dividend payouts in recent years, and it bought back more than $5 billion worth of its shares in 2012.Conoco's strong 4.6% dividend yield is one reason it gets strong interest from my James O'Shaughnessy-based value model. When looking for value plays, O'Shaughnessy targeted large firms with strong cash flows and high dividend yields. Conoco definitely has the size, and, in addition to that yield, it's generating $11.58 in cash flow per share, more than eight times the market mean.

The Thomson/Reuters estimate was for profit of $8.41 a share on sales of $2.8 billion.Same-store sales in the quarter rose a disappointing 2.1 percent, down from 4.5 percent growth in the year-ago quarter. CEO Bill Rhodes said: \"While our same-store sales performance was below our expectations for the quarter, we are confident we are well positioned to again deliver strong results for our new fiscal year.\"The company opened 72 new stores in the quarter, including 24 stores in Mexico. As of August 25, the company had 4,685 stores in 49 states and 321 stores in Mexico.From a technical perspective, Autozone's chart is an example of what slack buying demand looks like. There's been a lack of interest in this stock since it started to consolidate gains in early May. After a lengthy run that saw the stock gain 128 percent from March 2009 through 2011, it was definitely looking tired ahead of today's earnings report. It's made a series of lower highs and has repeatedly met with resistance (selling pressure) at its 10-week moving average. Recent price and volume trends say it's not likely Autozone will resume a leadership role anytime soon.The bulls will argue that a lot of bad news has been priced in already and it's only a matter of time before names like Autozone, Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:  ), O'Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:  ) and Monroe Muffler Brake (NYSE:  ) start to rally again. It's possible, but what's clear right now is that all four stocks have suffered much technical damage in recent months due to repeated bouts of institutional selling. Their charts will improve when institutional investors like mutual funds start buying again, but it's not clear it'll happen anytime soon. Technical damage like this usually takes a while to recover from.Stock chart: (c) 2012 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide .

The recovery rating on the term loan is '1,' which implies a higher (90% to 100%) expectation of recovery for creditors in the event of any default or bankruptcy.The issue-level rating on the company's existing senior secured term loan due 2013 is 'BB-' with a recovery rating of '1.' Meanwhile, the issue-level rating on Pep Boys' $200 million senior subordinated notes due 2014 is 'B' with a recovery rating of '3,' which indicates the agency's expectation for a meaningful recovery (50% to 70%).Overall, S&P ratings on the debt depict a \"vulnerable\" business risk profile and an \"aggressive\" financial risk profile of the company.

Many investors do not see it this way, as they tend to think of the dividend providing them their return. However, the stock market capitalizes earnings whether a company pays a dividend or not. Moreover, we contend that the market will value a given company's earnings based on their past and future prospects for growth, again, regardless of whether a dividend is paid or not.To clarify our point further, an investment in a common stock typically offers their shareholders two components of return. The first component is the capital appreciation component or the increase (or decrease) in the stock's value over time. The second component is the dividend, or lack thereof, that the company pays to shareholders in cash, typically once a quarter. The two added together equal the shareholders' total return. On the one side, we have the capital growth component and on the other side the income component.Now, here is the primary point behind this article. If you examine two companies with equivalent rates of earnings growth, where one pays a dividend and the other does not, the dividend payer will provide their shareholders a higher total return. In other words, we're suggesting that both stocks will provide equivalent capital appreciation when measured over a time period when the market is behaving rationally. We would define this as a time period when both stocks were being priced at fair value in the beginning and in the end. Consequently, the stock that pays a dividend to its shareholders is providing them a return bonus or kicker.What we are about to say next may come as heresy to the devout dividend growth investor. Nevertheless, the facts speak for themselves and we ask that they try to look at the total picture with an open mind, and eyes. In either case, dividend paying or not, the bulk, or majority, of total return will be provided by the capital appreciation component. This is why we are saying that dividends are a kicker or bonus return. In other words, capital appreciation is the cake and dividends (if any) are the icing.As a point of further clarification, this principle applies to the true dividend growth stock. We would define a true dividend growth stock as a company that has historically grown earnings at an above-average growth rate, and is expected to continue growing earnings at an above-average rate in the future. To clarify even further, low growth dividend paying stocks like utilities will often provide their shareholders the bulk of their returns through dividends. This is due to the low growth nature of their earnings which typically leads to subpar capital appreciation.(If you would like to test this last statement regarding utilities,  to Addendum To - Investing in Eastern Utility Stocks - Do Today's Valuations Make Sense, Part 4)To illustrate the validity of the thesis behind this article, we are going to once again rely on our graphs' earnings, price (and dividends) correlated research tool. This powerful \"tool to think with\" was designed to graphically, and therefore, instantaneously portray the important principles underlying the total return that shareholders can expect from a given common stock. More importantly, they were designed so that each of the two components of return, capital appreciation and dividend income, could be visually exposed independently and therefore, returns easily and quickly calculated.The total return component is driven by the market pricing a company according to its earnings achievements. Therefore, the orange earnings justified valuation line on each of the following graphs represents what we call the True Worth\u2122 or what others might call the intrinsic value of each sample company, again, based on the market capitalizing its  . Simply stated, when the black monthly closing price line touches the orange earnings line, fair value is present.Focusing on this earnings and price relationship will provide an instantaneous perspective of capital appreciation as long as fair value is present in the beginning and the end. All that the reader has to do is look immediately to the right of each graph to find the company's earnings growth rate listed and use it to easily estimate returns.Consequently, without any mathematical computation, the reader should understand that the capital appreciation component will precisely equal, or at least closely correlate, to the company's earnings growth. Therefore, when price starts on the orange line and is on the orange line at the end, whatever the earnings growth rate is, the capital appreciation will also be (within minor valuation adjustments).In order to demonstrate this as clearly as possible, we had to carefully pick historical time frames where earnings and price were correlated (the price touching the orange line) both at the beginning and at the end. Although we could not do this with absolute precision, as you will soon see we were able to accomplish it within reasonable margins of error.In other words, the price and earnings relationships we are showing are not perfect matches, but very close. However, in order to carry out this objective with the examples chosen, we had to draw some of our charts where we ended them through calendar year-end 2011 because valuation was in alignment at that time (thereby eliminating any 2012 data points). This was done in order to visually articulate the principle that we are hypothesizing.Interestingly enough, the dividend income component is also driven by and is a function of the company's earnings achievements. Even though dividends are paid out of earnings, we intend to demonstrate that the market eventually capitalizes the full measure of the company's earnings even though a portion has been paid out. Therefore, the dividend component becomes, as our thesis indicates, an extra or bonus piece of return.In order to depict this as vividly as possible, we chose to illustrate the full measure of each company's earnings (the green shaded area with the orange line on top) and then illustrate the dividend component separately. Therefore, we calculate the dividends paid out of earnings (light blue shaded area) and show them as additional return by stacking them on top of the green shaded earnings area on the graph (Note: The orange line represents the fair value of the company's earnings, while the green shaded area represents the total earnings). We believe this serves as a constant reminder that even though dividends come out of earnings, the capital appreciation component of the dividend paying stock is not reduced or diminished by the dividend.A quick word about ex-dividend dates are in order. Although it is true that a company's stock price will fall at precisely the level of its declared dividend, this is only relevant for that brief moment in time. In any other time during the quarter, and usually almost immediately following the ex-dividend date, the company's stock price will be once again capitalized based on its total earnings. In other words, over the majority of the time that a dividend paying stock trades, their shareholders' profits are not penalized by dividends. Therefore, and in truth, the dividend provides additional return above and beyond the company's earnings growth.Before we move on to presenting specific graphical evidence of our thesis that dividends are a bonus, a few qualifying remarks are in order. As previously alluded to, this article focuses on dividend growth stocks, which we define as dividend paying companies with above-average earnings growth. Therefore, we will be primarily presenting companies with above-average, to significantly above-average, historical total returns and earnings growth rates. It is from this class of dividend paying stock where the majority of return comes from growth of principle.On the other hand, even for low growth dividend paying stocks such as utilities, the capital appreciation component is often low because of the low growth rate of the company's earnings. (If you would like to test this last statement regarding low growth utilities, follow  Addendum To: Investing in Central Utility Stocks, Do Today's Valuations Make Sense, Part 3.)Furthermore, the dividend component is usually above-average with utility stocks, so cumulative total dividend returns may be equal to or even exceed capital appreciation. Nevertheless, the principle that dividends represent a bonus return remains valid.Our first set of examples compares two very fast growing businesses with one paying a dividend and the other not. Our nonpaying example is Hibbett Sports Inc. (  ), a sporting goods store operating predominately in the Southeast, Southwest, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions of the United States. As we can clearly see by the earnings and price correlated graphic below, the company's earnings growth rate (the orange line) has averaged over 19% for the years 1998 to 2011. But most importantly, we see that the market has priced the company in accordance with its earnings growth. Note the lack of a dividend as highlighted at the bottom of the graph (also no light blue shaded area on graph).Our dividend paying example, FactSet Research Systems Inc. (  ), combines integrated financial information, analytical applications, and client service to enhance the workflow and productivity of the global investment community. Their services are offered to Investment Managers, Hedge Funds, Investment Bankers, Wealth Managers, Pension Plans, Private Equity Groups, Government Agencies, Academics and numerous other members of the financial community.Just as we saw in our first example, the market has capitalized the full measure of FactSet Research Systems Inc's earnings just as it did for Hibbett Sports Inc. However, our attention is immediately drawn to the light blue shaded area or dividends. Since the company's price was close to the earnings line at the beginning and at the end, we can assume that capital appreciation should approximate the 20% plus earnings growth rate. But the key point behind this article is to note that dividends provide returns that are in addition to price appreciation as depicted by the light blue shaded area.Next let's examine the total return performance of each of our two samples. Our first example, Hibbett Sports Inc, grew earnings at 19% and therefore, generated capital appreciation at 18.2% that was a close approximation to its earnings growth rate of 19.3%. Note that there are no dividends or dividend cash flow table listed. This is another design feature of the F.A.S.T. Graphs\u2122 research tool.A $1000 investment made on December 31, 1997 would have purchased 230 shares of Hibbett Sports Inc. at $4.35 per share. By December 31, 2011 the price of the stock had appreciated approximately ten-fold to $45.18 per share. This turned a $1000 investment into $10,391.40 for a compounded annual rate of return of 18.2% per year, which again, was although just under but closely approximating the 19% earnings growth rate. Even without a dividend, Hibbett Sports Inc. generated shareholder returns that were significantly higher than the average company as measured by the S&P 500.Now, as we turn to our dividend paying example, FactSet Research Systems Inc., we discover a more complex performance record. We still discover that a $1000 investment on December 31, 1997 would have purchased 146 shares at a price of $6.83 per share. Then, just as we saw with our first example, the share price on December 31, 2011 grew to $87.28 per share. Thereby generating a capital appreciation component, that is more than twelve-fold larger than our original investment.Interestingly, our dividend paying, and therefore theoretically more conservative stock, actually grew faster notwithstanding the fact that it was paying dividends. This explains the greater capital appreciation component with FactSet Research Systems Inc. However, we further discover the dividend cash flow table which clearly illustrates the impact, and the additional rate of return, that shareholders received through dividends.With our next two examples we will look at a slightly shorter time frame covering the eight-year period calendar years 2004 through 2011. Once again, our sample companies in the time frames covered were specifically chosen because they clearly illustrate the reality behind our thesis that dividends represent a bonus return to shareholders. To repeat, if you have two companies with approximately the same rate of earnings growth that are purchased at fair value, and one pays a dividend, its shareholders will receive a bonus return over shareholders of the non-dividend paying or otherwise equivalent company.O'Reilly Automotive Inc. (  ) is a fast growth automotive aftermarket parts and tools retailer that grew earnings at a rate of 19.5% per annum between 2004 in 2011. Clearly, we see that the company's stock price has tracked its earnings growth, and anytime when the price moved above or below the earnings line it quickly returned. However, the important point is that the market capitalized the full measure of the company's earnings in the long run.Consequently, shareholders of O'Reilly Automotive Inc. enjoyed a return over this eight-year period of time that was virtually identical to the company's earnings growth rate. But since there were no dividends being paid, only the capital appreciation component applies.Our next example, McDonald's Corp. (  ), also enjoyed very fast earnings growth of 17.7% from 2004 to 2011. However, we see by the light blue shaded area on its graph that they also paid their shareholders a nice dividend. With this graph we can clearly see a visual example of how dividends represent an extra, or bonus, rate of return. The stock price very closely tracks and correlates to earnings with the price close to touching the orange line at the beginning and only slightly above the orange line at the end.Therefore, once again we see undeniable evidence that the full measure of McDonald's earnings are being priced by the marketplace. If dividends do not represent additional return, then it would logically follow that the normal PE ratio (the dark blue line) would be below the orange earnings line illustrating that the market did not price the portion of earnings that were paid in dividends. Instead, we see that both the orange earnings justified valuation line and the blue normal PE ratio line are almost perfectly coinciding.Now as we examine McDonald's performance, we find capital appreciation slightly exceeding earnings growth due to the very modest overvaluation at the end of the period. However, and most importantly, we see that dividends in this example contribute additional return.Just like we saw with O'Reilly Automotive above, McDonald's shareholders received the full value of their earnings growth from the marketplace. Furthermore, their dividend payments representing a portion of earnings paid out to shareholders, did not penalize the capital appreciation component of the stock. Instead, dividends made a meaningful and additional contribution to McDonald's Corp's exceptional total shareholder returns during this time period.Take away all the day-to-day noise associated with investing in stocks and the stock market and you will discover that in the long run fundamentals matter. In other words, inevitably shareholders of stock in a publicly traded company will be rewarded in direct proportion to how well the business performs on an operating basis. The better the business does, the better the shareholders will be rewarded.The primary measurement of business performance is profitability, otherwise known as earnings. It is earnings that the market ultimately prices a stock by, and it is from earnings that dividends are paid. However, it is our contention that the market does not price the stock according to their dividend policy, they price the stock according to their earnings power. Therefore, if and when a company does pay a dividend, it represents a nice bonus to total shareholder returns.When we review the earnings and price correlated graph on Hormel Foods Corp. (  ) below we see that the black monthly closing stock price line tracks the orange earnings justified valuation line. Furthermore, we also see that, in fact, the market has tended to more-often-than-not applied a premium valuation to this moderate growing blue-chip. With this iteration, dividends have been excluded from the analysis.With our next graphic we simply redraw the graph with dividends (the light blue shaded area) added. Remember, our first graph and this graph show the market applying a premium valuation. However, the difference here is that we see how dividends, when they are stacked on top of earnings, represent the additional return dividends provide the shareholders. As you look at this graph and the other dividend paying stocks included in this article, you should keep in the back of your mind that the light blue shaded area actually represents a cash payment to shareholders.Now as you examine the performance associated with the earnings and price correlated graph above, note that capital appreciation (closing annualized ROR) is almost identical to the company's earnings growth rate. Therefore, all of the company's earnings are being priced by the market, even those earnings that were paid out in dividends. However, we can also clearly see how the dividends represent the bonus this article has presented within its thesis.We have long held that investing in common stocks is all about investing in the underlying businesses. When looked at this way, it is only logical to place more of your focus and attention on the results of the companies you are invested in instead of worrying about day-to-day variations in its market price. Because, whether it is capital appreciation you are after, dividend income or both, they are all generated by the profits from the businesses.Regarding dividend paying stocks, it's great to get, as Will Rogers so eloquently once put it, a return of your capital as well as a return on your capital. The major object of this article was to point out that dividend paying stocks are capable of providing both a return of original capital invested and a return on your money. On the other hand, dividend paying stocks are fully capable of being great total return generators. From this perspective, we see the dividend as a nice quarterly bonus. But whether dividend paying or not, the principles of valuation must always be given careful consideration. I am long [[MCD]]. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

The decline was attributable to a 2.7% drop in store sales offsetting the favorable impact of the addition of 65 new stores during the past 12 months.The softness in the economy coupled with volatile gasoline prices are putting pressure on the company's performance. Weak economy and uncertainty in the market are leading to a decline in consumer spending on replacement parts. In addition, fluctuating gasoline prices are adversely affecting the miles driven, thus reducing vehicle parts sales.Advance Auto Parts faces tough competition from other national and regional automotive retailers including  (  ),  (  ), Pep Boys and CSK Auto Corporation. Moreover, complexity of vehicles makes it difficult for customers to perform DIY maintenance activities.

This is down from the peak of 248 million in 2008.I recently read a report called \"Transportation and the New Generation\" (TNG) by U.S. PIRG Education Fund and Frontier Group. The statistic that intrigued me the most was, \"According to the Federal Highway Administration, from 2000 to 2010, the share of 14- to 34-year-olds without a driver's license increased from 21 percent to 26 percent.\" How will this trend strain demand into 2015? Are there other trends which might provide clues to future demand for the automobile?I decided to take a look at industry statistics and demographics which may provide clues on the future demand of both auto parts and car and light truck sales.Comparison of car and light truck statistics 2005 vs. 2011\n  \nSource: R.L. Polk , Ward, FHA, NADA*2010The average age of car and light trucks on the road increased to 10.8 years, up 13.6% from its 2005 average. Separating the data, light trucks average age increase more sharply, up 19.5% from the 2005 average. Many light trucks are used for semi-commercial/small business purposes, as a result the average age increased more sharply. As this occurred many auto parts retailers stocks benefited from this change. Autozone and O'Reily Auto Parts are up 300% since 2005. Stocks of auto makers like GM, Ford and Chrysler all were hit badly in this period. Will this continue?\n  \nThe amount of registered vehicles was flat between 2005 and 2010 at 242 million. At the same time the population available to drive grew by 5.15% in the same period. The amount of licensed drivers grew less than the available-to-drive population at 4.48%. Since 2005, 15% of the available-to-drive population do not have driver's license. Who are they? Why did they choose not to get a driver's license? According to the report previously mentioned, they are the 14- to 34-year-old group.Are the Auto Parts Retailers near a market top?Although the amount of registered cars remained at 242 million since 2005, the Auto Parts retailers benefited from an increase in the average age of the car. The sweet spot of the auto parts retailer may soon be over as some demographic and cultural changes in driving and car ownership are appearing in the stats. As less of the newly able to drive choose not to get a license, the amount of cars that remain on the road will decline. The TNG report stated that some of the reasons are related to costs, living in cities, easier public transportation options, and more comprehensive driver exams. The report did not look at the elderly, the part of the population which is expected to grow the most in the next decade. This group is limited to purchases as they become physically unable to continue to drive.As the trend of 15- to 34-year-olds without a license continues, the current unlicensed 29- to 34-year-olds will be in the 35 to 69 age group by 2015, diminishing that group's demand for automobiles in the future. Now consider the large loss of drivers at the 70-or-higher age as that age group is expected to expand the greatest over the next five years.  With 300% or higher gains in AutoZone and O'Reily's Auto, I will give them a couple of more quarters until you see these demographic changes hit their earnings and stock prices.Read More: About GuruFocus: GuruFocus.com tracks the stocks picks and portfolio holdings of the world's best investors.

The stock is a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy).O'Reilly Automotive sells automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment and accessories. The company provides new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, including alternators, starters, fuel pumps, water pumps, brake system components, batteries, belts, hoses, temperature control and chassis parts. Its stores also offer auto body paint and related materials, automotive tools, and professional service provider service equipment. As of December 31, 2011, it operated 3,740 stores in 39 states. The company was founded in 1957 and is headquartered in Springfield, Missouri.O'Reilly Automotive topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in six of the last seven quarters. The average beat, including the quarter in line with expectations, of $0.07 translates to approximately 8.5% positive earnings surprise. The stock has moved higher by an average of about 2% following the earnings releases.The September 2011 quarter had the largest impact on share price. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.00 was beat by 10% or $0.10. This caused the stock to increase by more than 7% in the session following the earnings release. The quarter prior saw the company report earnings in line with expectations but was a little light on the topline. That top line miss helped push the stock lower by more than 4% in the session following that release.On April 23, 2012 O'Reilly Automotive reported revenue of $1.529 billion up from $1.382 billion reported in year ago quarter, an increase of 11%. Earnings per share came in at $1.14, $0.10 higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate for a positive earnings surprise of 9.6%. In the session following the earnings release, the stock traded higher by more than 8%.Estimates for O'Reilly Automotive have been rising of late. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2012 for O'Reilly Automotive stood at $4.38 as of January 2012. The consensus has since moved higher to $4.68. Over the same time period estimates for 2013 have moved from $5.01 to $5.37. The implied earnings growth rate of more than 14% is just what aggressive growth investors are seeking.O'Reilly Automotive trades slightly higher than the industry average for nearly every metric that aggressive growth investors tend to focus. The trailing twelve months PE of 23x is right in line with the industry average. The forward PE of 20x is slightly higher than the 17.7x industry average. The price to book multiple of 4.2x is higher than the 3x industry average, and the price to sales multiple carries a similar premium valuation.A quick look at the price and consensus chart shows a stock that has traced the consistent growth of the earnings estimates. This is the type of chart that aggressive growth investors love to see. The earnings estimates have guided the stock higher and the gaps between the earnings lines are the embodiment of the growth in earnings. The 2013 earnings estimate line should inspire investors as the line continues to move higher, which will likely help the stock higher in the future.

By most metrics, the recovery since mid-2009 is one of the weakest expansions in post-war economic history and tepid growth is likely to continue for the rest of the year.Not surprisingly, U.S. consumers, along with their counterparts in Eu\ufffdrope and other developed markets, are saving more and spending less - bad news for most retailers. Howev\ufffder, some consumer-focused compa\ufffdnies are actually benefiting from the new age of austerity.The weak housing market has severely hit investment in new home construction. The sil\ufffdver lining is that many consumers are instead remodeling and main\ufffdtaining existing properties.Foreclosed homes are typically in bad shape when they're acquired at auction from banks; new owners must upgrade and repair these prop\ufffderties to make them suitable for resale. Improvements and remodeling now account for more than 42 percent of all investment in retail hous\ufffding, up from about 21 percent at the height of the housing boom.The same principle is at work with automobiles. The U.S. new car mar\ufffdket currently stands at 13.7 million annualized vehicles, down from an average of about 18 million before the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009. Instead of splurging on a new car every few years, consumers are keep\ufffding their existing vehicles longer, pushing up the average age of U.S. cars. The need to repair and maintain older vehicles is powering demand for retailers of automobile parts and tools.One stock that stands to gain from cost-conscious consum\ufffder spending is  (  ). the largest automobile parts and accesso\ufffdries retailer in the U.S., with more than 4,600 domestic store locations and 300 in Mexico.The company sells products in three main categories: failure, maintenance and discretionary. Failure items include major mechanical parts in auto\ufffdmobiles and trucks that wear out over time such as air conditioning compres\ufffdsors, fuel pumps, fuses and lights.Maintenance items include non-discretionary products that must be replaced over time such as oil, wind\ufffdscreen washing fluid and transmission fluid, while discretionary items include waxes, floor mats and air fresheners.The first two categories of prod\ufffducts are direct beneficiaries of the current tendency of consumers to keep their cars longer. Cars that are older than seven years typically have more than 85,000 miles on the odometer and are no longer covered by warranty require more frequent and ex\ufffdpensive repairs.The number of cars in this age group has exploded since 2007, as sales of new cars have fallen sharply and the average age of U.S. cars reaches record levels (for more on the U.S. car market, see Perfect Storm for Palladium Could Bode Well for Stillwater).AutoZone has traditionally served a primarily DIY customer base. Sales to that group continue to perform well, but the do-it-for-me (DIFM) market that consists of professional mechanics has stronger growth prospects.Over the past 12 months, sales to DIFM customers totaled $1.2 billion, around 15 percent of the company's total revenue base, and they're grow\ufffding at a more than 21 percent pace year over year, compared to a total revenue growth rate of only 8 percent.One driver of that growth is Au\ufffdtoZone's roll-out of its commercial sales program across its retail loca\ufffdtions, allowing professional customers to buy parts on credit, with expanded online ordering and delivery.Management believes that AutoZone only has 2 percent market share in auto parts sales to professional buyers, suggesting there is plenty of upside.AutoZone shares were hit in late June after competitor O'Reilly Auto Parts (  ) lowered its quarterly comparable store sales guid\ufffdance, citing sales below expectations in June.However, this softening in sales partly stems from the extraordinarily warm winter of 2011 to 2012, which prompted customers to buy parts ear\ufffdlier in the year.

Let me first give you two shocking numbers:(1) The average age of the cars and trucks on U.S. roads hit a record 10.8 years as of July 1, 2011, as worries about job security kept many people from buying new vehicles.(2) According to Polk, there are 240 million light vehicles on U.S. roads. As less than 14 million new vehicles a year are being sold right now (and about 16.5 million a year in the pre-recession peak), average vehicle age is not declining anytime soon.In other developed countries, because of high taxes on cars and gasoline, which raise total ownership costs, cars owners tend to come from the more affluent segment of the society. In the US, a car is often a necessity and most cars are driven by poor people as a means to get to work. Therefore, it is reasonable for us to expect that:(1) They are less likely to purchase a new vehicle in this poor economy. They will hold onto their clunkers and drive on.(2) They have to maintain their cars and fix them when they break down, otherwise they would not be able to get to work.(3) Short in cash, people are more likely to DIY than going to a full-service garage shop.Who's going to benefit from this trend?I would say the job is cut out for DIY auto shops such as AutoZone (  ) and Advanced Auto Parts (  ).In fact, the sweet spot for the industry is vehicles 4 to 12 years old, that is, too old to be covered by an original warranty but too young to be sent to the scrap yard. If you happen to own a 7-year-old car, they see dollar signs all over you.But wait, there's more. I see two near-term catalysts, and two medium-term potential bonus points.First let me serve you two recent catalysts:(1) Potential buyout targetOn Monday (1/30/2012), full service auto repair shop Pep Boys agreed to sell itself to the Gores Group, that values the company's stock at about $804 million, a 24% premium to Friday's closing price.The event can draw investors' attention to this sector, and as they scrutinize the sector they may start to realize that Autozone would provide an even better value in this poor economy, because consumers may switch from full service shops such as Pep Boys to DIY shops such as AutoZone in order to save money.Both AutoZone and Pep Boys count hedge funds as their largest shareholders, and hedge funds are certainly more open to buyout offers. Basically, the Pep Boys buyout is going to bring attention to a company that would love to see more attention from higher bidders.(2) Motivated sellersAutoZone's largest owner, Edward Lampert (through ESL Investments,which also is the largest owner of the beleaguered retailer Sears Holdings) has almost cut his stake by half in recent months. He didn't sell much in the open market. Instead,  in the closing of one of his investment partnerships and the restructuring of another, as well as to meet year-end redemptions from his main fund, ESL Investments.Understandably, some of these clients may decide to liquidate the shares they received simply because they don't like to personally manage a stock portfolio. Normally, when we buy a stock, we always have to worry whether the seller knows something negative that we are not aware of, otherwise \"why would he sell to me?\"In this case, we know that some of the recent selling pressure comes from \"motivated sellers\" who do not necessarily have negative views on the company, and we expect that over time the pressure is going to subside. In other words, we feel less suspicious when buying a house from a \"motivated seller\" who's moving to a different city for work than from someone who's moving to a similar house just two blocks away.Finally, there are two medium-term bonus points that we can hope for but can't count on:(1) Decline in gasoline price: People drive more miles when gasoline is cheaper, and more mileages driven lead to increased demand for maintenance and replacement parts. Incidentally, AutoZone can also double as a hedge for those investors with long exposures to the energy sector.(2) Strengthening US Dollar: If the economic situation in Europe continues to worsen, investors may increasingly place a premium on businesses with less foreign exposures. AutoZone is mostly a domestic operation, with only a small presence in Mexico, and therefore may look attractive to those flight-to-safety investors searching for counter-cyclical assets at home.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) has been awarded a 'BBB' rating by Fitch Ratings for the issue of $500 million 3.7% notes due 2022.The company will utilize the proceeds from the offering in repaying commercial paper. AutoZone had total debt of $3.5 billion as of February 11, 2012.The rating underscores the company's leading position in the retail auto parts and accessories aftermarket. It also reflects the company's strong operating performance, credit profile and aggressive share repurchases.In March 2012, AutoZone announced the repurchase of $750 million of the company's common stock in connection with its ongoing share repurchase program which was initiated in 1998.During second-quarter 2012, the company repurchased 501,000 shares of its common stock for $173 million, with an average price of $345. At the end of the quarter, the company had $486 million remaining under its current share repurchase authorization.AutoZone is a leading retailer and distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories with stores in the U.S. and Mexico.

They beat EPS estimates last quarter and improved margins throughout 2011. New car sales are improving, but consumers are still finding value in their used vehicles and doing minor repairs themselves. The DIY movement across the US seems to be getting stronger as well.But O'Reilly doesn't just cater to individuals; they deliver parts to local shops around the country quickly, efficiently and at competitive prices, which is a large part of their business.The question is: can ORLY maintain this momentum into 2012?Company Description & DevelopmentsO'Reilly is an automotive parts company founded in 1957 which from humble beginnings has grown to 3,613 stores around the country with over 47,000 employees. 100% of their business is focused in 39 states across the US. They are looking to grab market share by rapidly expanding into new locations; opening 170 new stores in 2011 with 180 new sites planned for 2012.During their past report the company painted a bright picture for 2012, which added fuel to the fire burning in their high performance stock appreciation engine. In the coming year we should expect to see management focused on brand strength, efficiency and expansion.They also plan on increasing media reach with an advertising plan that includes the introduction of television along with print, a strong radio advertising schedule and the continued involvement in sports and motorsports sponsorships.Financial Profile & EarningsO'Reilly is a mid-cap ($10.68 billion) company that is trading at about 21 times trailing earnings (P/E). Looking forward, Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for that number to drop closer to 18 with no change in price over the next year. O'Reilly became a Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buy on Valentine's Day.The parts company reported a quarterly sales decrease of 9% at their last earnings report. Annual sales were still up 7% compared to 2010 with total sales of roughly $5.78 billion in FY2011. ORLY earnings rose from $2.95 per share in FY2010 to $3.71 in FY2011. O'Reilly is expected to earn $4.49 per share in FY2012 according to the Zacks Consensus Estimate.For the quarter, sales increased $81 million, comprised of a $43 million increase in comp store sales, a $38 million increase in non-comp store sales, a $2 million increase in non-comp non-store sales and a $2 million decrease from closed stores compared to 2010.For the year, ticket (receipt) average drove the increase as DIY ticket count was under pressure for much of the year. They believe the increase in ticket average was the result of professional sales growing faster than DIY sales and product mix tending towards hard parts, both of which carry a higher ticket average.Moving ForwardO'Reilly's sales guidance for 2012 is $6.15 billion to $6.25 billion. With comparable store sales growth guidance at 3% to 6%, the bulk of which is coming from strong growth in the professional side of the business, especially in the acquired markets. They see DIY growth a little slower this year.For the first quarter, they see diluted earnings per share coming in between $0.99 to $1.03. For the full year, diluted EPS guidance is $4.27 to $4.37 per share.O'Reilly also saw free cash flow improve 134% to $791 million for 2011 with anticipation of $600 to $650 million in 2012.To date, O'Reilly has bought back 16 million shares with an average price of $61.63. In 2012, the company intends to continue executing their programs with $362 million of cash on the balance sheet as well as additional free cash flow generated during the year.Market Performance & TechnicalsThe word momentum may be the only way to describe O'Reilly's stock for the better part of the past year. Since early August the stock has risen about 50% and has remained above its 50- and 200-day moving averages for the majority of that move, indicating a fairly constant and strong trend.Like most of the market, ORLY is consolidating just under its 52-week high of $85.32. Even yesterday's lackluster retail data couldn't hold the stock down, but a market reversal would most certainly influence its bullish momentum. As a consumer-driven stock, we need to continue to see growth or at the very least stability in economic data.ORLY has exceeded the S&P 500's performance by over 43% in the past year, but has fallen about 3% short of its bullish moves over the past 3 months.Jared A Levy is the Momentum Stock Strategist for Zacks.com.

But some of the stocks that are moving lower and actually becoming more oversold may be where attention is truly merited.As a growing number of active investors are coming to realize, the stocks pulling back today are typically the stocks that are making the new, short-term highs if not tomorrow, then often within the next week. This is why so many professionals spend more time studying the stocks that others are discarding, rather than the stocks that already have been bid into  status.This doesn't mean traders need to forage around in the scrap heap for stocks, either. A stock like  (  ) that is pulling back by more than 2% ahead of trading on Wednesday after rallying to 52-weeks highs is the kind of stock that has historically attracted buyers as it has moved lower and become oversold. Consider how the stock traded during its last stretch through oversold territory in mid-November, rallying for five days in a row for a gain of almost 5%.The pullback of more than 2% in ORLY has sent the stock into technically oversold territory, as well as to 10-day closing lows ahead of trading on Wednesday. The stock has a short-term, positive edge of more than 1% and a 7 out of 10 rating that puts ORLY at the higher end of neutral.Another example of profit-taking after rallying to significant, new highs is the two-day pullback in  (  ).SBUX pulled back by more than 1% on Tuesday, taking the stock from overbought territory to near oversold territory in just two days. In fact, if the stock continues to sell-off, it will almost certainly trade  before the end of the week.Starbucks has a neutral rating and a small positive edge of just under half a percent as of Tuesday's close.It took me a visit to a Walmart in Tucson to finally show me why retailers like  (  ) were so successful. Pulling back after rallying to new, 52-week highs in the closing days of 2011, shares of DLTR have closed lower for three out of the past four trading days, and are nearing technically oversold levels above the 200-day moving average.DLTR has been rangebound for nearly a month and a new,  in the stock would likely represent a break in that weeks-long consolidation pattern.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["hen stocks are trading at 52-week highs, there are often only two prudent actions to take if you are a short-term trader: locking in gains or wishing you had gains to lock in.What is not the most sensible act, however, is the one that is the most tempting - namely, to chase these already high-flying stocks even higher, hoping that there will be someone even more desperate than you are to buy into the market a few days or weeks from now.Regardless of time scale, new highs bring attention. They are typically viewed as a sign of market strength, even by short-term traders who have been burned in the past buying stocks just as they rally to new highs, only to have sellers swoop in, taking profits, selling shares short, and otherwise reversing the gains that seemed to be there for the taking when momentum was surging.The stocks in today's report are all trading near long-term highs and have just begun to experience profit-taking as traders and investors lock in gains. And while none of these stocks are yet in  territory on a technical basis, haven't reached significant, new lows and have not traded lower for multiple sessions, they are the kind of stocks that traders and active investors should keep on their watch lists should currently modest profit-taking grow into major panic selling.Shares of  (  ) rallied new, 52-week highs this week, gaining ground for seven out of eight trading days heading into Friday's session. Traders were aggressive to take profits in the stock, sending ORLY lower by nearly 3%. The selling in ORLY has produced a short-term edge of more than three quarters of a percent, which likely will increase if sellers remain on the offensive when trading resumes on Monday.Also pulling back from new, 52-week highs heading into the weekend were shares of  (  ). The stock pulled back by well over 2% on Friday after closing higher for three days in a row, the last in technically overbought territory above the 200-day moving average.

DLTR sold off by more than 1% on Friday, pulling back from new, 52-week highs and a pair of closes in technically overbought territory.

In absolute terms, profit increased 11% to $191.1 million from $172.1 million a year ago.The increase in profit was driven by a 7.4% rise in net sales to $1.92 billion, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.90 billion. Domestic same-store sales (for stores open at least one year), increased 4.6% during the quarter compared with 9.5% a year ago.Gross margin was 51.1% versus 50.7% in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The higher gross margin was attributable to lower distribution costs due to an increase in sales, lower shrink expense and modestly higher merchandise margins.Operating margin increased to 17.7% compared with 17.1% in the prior-year quarter, driven by an improvement in operating expenses (as a percentage of sales) to 33.4% from 33.6% a year ago based on lower incentive compensation, favorable legal expense and leverage from higher sales volumes, which was partially offset by higher self insurance costs.During the quarter, AutoZone opened 17 stores in the U.S. and 2 stores in Mexico.

With the new subsidiary, the company seeks to capitalize on the growing opportunities and will likely have a huge scope of creating brand awareness across the country, thus driving profitability going forward.AutoZone is one of the nation's leading specialty retailers of automotive replacement parts and accessories, operating in the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) retail, Do-It-for-Me (DIFM) commercial and other customer markets. Sales in DIY retail represent about 85% of the company's revenue, DIFM commercial sales accounts for 10% while the remaining 5% comes from other sales.AutoZone sells the ALLDATA brand automotive diagnostic and repair software, online as well as on DVD, which offers comprehensive factory-correct repair information to DIY customers and offers ALLDATA repair subscription. The company also sells in-house brands of automotive batteries such as Duralast, Duralast Gold and Valuecraft, manufactured by the U.S. automotive parts producer Johnson Controls.During the most recent quarter, AutoZone posted a profit of $7.18 per share versus $5.66 per share in the year-ago quarter. Net sales grew 8.1% to $2.64 billion and domestic same-store sales (sales for stores open at least one year) rose 4.5% during the quarter.AutoZone currently focuses on expanding its Hub store, acceleration of store maintenance and strengthening of its commercial sales force.

Numerous reports on the negotiations suggest that the Republicans have been able to force their budget cutting agenda in lieu of a compromise between the GOP and the Democrat White House.Budget cuts without additional, costly fiscal stimuli could possibly slow the already sluggish American economy and hinder job creation. Prevalent economic theory equates increased government spending with economic stimulus, and decreased spending with economic contraction.Michael Schuman of  believes the debt deal could have a significant effect on the global economy. He foresees two possible scenarios: a negative economic outcome from the budget cuts, and a positive economic outcome from reformed and improved government finances.The negative economic outcome would come in the case of a slogging American economy. A slower American economy would mean less demand for goods and services worldwide. This would hurt export-oriented economies, including China and a number of developing countries.The debt deal has also left out many of the details of the specific budget cuts. This uncertainty could make global investors uncomfortable. Schuman argues that budget cuts to defense spending could change the makeup of the global security, with significant consequences on countries like Taiwan and Japan that heavily rely on the US for military protection.Schuman is also concerned that the \u201cirresponsible brinksmanship and childish squabbling made American political leaders look more like The Real Housewives of New Jersey than the leaders of the free world,\u201d which would make global investors re-evaluate the stability of the American economy.Schuman concedes that there is a chance that global investors will appreciate the fiscal reforms. Indeed, an American economy that relies much less heavily on debt could be a much more attractive and stable investment environment than its current incarnation.What do stock investors think of these trends?

The S&P 500 has shed nearly -8% since during the past week. A correction can be quite healthy in the context of a long-term bull market , but if the selling continues for a few more sessions, it could really feed on itself and set the stage for an extended downward move. For now, many are still speaking of this as a buying opportunity.------------------------------------A number of specific stocks have really taken a bath this month, with some down -20% or even -30%. Any companies reporting good news right now can get lost in the shuffle. is a fine example. The urban-focused retailer has been a solid growth story in recent years, and should have pushed through to a 52-week high when it reported stellar quarterly results on Wednesday morning. Per share profits rose sharply, nearly +30% ahead of analysts' forecasts, but shares fell nearly -10% on Wednesday anyway in the face of broader market selling.Investors are correcting that mistake, pushing shares up more than +6% on Thursday, even as the broader market continues to slump. And with good reason. For starters, earnings estimates are likely to rise by a good margin , with 2011 EPS forecasts approaching $2.50. Shares trade for just 13 times that view, even though profits are growing at three times that rate. In addition, CitiTrends has ample long-term growth opportunities. The retailer has yet to enter many key urban markets, most notably in the Northeast. Combined with rising traffic at existing stores, top-line results can continue to grow in excess of +15% for several years to come, and bottom-line results at an even faster clip. As the market stabilizes, shares should start to move beyond the 52-week high of $37, and perhaps past the $40 mark. This implies gains of at least +25% in the near-term, and perhaps much more in the long-term as this retailer steadily expands its footprint.------------------------------------We're seeing positive quarterly results today from  ,  ,  ,  and  . Yet a clear divergence in the sector has emerged: Sales trends have been fairly positive, but the  , an exchange-traded fund (  ) we mentioned yesterday, is off another -2% on Thursday and is now down more than -10% since late April.There may be a correlation. As the market weakens, it could begin to impact consumer spending. After all, the remarkable rebound in the value of many retirement plans surely led many consumers to re-open their pocket books.Shares of Perry Ellis create a particular conundrum. The retailer posted very impressive quarterly results Thursday morning and boosted guidance, which is pushing shares up in an otherwise down market. Yet the company's key demographic is precisely the type of customer that is likely seeing some of his portfolio diminish in value in this market pullback. Then again, if the market weakness proves to be ephemeral, the positive sales and profit momentum is likely quite sustainable. Shares are certainly inexpensive at about 14 to 15 times expected earnings for the current year. There may be other retailers more leveraged to an eventual downturn in unemployment, but shares of Perry Ellis possess nice blend of growth and value. Today's positive action in the stock is likely to continue, unless the market slumps even further.------------------------------------As Americans hold on to their cars longer, demand for auto repairs and parts continues to climb. The major auto parts chains have posted above-average growth for several years now, and the trend continues.  rang up impressive quarterly results Wednesday after the market close, and boosted full-year guidance. That was good for a +7% gain in shares in Thursday trading.But the positive industry trends may be close to ending. Auto sales are beginning to rebound, and if unemployment drops, many aging cars may once again be scrapped rather than nursed beyond their normal usable life. The entire auto parts sector is near saturation thanks to never-ending expansion plans from the likes of Advance Auto,  ,  and  . The group generally trades for 18 to 20 times trailing earnings, with shares of Auto Zone a bit cheaper, and shares of Pep Boys being unjustifiably expensive on a trailing earnings basis. Despite the impressive results from Advanced Auto, the entire sector does not represent robust growth opportunities. Better opportunities lie elsewhere.Disclosure: Neither David Sterman nor StreetAuthority, LLC hold\npositions in any securities mentioned in this article.-- David StermanContributorStreetAuthorityDisclosure: David Sterman does not own shares of any security mentioned in this article.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (NASDAQ:  ) is one of the largest specialty retailers for aftermarket parts, automotive tools and professional service equipment in the U.S. The company has more than 3,400 locations throughout 38 states as well as a lucrative online store.The company caters to both do-it-yourself customers and professional installers, selling everything from new and remanufactured auto parts (such as alternators and fuel pumps), maintenance items (oil and antifreeze), accessories (floor mats and seat covers) and auto body paint.

The shares then recovered and ended the session down 0.42 percent at $55.02.The stock fell hard on Feb. 17 after management issued weak guidance for the fiscal first quarter, but shares are apparently attempting to hold support at their 200-day moving average (purple line on chart at right). Traders often look to such levels when selling puts.The put sale let the investor collect premium in return for agreeing to buy ORLY at the strike price if it falls below that level. The strategy is a common substitute for buying shares. (See our Education section)The transaction pushed overall option volume in the name to 27 times greater than average in yesterday's session.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) expects to release its first quarter 2012, ended November 19, 2011, on December 06, 2011 before the opening bell. Memphis, Tennessee-based AutoZone earned a profit of $7.18 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimates of $6.98 per share.For the upcoming quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AutoZone is pegged at $4.45 per share, reflecting an annualized growth of 18%. There is no upside potential for the estimate.With respect to earnings surprises, the company outdid the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters. This is reflected in the average earnings surprise of 6.39%, implying that the company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the four quarters.Net sales grew 8.1% to $2.64 billion, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.61 billion. Domestic same-store sales (sales for stores open at least one year) rose 4.5% during the quarter.Gross margin was 51.2% compared with 50.5% in the year-ago quarter. The increase in gross margin was attributable to lower shrink expense and higher merchandise margins. The increase in merchandise margins was driven by retail price increases on commodity-based products, which were partially offset by higher commercial sales.Operating profit rose 11% to $524.0 million from $472.7 million in the prior year. This translated into an operating margin of 19.8% versus 19.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010.Operating expenses, as a percentage of sales, increased to 31.4% from 31.2% last year due to higher self-insurance costs and higher fuel costs, partially offset by leverage due to higher sales volumes.During the quarter, AutoZone opened 68 new stores, replaced five stores, and closed one store in the U.S. and opened 18 new stores in Mexico. As of August 27, 2011, the company had 4,534 stores in 48 states, as well as in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico in the U.S. and 279 stores in Mexico.Earnings estimate for the first quarter of fiscal 2011 is currently pegged at a profit of $4.45 per share. The improving auto industry and the strong performance of the company in the last reported quarter have made the analysts optimistic about its future financial results.Out of the 18 analysts covering the stock for the first quarter of fiscal 2011, none revised the estimates in the past 30 days.Following the fourth quarter earnings release in September, first quarter 2012 profit per share was projected at $4.35. However, over the last 60 days, the profit estimate increased to $4.44 cents per share. Later, the estimate went up to $4.45 per share in the last 30 days and remained the same since then.AutoZone is focused on expansion of its Hub store, acceleration of store maintenance and strengthening of its commercial sales force. Besides, its aggressive share repurchase policy supported by a strong cash flow is also mention worthy.However, AutoZone relies heavily on its private label brands, which could hinder its business should they falter. Vendor consolidation and appreciation in gas prices coupled with fierce competition from  (  ) and  (  ), both of which have delivered impressive results during their last reported quarters, are primary headwinds for the company.Hence, we have reiterated our long-term Neutral recommendation on the shares of the company. ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."]], "Title": ["Why Shares of O'Reilly Automotive, AutoZone, and LKQ Surged in April", ["Why Advance Auto Parts Stock Soared in May"], ["Why Advance Auto Parts Stock Soared in May"], ["Validea's Top Five Consumer Cyclical Stocks Based On Warren Buffett - 4/26/2020"], ["O'Reilly Automotive Reaches Analyst Target Price"], ["5 Investment Trends to Profit From a Post-Coronavirus World"], ["Why This Key Indicator Bodes Well for O\u2019Reilly Automotive"], ["Validea's Top Five Consumer Cyclical Stocks Based On Warren Buffett - 5/31/2020"], ["3 Automotive Stocks That Could Snap Back After Coronavirus"], ["O'Reilly Automotive Q1 20 Earnings Conference Call At 11:00 AM ET "], ["O'Reilly Automotive Withdraws Full-year Guidance - Quick Facts "], ["O`Reilly Automotive Inc.
