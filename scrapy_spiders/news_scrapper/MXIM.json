Yet, since then, MCHP stock has bounced back to prior price levels, partially due to the stock market\u2019s rapid reversal and also thanks to the company\u2019s recent guidance boost.Source: \u00a9iStock.com/MADDRAT\n\t\nHowever, is there still value left on the table? That\u2019s the question for those who bought at lower prices, as well as those looking at the stock today.The recent guidance raise could indicate that shares rally even higher from here. Yet, with investors pricing in a recovery, shares may pull back some more if results don\u2019t line up with expectations.Yet, there are other positives to consider. Valuation remains low, leaving room for multiple expansion. Also, \u201cmegatrend\u201d exposure could also boost the stock. Granted, there\u2019s still some uncertainty. But, relative to other opportunities out there, MCHP stock may be a solid buy for cautious investors.Let\u2019s dive in, and see why that\u2019s the case.Shares have bounced back tremendously off their lows set in March. But it\u2019s recent news that pushed the stock back to prior price levels.On June 3, the company  for this quarter (ending June 30). With global manufacturing in recovery mode, this makes perfect sense. As factories worldwide reopen, expect increased demand for the company\u2019s integrated circuits.Following the news, investors bid up shares to their 52-week high ($113.28). However, in recent days, the stock has pulled back to around $100 per share.Even with the recent positive developments, the analyst community remains mixed on the company\u2019s prospects.Some analysts, like  Craig Ellis, upgraded the stock and boosted their price targets. However, . The main concern is whether demand has truly improved. It\u2019s possible recent strong results will cool once manufacturing normalizes.In other words, if manufacturing doesn\u2019t see a V-shaped recovery, results could disappoint and send shares to lower levels.However, the stock has plenty of runway if results meet or beat expectations.  for this quarter\u2019s earnings is around $1.39 per share. If the company can beat on earnings like it did last quarter, MCHP stock could move higher. In short, the recent pullback may be a strong buying opportunity.What\u2019s also at play with Microchip Technology? Selling at a discount to peers, shares could move higher thanks to multiple expansion. Also, the company\u2019s exposure to automotive technology \u201cmegatrends\u201d is another solid reason to buy shares now.In a June 8 article, InvestorPlace\u2019s Mark Hake included MCHP stock as  that could move higher. And looking at forward price-earnings (P/E) ratios, I agree it\u2019s possible.Right now, Microchip Technology shares trade for a forward P/E of 18.4. That\u2019s far below where peers like  (NASDAQ:) and  (NASDAQ:) trade. These rivals have forward P/E ratios of 27.9 and 28.9, respectively.In short, multiple expansion could happen. Add in the potential for the company to continue beating projections, and it seems likely this stock can catch up valuation-wise to its peers. Perhaps MCHP stock won\u2019t won\u2019t bridge the gap completely, but at least enough to move the needle.Also, shares have another potential mover in motion. That would be increased chip demand thanks to key automotive \u201cmegatrends.\u201d As seen in a recent investor presentation,  to automated vehicles, increased connectivity and the pivot to electric vehicles.As cars and trucks become more tech than machinery, MCHP stock stands to benefit. Sure, the automotive end market only makes up 15% of current sales. But, this technological shift could boost demand from this end user market, helping to support long-term growth.Right now, it\u2019s hard to find reasonably priced stocks with upside. With Wall Street banking on a V-shaped recovery, optimism has been more than priced into the market. However, with names like this one, there\u2019s still strong buys out there for cautious investors.With two factors \u2013 valuation and \u201cmegatrend\u201d exposure \u2013 that could help move the needle, this may be a buy-the-dip type of situation.In short, consider the recent pullback a solid entry point to buy MCHP stock.Thomas Niel, contributor to InvestorPlace, has written single-stock analysis since 2016.

But their peers have much higher P/E ratios.

It is a large semiconductor product designer and manufacturer based in the U.S. The company makes advanced microcontrollers and microprocessors, as well as memory and flash DRAM products.Its earnings have waned as a result of the novel coronavirus, which has lowered demand. However, now that global restrictions are being lifted, the company expects a significant pickup in orders worldwide.Moreover, its move into selling products for data centers as well as curtailing manufacturing to line up with demand should increase profits.Three of its peers have significantly higher valuations, despite similar industry conditions. Therefore, I suspect the company is worth significantly more than its present price.For example, right now Microchip Technology trades with a forward price-earnings ratio of 20.1 times. This is well below its peers such as  (NASDAQ:), with its forward P/E ratio of 28.6 times. In addition,  (NASDAQ:) has a forward ratio of 27.1 times, and  (NASDAQ:) has a 50.5 times ratio.Using these peer ratios with Microchip Technology\u2019s March 2021 expected earnings of $5.73 per share gives MCHP stock a target price of $170.43.

Last year, it was over $635 million, and for the last 12 months to March 31, FCF rose to $685 million.Based on the GDDY stock $13.1 billion market value, the FCF yield is very high at over 5%.I like this stock for one simple reason. It is an arbitrage play on the valuations of some of its peers. For example, GDDY stock has a forward P/E of just 17.2 times expected earnings. But some of its peers have massively higher valuations.For example,  (NASDAQ:) has a forward P/E of 215.5 times.  (NYSE:) is at 186 times and  (NYSE:) is at 229 times.The average of these three forward P/E ratios is 210.2 times. I decided to discount these by 75%. The target P/E in my valuation is roughly 54.6 times.Even with that significantly lower P/E valuation, my target price for GDDY stock is $250. That implies potential upside of over 218% from its present price.Source: Mark R.

Recently, it decided to institute a restructuring plan, which may reduce its operating profits in the short term.Nevertheless, its free cash flow in the last 12 months was very respectable. The company generated $904.1 million in cash flow from operations and spent just $68.4 million.That means it generated $835.7 million in FCF. Given its $11.7 billion market value, its FCF yield is very attractive at over 7%Using the same peer valuation method I used in the other stocks above, the average P/E ratio for OTEX stock should be 44.5 times earnings. However, the stock trades for just 14 times its forward earnings.Using a 50% discount factor, I set the price target at 22 times earnings. This means the stock is worth at least $68.06 per share. That represents a very respectable potential upside of 58% for OTEX stock.Source: Mark R.

The company is extremely profitable.For example, in the last 12 months ending March, it generated $114.2 million in CFFO. FCF in the last 12 months was $99.4 million. Moreover, some of the companies in this employment industry space are highly valued.Based on the relative P/E valuations of some of its peers, the company should be trading at a forward P/E multiple of over 60 times. However, CSOD stock trades for just 18.5 times its forward expected earnings for the year ending December 2021.I applied a 50% discount figure to that and derived a target price of $68.54 per share. This helps provide a margin of safety for the stock valuation. It also takes into account other factors. For example, this discount accounts for the fact that some of its higher-valued peers do not make money in employee software like Cornerstone.Nevertheless, this price target represents a potential gain of over 64% for investors in CSOD stock.Source: Mark R.

Here is why I think the AEYE stock is now worth looking at. Recently management indicated in its March earnings press release that .Moreover, the company produces consistent and recurring revenues. In fact, AudioEye regularly gives guidance on its monthly recurring revenues (MRR). Even more importantly, AudioEye is at the inflection point where operating leverage provides huge profit growth. Marginal increases in revenue, after variable expenses, go straight to profits as its overhead is covered by existing cash flow.Based on this, I estimate that earnings for the year ending 2021 will be at least 50 cents per share, if not higher.That puts AEYE stock on a forward P/E of just 19 times. For a company with this type of fast-growing revenue and recurring earnings, I deem it is worth at least 25 times earnings for 2021.

Now I'll turn the call over to Tun\u00e7.  -- Thank you, Kathy. Good afternoon to all our participants. We hope that you're safeguarding your health during the current global crisis. We appreciate you joining us today and your interest in Maxim Integrated.Let me first summarize last quarter's results. The March quarter progressed largely as we had expected, apart from the last two weeks of the quarter. Given the growing concerns about COVID-19, we took precautionary measures to protect employees and work with social distancing mandates of governments. These measures impacted our manufacturing test operations in the Philippines.However, due to solid execution by the global Maxim team, our March quarter financial results were within the range of our guidance. We have a flexible supply chain that is geographically diverse and the global pandemic has a varying impact depending on location. Our supply chain footprint in wafer fabs, both internal and at our foundry partners, is currently operational without disruptions. In assembly, we have flexibility in our supplier network to work through staffing-related capacity constraints.Our Thailand test operations are currently able to continue at full capacity. However, our Philippine test operations are impacted by social-distancing measures. In the June quarter, we expect our test operations in the Philippines will run at approximately 70% of normal run rate. Additionally, we are expediting product shipments for our medical customers to fight the pandemic, and this has been factored into our test planning.Our internal and external manufacturing teams are doing great work in optimizing Maxim's operations during the crisis. Let me turn to our fiscal Q3 and Q4 market overview. Please note that our June quarter commentary by end market includes the effect of our Philippine test constraint on revenue shipments. I will start with automotive.In the March quarter, our automotive business was up 5% sequentially, with growth across all of our automotive applications, including infotainment, auto body electronics, BMS and driver assistance systems. Due to the impact of COVID-19, we expect that June quarter automotive demand will soften. Our automotive customers have been significantly impacted by shelter-in-place mandates around the world, and many customers have temporarily stopped producing cars. We continue to believe in the content growth opportunities in this market and continue to invest in power management, ADAS, and BMS for electric vehicles in anticipation of the return of growth from these content-rich applications.Due to COVID-19 OEM factory closures resulting in lower demand, and given our test constraints, we anticipate our automotive business will be strongly down with a greater than 20% decline sequentially. We expect declines in all of our automotive markets with the lowest impact in our BMS business due to the resumption of demand at Chinese OEMS. Let me next turn to the Industrial market. In the March quarter, Industrial was flat from the prior quarter.We saw modest broad-based declines, which were offset by an uptick in automatic test equipment. Days of inventory in the channel remained similar to the prior quarter and were well below our target of 60 days. The COVID-19 related test operations disruption caused the sharp decline in shipments to distributors during the last two weeks of the quarter. As a result, we were not able to replenish channel inventory at the rate previously forecasted.Brian will provide more detail on our distribution business right after me. In the June quarter, we expect Industrial to be up sequentially, primarily driven by expedited medical products to help our customers meet a surge in demand. Industrial is expected to be up from the same quarter last year. Once again, we have the impact of our test constraints weighing on our guidance.Otherwise, stronger growth could be achieved. Let me next discuss communications and data center. In the March quarter, comms and data center was up 3% sequentially. We experienced strong growth in demand for 25G optical products for base stations and 100G optical products for data center applications.The ramp in optical products was partially offset by weakness in notebook computers and peripherals. Our laser driver products are being rapidly deployed at hyperscale data centers and 5G base station uplinks. Our products enable these links to move more data, while staying within limited power budgets. Our optical business should benefit in future quarters as employees around the world adjust to remote work.We are starting to ramp shipments of new design wins in server power for a leading hyperscale data center customer. We expect this ramp to be a tailwind for the business in future quarters. In the June quarter, we anticipate comms and data center revenue to be up from the prior quarter, primarily driven by increased demand for server power and optical products for hyperscale data centers. Comms and data center is expected to be strongly up from the same quarter last year.We expect power and optical for data center and 4 and 5G base station applications to contribute to strong year-on-year growth. Finally, let me turn to consumer. In the March quarter, consumer was down 5% sequentially with an uptick in smartphone-related shipments, more than offset by seasonal declines in other consumer electronics. In the June quarter, we expect the consumer market to be very soft due to the COVID-19 epidemic impact on consumer spending and lower smartphone content.Consumer is expected to be strongly down greater than 20% sequentially. I would like to recognize Maxim's hard-working employees at our wafer fab and test manufacturing sites, our supply chain partner and our global employees who are remaining productive as they work from their homes. I'm very proud of the resilience of this company as shown by our ability to navigate these unprecedented times. We remain highly profitable due to our well-diversified business model and outstanding product portfolio.We are maintaining our focus on long-lived, high-performance analog and mixed-signal products which will deliver value to our customers and drive sustainable growth for Maxim in the long term. Now I'll turn the call over to Brian. -- Thanks, Tun\u00e7. I hope that all of you listening are staying safe, and thank you for joining the call today. As Tun\u00e7 mentioned, we are working diligently to prioritize the safety of our employees, while ensuring business continuity in this challenging environment. I'm proud of the work that we're doing to keep our operations running as efficiently as possible and to supply our customers with critical products.Revenue for fiscal Q3 was $562 million, up 2% sequentially and up 4% from the same quarter a year ago. Our revenue mix by major markets in Q3 was approximately 30% industrial, 28% automotive, 24% comms and data center, and 18% consumer. Now I'll turn to the distribution channel. Distribution comprised 52% of Maxim's revenue in Q3.We ended the quarter with just 50 days of channel inventory, up one day from the prior quarter and well below our long-term target of 60 days. As Tun\u00e7 mentioned, our manufacturing test operations were not able to run at full capacity during the last two weeks of the quarter, impacting our ability to ship products both to direct customers and to distribution. Additionally, distribution resales increased from the prior quarter. Turning to the P&L.Maxim's gross margin, excluding special items, was 66.1%. This was up 10 basis points from the prior quarter, but 40 basis points below the midpoint of our guidance. Gross margin was slightly below our guidance midpoint due to COVID-19 disruptions to our manufacturing operations in the last two weeks of the quarter. Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $181 million, down approximately $7 million from the prior quarter, reflecting lower controllable expenses.A portion of the decrease was discretionary travel, which we intend to resume when safe for employees and customers. Q3 GAAP operating income excluding special items was $191 million. Operating margin was 34% of revenue, up 210 basis points from prior quarter due to higher revenue and lower operating expenses. The Q3 GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, was 12%, down one percentage point from the prior quarter.GAAP earnings per share excluding special items was $0.61, equal to the midpoint of our prior guidance range. Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $1.7 billion, down $97 million from the prior quarter. Trailing 12-month free cash flow, defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was $744 million or 34% of revenue.Free cash flow per share was $2.74. And our free cash flow yield is 5% at yesterday's closing stock price. For capital return, share repurchases totaled $157 million in Q3, as we bought back approximately 2.8 million shares. This was an increase of $49 million or 45% from the prior quarter.Our share repurchases accelerated in Q3 driven by our repurchase matrix which buys back more shares at lower share prices, combined with increased free cash flow. Dividends totaled $129 million in the quarter. Based on yesterday's closing stock price and our quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share, our dividend yield is 3.5%. Total return of cash through dividends and share repurchases was 131% of free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis.We are on track to exceed our commitment to shareholders to return at least 125% of free cash flow in fiscal 2020. Q3 inventory days ended at 106, down three days from Q2, and inventory dollars were down 1% from the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $17 million. Now I'll turn to our outlook for the June quarter.We forecast fiscal Q4 revenue to be between $480 million and $540 million, down 9% from the prior quarter and down 8% year-over-year at the midpoint. Our beginning fiscal Q4 backlog was $509 million, almost equal to the midpoint of our revenue guidance range. On the surface, this would imply that turns would not be required to achieve our revenue forecast. However, we anticipate some level of pushouts within this backlog.And we expect that our ability to satisfy orders will be impacted by COVID-19 related constraints in our Philippine test operations, limiting our revenue outlook to the range provided. Fiscal Q4 gross margin, excluding special items, is forecasted at 65.5% to 67.5%, up 40 basis points at the midpoint from the prior quarter, with favorable product mix and front-end factory loading more than offsetting lower revenue. During the quarter, we plan to increase our internal inventory ahead of test to accelerate our ability to ship finished products as test capacity becomes available. Fiscal Q4 operating expenses excluding special items are expected to be down approximately $1 million from Q3, with continued cost controls and the benefit of lower travel expenses.Fiscal Q4 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 3% of revenue. And our tax rate excluding special items is expected to remain flat to Q3, at 12%. Our fiscal Q4 GAAP earnings per share excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.43 to $0.57. In summary, our strong financial model and operational focus is enabling Maxim to be resilient in these challenging times.We are focused on delivering critical products to our customers while safeguarding employee health. We continue to generate strong free cash flow and remain committed to our strategy to return more than 125% of that free cash flow to investors. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kathy. -- Thanks, Brian. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now open the call for questions. I'd like to continue the same Q&A process that we've used in previous calls. We'll take one question from each caller so we can get to as many people as possible.Jonathan, could we please have your -- our first question?Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please. -- Hey, guys. Congrats on the solid results in the uncertain times. I just wanted to dig a little bit deeper into the industrial side of things. I was a little surprised that it's holding in as well as it did in March and, I guess, more impressively even in June.Tun\u00e7, you said you're expediting medical there. So, I guess, in aggregate, can you just talk about how much of that is pull-ins? How big is medical as a percent? Any more color around that? And when do you expect the Philippines test headwinds to actually go away? Thank you. -- All right, Ross. So, in general, just to begin at what percentage of our sales is medical, it's somewhere -- well, before COVID-19, it was somewhere in the mid-single digits range for the company. So, that gives you some idea. In terms of what's happened during this quarter is really a surge in demand and customers wanting to pull in all kinds of our products.We have many products that go into medical, but they're used -- a lot of them are used in ultrasound equipment, in pulse oximeters, in disposable patches for remote patient monitoring, in ventilators, anesthesia machines, so a lot of equipment that we actually didn't really follow where our strong product portfolio was actually designed into. So a lot of those customers obviously came in and increased their orders, both bookings, and pulled in. So essentially, we're responding, giving those customers priority to deliver products to them. In terms of, you know, the rest of the industrial market, you are seeing some effect of -- clearly, we couldn't ship all that we needed to ship last quarter, so there's some catchup that's going on.In general, industrial customers in previous experiences we've had, their reaction speed is not very quick, like a consumer customer would be. So, I think that we're still seeing them continuing business as usual as long as their factories are open. And that's what \u2013 you know, we don't have a lot of advanced information unlike automotive in that space. So, some of the group is fueled by these pull-ins and high priority we're giving for medical.Some of it is also by general demand kind of remaining stable, frankly, not going down in this environment. -- Thank you. -- You're welcome. -- Thanks, Ross.Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JP Morgan. Your question, please. -- Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the strong free cash flow generation. Maybe just a quick housekeeping question. You guys talked about test capacity constraints in June.Maybe -- how much of the revenue impact -- how much of a revenue impact is that having on the June quarter? And then for my main question in automotive, the recent data points out of third-party research guys, like IHS and one of your semi-peers that reported this morning, is that China auto sales have started to pick back up in addition to China auto production picking back up here in the June quarter. Given your strong presence in BMS and, recently, in ADAS, would like to see if you guys are seeing the same trends. And then on a global basis, light vehicle production is expected to inflect pretty strongly in the September quarter as European and U.S. and the Japan guys start to ramp production back up.Are you starting to see this reflected in your auto customers forward forecast, just given that you are keeping relatively lean inventories? Would you anticipate your auto shipments to track closely with global production trends? -- OK, Harlan. I'll take that. That was a lot of questions in here. So, one thing that I just recalled, Ross asked the question -- it's a two-part question, I didn't answer the second part, which is when do we expect our test constraints to get better.And et me answer that first. We -- obviously, the whole team is working to do changes in getting more operators to get and work in our factory in the Philippines as well as shifting test to other facilities that we have. So, the 70%, I talked about in my prepared remarks was kind of an average for the quarter. So, we're starting from a lower number, and we'll catch up by the end of the quarter.So, I think that in terms of the delayed shipments, I think we'll be able to catch up with it in basically in our Q1. This is our current plan. In terms of your questions about automotive, we are seeing a mix, actually, from customers. Some of them have begun to order.And you mentioned one of them, which was BMS customers in China because their factories are coming back online. Some of our customers are still in the condition of factories either partially operating or completely closed. So, they're not essentially taking products for Maxim. So it really is a mix that's going on in the automotive area.And as I said, it's also limited by some of our test constraints. So, I think automotive is a lot of things happening. And frankly, any answer I give you would be correct for some segment in terms of demand coming back or being delayed. But I think in general, the world in whole has built fewer cars because of the constraints.So that has to have an impact essentially on the amount of product that customers are going to take from us. It does depend on what their inventory levels are at their tier 1s, for example. But we're doing our best in order to really prioritize the ones that need the products more heavily than others. But I think our general feeling is that there will be weakness in this quarter, and maybe even next.Having said all that, I think in the long term, it's still a good market for us. I mean we'll continue to invest in it, in the product lines that I mentioned in the prepared remarks. So, your other question was, you know, how much of your revenue is test constraints versus demand. It's hard for me to quantify that, but I think I can directionally give you some answers, and maybe that will help.First of all, the impact is across each of our end markets in terms of the test constraint impact. I think the industrial market guidance would have been strongly up instead of just up if we were able to build all the products and ship them. I think the consumer softness is primarily from demand weakness that we're seeing and not really affected that much by test constrains. But automotive is both.It's both demand weakening and test constraints, so both of them. And comms and data center was relatively unaffected by the constraint. So, I think that -- these kind of things are fluid, that's why we're kind of hesitating from giving actual numbers as to what revenue could have been if we add all the test constraints because as Brian mentioned in his prepared remarks, some of the backlog we have, we're suspecting that as the quarter goes on, some of that might be pushed out of the quarter as well. So, it's a bit of a mix for that reason. -- Thanks for the insights, Tun\u00e7. -- You're welcome. -- Thank you, Harlan.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Your question, please. -- Hi. Thank you very much for taking my questions. I had a question on the guide and the commentary around the turns and the backlog. Just help us put this in perspective that other such sharp downturns we have seen before.And I know no two downturns are the same, but in terms of percentage of cancellations, push-outs that you're seeing, just trying to understand the kind of the sharp reversal in fundamentals we have seen and from -- based on your order patterns, what are you seeing versus what we've seen in the past? And also more importantly, NXP this morning, was calling out for recovery Q-over-Q growth in 3Q. Can you just help us understand how you're seeing this current downturn playing out? Thank you. -- Sure. This is Brian. I'll take that one. So, if we start with turns, a typical quarter for us would include about 35% of the revenue coming from turns within the quarter.So clearly, you know, beginning this quarter with backlog equal to the midpoint of our guidance is unusual. But we've raised the guidance as we had, again given the current environment where we do have some supply constraint issues as well as, you know, the potential for some movement of backlog, but 35% would have been kind of the historical norm. As it relates to pushouts, and we are trying to factor that into our guidance, you know, the one thing that I think is working in our favor here is that we have locked down 45 days of commitment from our customers. So, we've moved to a practice where orders within 45 days are noncancelable and nonreschedulable.So that gives us, you know, a reasonable amount of certainty as we move forward in the quarter. There's a little bit of exposure at the tail end of the quarter, which is what we're trying to contemplate into the guidance. But I think that this is very difficult to compare to prior downturns because we have, you know, supply dynamics here that are constraining the revenue. It's not necessarily just a decrease in demand.And the areas of softness in demand are particular pockets, we have strength in our areas. But the supply side of things, I think, makes it noncomparable to try to draw correlations to prior downturns. -- Yes. So Ambrish, maybe I'll add to things to that. There -- first of all, in terms of the shape of the recovery, I think that was part of your question as well. As Brian said, we have some amount of complication because of the supply issue.But in general, the industry really has never been faced with a pandemic-caused recession. It came so quickly. And the effect on our industry, I think, will be different, I think, from the general industry. We also saw this -- if you take the model of the 2009, you know, the Great Recession, even though the economy remained in recession for a long time, semiconductors really bounced back within -- I remember, within a year.We had already exceeded the quarter-over-quarter numbers within a year or five quarters. So, what we're doing is we can't really project that very well. And assuming that the shelter-in-place orders remain in place for a short time, let's say, a few more months at most, and taking that all into account, we're preparing, assuming there's a quick recovery. So, in terms of our ability to ship, our supply chain and so on, you know, we're really preparing for a quick recovery.We are built to be resilient. I mean we're serving a high-performance analog market with long-lived products, the flexible manufacturing structure that we have today, we'll be able to respond to a quick recovery, unlike the difficulties that we had in 2010, you might recall. And we will continue to be careful on spending. I think that is also important.But we essentially are preparing so that we're ready for a quicker recovery of the semiconductor business compared to what might happen in the overall economy. -- Thank you, both, for your perspectives. -- You're welcome. -- Thank you, Ambrish.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of from Vivek Arya Bank of America. Your question, please.[Inaudible] Zakalik, on for Vivek. Thanks for letting me ask the question. My question is also on the automotive end market. So even with your softer June guide, your auto business appears much more resilient compared with industry auto production that's down 30% or so in the first half.I guess, I'm wondering how you're feeling about customer inventory headed into Q2, particularly in the auto space. Thanks. -- Yeah. I'll take that one. So, we actually don't have really good insights into what customer inventories are. They don't really share that with us.We do ask the questions about inventory levels. But the fact that -- and not maybe across the board, but on many of our newer products. You know, we were also limited by test constraints, tell you that they don't have much inventory on, especially on our new and faster-growing product lines. So, it's hard to really put numbers on it, but we do notice that we're really performing very well in automotive compared to the overall market.And we're attributing some of that to faster content growth and design wins, in particular, segments that are doing well. And good examples of this are our ADAS, our serial link products, our BMS products, these are all doing pretty well. And therefore, since we're getting more content and market share gains, it would be reasonable to assume that we're doing better than what we're seeing for the overall market. Now having said all that, as Brian said, it is very hard for us to predict what's going to happen.And therefore, we laid out a more cautious outlook on what's going to happen in automotive with a pretty serious decline that we're forecasting in the current quarter we're in.Got it. Thanks. -- You're welcome. -- Thank you, [Inaudible].Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please. -- Oh, yeah. Thank you. I just wanted to follow-up on the commentary around inventory in the channel. And you had mentioned in the March quarter, the expectation was you were going to at least kind of refill or get closer back to your targets, and that didn't happen.So just how do you see things playing out for the June quarter? And any update on resales in the month of April? -- Sure. This is Brian. I'll take that. Yes, for the March quarter, we had built an assumption in our guidance that we would replenish the channel to some extent, moving a little bit more toward our targeted range there.As it turned out, channel inventory remained essentially flat, you know, 50 days, up just one day from the prior quarter. That was driven by stronger resales, so resales were up a bit from the prior quarter, but it was also driven by the fact that we were constrained in our ability to ship products into the channel toward the end of the quarter. Your question about -- so with the -- what are we assuming moving into the current quarter, the June quarter as it relates to that, you know, again, it's difficult, even when there is less uncertainty in the macro environment, it's -- I think it was challenging for us to forecast resells with a tremendous amount of accuracy. And I think in today's environment, it's even more difficult, and then is combined with the challenge of trying to predict how our mix of shipments will ultimately play out as it relates to direct versus chain shipments.So, I think what you've seen from us over the course of the last several quarters is very prudent management of our channel inventory. We've been very disciplined in managing that and keeping it well within our target range. You should expect us to continue to do that. We will.But again, I don't think it would be valuable for us to try to predict, you know, exactly where days of inventory in the channel would likely fall in the June quarter, given the various uncertainties. -- OK. Thank you, Criag.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your question, please. -- Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess another question on the test and assembly side. So, I guess, could you share with us, is it strictly test also assembly, is it really just related to social distancing or related to supply, logistics, other issues like that? And then as you think about, you know, improvements there, can you speak to any impact on margins in the June quarter? Your vision for, perhap,s adding redundancies for ATE outside of Southeast Asia? And you talked about backlogs potentially being pushed out related to tests.Can you qualify what you mean by that? Thank you. -- Yeah. So, let me comment in general about manufacturing, and Brian can add, if gross margin affects. He can add to that. So, in terms of our supply chain, just to give you an overall summary, our wafer fabs -- our own wafer fabs and our foundry partner network is in good shape.So, we're not seeing any disruptions there. Our assembly is almost 100% outsourced into multiple vendors in multiple countries. And even though there are -- there's a couple of countries affected, we've been able to shift around where we load because we had multiple sources for those packages. So, assembly, in general, you know, we've been able to take care of about being affected by the social distancing measures.In final test, we really have two internal sources, and then some test is outsourced. Of these, the outsource is working fine. Our Thailand operation is working fine. In the Philippines, basically, we're not running at 100% because we can't get all the employees or staff into the factories because of restrictions in the Philippines that were mandates by the government.So, our plan is really to increase the level of staffing, and also, as a result, be able to increase our output from that factory. And we expect, unless we run into other issues or other restrictions by the government, we are protecting the employees. We're making sure that they're in a safe environment with many measures. And we do expect, probably by the end of the quarter, to get back to the levels that we were running at and doing some catch-up as well.So, it is really a number of staff that can get to the factory, and it's not really related to equipment and so on. So hopefully, that answered most of your questions. Was that sufficient? Or is there any other detail you're looking for? -- Yeah. Very helpful. If you can just state on the margin impact, that would be great. Your question, please. -- So, Brian, can you comment on that? -- Yeah, sure. For the June quarter, we're actually guiding gross margin up 40 basis points at the midpoint. So, we are getting a fairly significant benefit in the June quarter associated with mix with lower automotive and lower consumer from a mix perspective. That's providing tailwinds on the gross margin.And we will continue to run manufacturing operations at a higher level. So particularly, at the front end, we're going to continue to manufacture. We're going to build some inventory, as I said in our prepared remarks. So, the front end will continue to work.We'll build some inventory in front of test because we want a position for that bottleneck to be resolved. So once that bottleneck in the Philippines is resolved, we want to be in a position to push out finished goods as quickly as possible and adjust the backlog that we have. -- Thank you. -- Thank you, C.J.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your question, please. -- Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for answering my questions. A couple of things here.First, I just want to -- can you quantify what the impact was in the March quarter from the test assembly issues? What -- would you have been at the midpoint? So, I can assume a two-week issue was about a $12 million hit. And then Tun\u00e7, as I kind of follow-on to that, I'm just a little bit confused by the June guidance. You're heading in with very healthy backlog in a supply constrained environment where inventories are really lean. Why isn't June the quarter that customers actually try to build some cushion inventory? And maybe the cancellations you're expecting are pushed out until September.Why are you so confident that June is the quarter that customers will start to cancel backlog and push things out? -- Well, I think you used the word confident in there, and we're not that confident. But I think that's what is the most likely thing to happen, which is the way we construct our guidance for the quarter. We did see, you know, in the first weeks of April now. You know, before we put in the 45 days of backlog is locked -- a comment that Brian made, we did allow customers to move their backlog around.And we did notice that some of the automotive customers did push their orders. So, we're suspecting that as things settle, there might be more of those pushouts. So that's really why we're doing it. We're basing it on what the automotive customers, how they behaved in the first few weeks of the quarter.Whether that will continue or not is to be seen. We're not really sure. Your other question about last quarter, I think Brian can answer that one. -- Sure, John. Yes, the disruption to the test operations in the Philippines at the end of the March quarter did have an impact on gross margin. We were 40 basis points shy of the midpoint. And we would have expected to be at the midpoint if it weren't for that impact. -- Brian, I was more talking the midpoint of the rev guide. Would you have hit the midpoint of the rev guide without the testing issue? -- We were tracking to make the quarter at the midpoint. -- Perfect. Thank you. -- Yes. I think just to give you a bit more color on that one, we were tracking, absolutely correct from Brian. One way to look at it is we said, how much did the lateness of deliveries grow. They grew about $20 million, $30 million.So, I guess that shows you that we were tracking. -- Perfect. Thank you. -- Thank you, John.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to focus a bit on just kind of the supply versus demand dynamics. So, if you're talking about a pretty noticeable sequential decline in June due to the COVID-19 impact.But how do you guys get comfortable around what is demand erosion? What is just supply constraints? Because it sounds like the supply issue really impacted March quarter by, let's call it, $10 million to $15 million plus. So how much of that supply issue is reoccurring in June? And then secondly, do you believe that the kind of consumer and automotive demand market is going to be weaker in 2021? Or do you think that's too early to kind of look out that far? -- I think going out to 2021, you know -- as you know, we don't give guidance for that long time. I think that if the stay-in-place orders -- now I'm talking about the economy, more than about Maxim. But if those orders are eased in the coming months, I personally would expect things to kind of recover. But as I said, it's hard to see what all those implications are for Maxim.We really have our focus on, you know, the long-term in terms of our investments, especially in R&D. And we have a pretty flexible supply chain, so we should be able to react. Whether there's a quick recovery in '21, or if there isn't, then because of the flexible chain, we don't have a huge, you know, dependence on gross margin and the level of revenue. So, I think we should be -- we're well-prepared for any eventuality that occurs out there. -- Got you. And then how much is the supply impact in the Q2 guide -- or sorry, the June quarter guide? -- Well, with the backlog not as stable as we like it, including the quarter, it's hard for us to project. But with us running, on average, you know, at 70%, we do expect the lateness in our deliveries to orders to actually grow in the June quarter. But I'm not going to be able to quantify that because I don't know what the backlog is going to be. -- Got it. Understood. Thank you. -- Thank you, Mitch.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Your question, please. -- Yup. Thank you. I was hoping to zoom in a little bit on the 45-day commitment schedule. First of all, when was that instituted? And is this a new phenomenon? And should we assume that this is going to be ongoing? Just trying to understand if this is sort of a new policy that you have or if it's only now during this very uncertain era? -- Yeah. I'll take that one. So, it is something we put in place, if I remember right, within the first week or two of April. And it was done because we were test-limited.We wanted to make sure that the backlog is the correct backlog that we are building. Because 45 days is enough time to make sure that we're loading the correct products to assembly and loading them on our testers. So, we put it in place because of the current conditions and the test constraints that we're looking through. And it was -- I think I was in the first -- maybe 10 days of April. -- And Tun\u00e7, is this sort of a one-time thing? Or should we expect this to be the norm going forward? Because obviously, that will change your backlog in terms ratio going forward, right? -- I wouldn't think it would change it because we usually come in with a pretty reasonable backlog at the beginning of the quarter. I don't think it will change it. Whether we'll make this permanent or not, I think it's too early to make that decision. We'll just see how things develop and see how customers react.We basically explain to customers why we're doing it. And I'd say most of them found it very reasonable under these conditions. And they said that they would follow our direction on this. And we didn't really talk about what was going to happen long term, frankly. -- Sounds good. Thank you, Tun\u00e7. -- You're welcome. -- Thank you. Tore.Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay from Cowen. Your question, please. -- Yeah. Hi, there. This is Ethan Potasnick, on for Matt Ramsey. I want to ask about the comms and data center business.As you guys have previously described, the business is lumpy. and you touched on some of the growth drivers for the June quarter. So, I was wondering if you could kind of parse these out and talk about some of the ebbs and flows between hyperscale, CapEx and 5G activity for 25-gig and 100-gig optical products. Are these trends sustainable heading into the back half of the calendar year? Any color would be helpful. -- Sure. So, as you summarized, we have a nice, robust, good-growth business on the hyperscale side, that consists of products we make [Inaudible]. Primarily, most of the growth there is coming from our optical products. These customers are investing in their data centers, and they need to connect -- high speed connect to their servers and storage together, and our products help do that inside of the data center.So that's pretty robust growth. And the signals we're getting at the moment from them is that their investments are going to continue. We -- this quarter, the addition was that we began to ramp some power products for these high-powered server applications, so that also should help. You know, essentially our power products, and enterprise and data center had been weak for multiple years.And this is the initial ramp that we're seeing at least from that one customer. So that -- those two added should really help us grow. In our market, it seems like the world has continued to invest, which is data center and cloud. On the base station side, rollouts are continuing and our single lane 25G transceiver products are well-accepted in the market.But that piece will be lumpy. And I think that we ramped it very nicely throughout last year. There will be, you know, a little bit of a decline probably this quarter as things kind of stabilize in that market. But I think there's no question in our minds that, overall, you know, for the future, the upgrading of base stations are going to continue.But that business, you know, has always been lumpy and will continue to be so. So, I wouldn't really direct it to keep growing at the rate that it has grown, let's say, in the last year. -- Alright. Thank you, Ethan.Thank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Kathy Ta for any further remarks. -- OK. Thank you, Jonathan. That does conclude today's conference call.

It stated that its worldwide iPhone supply would be \"temporarily constrained\" by manufacturing issues in China and that its store closures and reduced operating hours for open locations would throttle its sales to Chinese consumers.That warning wasn't surprising since Apple  the closures and its top contract manufacturer  only brought back about 10% of\u00a0its workforce after the extended Chinese New Year holiday. Apple's stock dipped after the announcement but subsequently rebounded as investors digested the news.Many Apple investors likely consider the coronavirus (officially known as COVID-19) outbreak to be a temporary headwind. That's likely true, but that headwind could hurt Apple's smaller suppliers more than the tech giant. Today, we'll discuss the outbreak's potential impact on four of Apple's top suppliers:  , , , and  .Image source: Apple.Jabil is a manufacturing company that produces Apple's iPhone and iPad casings. Its orders from Apple accounted for\u00a022% of its revenues in fiscal 2019.Jabil's revenue from Apple feeds its DMS (Diversified Manufacturing Services) business, which accounted for 39% of its revenue last year. That business also manufactures products for the material sciences, technologies, and healthcare sectors.The remaining 61% of its revenue came from its EMS (Electronic Manufacturing Services) unit, which produces myriad products across the automotive, industrial, cloud, defense, energy, telecom, retail, and smart home markets. Its other top customers include , , and .In Jabil's first-quarter report last December, it estimated that its full-year revenue would rise about 5.5% to\u00a0$26.7 billion. Citing a \"nice start to the year,\" it also raised its EPS guidance from 16% growth to 21% growth.Based on those forecasts, Jabil's stock looks cheap at nine times forward earnings. However, Jabil will likely reduce or withdraw that guidance when it reports its second-quarter numbers in\u00a0mid-March -- so investors should wait for that update to see if it's still an undervalued growth stock.Skyworks and Qorvo both supply wireless chips for Apple's devices. Skyworks sells a wide range of chips, while Qorvo mainly sells front-end radio frequency (RF) modules.Apple's orders accounted for\u00a051% of Skyworks' revenue and\u00a032% of Qorvo's revenue last year, so any slowdown at Apple will significantly impact both companies. To make matters worse, both companies rely heavily on , which faces a slowdown in its Chinese smartphone sales and restrictions stemming from the ongoing trade war between the .Image source: Apple.Analysts expect Skyworks' revenue and earnings to rise 4% and 7%, respectively, this year -- which are decent growth rates for a stock which trades at 15 times forward earnings. Qorvo, which also trades at 15 times forward earnings, is expected to generate 6% revenue growth and\u00a09% earnings growth this year. However, investors should expect analysts to slash those estimates if the coronavirus outbreak worsens.Cirrus Logic, which produces audio chips for Apple's devices, relied on\u00a0Apple for a whopping 78% of its revenue last year. Cirrus has been Apple's longtime supplier, but Apple  's  audio codec in its latest AirPods instead of using Cirrus' competing codec -- which suggests that Cirrus investors shouldn't get too comfortable.Wall Street expects Cirrus' revenue to rise 2% next year as its earnings -- facing a tough comparison to favorable tax benefits in\u00a0fiscal 2020 -- dip 2%. Those are tepid growth rates for a stock that trades at 21 times forward earnings.Cirrus' concentrated exposure to Apple enabled its stock to outperform Jabil, Skyworks, and Qorvo by a wide margin over the past 12 months.

However, it's a highly competitive field and Maxim comes up against far larger semiconductor companies like  and  -- a concern in a highly cyclical industry where scale is so important. Meanwhile, Eaton Vance is an investment asset manager -- a great business to be in when the markets are in good shape and assets under management are expanding.

Now I'll turn the call over to Tun\u00e7.  -- Thank you, Kathy. Good afternoon to all our participants. We appreciate you joining us today and your interest in Maxim Integrated. Let me first summarize last quarter's results and our outlook.Our December quarter results met our expectations while also maintaining lean inventory levels. Looking forward to the March quarter, we expect a return to revenue growth for the company from the same quarter last year, driven by growth in communications and data center, industrial and automotive markets. We continue to be cautious, given the persistent macro and trade uncertainty, but demand is improving. Let me provide some color by end market, starting with automotive.In the December quarter, our automotive business was up 5% sequentially with double-digit growth in our secular growth areas of BMS and driver assistance systems. Our revenue growth in our overall automotive business fared better than the growth of global car production. We see ample content growth opportunities for Maxim in ADAS applications in power management and point-to-point serial link data communication products. At the consumer electronics show, we held a large number of customer discussions on our BMS, driver assistance and power management solutions, our latest generation automotive serial link products, transport video, audio and data at 12 gigabits per second.In recent quarters, we grew our serial link business from Chinese OEM customers. At CES, we showcased our wireless BMS technology and new families of high-voltage automotive power solutions that efficiently control and supervise the hundreds of watts of power required for advanced driver assistance systems. In the March quarter, automotive is expected to be strongly up sequentially. We also anticipate automotive revenue to be up from the same quarter last year, driven by driver assistance and infotainment content.Let me next turn to the industrial market. In the December quarter, industrial was up 7% from the prior quarter. We experienced sequential growth in factory automation and automated test equipment markets. Days of inventory in the channel remained relatively similar to the prior quarter.In the March quarter, we expect industrial to be up sequentially. Industrial is also expected to be up from the same quarter last year, driven by automated test equipment; financial terminals; and core industrial, including factory automation. Now let me next discuss communications and data center. In the December quarter, comms and data center was up 25% sequentially.We experienced a strong ramp in demand for 25G optical products for base stations and 100G optical products for data center applications. We're excited about the rapid deployment of our analog laser driver products. Hyperscale data centers and 5G base station uplinks need to move more data while staying within their already constrained power budgets. Maxim's transmitter products address both challenges within the power and cost constraints of our customers.In the March quarter, we anticipate comms and data center revenue to be strongly up from the prior quarter. In the past, our optical business has shown large demand fluctuations based on customer capex deployments. We are currently enjoying a period of strong demand. Comms and data center is expected to be strongly up from the same quarter last year in 100G optical for data center and 25G optical for 4G and 5G base station applications.Finally, let me turn to consumer. In the December quarter, consumer was down 15% sequentially with expected weakness in smartphones and seasonal declines in other customer electronics. The peak of holiday shipments for consumer electronics had occurred in the September quarter. In the March quarter, we expect consumer to be flat sequentially.Gaming growth, new flagship phones ramp and other customers are expected to be seasonally down. Consumer is expected to be down strongly from the same quarter last year. To summarize, we have built Maxim to be resilient and to position the company to outperform as conditions get better. Market demand is improving, and we expect revenue growth in the March quarter compared to the same quarter last year in communications and data center, industrial and automotive.We are executing on our strategy to grow revenue with new design wins and long-lived products in automotive and industrial. Our analog business model and flexible manufacturing strategy enable consistent company profitability and stability. Now I will turn the call over to Brian. -- Thanks, Tun\u00e7, and thank you to everyone on the call today. Revenue for fiscal Q2 was $551 million, up 3% sequentially and $6 million higher than the midpoint of our forecast range entering the quarter. Compared to the same quarter a year ago, revenue was down 4%. Our revenue mix by major markets in Q2 was approximately 30%, industrial; 26%, automotive; 24%, comms and data center; and 20%, consumer.Now let me turn to our distribution channel. Distribution comprised 51% of Maxim's revenue in Q2. We ended the quarter with just 49 days of channel inventory, up one day from the prior quarter and well below our long-term target of 60 days. Our lean channel inventory was enabled by our tight inventory management, combined with stronger-than-expected resales for optical and BMS products.Turning to the P&L, Maxim's gross margin, excluding special items, was 66%, up 100 basis points from the prior quarter and above the midpoint of our guidance with the increase driven by favorable manufacturing efficiencies. Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $188 million, up approximately $3 million from the prior quarter, reflecting the full-quarter impact of annual merit increases for employees and an increase in variable compensation due to higher profitability. Q2 GAAP operating income, excluding special items, was $176 million. Operating margin was 31.9% of revenue, up 160 basis points from the prior quarter, due to higher revenue and improved gross margin.The Q2 GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, was 13% and equal to our current outlook for the remainder of this fiscal year. GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.56, $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance range. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $1.8 billion, down $10 million from the prior quarter. Q2 inventory days ended at 109, down six days from Q1.And inventory dollars were down 5% from the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $14 million. Trailing 12-month free cash flow, defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was $737 million or 34% of revenue. Free cash flow per share was $2.70, and our free cash flow yield is 4.5% at yesterday's closing stock price.For capital return, share repurchases totaled $108 million in Q2 as we bought back approximately 1.9 million shares. Dividends totaled $130 million in the quarter. Based on yesterday's closing stock price and our quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share, our dividend yield is 3.2%. Total return of cash through dividends and share repurchases was 126% of free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis.Now I'll turn to our outlook for the March quarter. Our beginning fiscal Q3 backlog was $456 million. Based on this beginning backlog and expected turns, we forecast Q3 revenue to be between $555 million and $595 million, up 4% from the prior quarter and up 6% year over year at the midpoint. Q3 gross margin, excluding special items, is forecasted at 65.5% to 67.5%, up 50 basis points from the prior quarter, at the midpoint on higher revenue.Q3 operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be up approximately $2 million from Q2, driven by higher variable compensation on increased profitability. Fiscal Q3 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 3% of revenue. And our tax rate, excluding special items, is expected to remain at 13%. For Q3 GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, we expect the range of $0.57 to $0.65.In summary, we are pleased to see improving business trends with an outlook for continued sequential revenue growth in the March quarter, along with the return to year-over-year revenue growth. That growth, combined with our strong financial model, enables us to generate increasing profits, cash flows and shareholder return. With that, I will turn the call back over to Kathy. -- Thanks, Brian. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now open the call for questions. We would like to continue the same Q&A process that we've used in previous calls. [Operator instructions] Jonathan, could we please have our first question?Our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please? -- Thanks for letting me ask a question, and congrats on the strong quarter and guide. Tun\u00e7, I just wanted to go back to last quarter and compare it to this quarter. A quarter ago, I think stabilization was the operative phrase you used to describe the business. It seems like things have gotten better across the board given your guidance.Can you just give us an update on either geographically or by end market? Do you think it's true that demand is getting better? Or is it that 49 days of inventory in the channel, which is still very low, just starting to refill as you look into the March quarter? -- Yes. So I will summarize what I said in the prepared remarks. But essentially, considering our Q3 guide, what we're seeing is a few things happening. Number one, we have some good growth, really end market demand-driven growth in our automotive products and in our optical products for both data center and 5G.So that's strong demand we're seeing from our customers with nice growth. On the other hand, on the industrial side, we've not really seen a full recovery, I'd say, to like two year-ago levels. But both Q2 and Q3 had some growth compared to the same period last year, so what we're seeing there is reasonable demand coming from customers. And in all of this, we've been able to also maintain lean inventory levels in the distribution channel.So I think one of the questions that we got last quarter was the growth really coming from refilling the inventory in distribution, and that's not what we did. So essentially, it's very strong growth in some areas that I mentioned in automotive and comms data center, but we're seeing a broadening increase in demand. And geographically, I guess, geographically, maybe Brian can answer that piece. -- Sure. Geographically, particularly as we look at resales through distribution, the Asia region continues to be the strongest with particular strength in China. And in terms of softer areas, Europe continues to be a little bit weak. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JP\u00a0Morgan. Your question, please? -- Good afternoon. Solid execution on the quarter, guys, and good to see the return of year-over-year growth this quarter. It's a little bit hard to calculate exactly because of the revenue segmentation change in fiscal '19, but it looks like your auto business had another year of outperformance. I think it was flat to maybe slightly up in calendar year '19 versus auto production that was down about 5% to 7%.This year, the outlook is for flattish auto production growth. And within that, I think China EV production is targeted to grow about 8%. So given your exposure to some of the faster-growing segments, like EV and ADAS with some of your serial link and BMS products, do you think that this segment can approach kind of low teens percentage year-over-year growth as the year unfolds? -- OK. So let me take that one. So essentially, with what you summarized there well with our exposure to EVs, which is a faster-growing segment, estimated to grow about 20% per year and our good market position with our BMS products. And also, in ADAS, we have a lot of design wins we've had in the past few years, and those are ramping into production.So those two segments, we believe, were going to grow at much better rates than our average. Infotainment is more tied to growth in the car units, but that's doing pretty well, too, recently, so it's really hard to exactly predict. But I think we continue to believe that we can grow faster than car production units globally: a, because content's growth is faster than car production units; and b, because we've invested and have great products and technology for two of those segments that are in kind of, I would call it, in hyper growth globally. So, yes, we will grow.You stated a number. I'm a little reluctant to give a number. But we believe, for this year for the long term, we do expect automotive to grow in the low teens. -- OK. Thanks, Tunc. -- OK. Thank you, Harlan.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Your question, please? -- Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. This is Jamison calling in for Ambrish. So I was hoping just to continue touching on auto.So while I appreciate the fact that you outgrew auto SAAR, and I believe you said that auto grew 5% sequentially. I believe last quarter, you had guided it to be up strongly. So first, was this below your previous expectations? And second, can you talk about the broader auto demand environment? And what gives you confidence in the guide for the end market to be up strongly in the March quarter? -- Yes. So I'm going to do a little bit from memory, and I think Kathy can help me here. We did guide to strong growth. I think we were maybe a little bit under that but not a large number.So I think that we came pretty close, maybe slightly lower in the previous quarter. This quarter, we know we are seeing very strong demand, especially for our products that go into ADAS system. So that's the strong growth driver for us, and we've got some good design wins in China OEMs, which I mentioned in the call. So there are some specific areas in automotive that are doing really well for us.And as we had spoken last time, some of the slowing growth we saw in automotive, we've attributed to maybe inventory digestion as car production slowed last year. So the fact that we're also believing that we're seeing that infotainment will be another growth, so seems like that is maybe confirming that maybe some of that inventory is now being digested by car manufacturers. So we're feeling pretty good about the demand we're seeing in automotive for this quarter. -- Thank you. -- You're welcome. Thank you, Jamison.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your question, please? -- Hi. This is Blake Friedman on for Vivek Arya. I was just curious how we should think about the virus impact in China's growth in Q1? And if there is any impact, which end markets, specifically, you see that having more of an impact versus others? -- Yes. So obviously, this development about restrictions in travel and so on have occurred pretty recently. So to get a full assessment on which market it will affect having a comprehensive view on that, it's pretty short, frankly, to figure that out. In the areas that are affected, there are some of our optical module makers in that region, and they have communicated that they will shut down a bit longer than the normal Lunar year shutdown, so there will be some effects on that.We don't believe it's going to be a large effect on us, but that's the only customer information that we have some specifics on so far. We don't believe that's going to have an impact on our total revenue for the quarter. -- Got it. Thank you. -- Thank you, Blake.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your question, please? -- Yes. Good afternoon, guys, and congratulations on the solid results. Tun\u00e7, I'm just kind of curious about the backlog coverage you're bringing into the March quarter. It's at the midpoint of your revenue guide, about 79%, which is as high as I think I'd seen it.So help me understand. Other than trying to take a conservative stance because there is still some macro uncertainty out there, is there anything specifically that's driving the backlog coverage to be this high versus what's usually kind of in the low 70s as business mix into end markets that are more backlog oriented than turns? Or just help me understand why turns couldn't be better in the quarter. -- John, this is Brian. That's a great observation. And as Tun\u00e7 mentioned, we've had very strong demand for our optical products. And so what you're seeing is the effect of the higher-than-usual amount of optical orders in our backlog that we don't expect to ship all of which this quarter. -- Thank you. -- Thank you, John.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please? -- Yes. Thank you. Tun\u00e7, just a follow-up on your comments about wireless BMS at CES. Can you just talk about kind of the developments there and just gauge the time line in terms of product introductions? And then what period of time could you see those products eventually come to the market? -- Yes. So wireless BMS is a technology that we have been working on. Essentially, what we developed in a nutshell was a way to be able to connect all of our individual, essentially metrology chips that are on the packs to talk to a central control unit through wireless technology. We demonstrated that it can be done.Obviously, we need to do more work to make sure that it is as robust as wired technology. And as you predicted, that's going to take a little bit more time. It's hard for us to really tell exactly when it will gain enough customer acceptance in terms of how robust it is as a complete system. But revenues from this will not are not on the horizon for multiple years, so it's really just a technology that we're showing, but we have to productize it in a way that's equivalent to our ASIL D solutions that we have in our wired products right now.So revenue-wise, multiple years in the future. -- Thanks. -- Thank you.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your question, please? -- Hey, guys. This is Matt Prisco on for C.J. I just wanted to dig a little more into the comms and data center side of the business, stronger than expected this quarter, great guide next quarter. So can you just kind of dig into a little bit more what's driving that uptick across both 25 gig and 100 gig? And how sustainable are those trends as we kind of think through all of calendar '20? -- Yes. So there are really two components to the strong growth in comms and data center. One of them is in data center where we're selling products that are 100G or 4x25G lanes. We have a strong presence and good design wins on the laser driver portion for which we basically have an analog solution.And that, if you recall, we had strong growth in that about a couple of years ago. And then there was a lot of inventory built at our customers. And the module makers took us a while to drain that down, and now it's back for the last two quarters. So that's the story there.I think we're getting to a healthy level of consumption on those products as the cloud customers essentially are deploying more data transport capability in their data centers. So that's what's driving that, so it's really a recovery from an inventory correction last year. On the 25G front, it's one lane x 25 transceiver IC, plus some transimpedance amplifier products and like a system management chip for a module, so it's kind of a set of products that we sell into that. And that solution is very popular for 5G and, I guess, 4G installations that are trying to be made 5G-ready for base stations and that we're seeing a strong growth, especially now coming from China, because we have, again, a popular solution that everybody liked.And these designs were won probably about a couple of years ago. So that's what's ramping. As long as the 4G, 5G rollout continues, I think we're going to continue to sell these products because of our strong market position. But as I said in my prepared remarks, both of these businesses and especially the 25G connections, this business is kind of lumpy.And right now, we're enjoying a good spot. But those of you that have followed these markets, always remember in the past that there are times when there's some inventory digestion that happens and so on. But I think right now, fundamentally, long term, even if we get this lumpiness, I think, these are good growth markets because of the amount of data that's being moved, both in data centers and in wireless. Thank you, Matt.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Your question, please? -- I actually wanted to focus a bit on the consumer side. It looks like that's seeing a lot more pressure than we thought, at least near term. Can you walk through what you guys expect for maybe the full year out of that business in terms of like the calendar year, if it is this like company-specific? Or do you think this is like an industrywide issue that we'll see, particularly since Apple's reported numbers are pretty solid in the quarter? -- Yes. So just to remind everybody, I mean, our consumer business, if you walk back a few years ago, was pretty concentrated on one our largest customer. Our strategy has been for multiple years to diversify the business to go into multiple other customers, as well as other markets, even if same customers. And we've been executing on that plan.If you look at our guidance into the current quarter, basically, our large customer is ramping a new flagship phone. We've got good demand for our gaming products, but many of the other products really go into a seasonally weak period after the holiday season. So we're seeing that. Our seasonality is definitely changing, and maybe it's already changed to be more heavier in Q1 than it used to be basically in our Q2 -- in our Q3, sorry.So it's going to be heavier in the Q1 of the next fiscal year. Now your question is are we seeing something that's particular to Maxim? Yes. Our content has gone down at our largest customer, so you are seeing the effects of that. But we are seeing good demand from other customers, but it takes a while for this all to balance out. -- Thank you. -- Welcome. Thank you, Mitch.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your question, please? -- Hey, guys. This is Tom O'Malley on for Blayne Curtis. Congratulations on the nice results. Looking at market share, you guys have obviously come from levels with some weaker trends, and you're seeing above-average growth in terms of seasonality.Can you remind us what normal seasonality for June is? I know you just finished talking about how consumer is a little bit different than historically, but what's the right way to think about the entire business into the fourth fiscal quarter? And do you think just coming from a lower base, that you can outgrow that? -- Yes. I assume you asked about the March quarter, not June seasonality growth? -- March seasonality and for the rest of the fiscal year, if that's OK. -- OK. So I don't have the seasonality numbers in front of me, but I'm sure Kathy is going to help me out here. -- OK. So, Tom, this is Kathy. So of course, we're only guiding one quarter at a time, but we do usually see that the first half of any given calendar year is better for industrial and automotive. And historically, as Tun\u00e7 outlined in his last question and answer, we had historically benefited from a ramp in smartphone revenue in June quarter, but that's changed now because of the lower content that we have with that customer.So Samsung is a much smaller part of our revenue, and so we should not expect that to recur this year in our June quarter. And then finally, for comms and data center, given the lumpiness of optical, it's hard to predict, and there's not really a seasonality that we can point to there.Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jeremy Kwan from Stifel, Nicolaus. Your question, please? -- Yes. And let me add my congratulations on a solid quarter. I had a question on the automotive side. You mentioned battery management, ADAS.Those are growing very nicely as they are your key drivers in that segment. Can you give us a sense of how big that is relative to your -- maybe the legacy or the larger auto business? -- Yes. So let's see if we took Q3 as an example. Roughly half the business, half of automotive is infotainment. And if you look at BMS and ADAS, they're probably in the range of the mid-teens of automotive each.So that's kind of gives you an idea. I mean, these numbers vary because the mix changes quarter over quarter. So half infotainment, mid-teens for BMS and probably around mid-teens for ADAS, roughly. Did that answer your question? -- Yes. That's very helpful. And where do you see that going in the next three to five years, that proportion? -- Yes. It's hard for us to predict that, but higher would be the obvious answer. I mean, they're clearly growing, if you look at some of the numbers we quoted, double digits and so on. And clearly, they will grow pretty quickly.Just to give you an example, similar calls a year or two ago, we would use to say infotainment was 60% to 70% of the business, so the rest of it has grown pretty nicely. -- Great. Thank you. -- Thank you, Jeremy.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Your question, please? -- Yes, hi, and congratulations on the quarter. I'm not sure if this question has been asked, if you've addressed this, but Intel on their call talked a lot about very strong data center dynamics over the first half, but then they're kind of expecting a slowdown second half. I know it's very early on, and I don't even know if you have the visibility, but do you have any thoughts on that particular topic? -- I mean, honestly, Tore, I mean, if we're -- I don't think we're going to add anything to what Intel knows. They know their customers better than we do. And remember that we're one or two farther away from them because we're selling to mostly our data center customers who are module makers that are selling to cloud customers. And I don't think we can say anything that either confirms or denies with Intel would say.My recommendation would be to go with whatever they're projecting. Sorry, I couldn't help you on that one. -- No, that's fair, Tun\u00e7. My follow-up is on the channel inventory. So it's obviously below your target, and I'm just wondering what the dynamics are there. Is it mainly because of shortages? Or is it just customers kind of being gun-shy about visibility? Just trying to understand why it's running still quite a bit below your long-term target. -- I want to make sure I understand the question. Your question was about China inventory? -- No, channel inventory, channel, not China. -- Channel, channel inventory. Well, I mean, essentially, channel inventory, as you know, it's running below our model. Our desire is to bring it back up to what our model levels are, and we actually said that in the last call. But we saw -- as you stated, we saw a stronger demand for the optical products especially, and that caused us not to be able to completely catch up to what we wanted.Our read is that the end demand for these parts are pretty strong, so they're basically being consumed pretty soon after we ship them. And there's not too much inventory because of strong demand more than anything. -- Can I just add to that, Tore? Sorry. I'd just add to that, Tore. This is Kathy. So we also highlighted last quarter that we're starting to ship serial link products to Chinese OEMs in automotive, and that goes to JASTI.We saw strong resales of those products as well, so there are some Maxim-specific products that are doing quite well in the resales to China JASTI. -- That's very helpful. Thank you very much. -- Thanks, Tore.Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'd like to hand the program back to Kathy for any further remarks. -- OK. Thank you, Jonathan. That concludes today's conference call.

Dividend yield above a certain value and number of consecutive dividend hikes are probably most common. While these two measurements provide an incomplete picture of a stock\u2019s dividend worthiness, both can quickly reduce the number of stocks from several thousand to just a few dozen potential candidates.However, these two indicators have some shortcomings and should not be used as sole determinants for choosing investments. While a high or increasing dividend yield is desirable, it does not indicate whether the yield increase resulted from rising payouts or a declining share price. Therefore, the total return measurement will provide additional information about whether the share price rose to complement the rising dividend for upsized returns, declined to offset dividend income growth or cancelled out the dividend income growth to cause a loss for shareholders.The companies on this list have been selected with dividend investor\u2019s . All picks trade their shares on the NASDAQ exchange, have market capitalizations of more than $7 billion, have current dividend yields of more than 3% and have boosted their annual dividend at least for the last five consecutive years. Additionally, the list excludes mutual funds.The current yields of all seven NASDAQ dividend stocks below are in a narrow range between 3.02% and 4.02%, with a simple average yield of 3.48%. Furthermore, all picks on this list have total returns over the trailing 12 months that exceed their respective dividend yield. This measure indicates that the equities offer at least marginal capital gains over the last year. The simple average total returns across all seven equities are 14.3% over the last 12 months, 41.2% over the past three years and nearly 90% over the past five years.Below is the list of the seven NASDAQ dividend stocks investors should consider, ranked in ascending order by their current dividend yield.\u00a0Growing at an average annual rate of 20%, the company\u2019s dividend advanced 42-fold over the past two decades to the current $3.60 annual payout, which yields 3.02%. While lowest on this list in terms of dividend yield, Texas Instruments offers strong capital gains that place the company\u2019s total returns among the highest overall.Just over the trailing 12 months, capital gains of more than 20% pushed the total one-year returns on shareholders investment above 28%. Over the past three years, the total return exceeded 70%. Lastly, the shareholders more than doubled their initial investment over the past five years with a total return of nearly 150%.\u00a0After eight consecutive annual dividend hikes since the introduction of distributions in 2011, the company\u2019s current $1.40 annual payout corresponds to a 3.08% forward yield. The dividend advancement of nearly six-fold since 2011 is equivalent to a 25% average annual growth rate.Because of a flat share price performance, dividend income contributed most of the company\u2019s 5.1% total return over the trailing 12 months. However, the company delivered a 63% total return over the last three years and an 87% total return over the past five years.\u00a0Xcel Energy\u2019s current yield is 3.2% and the company has boosted its annual dividend every year since beginning dividend payouts in 2013. Over this time frame, the company enhanced its annual dividend payout more than four-fold for an average dividend growth rate of nearly 27% per year.After rising steadily for the first three years, the company\u2019s share exhibited increased volatility since mid-2016 but continued an overall uptrend and has gained 140% over the last five years. The current dividend income payouts and a double-digit-percentage share price rise combined for a 22.6% total return over the trailing 12 months. The total return over the last three years was 58% and nearly 158% over the last five years.\u00a0Maxim Integrated Products current 3.37% dividend yield is the median of the group. This company has a record of raising its annual dividend every year since beginning payouts 16 years ago. Over the past 15 years since its first full year of dividend distribution, the company has enhanced its annual payout amount nearly nine-fold, which corresponds to a 15.5% average annual growth rate.The company accompanied its rising dividends with steady asset appreciation of 80% over the last five years. Over the trailing 12 months, the share price gain of 5.8% provided approximately half of the company\u2019s 11.5% total return. The three year total return exceeded 50% and shareholders more than doubled their investment over the last five years with a total return of 122%.\u00a0Regency Centers Corporation\u2019s current yield is 3.64% and the company has boosted its annual dividend over the past six consecutive years. The company reduced its dividend payouts in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and paid four consecutive years of flat annual dividends afterwards. However, since resuming annual dividend hikes in 2014, the company enhanced its distribution payouts 26%, which corresponds to an average annual growth rate of 4%.After nearly tripling from its post-crisis level, the share price lost a third of its value between mid-2016 and the end of 2018. This decline limited the five-year asset appreciation to less than 3%. Furthermore, the share price one year ago was marginally below its level from five years ago, which translated to similar capital gains of 2.9% over the trailing 12 months. However, year-to-date in 2019, the share price advanced more than 13%. Including dividend income payouts, total returns over the last 12 months and five years were 6.25$ and 23.5%, respectively.\u00a0With a 4.01% current yield, the Principal Financial Group missed the top spot of this list by a mere hundredth of a percentage point. The company enhanced its annual dividend nearly five-fold since cutting the annual payout amount in half for 2008. This advancement corresponds to an average annual dividend growth rate of 15.4% over the past 11 years.A share price decline of nearly 45% in 2018 limited capital gains to just 2.6% over the past five years. However, a direction reversal at the end of 2018 set the share price on its current uptrend. The share price advanced 12% over the trailing 12-month period and more than 23% since the beginning of 2019.Consequently, the total return over the last three years is less than 5%. Additionally, because the 2018 price pullback limited the overall gains over the extended period, the one year total return of 18% is nearly as much as the 18.5% total return over\u00a0 the last five years.\u00a0This security\u2019s current yield is 4.02% and the company boosted its annual dividend for the past nine consecutive years. The share price delivered robust long-term gains of 43% over the last five years. A pullback of more than 20% in late-2018 amid the overall market correction limited the stocks asset appreciation to 4.6% over the trailing 12 months. However, since the beginning of 2019, the share price has advanced nearly 23%.Since its most recent dividend cut in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, the company has enhanced its annual dividend payout 15-fold, which corresponds to a 35% average annual growth rate. This rising dividend income combined with asset appreciation to deliver an 8% total return over the trailing 12 months. Additionally, the longer-term total returns were 31% over the last three years and 68% over the past five years.\u00a0Dividend increases and dividend decreases, new dividend announcements, dividend suspensions and other dividend changes occur daily.

(Symbol: MXIM) saw new options become available this week, for the February 2020 expiration.  One of the key inputs that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 79 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MXIM options chain for the new February 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $55.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.00.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $55.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $53.00 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MXIM, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $56.87/share today.\n\nBecause the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 62%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 3.64% return on the cash commitment, or 16.80% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $55.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $60.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.70.  If an investor was to purchase shares of MXIM stock at the current price level of $56.87/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $60.00.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.49% if the stock gets called away at the February 2020 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MXIM shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing MXIM's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $60.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 6% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 64%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 2.99% boost of extra return to the investor, or 13.81% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 30%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 29%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $56.87) to be 29%.

Now I'll turn the call over to Tunc.  -- All right. Thank you, Kathy, and good afternoon to all our participants. We appreciate you joining us today and your interest in Maxim Integrated. Let me first summarize last quarter's results and our outlook.Our September quarter results met our expectations while maintaining lean inventory levels. Looking forward to the December quarter, we expect sequential growth in communications and data center, in automotive and in industrial, partially offset by smartphone-related headwinds and holiday seasonality in consumer. We continue to be cautious given the persistent macro and trade uncertainty, but demand trends are stable. Given the soft environment, we will continue to tightly manage inventory and spending in the December quarter.I'll next provide color by end market. As a reminder, we have improved our revenue mapping by end market to be a more automated system. All my commentary is based on our new mapping. In year-on-year comparisons, we also use the updated mapping methodology.I will begin with automotive. In the September quarter, our automotive business was down 9% sequentially and down 4% from the same quarter last year. This reflects the effects of a year-over-year decline in global car production. However, we continue to see strong growth in driver assistance and electric vehicle content compared to the same quarter last year.In the December quarter, we anticipate strong growth sequentially in automotive driven by driver assistance and battery management systems content and a return to growth in our infotainment business. Growth in battery management system revenue is expected to come from a mix of geographies. In driver assistance, we expect to recognize revenue from new design wins at Chinese carmakers with our serial link products. And finally, infotainment system revenue is expected to grow sequentially across a broad range of customers.Let me next turn to the industrial market. In the September quarter, industrial was down 8% from the June quarter. This was softer than seasonality and modestly below our expectations. We experienced this broad-based weakness across our industrial markets.In the December quarter, we expect above seasonal sequential growth in industrial from a broad set of customers. This growth is from a low baseline in the September quarter and assumes continued stability in the run rate of bookings and lead times in the quarter. Let me next discuss communications and data center, which now includes computing. In the September quarter, comms and data center was down 7% sequentially.Broad-based weakness in communications infrastructure was partially offset by an uptick in demand for 100G laser driver products for data center applications. In the December quarter, we anticipate comms and data center revenue to be up strongly from the September quarter. We expect strong growth in 100G laser driver shipments for data centers and growth in 25G optical products for 5G base station applications. Finally, let me turn to consumer.In the September quarter, consumer was up 5% sequentially. We experienced weakness in smartphones offset by growth in tablets, wearables and peripherals. Smartphones comprised approximately 35% of our consumer business in the quarter, with Samsung smartphone revenue declining less than expected. In the December quarter, we expect consumer to be strongly down sequentially, with the peak of the holiday shipments for consumer electronics having occurred in the prior quarter.To summarize, we have built Maxim to be resilient and to position the company to outperform in the next market upturn. While we are clearly in a period of soft demand in certain -- on certain macroeconomic conditions, we expect sequential revenue growth in communications and data center, in automotive and in industrial. We are executing on our strategy to grow revenue with new design wins and long-lived products in automotive and industrial. Our analog business model and flexible manufacturing strategy enable consistent company profitability and stability.Now I'll turn the call over to Brian for his first call as Maxim's CFO. Brian? -- Thanks, Tunc, and thank you to everybody on the call today. I'm very pleased to have officially joined the Maxim team. I was able to meet some of our analysts and investors last quarter, and I look forward to meeting everyone in the coming months during our normal schedule of investor events. Turning to our results.Revenue for fiscal Q1 was $533 million, $3 million above the midpoint of our forecast range entering the quarter, but down 4% sequentially and down 17% from the same quarter a year ago. As Tunc mentioned, we are now using an automated system to map revenue to end markets. As most of you know, end market mapping can be a challenge in our industry given that we have thousands of products and thousands of customers. This updated mapping does result in some changes to our revenue breakout by end market starting with the currently reported quarter.As an aid to investors, we are providing four quarters of history under the new mapping on our website. Also, what we previously categorized as computing, which is primarily personal computing, is now combined with communications and data center. This now combines PCs and peripherals into the same category as servers. Our commentary and supplemental earnings presentation published on our website reference this new mapping.Our revenue mix by major markets in Q1 was approximately 30% industrial, 27% automotive, 24% consumer and 19% comms and data center. Combined automotive and industrial was 57%. Let me now turn to the distribution channel. Distribution comprised 50% of Maxim's revenue in Q1.We ended the quarter with just 48 days of channel inventory, down 11 days from the prior quarter and well below our long-term target of 60 days. The significant decrease in channel inventory was driven by the combination of our tight inventory management along with stronger-than-expected resells in China. China resells were strong across multiple product lines, but particularly for our optical and BMS products. Despite this strength, we believe that it's too early to interpret this as a beginning of a broad sustained upward trend in China end demand given the potential impact that trade tensions may be having on buying behavior.Turning to the P&L. Maxim's gross margin excluding special items was 65%, up 20 basis points from the prior quarter and above the midpoint of our guidance, with the increase driven by favorable manufacturing efficiencies combined with lower inventory reserves. Operating expenses excluding special items were $185 million, up from the prior quarter, reflecting the impact of annual merit increases for employees combined with higher R&D spending in support of new product development. Q1 GAAP operating income excluding special items was $161 million.Operating margin was 30.3% of revenue, down from the prior quarter due to lower revenue. The Q1 GAAP tax rate excluding special items was 13% and equal to our current outlook for the remainder of this fiscal year. GAAP earnings per share excluding special items was $0.52, $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance range due to higher profitability. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow.Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $1.8 billion, down $105 million from the prior quarter. Q1 inventory days ended at 115, up one day from Q4 due to improved gross margin, while inventory dollars were down 4% from the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $21 million. Trailing 12-month free cash flow, defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures, was $725 million or 33% of revenue.Free cash flow per share was $2.54, and our free cash flow yield is 4.6% at yesterday's closing stock price. For capital return, share repurchases totaled $94 million in Q1 as we bought back approximately 1.6 million shares. Dividends totaled $130 million in the quarter. Based on yesterday's closing stock price and our quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share, our dividend yield is 3.3%.Total return of cash through dividends and share repurchases was 142% of free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis. Now I'll turn to our outlook for the December quarter. Our beginning fiscal Q2 backlog was $402 million. Based on this beginning backlog and expected turns, we forecast Q2 revenue to be between $525 million and $565 million, up 2% from the prior quarter.Q2 gross margin excluding special items is forecasted at 64% to 66%, flat with Q1. Q2 operating expenses excluding special items are expected to be up approximately $2 million from Q1, driven by the full quarter effect of annual merit increases, partially offset by continued tight spending controls. Our tax rate for Q2 excluding special items is expected to be 13%, flat with Q1. For Q2 GAAP earnings per share excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.49 to $0.57.Fiscal Q2 capital expenditures are expected to remain in a similar range as Q1 at approximately 3% of revenue. We expect capex will decline toward the midpoint of our targeted range of 1% to 3% in the second half of our fiscal year. In summary, given the current environment, we are tightly managing spending and inventory, both internally and in the channel, while continuing to invest prudently in our long-term secular growth drivers. Our financial model enables us to generate strong consistent cash flow, and we remain committed to return 125% more of that free cash flow to investors.With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kathy. -- Thanks, Brian. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now open the call for questions. [Operator instructions] Jonathan, could we please have our first question?Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question please. -- Hi, everybody. Congratulations on the solid results. Tunc, a big picture question for you. The inventory came down way more than you thought in the quarter.You guys are guiding better than people expected. So can you just give us a view on -- do you think end demand is actually improving much? Or is the difference between your fiscal 1Q and 2Q just and inventory dynamic? And you can break that down to any specific end markets if you choose. That would be helpful as well. -- Yeah. OK. Well, happy to. So first of all, what we're seeing is, obviously, we're not expecting the shipment from distributors to be stronger than expected.I think that's broadly because of some specific markets where the demand was strong. And Brain expressed what those were, BMS -- some of our BMS products and some of our optical products. But there was also a drawdown from other markets to a lesser extent. I think the best way to characterize the market is that the weakness that we had seen in the past several quarters is there, but it is stable.And for us, we've seen pockets where we're seeing growth for our product lines, and I summarized those in my prepared remarks. So I think that even though obviously it's a tailwind to be able to replenish distribution, we are also seeing growth in some of our markets. And if you look at our demand -- or our revenue picture going from quarter to quarter, we basically said that three of our markets, our major markets, were going to be up in this quarter compared to the last. The only one in the other direction is consumer, and that's mostly because of smartphones and because of the holiday shipments occurring in the previous quarter.So I think to summarize, I think broad-based, it's still pretty stable and there are areas or pockets of growth for the company where we are definitely seeing some strength. -- Thank you. -- Thanks, Ross.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Your question please. -- Hi, thank you very much. I just wanted to focus on the automotive segment, Tunc. If I look at the last several quarters, your auto business has done much better than your peers and it's not a small business anymore, whether as a percent or on an absolute basis. So the question is twofold.One is maybe your results are not indicative of the market, but I just wanted to get a sense from you. What are you seeing in the end market? Because SAAR has come down this year versus early expectations. And so, A, are you seeing a stabilization and a pickup in SAAR because you're guiding your infotainment up as well, which I'm assuming is more SAAR related? And then the second part of the question is, how much of -- you've talked about BMS doing better, and that was the detractor last quarter. So is that some specific programs that are ramping? And just help us understand the auto performance, not just near term but just kind of the cadence over the last quarters and then going forward.Thank you. -- OK. All right. All right. So let me try to summarize.So your -- you gave the answer partially to your question on infotainment. It is our largest piece. It will be the most correlated to car production in the world. And obviously, when car production was down last year, it was the one that had the biggest effect.However, we are seeing strength in that and we've -- and strengthened that for the quarter we're in right now, so some of that business is coming back. Some of it, we're really guessing, is because of people adjusting to car production being down. And obviously, that has some effects on them drawing down on inventories. So I think that that's kind of -- looks like it's getting behind us.On the BMS front, it was a bit of a headwind last quarter. But it's coming back pretty strong in this quarter. Even though it was a headwind last quarter, by the way, BMS was still up double digits on a year-over-year basis. So essentially, we're still happy with our position in that market.And we're still expecting it to be growing strongly again this quarter as well. The other bright spot there is really in our serial link business, which is doing very well. And we think that, that, too, is helping us get numbers that are better than unit car growth. But if you recall, that's been our model all along.So we are pleased with the results we're getting right now. And if you remember last quarter, we disclosed that we're over $1 billion of design wins -- lifetime revenue design wins last year, which was a 26% increase from the previous year. So we're very happy with our performance on the automotive side. -- OK. Thank you. -- Thanks, Ambrish.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JP\u00a0Morgan. Your question please. -- Good afternoon. Solid execution on the quarter, guys, and welcome to the team, Brian. Look forward to working with you again. Maybe a similar question, similar to Ross and Ambrish, but focused more on the industrial segment, very broad based.It looks like the business declined slightly more than expected in September. Was this the final legs of inventory drawdown as your channel inventories were down so much? And looking at the growth in the December quarter, resells are looking -- have been looking good. Is this simply that you're now catching up to consumption versus shipping below consumption? And where are you seeing the most momentum? Is it SMB, the broad-based business versus some of the verticals like factory automation? Any color here in industrial would be great. -- Yes. So on the industrial side, it's a mix of things. There's definitely -- I mean one of the questions that we sometimes get asked is it appears that your shipments are below what the industrial customers' revenues are, which definitely is true. And obviously, they have to adjust to what's happening to them.And there is a long channel of inventory. There's some at distribution. There's some at the customer. So therefore, I think we believe -- and there's no real way, Harlan, to get this data very accurately.We believe that they've drawn down most of their inventory. And clearly in distribution, inventories have gone down as well for us. So from a short-term outlook, it seems like there is some stabilization that's happening in the channel. So for the broad base of customers, that is what we're seeing.There are also some parts of the verticals that are actually doing better than they have been in the past, and they're expected to do better this quarter as well. And I think if you remember, our verticals are markets like ATE and financial terminals. I think those are beginning to do better for us as well in Q2. So it's kind of a mix.I think that it seems like some of the inventory correction in the channel and customers is happening, and we're kind of seeing the effects of that. -- Great. Thank you. -- Thank you, Harlan.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse from Evercore. Your question please. -- Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Very impressive gross margins in the current environment. I'm curious if you can kind of walk through how we stair step from 65% to potentially the high end of your target model of 70%.What are the key assumptions we have to assume there, not only top line but elsewhere? Thank you. -- Hey, this is Brian. So I think that there's a couple of things. There's certainly the overall revenue level, and we've been at a depressed level. More recently, at 65% gross margin in the September quarter at $533 million, we feel like that's a solid base.And to get above that and get up into our stated target range of let's begin at 67%, we really need to get back to that $600 million per quarter revenue run rate. And then to get to the high end of the range, we need to get beyond that $600 million mark. So that will come with a higher factory utilization. It would also probably entail some improved mix with industrial coming back, which is our highest gross margin end market.So I think that's the path. Where we are today at 65%, we feel, is solid. And we have the ability to build off of that base moving forward with some additional revenue growth. -- Very helpful. Thank you. -- Thank you, CJ.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your question please. -- Hi, this is Jamie Zakalik on for Vivek. Thanks for letting me ask the question. So we have seen a wide difference in the earnings outlook for this quarter from companies that are exposed to mostly the same end markets like you, TI, NXP. So I'd be interested in any color you can provide on what you think could be causing this discrepancy.Is it customers reacting differently to analog or microcontroller products or U.S. versus non-U.S. or something else? Any color there would be great. -- Jamie, I mean, that's a good question. We really mainly see what we're experiencing, and we don't have the details of what others are experiencing. But I'm going to repeat what I said earlier to Ross. We are -- we've been in a broad market weakness for the last several quarters.But it's quite stable. We're not seeing a weakening in that. And some of the forecast we're giving with growth in three of our end markets is really coming from the strength of the product line in those markets for us. And the fact that our inventories are very lean, both at the company and in distribution, obviously helps us a lot.So we're very well positioned for strong performance when there's any turn in the market. As to messages given by other companies, you'd really have to know the details of those companies. And it's not -- I don't think it's -- we have an update to really tell you what's different between the three companies that you just mentioned. -- Got it. Thanks. -- Thank you, Jamie.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your question please. -- Yes, thanks. Tunc, just a question on the comm infrastructure market, which is notoriously volatile. Can you talk about just data center versus traditional wireline and kind of what you're seeing from a capex perspective? -- OK. So let me do my best here. So our focus in comms and data center really has been mostly on the data center side and less on the wireline side. So in the data center side, we had -- and it is pretty volatile, as you said.We did have some strong growth in our 100G products last year, if you recall, and then we went into a period where there was overinventoried market. So it kind of went away. And that -- we were signaling that, that was beginning to show signs of coming back. And we are seeing that coming back basically.But it is -- I mean, there's no doubt that the data center business is going to grow, but trying to figure that out from the semiconductor side is actually very difficult because it's very masked by what's happened in the -- what happens in the channel. All I can tell you is that the 100G market for us seems to be back and we know we have strong shipments in that. On the communications wireless side, I think we talked about that as well. Our 25G products are pretty strong.And in general, the broad base of, let's say, wireline communications products have been weak for us. And this is where we sell most of our older product lines that are analog housekeeping products, etc. And that has not been a strong market for us. And frankly, in the long term, as I said, it's a dated product line so we don't expect it to be good.We expect our growth to really come from optical products in this market and also from power management products in this market. -- Got it. Thanks. -- Thank you, Craig.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your question please. -- Yeah, good afternoon, guys. And congratulations on the strong results. Tunc, I just want to go back to the December guide. If you look at sort of this correction for the industry, your year over years got worse early.And so I guess it makes sense to me that perhaps your year over year start to get better more quickly than the industry as well, especially given your product portfolio. But I'm just kind of curious, given how much inventory came down in the calendar third quarter, especially in disti, when you look to sort of the December quarter guide, to what extent do you think -- or where do you think inventory is going to end up in disti by the end of the quarter? To what extent is this kind of just we got way too lean in the disti channel and you're benefiting from that versus kind of real demand in the December quarter? -- Hey, John, I'll try to take that. This is Brian. We should get some revenue growth associated with channel replenishment, and we would expect days of inventory in the channel to come up from what was an extremely low level in the September quarter. But I think in terms of trying to forecast exactly where that number lands, it's highly dependent upon resells, and that's the piece of the puzzle that is hard to forecast.So we've seen steady order trends. We've seen a very steady resell activity. But how that tracks between now and the end of the quarter is open to variability, and so that's a variable that makes it hard to pin down an answer with precision. But we would expect some tailwind from an increase in the channel inventory level. -- Yeah, I think when -- let me just add to that. I think when we discuss this internally, we said that we would improve it, but not likely to go all the way back to our target in one quarter. So hopefully that helps as well. -- Perfect. Thanks, Tunc. That's very helpful. -- Thank you, John.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay from Cowen. Your question please. -- Hi, this is Josh Buchalter on behalf of Matt. And thanks for taking my question and congrats on the solid guidance. There's been a lot of questions on inventory in the channel. I wanted to ask a bit of a longer-term one.Given the debate following a TI distribution strategy, it'd be helpful to hear, I guess, how you guys are thinking about it. And if there's any potential impact comparatively from TI's decision to deemphasize the channel. Thank you. -- Sure. I'll take that one. So there was obviously a big announcement made by Texas Instruments, like you mentioned. We -- as you know, Avnet is our franchise distribution partner.We expect the change that Texas Instruments announced to be beneficial to us, and we're discussing opportunities with Avnet. But as you know, most high-performance analog sockets are not pin-for-pin comparable. So we would not anticipate an overnight change to our business. We continue to view distribution as a valuable partner of our global reach to customers.So we think we can benefit from it. It's not going to happen quickly because of the nature of the product line that we have. But we're definitely working with our distributors to see how we can take advantage of it. -- Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. -- You're welcome. -- Thanks, Josh.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel, Nicolaus. Your question please. -- Yes, hello. This is Jeremy Kwan for Tore. I just wanted to maybe focus in on lead times. I know you mentioned it a little bit on the call, but just wondering what your customers are sharing with you in terms of their lead times on you and also what you're quoting to customers.And maybe if you can also provide a little bit color on the linearity in the quarter, how it's been thus far in the fourth quarter. -- Look, so Brian can help me out on this one. But customer-given lead times to Maxim have been fairly consistent. It's really not been changing a lot in the last few quarters so it's pretty consistent. So no behavior change from the customer standpoint.Your other question about linearity was that when we provided our guidance, we assume that bookings and the lead times we're getting from customers would be good enough to support that. And I think that this quarter is a little bit tricky because it ends in December. So it's really hard to exactly model what the linearity looks like, frankly. So I don't think we're going to be able to give you a lot of data based on that.But customer order lead times look normal and we don't see anything out of the ordinary. And I think we are starting with a pretty strong backlog for the quarter as well, as Brian mentioned earlier. -- Thank you. -- Thanks, Jeremy.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please. -- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just had one, just more kind of high level. So one thing that's kind of coming up in the semis space, it looks like legacy products are having a harder time kind of getting the components they need, whether it be MLCCs, capacitors and kind of smaller products like that.And so I'm wondering, is that potentially one of the reasons why you guys are seeing better demand because you're selling into higher-end products? Or are you guys seeing basically better demand across the board? So I guess, the crux to my question is this, you guys are seeing more upside from high-end products and that's why the gross margins went up or if it's really just a function of demand. -- I'm not sure -- we have not seen -- in all of our discussions with the sales team and the business units, we've not seen anybody bring this up as a correlation. Our products seem more demand-returning because we're in the high-performance side. I've not heard that in internal discussions so I won't to be able to really comment on that, frankly. I think that what's helping us is that we really managed through the weak period by keeping inventories low and the margins are being helped by the fact that inventories being low also helps your inventory reserves, and Brian talked about that.So it's really running a tight ship basically is what we think is happening in terms of margins. And on the demand side, I don't know how to form this correlation that you're saying might be there. It might be there or it might not be there. I'd kind of doubt it, frankly. -- Understood. Thank you. -- Welcome. -- Thanks, Mitch.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of William Stein from SunTrust. Your question please. -- Great. Thanks for taking my question. Tunc, I think you talked about strength in China and I just want to make sure I understand. I think you said it's in optical components and then also in battery management systems.Do I get that right? Or is there something else there? Is that all in the channel or any of that direct? And then also related to this, have you considered whether some of this might be pull-in relative to tariffs? Or do you think this is real demand? Thank you. -- Yes. So I think on the specific -- I think your question is mostly about the distribution end market sales. Or are you asking about the current quarter? -- Well, either I think. You mentioned these two as strengths, and I'm just not sure if I heard this as part of the distribution commentary or if this is the direct business. -- I see. OK. -- I'm curious about in China generally. Do we think that you're seeing pull-ins because of some concern about tariff rules, tariffs getting more problematic? -- Yeah. It's actually not that easy to trace it down all the way to that. The strength that we're seeing is -- in China is mostly on the battery management system products, especially this quarter. And we're seeing it on the optical products, and those are the largest ones that we see.Now I don't think those are related to tariffs. And the question that we sometimes get is the tariffs that are kind of scheduled to be added I think in mid-December, which affects a lot of consumer products. I doubt it's for that because most of our consumer shipments have already happened, and that all occurred in Q1. So we don't really see this correlation, but I have to be the first to admit, it's really hard to get this question even answered by customers because they don't want to really talk about it.So our feeling is that it's unrelated, but we can't say that definitely. -- Thank you. -- Thanks, Will.[Operator instructions] Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Harlan Sur from J.P. Morgan. Your question please. -- Yeah. Great. Thanks for taking my follow-up. So as we think about the March quarter, the two historical tailwinds for the business have been the ramp of your smartphone customer and positive seasonal trends in your industrial business.And typically, it's up quarter over quarter in March. And I know you probably don't have a lot of bookings visibility or backlog visibility for March, but what you do have is three-month and six-month customer forecasts. And so I guess the question is, without your lead handset customer but with other, let's say, positive seasonal trends in the other businesses, do you think that the seasonal pattern changes much relative to kind of historical patterns? -- Yes. Harlan, you know us pretty well. So obviously, we don't want to give guidance out to the March quarter. Historically, what you've said is not just for us but in general is true.industrial kind of gets stronger in the March quarter. Our consumer business, which was very much tied to Samsung, would get very strong in the March quarter. But I want to remind you that we have less content in Samsung now so that should not be a big effect. I mean we think that -- our projection is that our content at Samsung will be in the mid-single digits this year versus about 10% last year.I'm talking about fiscal years now. So some of the seasonality has changed, especially on the consumer side. The others, we expect to be kind of similar. But I don't think we have enough information to go -- really go beyond that to reach and give a guidance into the March quarter. -- OK. Thank you. -- Welcome. -- Thanks, Harlan.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland from Susquehanna. Your question please. -- Hi, this is David Haberle on behalf of Chris. Thanks for taking our question. Just really quick, I wanted to ask about Huawei, which last quarter you guys pointed out as a headwind for the business. Just -- is there any update there? Were you able to ship anything to them in the quarter? Just any color on the Huawei thing would be great. -- Sure, David. In the September quarter, we shipped about $1 million of revenue to Huawei. And in our December quarter forecast, we're assuming approximately the same amount of revenue. -- Is -- does that answer what you were looking for or? -- Yeah, thank you very much. -- Yeah. You're welcome. -- Thank you, David.Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Kathy for any further remarks. -- Thank you, Jonathan. That does conclude today's conference call.

(Symbol: MXIM) shares, but tentative about paying the going market price of $57.81/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal.  One interesting put contract in particular, is the December 2020 put at the $45 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $2.55.  Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 5.7% return against the $45 commitment, or a 4.6% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost).\n\n\n\nSelling a put does not give an investor access to MXIM's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised.  And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $45 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price.  ().  So unless Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. sees its shares decline 21.8% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $42.45 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $2.55 from $45), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 4.6% annualized rate of return.\n\n\n\t\t\t\tInterestingly, that annualized 4.6% figure actually exceeds the 3.3% annualized dividend paid by Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. by 1.3%, based on the current share price of $57.81.  And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to fall 21.83% to reach the $45 strike price.  \n\t\t\t\t\nAlways important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company.  In the case of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., looking at the dividend history chart for MXIM below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3.3% annualized dividend yield.\n\n\n   Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $45 strike is located relative to that history:\n  \n\n   \nThe chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the December 2020 put at the $45 strike for the 4.6% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks.  We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (considering the last 250 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $57.81) to be 32%.

If we were to summarize last quarter's results and our outlook, our June quarter results met our expectations, while reduced both internal and distribution channel inventory.Given the soft environment, we will continue to tightly manage inventory and spending in the September quarter. Today we announced the 4% increase in our dividend reflecting our continued commitment to return cash to shareholders and confidence in our long-term outlook. Let me now provide more detail on June results and current quarter outlook. As a reminder, our historical seasonality from the June to September quarter has been flat revenue.However, this year, we accept our September to be lower than seasonal due to lower revenue from Samsung, Huawei and battery management systems' customers. I'll next provide color by end market, and I will start with automotive. In the June quarter, our Automotive business was up 2% from the same quarter last year despite a significant year-over-year decline in global car production. This decline impacted our infotainment and auto body electronics businesses, and was offset by strength in battery management system products for electric vehicles and growth in driver assistance revenue.In the September quarter, we anticipate a slow quarter driven by an expected soft environment for automotive production units. In battery management systems for electric vehicles, we are forecasting lower shipments given the market uncertainty in China due to changing subsidies and lower auto demands from consumers. However, we still anticipate year-over-year growth -- revenue growth in electric vehicle BMS products in the September quarter. Looking forward, we have a growing pipeline of design wins in serial link products for parking assistance.Over the last few years, we have won surround-view sockets at nine Chinese OEMs, some of whom have started production with our products. In China, we also have design-win traction for our next-generation serial link products that enable high-resolution displays and camera systems. The first of these customers have started receiving production shipments of these serial link products. Additionally, for automotive lighting, we are introducing new products for LED-adaptive lighting applications, as well as driver monitoring systems.Maxim's products were driving monitoring work with our serial link technology for ADAS applications that comply with the highest automotive safety integrity loss. These new LED lighting products are currently initial production and are expected to reach volume production in the next few years. Fiscal '19 was a record year for automotive design wins. During the fiscal year, we won close to $1.1 billion in our pipeline of new design wins, which was up 26% from the prior fiscal year.Let me next turn to the industrial market. In the June quarter, industrial was down 20% from the same quarter last year reflecting the soft demand environment. Within distribution, global resales were seasonally up. In the September quarter, we expect continued seasonality in industrial and roughly flat sequential resales in distribution, with the overall business at a significantly lower level than last year.We remained disciplined with channel inventory as we maintained inventory days around our target of 60. Bruce will provide further details on the distribution business right after me. Let me next discuss communications and data center. In the June quarter, comms and data center was down 23% from the same quarter last year.As we expected, we saw lower demand for 100G laser driver products for optical modules used in hyper scale intra-data center applications. Year-on-year revenues also declined in a broad base of building block products. In the September quarter, we anticipate comms and data center revenue to be down sequentially with strong growth in 100G laser driver shipments offset by declines at Huawei and weakness in a broad base of building block products. Our customers are indicating that their excess inventory of 100G laser drivers and modules has been reduced, and we are starting to see customers placing orders for our products.Finally, let me turn to consumer. In the June quarter, consumer was down 7% from the same quarter last year. The weakness in smartphones, partially offset by growth in wearables and peripherals. Smartphones comprise less than half of our consumer business in the quarter.Going forward, we expect Samsung consumer revenue to decline from approximately 10% of our total revenue in the fiscal '19, to a mid-single-digit percentage of total revenue in fiscal '20 due to lower content and unit shipments. In the September quarter, Samsung revenue is expected to decline over 50% from the same quarter last year. Despite the head -- the smartphone headwind, we expect consumer to be up sequentially due to growth in our broad base consumer business in gaming, peripherals, wearables and tablets. To summarize, we have built Maxim to be successful in any environment, including the current downturn and to position the company to outperform in the next market upturn.We are growing content and new design wins in long product life cycle end market, such as automotive and industrial. Our analog business model and flexible manufacturing strategy enables our consistent company profitability and stability. All of this results in strong, predictable free cash flow. This enables us to increase our dividend again this year as we have consistently done each year for the last decade.About an hour ago, we released the announcement that Brian White will be our next chief financial officer. So this will likely be our last earnings report with Bruce on the call. I want to make -- to recognize Bruce's contributions to me and to Maxim. I feel very fortunate to have had Bruce, at my side, as a trusted partner for over 11 years.He's been instrumental in driving many of our initiatives and together we've structurally improved Maxim for strong performance over the long term. In addition to the benefits of Bruce's financial acumen, he has consistently delivered on the operational front while looking out for the best interest of employees. I would also like to thank our shareholders and the investment community for their support as we make this important transition. Now, I'll turn the call over to Bruce, one last time. -- Thanks, Tun\u00e7. Much appreciated. And thank you to everyone on the call today. I'm very pleased to welcome Brian White to the Maxim team.As announced today, he will join Maxim on August 12 and become CFO after we file our 10-K. Brian's successful run as CFO of IDT and his 30 years of industry experience make him uniquely qualified to lead Maxim going forward. Turning to our results, revenue for Q4 was $557 million, in line with expectations, up 3% sequentially and down 12% from the same quarter a year ago. While this is clearly the soft demand, Maxim is built to perform in any environment.Our trailing 12-month free cash flow was $793 million and was 34% of trailing 12-month period. In fiscal 2019, we exceeded our commitment to return 125% of free cash flow to shareholders. Today, we announce that we will increase our dividend by 4% despite the soft business environment. In fiscal 2020, we plan to, again, return 125% or more of free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases.Our revenue mix by major markets in Q4 was approximately 29% industrial, 25% automotive, 25% consumer, 17% comm and cata center and 4% computing. Our industrial and automotive businesses comprise 54% of our revenue in the quarter. Starting in Q1 -- starting in our Q1 earnings report, we will be using an automated system to map revenue to end markets. As most of you know, end market mapping can be a challenge in our industry given that we have thousands of products and thousands of customers.This updated mapping will result in some changes to our revenue breakout by end market starting next quarter. However, as we looked at sequential trends from Q4 to Q1 in both the current and the new system, today's guidance is the same regardless of the system use. As an aid for investors, when we make this change, we will provide four quarters of history. However, for the time being, all of today's commentary references the existing mapping.Also, because the computing segment is small and is not an R&D focus area for Maxim, next quarter, we will be combining computing with the communications and data center segment, enabling us to combine PCs and peripherals into the same category as servers. Let me now turn to the distribution channel. Distribution comprised 50% of Maxim's revenue in Q4. I'm pleased to announce that we ended the quarter with 59 days of inventory in the channel, down from 64 days in the prior quarter.Channel inventory dollars were flat from their prior quarter while resales were up 8% sequentially. This inventory performance demonstrates our commitment to closely manage inventory in the distribution channel and partner with our distributors to maximize performance in the current uncertain environment. We're committed to maintain our current channel inventory around 60 days. Turning to the P&L.Maxim's gross margin, excluding special items, was 64.8%, up 100 basis points from the prior quarter with the increase driven by higher revenue and lower inventory reserves. Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $180 million, down from the prior quarter and below our guidance, reflecting tight cost controls. Q4 GAAP operating income, excluding special items, was $180 million. Operating margin was 32% of revenue, up from the prior quarter due to higher gross margin.Q4 GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, was 14%. GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.57, in line with expectations. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Overall, total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $1.9 billion flat with the prior quarter.Q4 inventory days ended at 114, down 12 days from Q3 and inventory dollars were down 10% from the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $31 million in the quarter. Trailing 12-month free cash flow was $793 million or 34% of revenue, which is down 15% year over year on an adjusted basis or up 5% on an unadjusted basis. Adjusted fiscal 2018 free cash flow excludes the one-time tax payment of $178 million in Q4 '18.Our free cash flow per share was $2.87. Our free cash flow yield is 4.4% at yesterday's closing stock price. For capital return share repurchases $102 million in Q4 as we bought back approximately 1.8 million shares. Dividends totaled $125 million in the quarter based on yesterday's closing stock price and our increased dividend of $0.48 per share, our dividend yield is 3%.Our beginning Q1 backlog was $391 million. Based on this, beginning backlog and expected turns, we forecast Q4 revenue of 510 to $550 million. Q1 gross margin, excluding special items, is forecasted at 63 to 65%, down from Q4 due to lower revenue and lower utilization of our internal fab as we perform facility upgrades. Q1 operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be in the low 180s due to continued tight cost controls.Our tax rate for Q1, excluding special items, is expected to be 14% flat with the prior quarter. For Q1 GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.46 to $0.52. For FY '20, we expect capital expenditures to be down from the prior year near the midpoint of our targeted range of 1 to 3% of revenue as we complete facility upgrades at our internal fab. We've returned 132% of free cash flow in fiscal 2019.In fiscal 2020, we again plan to return 125% or more of free cash flow to investors. In summary, given the current environment, we are tightly managing spending and inventory both internally and in the channel. We continue to invest in our long-term secular growth drivers of automotive, industrial and data center. Our financial model enables us to generate strong, consistent cash flow in any environment as evidenced by our commitment to return 125% or more of free cash flow to investors and the increase in our dividend announced today.And finally, as this is my last earnings conference call, I want to thank all our investors and sell-side analysts for their support over my nearly 12 years at Maxim. It has been a great honor to be part of the Maxim team. I am proud of our many accomplishments as we transform Maxim. At Maxim, we truly make a difference for our customers, our shareholders, our employees and the communities where we operate.I'm highly confident that Tun\u00e7, Brian and the 7,000 Maxim employees will continue to maximize value for all our stakeholders. Thank you. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Kathy. -- Thanks, Bruce. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now open the call for questions. We'd like to continue the same Q&A process that we've used in previous calls. We'll take one question from each caller so we can get to as many people as possible.\u00a0 Jonathan, could we please have our first question?[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question please. -- Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. And before I do that, just wanted to say that, congrats, and goodbye, Bruce. It's been a pleasure working with you.So for Tun\u00e7 and/or Bruce just wanted to talk about the general environment. Last quarter, stabilization was kind of a word that was used on your call. And it seems like things have taken another step down. So whether you want to split it into the various end markets or just in aggregate, can you just talk about what changed from one quarter to next? Is it just the China trade? Is it Huawei? If you want to size that? Or are there other dynamics that we should appreciate? -- So Ross, I'll take that one and Bruce can add if he wishes. So we did say that the demand seems to stabilize. We didn't say there was a rebound last time. The demand is stabilized at a lower level than it's used to, and it remained soft across all end markets.Basically, what we had said that we kind of saw seasonal patterns. And except for a few exceptions that I'm going to mention, things do still look seasonal. So if you break it down by market, industrial is seasonal from fiscal Q4 to Q1 so -- but there is no rebound, frankly. Automotive was up in Q4 but down more than seasonal in Q1.And this is being impacted a lot by the BMS uncertainty I talked about in my prepared remarks. Customers are starting to order again in data center optical, so that's going to help out. But the comms infrastructure and there's broad base weakness on the communication side, and this is impacted a lot by Huawei. So in essence, on Huawei, we have -- for most of our products, we actually are able to shift, but Huawei is kind of realigning their demand.And we don't really have good visibility from a backlog standpoint as to what they want. So to be on the safe side, we've basically taken their forecast way down. And that means that they're kind of roughly having an effect of about $10 million or so in the quarter. And in consumer, our broad market business is up strongly, which is good in tablets, variables and gaming.But this is offset by lower content in Samsung phones. So those three effects combined which were, just to remind you again, BMS uncertainty, Huawei uncertainty, and the Samsung content and unit introduction may contribute about $30 million or so. So that's the biggest weakness that you are seeing, but the rest of it is kind of seasonal, kind of pretty similar to what we've said in the previous quarter. Hope that gave you some color.And Bruce, I don't know if you want to add anything. -- No. I think you said it well, Tun\u00e7. I will just add, three-year seasonality for the September quarter, it's flat. And it's actually really pretty consistent there, so we would have started at about 560,\u00a0 it has been normal.And then there's kind of the 30 million\u00a0 a third, a third, a third that Tun\u00e7 just outlined. That really kind of put us where we are at today. -- Yeah. Thank youOur next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JP Morgan. Your question please. -- Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. And Bruce, thank you very much for all your support over the years and I wish you well in retirement. To follow-up on the last question, maybe this is more specifically an industrial. It looks like in the June quarter, industrial didn't grow as strongly as you anticipated.And I know you are guiding industrial down again, sequentially, in this December quarter, kind of seasonal, but that seems to be off of the June quarter that was a bit weaker than expected. So can you just help us understand, maybe a little bit more in detail, what happened from back in late April when factory automation trends were picking up, you were seen broad recovery across some of the geographies. I think even your SMB catalog business was seeing some good demand trends as well. So maybe you can just provide us a bit more color on what happened as the quarter progressed? -- Yeah. So when we look at our industrial business -- and you're right, we guided industrial up strongly in the June quarter. And we had talked about that -- a lot of that had been off of kind of a weak March, where we kind of took our medicine in bringing down our disti channel inventory. So industrial was up sequentially, in line with probably similar or normal seasonality for the June quarter.But it wasn't up strongly so it did come in a little bit weaker. And as we saw the overall business, and clearly, our order patterns have stabilized, but we haven't really seen a pickup in industrial. As similar to what we did in the March quarter, we brought channel inventory down again, right? This time from 64 days down to 59. So -- and you saw basically resales were up 8% and we kept inventory in the channel flat.So basically, we are under-shipping demand in order to aggressively get our channel inventory down. So I think it's just a combination of, we haven't seen any form of, kind of, rebound in industrial. We haven't seen it really getting weaker, but this combination of, sort of, kind of flat order flow at a lower level combined with managing channel inventory, really kind of resulted in coming in a little bit lighter than we thought. When we look at the September quarter, again, we're seeing it down, but in line with normal seasonality, actually, nothing unusual there.The challenge, of course, is it's offset much lower base and I think we are looking for when that balance's going to come back, and I think we haven't seen that yet. -- Yeah, we haven't seen it yet. Yes, let me add a little bit to that. So we haven't seen that yet. We've probed a few customers to see how they're doing on their inventory levels.And some of them are -- they're still saying they are working down inventory, by the way, and they expect that those inventory reductions to, kind of, get back to normal levels sometime in the late second half of the year. That's not a broad survey, that's a few customers we asked, but that's the answer that we got. -- Great. Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Your question please. -- Hi. Thank you very much. And Bruce, thanks. It's been a pleasure.Wish you all the best and you're leaving behind big shoes to fill here. For my question, I wanted to go into factory loadings, and maybe I missed it last quarter. What is this facility upgrade? And what's the impact of that on margins? And how should we think about -- well, what's the playbook now? Are you reducing loadings further as you look out? It looks like definitely more prolonged downturn than you might have been thinking 90 days ago. -- Yeah. So we had -- if you look at our capex, we came in above our 1 to 2% model. I think we came in -- I think it was around about 3.6% capex as a percent of revenue. And we had identified that we were making some uptake to our loan remaining quiz to the electrical systems, to the water systems.And so we were spending that money in FY '19 to do that. We've completed the bulk of that work. We got it done, kind of, on schedule. And during the, kind of, July four time period, in essence, we shut the fab down for two weeks.And that really, kind of, lowered our moves in the fab by about 15% during that time period. And so that certainly had an impact. I think it's maybe 20, 30 bips. So that's just one of the reasons, certainly, that's causing us not to be quite as strong as we have before.Obviously, the lower revenue in our desire -- you saw that just overall in addition to the fab shutdown, you saw that in the June quarter, right, we took overall inventory down by 12 days, right? From 126 down to 114. So again, that's just us setting ourselves up for as things come back, we're going to have lean inventory. We're not going to have to -- we're going to be able to see the immediate benefit as revenue comes back from a margin point of view. -- Thank you.\u00a0Our next question comes from the line of someone from Vivek Arya from BMO \u2013 B of A, sorry. Your question please. -- No problem. This is Jamie Zakalik on for Vivek. Could you talk a little bit about the competitive environment in the BMS market. Do you see increased competition in that market? And is the weakness in the September quarter due also to this macro softness that you're seeing? Or could it be more competitive positioning? -- Yeah, so I'll comment about that. This is Tun\u00e7. So first of all, BMS is part of the Automotive market where market share changes relatively slowly, so you don't really see it in one or two quarters. The -- we've grown the BMS business significantly over the -- I don't know if you recall, but last -- in the second half of last year, we were talking about year-over-year growth rates that were 50 to 75%, which is huge.What's changed now is the fact that there's been a change in the way the subsidies are paid out in China. And we think that that will have maybe a dampening of the sale of the cars, and taking that into consideration, we reduced our forecast for that market. Now having said that, No. 1, we're still growing in the mid-20s year over year.I would still a call that pretty healthy growth even though we're seeing this quarter-over-quarter deceleration. And the second part of that is, overall the subsidies will have an effect, but the Chinese government still has their policy or their objective is to grow electric vehicles from about 1.1 million couple of years ago, to almost 2 million in the next couple of years. So I think the demand is going to be healthy. We just didn't know how to forecast what was going to happen on consumer behavior.In terms of competitiveness, I think we have a strong product portfolio. The products are very robust and in terms of ASIL D or safety requirements that our customers like that, plus the fact that we have tremendous history with the products. They have been used for years by our customers, which means that there's less risk from a customer standpoint. So this is -- I hope that I gave some color on what it is that caused us to essentially forecast BMS revenue to be down quarter over quarter.As I said before, it's still up, mid 20% year over year. Hopefully, that helps. Thank you, Jamie.Our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your question please. -- Yeah, thank you. Question on the industrial market. Understanding that it's weak demand, and inventories coming down, but just more so from a design perspective, are you seeing customers pause at all in terms of how they look at new design opportunities? If you give any color on that. -- We -- you're talking about the design win activity? Is that -- you're asking about that, I assume? -- Yes. -- No, we are not seeing that. Things are as robust as they've ever been in terms of them looking for products that help them build more productive factories. So that really has not changed. The level of interest in our communications products and our high-efficiency, small power supply products, that's very robust and customers are asking us for more advanced parts, frankly, and helping us define newer generation products as well.So despite the fact that there's a slowdown that we're observing, the design of new generation of factory automation products at our customers continues to be very robust. -- Got it. Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Your question please. -- Hey, guys. This is Tom O'Malley on for Blayne Curtis. And I just wanted to echo the sentiment from others, and thank Bruce. But my question here is on December.Moving forward, I know there's not much visibility in the market right now. But can you kind of do your best to quantify what you think is normal seasonal for December? And just any kind of color you have on the moving pieces there, just to better give us the feel of how you guys are viewing the end of the year -- the calendar year? -- Yeah. And so, I think we all know, this isn't a normal time period right now. And so, from that point of view, but I mean you just -- as the highest level kind of by the end market, if you look back historically, usually consumer is seasonally down after a strong September. And we're seeing certainly a good September, take out Samsung, and our broad base business is doing very well.Industrial is usually, kind of, seasonally flat. And -- but again, we've talked about the industrial business, where it's kind of waiting, it's kind of very stable, but we haven't seen the rebound yet. Automotive is usually seasonally up as people start shipping in advance. And then, of course, comms and data center is not seasonal.And that's going to be depended on what's happening to this kind of rebound or this kind of start of reordering on the data center continue. And then, of course, what happens with Huawei would be the other kind of open question that we have. So if you think about some of the several items that we've, kind of, called out this quarter, I think, all of those are going to be open questions for December as well. Thank you, Tom.Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your question please. -- Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Bruce, thank you for all the help through the years and enjoy the retirement.I guess my question going back to the consumer market and the smartphone market in general. I guess despite really good efforts to diversify away from smartphones and that bucket and the largest customer, Samsung, it still feels like that's a headwind. So I'm kind of curious from here, philosophically, is that a market and a customer that you still think is important to support going forward? Or help us understand, can you reallocate resources or take further cost out of the model as you continue to try to deemphasize that part of the business? -- Well, from an -- OK so your questions are more about R&D investment. I mean in essence, at that 1 large customer, we've got sockets where we add value and our customer cares about it. The level of investment that's required on this -- we have some big programs, not really very high. Our resources, our R&D investment really has been mostly in product lines that are more general-purpose and diversify to all the other markets that we talk about, like hearables and variables and peripherals and gaming and so on.So a lot of the shifts have already occurred in terms of R&D investment. So what we really look at, John, is to see what the return on investment is going to be. We have a bar that's higher for short-lived products in terms of returns than our other product areas. So really, we don't see a need to really make some major investment changes in terms of research and development.And most of our investments have been in other areas of Consumer for a while now. So I think the changes, maybe, you're suggesting are kind of behind this already in terms of what we've done in the past year or so. -- Yeah. And John, just to put some numbers to that on just the business side, I mean, in Q4, right, basically consumer was flat. But we had, obviously, smartphone and Samsung down significantly while our broad market businesses: gaming, variables, tablets, was up 30% quarter over quarter. So we did see some strong growth there.And when we look at the September quarter, again, we're seeing, sort of, our consumer business at Samsung up 15% sequentially, so we are seeing that. And, again, that assumes that we made that shift in R&D and focus several years ago, and we're seeing that benefit. Obviously, as we've kind of taken this step from Samsung being a, kind of, roughly called -- roughly a 10% customer down to a mid-single-digit. You see that that one step down, but I think the strategy to move to broad-based consumer, that's -- it's working very effectively as we are able to continue to compete consumer flat and sequentially in June and still grow it in September despite the significant takedown from Samsung.Thank you, John.Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay from Cowen. Your question please. -- Hi. This is Josh Buchalter on behalf of Matt. Let me echo my congrats to Bruce, and best of luck to Brian. So I guess despite the revenue softness, your gross margins have held up comparatively well compared to past cycles.I was hoping you could talk about some of the measures you've taken here? And how your fab-light model plays into this. And also, assuming that we're now shipping closer to end demand you should -- current levels represent roughly the bottom. -- Yeah. So I think if you look at gross margin and part of our transformation was -- we really went from a company that when I joined almost 12 years ago, we were about 85, 90% internal fab-sourced, and today, we are about 25%. So we really shifted to a much more variable model. And kind of one of the ways that we've tried to capture this is, 10 years ago, when the recession, and we were this kind of 85% internal.For a 10% drop in revenue, we probably would have lost about five points of gross margin. Today with the, kind of, the outsourced model, for that same 10% drop in revenue, we loose about one to two points of gross margin from utilization. And if we kind of test that against our results here, it actually -- the model is holding up. We're a little -- we're on the high end of that -- of the range of the 1 to 2%, but part of that is just simply because we're also trying to reduce DOI at the same time, right? And so, we're starting late for this below demand.And then we've seen little bit -- the other element is, we've seen a little bit higher inventory reserve on a year-over-year basis, again, because of the slowdown. But we still feel very confident in our gross margin story. We think we can get back to our range of 67 to 70%. We can get -- we think we get back there, something, a little bit over 600 million and feel good about that.And we believe that the growth drivers or the tailwinds for our gross margin are still absolutely in place, right? Whether that continuing to drive put more wafers through our long fab up in Oregon, whether that through kind of been able to kind of -- for the rest of our foundry network, kind of, optimize that for the lowest cost. The move to distribution into SMB and the favorable pricing environment, all those tailwinds are still in place and we still feel very good and just the fact that we are able -- in sort of the current environment, we are still at 64, 65%, feels very good to us. And it's been a good stress test for the model, and we're looking forward to, kind of, moving that gross margin backup as revenue inevitably returns. -- Thank you, guys.Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg Stifel. Your question please. -- Yeah. Thank you. Welcome to Brian. And congratulations to Bruce, you're an exemplary CFO and really appreciate you over all these years.I had a question back on distribution. It just feels a little bit like the disti channel is trying to lower inventories perhaps even more than where demand is. I mean I know, obviously, your resales were pretty strong, but am I sort of perceiving that the wrong way? -- I think, candidly, I think, our senses were probably being a little bit more aggressive on reducing inventory. That's something I have a strong belief about. And so we've been kind of pushing to lower, I would say, in some situation, in Asia, particularly, I think distributors want to carry a little extra inventory, whether that is in support of kind of larger OEMs, whether it's in automotive, whether it's in gaming, and as the data center starts to come back. So we've -- I would say that that push to kind of manage inventory within the kind of the area of around 60 days is more from Maxim.And especially, on a sell-in basis, you just don't want to get caught with too much inventory in a cyclical business. And -- so we've been managing that. And as you said, basically, we had good resales, up 8%, normal seasonality is up 5. So I think that was positive.And we've pretty much saw strength. China was up 14%, Japan, up 16%, Taiwan, up 6%. These were -- Asia was reasonably comfortable from that point of view. And we just used that opportunity to kind of manage our shipments in, in order to bring down the overall channel DOI. -- Very helpful. Thank you. -- Yep. Thank you, Tore.Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your question please. -- Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. This is Charles Long on for Toshiya. And also Bruce, congrats.Good luck in all your future endeavors. I just had a quick question on the overall hyperscale environment. I was wondering how you would characterize it as it stands today? And if you've got any visibility on potential pickup or stronger trends in that end market? -- All right. So the larger portion of our hyperscale business currently is actually on the optical side. And on the optical side, there was a growth in inventory that occurred last year. And what we're seeing is, my commentary is going to be limited mostly to that piece of the business.And that inventory took quite a while, multiple quarters, to actually work itself down. So what we're seeing from the module customers that we sell into and then the module customers sell to the hyperscale end customers, they're pretty much indicating to us that their inventory levels are now coming back to normal, and they've started placing orbs. So that is not a direct implication about the hyperscale customers because there's another, somebody else in the way that's also billing inventories. So -- but it does indicate that if there was extra inventory at the end hyperscale customers, a lot of that must have been consumed as well.So that's kind of the extent of our knowledge, or look into the cloud customers. I don't know how much that helps but that's all we can really say. -- Got it. Thank you. -- Thank you, Charles.Our next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. Your question please. -- I just wanted to circle back to the auto and industrial piece. I think there is a little bit of concern that that's going to, kind of, be a longer, I guess, semi cycle downturn and then there's a lot of concern around the, kind of, share shift. So how would I think about you guys in current position Auto and industrial. Do you guys think you're gaining share in that space? What do you think the underlying growth rate is for both those end markets? -- So let me just talk about automotive first. So in the automotive market, we -- for many years, we actually were growing faster than the market growth, and we project that we still will grow faster than market growth, mainly because of two major growth drivers for us. One of them being the BMS market and the second one being the serial link products, or the ADAS products, that the company is making. So those two, I think, are still robust areas where we have a strong position, as well as a strong pipeline of products.Not to mention the strong design wins that I talked about that we registered throughout the year. The infotainment piece will probably grow at similar rates as infotainment content in cars. And I think that's still pretty robust. It's more than the automotive unit sales growth.So I think automotive, we're going to do well -- but especially in markets where we have a large revenue content, which is infotainment and auto body electronics, we will be impacted by auto car production in the world. And right now, that's kind of going through a negative growth period. But I think eventually people will buy cars, so it will recover. And I think we'll be able to grow because of the two growth drivers I mentioned.We'll be able to grow faster than the market grows. -- Got it, perfect. And then, just a quick clarifying on what you guys think how long this cycle is going to last, turns into auto industrial? -- So that is -- that's always a dangerous thing to predict. We -- it's not very easy to do. We look at charts to see how we can predict that, but it's pretty elusive. I think there are just too many external factors that are affecting it.And -- but those factors are bringing what's happening with trade, what's going on with China. Those are all kind of affecting both the automotive par, as well as the industrial part of the business significantly. So we were not going to -- of course, Bruce can take this risk and predict it, but from my point of view, it's very difficult to say where the end is. The metrics that we watch for is, what kind of bookings are we getting? But that only gives you a three-month view.And we ask questions to our customers about inventory levels because -- and I gave you some color on the industrial inventory answers we got from just a handful, maybe two or three customers. But other than that we don't have a clear view of when the cycle finally ends, but it will end someday. Thank you, Mitch.Our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse from Evercore. Your question please. -- Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. And Bruce, let me echo everyone else's thoughts.You'll be missed. Quick follow-up question on Huawei. You talked about into September, declines at Huawei, as well as weakness broad-based products. I'm just curious here, you also said that you're able to shift most products to Huawei.So do you have disproportionate share to Huawei? Or is the entire supply chain influx given the uncertainty of whether business will move to other players? Can you provide a little bit more color on how we should be thinking about the uncertainty there? And when you think we'll have better visibility to end demand and growth drivers there going forward? -- Yeah. So I mean when we think about Huawei, and we've said this before, they're about 2% of revenue. I think about that kind of like 50 million a year, kind of, number. We were able to -- as Tun\u00e7 said, we've been generally able to ship product, kind of, within the rules, and in essence, didn't seen much impact in the June quarter.When we look at September and we kind of talk to Huawei and talk within the channel, what we see is, basically, Huawei is trying to, kind of, sort through their supply chain and try to figure out what backlog do they want to play. And I think it's the whole combination. What's their demand? What's their inventory level? Just the availability of the entire BOM and we just saw a lot of uncertainty there. And so, in essence, we almost zeroed out Huawei.I think we left a small amount in there, but as Tun\u00e7 said, it's probably down $10 million quarter over quarter, which if you think about $50 million on a run rate, that's most of it. There could be upsize. We're obviously continuing to meet with Huawei and understand what their demand is, but I think just from being prudent, from a forecast point of view, we know we just took that number down. I'm not going to try to predict what happens with that situation on a, kind of, on a geopolitical basis.That's well, well beyond my capabilities. But for now, we kind of guided -- as we always do to what we kind of think we can say confidently and investors can count on. And so that's kind of what we've done. I think for the broader comm and data center, outside of Huawei, obviously, Tun\u00e7 talked about data center.We've definitely seen orders coming back there. And so that business is up strongly, sequentially, but of course, it's still down year over year. And then on the overall comm market, again, I think similar to industrial, I think we still see kind of stable order flow but at a much lower level, right? So that's kind of that broad base weakness similar to what we've seen in industrial. It's stable, but we haven't seen, kind of, signs of that recovery yet.Thank you CJ.Our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso from Raymond James. Your question please. -- Yeah, thank you. And I'll certainly echo my congratulations to Bruce, it's been a pleasure. The question is on the comments on the Samsung business. And you had some earlier comments as that drops to 5% of revenue in fiscal '20.I guess the question is, once it gets down to that 5% level, what's left? And from there, based on the R&D and design work you had, are you -- do you expect to grow that business? Is that kind of just a steady-state business to that point? Or at that revenue level, do some of the variables and non-handset parts of the business allow it to grow going forward? -- Yeah. So I don't know if we're giving the wrong impression here, but Samsung is still a very valued customer, and we continue to support them in their design of their products. And they buy more than just smartphone products from us, by the way, not single product company. So from our viewpoint though, when we see opportunities, we want to be careful that we're doing something special in terms of performance for them.And from our viewpoint, if we find those types of opportunities and the return on investment makes sense, we definitely will go for those sockets. But in terms of forecasting next year and so on, we wanted to make sure that we gave what we felt was the most likely outcome, what's going to happen next year. But I don't want anybody to have the impression that we're -- we don't value that customer. We do.There've been a good partner to us for many years and we'll continue to sell or market our products to them just like we ever have, and continue on that. Whether they will grow or not, time is going to show. And it might or it might not. And in terms of basically the product that we have forecasted for next year, it's product that they've used for many years, and it's one they value when they see the performance advantages from Maxim.So we believe they're going to continue to use it. -- Thank you, guys.Our next question comes from the line of William Stein from SunTrust. Your question please. -- Great. Thanks for taking my question. And Bruce, I'll echo my congratulations. Question on the M&A environment.Maxim has not participated recently, although in the past it had, and there's been some incremental level deal flow in the last few months. And I'm wondering to what degree Maxim would consider participating? -- Yeah. I mean our M&A stand really has not changed. We're -- we continue to look for any companies or product lines for that matter at other companies where they will be accretive to us. They'll -- after we go through and work through the integration, they will be not dilutive to our great margin structure.And in the end, we don't want to overpay. So especially on that last part, you're going to see with stock prices at these levels, it makes it pretty difficult to find a good fit to Maxim. But as I said, we're -- we still look. We have a corporate business development group, and we look at what the assets are that we can purchase and see if we can add revenue and free cash flow that way as well. -- Great. Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Cody Acree from Loop Capital. Your question please. -- Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. And Bruce, congrats, and thanks for all the time over the years. I guess just your thoughts on opex.It sounds like things might be uncertain for quite some time. And maybe Brian will have different thoughts later, but what are your current thinking around the opex for next year? -- Yeah. So I think as you've seen, we tightly control opex. We kind of keep it in line with revenue. We are usually -- in this period of, kind of, a slowdown, it usually come in underneath our forecast a little bit.It's a very experienced management team. We've all been in the industry. We all understand cycles. And so usually before my team can go out and revise targets, the management teams already are kind of lowering spending and controlling areas.That said, I think it's important to highlight that we are absolutely continuing to invest in our growth areas, right? We continue to invest in whether that in the industrial and factory automation or whether it's automotive, whether it's in the data center. Even in -- to the extent, sort of a broad-based consumer business. And so, we understand those. We're good at making choices and kind of doing our ZBB and drawing the line of where we invest, but you've got to believe what's going to drive growth in the future is above the line and we're continuing to invest and we're just pretty good at continuing to take the more discretionary items and being pretty tight on those.As far as the model goes, our standard model's always been to grow at about half the rate of revenue. And I think that's how we'll continue to look at opex going forward. But as we've said like in the overall environment, it is difficult to predict what's going to happen on the revenue side, but those things we control whether it's opex, whether it's spending within our fabs, whether it's inventory on our own books, inventory in the channel, all those things within our control, we're going to tightly manage. That's that.We continue to generate 34% free cash flow margin in a downturn and we'll, obviously, generate much more than that on a -- in the upturn. -- Thank you much. -- Thank you, Cody.Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland from Susquehanna. Your question please. -- It's David Haberle on behalf of Chris. You mentioned a pipeline of new automotive design wins of 1.1 billion in 2019 and that it's up strongly year over year. Can you give us a sense of your expectations for how this pipeline ultimately converts into revenue? And then also, which products make up the bulk of the 1.1 billion? Whether it's growth opportunities such as BMS and ADAS or more legacy type of auto products? -- Yeah. So OK, so first of all, the pipeline, obviously, is the lifetime revenue you get from those design wins. Maybe I wasn't that clear about that. So how it distributes kind of depends on the particular design win, some products have design wins with longer lives than others.Much of this win is in the areas that I mentioned before. I think if you look at them, their serial link was area wins, automotive power products whether whichever end function they go into or a big portion of it, and BMS also was large. So it's all in the expected areas of the design wins. And I think that, we're -- and the growth, as I said, was about 20, 26% year over year.So all that kind of signals that we're going to have robust growth once the automotive production kicks back in line with what the long term growth rate has been, which is in the 2 or 3% unit growth, in the high single digits for content growth, and we think we're going to grow better than that, so still in the low teens is our expectation. But most of those assignments came exactly is the areas that we were investing in, which should be no surprise. And they were kind of all over the world, so there's no single region where they were concentrated in either. So that's why we are feeling very good about future growth in automotive. -- Thank you. -- Thank you, David.And I'm not showing any further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to hand the program back to Kathy for any further remarks. -- Thank you, Jonathan. That does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and for your interest in Maxim.[Operator signoff] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

(Symbol: MXIM) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.84), with the stock changing hands as low as $61.03 on the day.  Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return.  To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) back on 12/31/1999 \u2014 you would have paid $146.88 per share.  Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years.  But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%.  Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable.

(Symbol: MXIM) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.\n\n\n\nIn general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company.

Now though, in an oversold market,  (NASDAQ:) is looking less like a casualty of the trade war and more like a sector standout off and on the AMD stock chart. Let me explain.\nSource: \n\tMonday picked up right where a market drubbing last week left off, sans Friday\u2019s miraculous late session, tweet-inspired rally. And that\u2019s to say, the broader averages finished deep in the red. For its part, the  slid by 2.47% as the \u2018twit\u2019-for-tat gameplay of the U.S. and China\u2019s trade war worsened.Driving the price action, investors are increasingly on edge after Chinese officials promised to raise tariffs on $60 billion of American imports following the U.S. increase on $200 billion of Chinese goods from 10% to 25% on Friday.And nowhere was the selling more pronounced than in tech names like AMD stock.The tech-heavy NASDAQ tumbled 3.41%. Meanwhile, the  (NYSEARCA:) fell by 4.64%. AMD stock shed an outsized 6.15%. That was enough to allow AMD to share the top spot for worst performance among large-cap semiconductors with peers (NASDAQ:) and  (NASDAQ:).As a group, chip companies maintain an inordinate amount of revenues tied to China. Needless to say, with China manufacturing a good chunk of the end products semiconductors are used in, as well as being a massive consumers of those products as well, those sales are perceived as being increasingly at risk in today\u2019s escalating trade war.But is it really all that bad in AMD stock? As an investor I don\u2019t see it that way, despite the financial media\u2019s well-vocalized and distributed fear mongering that make the bear case seem inevitable. Sure, the trade war could get uglier. And that could negatively impact Advanced Micro Devices. But a trade agreement isn\u2019t exactly off the table, and conditions could quickly become bullish.In an uncertain environment, with AMD\u2019s recent earnings topper in hand, a big $600 million U.S. Department of Energy contract win last week and a price chart still looking very supportive for bulls, it\u2019s time to focus on going long, not giving up on AMD stock.Are conditions perfect for this sort of bullish enthusiasm in AMD stock given the market\u2019s amazing run from last December\u2019s \u2018the sky is falling\u2019 trade war-driven lows? Personally, I\u2019d want to see more investor unease or outright panic before I\u2019m convinced buying shares outright on weakness will result in a profitable position. So, I have something else in mind.Barring more extreme market behavior, which might still happen, there\u2019s still a way to prepare for buying AMD stock smartly at nearby prices that is less of a guessing game and one which stacks the odds in our favor.The strategy I\u2019m recommending is to buy AMD stock using the weekly chart and waiting for modest upside confirmation of strength. This is accomplished by purchasing shares above last week\u2019s high of $28.10. Given AMD\u2019s fairly well-supported and behaved consolidation of the past six to seven weeks, as long as last week\u2019s low of $26.03 holds, this allows investors to buy shares as the pattern\u2019s low is confirmed.Bottom line, despite an entry in a notoriously volatile stock, this strategy isn\u2019t likely to trigger unless the market is actually picking up the pieces rather than scrambling to buy more technically oversold stocks like (NASDAQ:) or (NASDAQ:. The intention is to avoid buying AMD stock during a one or two day dead cat bounce which ultimately fails. And right now that looks like smart business and certainly smarter than trying to catch a potential falling knife.Disclosure: Investment accounts under Christopher Tyler\u2019s management currently own positions in Advanced Micro Devices () and its derivatives but no other securities mentioned in this article.

Instead, Craig-Hallum analyst Anthony Stoss, who first spotted the exclusion, believes that Apple is using  's (NASDAQ: MXIM) competing codec, which processed audio for the original AirPods.Stoss believes that expectations for Apple to use Cirrus' ANC codec boosted the semiconductor supplier's stock price by more than 20% this year, and that its exclusion could cause the stock to sell off. Let's take a closer look at Cirrus' business to see if that fear is justified.Image source: Apple.Cirrus Logic produces a wide range of audio chips and amplifiers. It generates most of its revenue from chips for portable audio products, including smartphones, and a lower percentage from non-portable audio devices and other devices.Cirrus' top customer is Apple, which accounted for a whopping 83% of its revenue last quarter. Cirrus supplies the audio chips for its iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Apple's robust hardware sales in previous years were a major tailwind for Cirrus.However, iPhone sales decelerated significantly last year, due to longer upgrade cycles, high prices, and tougher competition in high-growth markets like China. Demand for iPads peaked five years ago, and the soft PC market is throttling Mac sales.Apple is pivoting its core business toward subscription services to offset that decline, and it streamlines its supply chain in two ways to boost its margins. First, it's producing more of its own components -- including its A-series systems on a chip, Bluetooth chips for its AirPods, and security chips for storing biometric data. It's also developing its own GPUs, modems, and power management chips, and recen  s indicate that it could replace  's x86 CPUs with its own custom ARM chips in future Macs.Second, Apple often splits and shuffles orders of key components between two or more manufacturers. In previous iPhone models, it shuffled its chip manufacturing orders between  and  , and its modem orders between Intel and  . Doing so arguably boosts Apple's clout in negotiations and reduces its dependence on individual partners and suppliers.Image source: Apple.Apple's strategic shift raises red flags for Cirrus. Cirrus is Apple's longtime partner, but Apple could eventually produce its own audio codecs or split its orders with a competitor like Maxim. After all, Apple has abandoned partners before. When Apple decided to produce its own graphics chip,  lost about half its annual sales. (NASDAQOTH: DLGNF) , which previously sold power management chips to Apple, also sold its patents and a portion of its business to Apple when it realized that its top customer wanted to produce in-house power management chips. Dialog, which generated about three-quarters of its revenue from Apple, preferred to raise cash and diversify its business  Imagination's fate.Apple's sluggish hardware sales will likely raise the priority of its efforts to build more components in-house. Apple's decision to use Maxim's codec again in the AirPods 2 might just be a matter of convenience, or it could be a dire warning sign.Cirrus often claims that it can diversify its core business away from Apple by selling more audio chips to Android original equipment manufacturers. Yet Apple's weight on Cirrus' top line fell only 3 percentage points annually to 83% last quarter, and no other customers accounted for over 10% of its revenue.At this point, it makes sense for Cirrus to diversify its business with investments or acquisitions. However, the company is mainly sitting still, waiting for the smartphone market to improve, and buying back shares.Cirrus repurchased $150 million in shares during the first three quarters of 2018 at an average price of $40.41, and added $200 million to its buyback program to boost its authorization to $250 million. It hasn't acquired any companies since 2015.Cirrus investors likely hoped that securing a spot in Apple's AirPods 2 could reduce its dependence on iPhones, iPads, and Macs and tighten its bond with the company. TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo estimates that Apple's AirPods shipments will rise from about 27 million units last year to 100 million to 110 million units in 2021 -- so it could become a lucrative new revenue stream for Cirrus.But there's no guarantee that Cirrus won't suffer the fate of Imagination and Dialog as Apple vertically integrates its operations. Instead of focusing on content-share gains in other Apple products, Cirrus investors need to ask whether the company can survive without its biggest customer. If not, it might be wiser to simply buy shares of Apple instead.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Cirrus supplies the audio chips for its\u00a0iPhones, iPads, and\u00a0Macs.\u00a0Apple's robust hardware sales in previous years were a major tailwind for Cirrus.However, iPhone sales decelerated significantly last\u00a0year, due to longer upgrade cycles, high prices, and tougher competition in high-growth markets like China. Demand for iPads peaked five years ago, and the soft PC market is throttling Mac sales.Apple is pivoting its core business toward subscription services to offset that decline, and it streamlines its supply chain in two ways to boost its margins. First, it's producing more ofits own components -- including its A-series systems on a chip, Bluetooth chips for its AirPods, and security chips for storing biometric data. It's also developing its own GPUs, modems, and power management chips, and recent reports indicate that it could replace 's x86 CPUs with its own custom ARM chips in future Macs.Second, Apple often splits and shuffles orders of key components between two or more manufacturers. In previous iPhone models, it shuffled its chip manufacturing orders between  and , and its modem orders between Intel and . Doing so arguably boosts Apple's clout in negotiations and reduces its dependence on individual partners and suppliers.Image source: Apple.Apple's strategic shift raises red flags for Cirrus. Cirrus is Apple's longtime partner, but Apple could eventually produce its own audio codecs or split its orders with a competitor like Maxim. After all, Apple has\u00a0abandoned partners before. When Apple decided to produce its own graphics chip,\u00a0\u00a0lost about half its annual sales., which previously sold power management chips to Apple, also\u00a0sold its patents and a portion of its business to Apple when\u00a0it realized that its top customer wanted to produce in-house power management chips. Dialog, which generated about three-quarters of its revenue from Apple, preferred to raise cash and diversify its business\u00a0 Imagination's fate.Apple's sluggish hardware sales will likely raise the priority of its efforts to build more components in-house. Apple's decision to use Maxim's codec again in the AirPods 2 might just be a matter of convenience, or it could be a dire warning sign.Cirrus often claims that it can diversify its core business away from Apple by selling more audio chips to Android original equipment manufacturers. Yet Apple's weight on Cirrus' top line fell only 3 percentage points annually to 83% last quarter, and no other customers accounted for over 10% of its revenue.At this point, it makes sense for Cirrus to diversify its business with investments or acquisitions. However, the company is mainly sitting still, waiting for the smartphone market to improve, and buying back shares.Cirrus repurchased $150 million in shares during the first three quarters of 2018 at an average price of $40.41, and added $200 million to its buyback program to boost its authorization to $250 million. It hasn't acquired any\u00a0companies since 2015.Cirrus investors likely hoped that securing a spot in Apple's AirPods 2 could reduce its dependence on iPhones, iPads, and Macs and tighten its bond with the company. TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo estimates that Apple's AirPods shipments will rise from about 27 million units last year to 100 million to 110 million units in 2021 -- so it could become a lucrative new revenue stream for Cirrus.But there's no guarantee that Cirrus won't suffer the fate of Imagination and Dialog as Apple vertically integrates its operations. Instead of focusing on content-share gains in other Apple products, Cirrus investors need to ask whether the company can survive without its biggest customer. If not, it might be wiser to simply buy shares of Apple instead.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

However, as Craig-Hallum's analysts observe, , the codec inside of the latest AirPods -- marked as the Apple 338S00420 -- looks similar to the\u00a0 98730EWJ audio codec found inside of the first-generation AirPods.Image source: Apple.This, the analysts conclude, means Cirrus Logic didn't win the spot after all. Moreover, the analysts claim that Cirrus Logic stock had risen significantly year to date because investors thought Cirrus Logic would win the second-generation AirPods codec spot.Here's why this probably isn't as big of a deal as the analysts with Craig-Hallum seem to think it is.About a year ago, analyst Christopher Rolland published  in which he indicated that Cirrus Logic had, in fact, won the spot inside of the next-generation AirPods. The impact to Apple's financial performance, he estimated, would be a $50 million bump in revenue and a far more significant $0.50 boost to the company's  (EPS).The reality is that Cirrus Logic would probably have been better off if it were supplying the codec into Apple's latest AirPods, but I don't think the business would have been large enough to make this a game-changer.\u00a0Right now, Cirrus Logic's main issue is that Apple's iPhone shipments are clearly falling short of expectations, which is putting significant pressure on the company's revenue. Indeed, analysts project that for this year, the company is going to suffer a 24% drop in revenue and about a 44.3% plunge in EPS.Let's take a more quantitative look at what's going on here. Right now, analysts expect Cirrus Logic's revenue to drop by $390 million. Suppose this is entirely due to the decline in iPhone-related revenue, and further suppose this revenue carries a gross margin of 50%. This means the drop in gross profit as a result of the iPhone drop should be in the ballpark of $185 million.\u00a0Now, let's further suppose that Cirrus Logic winning the AirPods codec spot meant $50 million in incremental revenue at well above-average gross margin -- let's call it 60% for the sake of argument. The total gross profit contribution from the AirPods win would have contributed about $30 million in gross profit, or just over 16% of the gross profit that Cirrus Logic stands to lose this year as a result of iPhone sales declines.\u00a0While I'd hardly call a 16% offset a \"drop in the bucket,\" what I can conclude is that the main driver of Cirrus Logic stock isn't going to be whether it wins or doesn't win a spot in the AirPods. Cirrus Logic's business is still fundamentally dependent on the success of Apple's iPhone, so if iPhone sales rebound sharply, Cirrus Logic's business stands to benefit.Over the long term, Cirrus Logic is  by trying to supply audio codecs into mid-range smartphones from non-Apple vendors, and by increasing its dollar content in smartphones through things like its voice biometrics chips. It's also trying to expand into smart-home applications, and of course, the company is quite bullish about the market for smart accessories, which includes devices .Cirrus' ability to gain traction in these areas beyond Apple's iPhone will be an important part of its long-term growth story, but frankly, I don't think the company not winning a spot in this year's AirPods (remember that Apple will surely release many iterations of the product in the coming years) is necessarily a reason to change one's investment thesis on the stock.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Now I'll turn the call over to Tunc. -- Thank you, Kathy. Good afternoon to all our participants, and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Maxim Integrated. Our March quarter results met our expectations and end-market demand appears to have stabilized.In the quarter, we reduced shipments to our distribution partners to reduce inventory days in the channel. Looking ahead to the June quarter, we expect the return to seasonality in Industrial and Automotive with both end markets trending up sequentially from the soft March quarter. Our profitability remains at industry-leading levels in the cycle due to our flexible manufacturing structure and overall business model. We are on track to return 125% or more of free cash flow to shareholders this fiscal year, with increased share buyback and industry-leading dividend.Let me now discuss March quarter results and current quarter outlook starting with automotive. In the March quarter, our automotive business was up 5% from the same quarter last year, despite a year-over-year decline in global car production. This impacted our infotainment and auto body electronics businesses and was offset by strength in battery management system products for electric vehicles and growth in driver assistance revenue. The strong BMS product revenue growth was primarily from growth in electric vehicle production and secondarily from Maxim share gains.In the June quarter, we expect automotive to be up sequentially. We see continued strong demand for battery management systems, particularly in China. This is expected to be offset by softer infotainment revenue, which is correlated with overall car production. We continue to believe in the long-term secular growth prospects for automotive business, with growth opportunities in battery management systems, driver assistance products and infotainment.All of these are expected to grow faster than overall car production due to higher growth of electric cars and higher content per car in driver assistance and infotainment. Let me next turn to the industrial market. In the March quarter, industrial was down 18% from the same quarter last year, reflecting the soft demand environment. Within distribution, global resales were seasonal.Bruce will provide more detailed commentary on the dynamics of our distribution business right after me. In the June quarter, we expect industrial to be strongly up sequentially, led by content growth in factory automation and in broad-based industrial products. In factory automation, we are focused on power management products in the areas of interface and communications that deliver intelligence to the factory edge. Let me next discuss communications and data center.In the March quarter, comms and data center was down 22% from the same quarter last year. As expected, we saw lower demand for 100G laser driver products for optical modules used in hyperscale infra data center applications. Year-on-year revenues also declined in a broad base of building block products. Our customers are indicating that the excess inventory of 100G laser drivers and modules will burn off by the second half of calendar 2019.In the June quarter, we anticipate comms and data center revenue to be down sequentially with continued softness in 100G laser driver shipments and in a broad base of building block products. However, we believe in the long-term growth opportunities in the data center market with our market-leading 100G laser drivers, strong pipeline of higher data rate optical transceiver products and with high density, highly integrated power management products for servers. Additionally, we do have optical and power management products that serve the early 5G infrastructure market, and we have started shipments of these products. We expect these products to ramp significantly in the next fiscal year.Finally, let me turn to consumer. In the March quarter, consumer was down 27% from the same quarter last year with weakness in smartphones and seasonal softness in our broad-based business in tablets, wearables and peripherals. In the June quarter, we expect Consumer to be flat sequentially due to growth in our broad-based consumer business in gaming, peripherals, wearables and tablets, offset by lower smartphone business. To summarize, we have built Maxim to be successful in the current environment and to position the company for the next market upturn.We are growing our content and new design wins in long product life cycle end market, such as automotive and industrial. Our analog business model and flexible manufacturing strategy ensured consistent company profitability and stability. All of this results in strong, predictable free cash flow, all of which we return to shareholders. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bruce. -- Thanks, Tunc. Revenue for Q3 was $542 million, in line with expectations, but down 6% sequentially and down 16% from the same quarter a year ago. While this is clearly a period of soft demand, we are built to perform in any environment. Our trailing 12-month free cash flow, excluding our one-time tax payment in Q4 FY '18, grew 7% from last year and was 38% of trailing 12-month revenue.We are executing on our plan to return 125% or more of free cash flow to shareholders in the current fiscal year. Our revenue mix by major markets in Q3 was approximately 28% industrial, 26% consumer, 25% automotive, 18% communications and data center and 3% computing. Our industrial and automotive businesses comprised 53% of our revenue in the quarter, which is an all-time high since I have been at Maxim. Turning to the distribution channel, distribution comprised 49% of Maxim's revenue in the March quarter.We ended Q3 with 64 days of inventory in the distribution channel, down from 68 days in the prior quarter. Channel inventory dollars decreased by 8% due to our management of shipments into distribution partners. Resales were down 11% from the same quarter a year ago, but were seasonal across most geographies. We continue to closely manage our supply chain, our inventory in the distribution channel and our distributors' performance given the uncertainties in the industry.We remain committed to bring down our days of channel inventory to our target of 60 days or less. Turning to the P&L, Maxim's gross margin, excluding special items, was 63.8%, down 2.1 percentage points from the prior quarter, with the decrease driven by lower revenue and higher inventory reserves in Q3. Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $181 million, down 4% from the prior quarter and below our guidance, reflecting tight cost controls. Q3 GAAP operating income, excluding special items, was $165 million.Operating margin was 30% of revenue, down from the prior quarter due to the lower gross margin. Q3 GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, was 14%. GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.52, in line with expectations, but down $0.29 -- 29% from the same quarter a year ago. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, overall, total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased by $62 million in the third quarter to $1.9 billion due to returning 125% of free cash flow in FY '19.Q3 inventory days ended at 126, down three days from Q2 and inventory dollars were down 2% from the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $21 million in the quarter. Adjusted trailing 12 months free cash flow was $899 million or 38% of revenue, which is up 7% over the same quarter last year. Our free cash flow yield is 5.5% at yesterday's closing stock price.Our free cash flow per share was $3.25. For capital return, share repurchases totaled $117 million in Q3, as we bought back approximately 2.2 million shares. Dividends totaled $126 million in the quarter or $0.46 per share. Based on yesterday's closing stock price, our dividend yield is 3.1%.Our beginning Q4 backlog was $399 million. Based on this beginning backlog and expected turns, we forecast Q4 revenue of $540 million to $580 million. This is the result of continued content growth in automotive and sequential growth in our factory automation and broad-based businesses in industrial. Q4 gross margin, excluding special items, is forecasted at 64% to 67%, up significantly from Q3 with higher revenue, lower inventory reserves and improved product mix.Q4 operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be in the low 180s due to tight cost controls and response to the soft environment. Our tax rate for Q4, excluding special items, is expected to be 14%, flat with the prior quarter. For Q4 GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.54 to $0.60. For FY '19, we expect capital expenditures to be just above our targeted range of 1% to 3% of revenue due to lower revenue and facility upgrades at our one internal fab.We are on track to return 125% or more of free cash flow in fiscal 2019. Looking forward to fiscal '20, we plan to continue to return 125% of free cash flow to investors. In summary, we expect a return to seasonal increases in Q4 revenue in Industrial led by factory automation and continued content growth in automotive led by battery management systems. While industry conditions remain soft, we believe automotive, industrial and data center are high-quality, long-term secular growth drivers for Maxim.Our flexible manufacturing strategy enables us to maintain high profitability, and we will continue to tightly control operating and capital expenses. These factors result in high-quality earnings and strong free cash flow, which will support our plans to return 125% of cash to shareholders. As a result of the increased buyback during the cycle, we will exit this period with greater earnings power. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kathy. -- Thanks, Bruce. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now open the call for questions. [Operator instructions] Jonathan, could we please have our first question?\u00a0Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JP Morgan. -- Congratulations on the strong execution. On the outlook for the strong growth in Industrial here in the June quarter, I always view this as somewhat of a good proxy for sort of global demand and manufacturing trends. I think you gave us some color. Factory automation strong, strong catalog business servicing the SNB customers.Is the growth that you're seeing broad-based across all geographies on a sequential basis, including China? And then just given your visibility, do you anticipate a September quarter driving kind of a normal seasonal profile, which I think is sort of flattish plus or minus? -- Yes. So Harlan, this is Bruce. So when we think about our industrial business and guiding that up strongly, I think it's a couple of things. We have seen the strength in our factory automation, but we also saw nice broad-based kind of return to seasonality in our distribution business.In our distribution business, the largest component of that is industrial. And so when we look there, both China and Europe were seasonal on a kind of quarter-over-quarter basis, albeit on a lower base. And as we look into the Q4 quarter, we see that continued seasonality in those geographies. Similar story seasonality for Japan.I would say the one area we have seen some below seasonality was in Americas in our third quarter. Speaking to September, we're, obviously, giving guidance for one quarter and even additionally in this environment, right, we're kind of giving guidance based of what we can see in front of us, what is sort of the backlog and the trends that we have immediately before. And certainly, we don't have the visibility to talk about September.Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. -- Congrats on the solid results. Just want to talk a little bit about the automotive side of things. You gave some color about what was happening in ADAS and BMS and that was very helpful. As you think about the SAAR side of things, what are your customers telling you about that side of the business? And what that might impact, albeit it turned to a tailwind in the back half of the year? And is there any competitive dynamics changing within BMS as some new companies have entered that market and are getting some traction from what we can tell? -- Ross, OK, I'll like that. There were a few questions in that one combined question, but I think we have time to answer them. So in terms of what we're seeing in the automotive market, in general, I mean, if you look at market data for car production, last year or 2018 calendar year was down slightly about 1% or so. This year, 2019, car production is about flat is what the markets are saying.We don't really get too much more detail from the Tier 1s, who are the ones that we really talk to a lot. So we usually go by what the market numbers are from marketing companies, so -- and a lot of that 2019 calendar year is expecting growth in the second half. So that's what we're seeing from a market standpoint. In terms of the competitive environment, I mean, automotive is a good area for growth.We're not the only company that sees that. There are other companies, obviously, that want to grab as much our share as they can. The competitive dynamics haven't really changed. It's kind of always been that way.And in the BMS market, which is the one that you talked about, we've done quite well. We've done well because electric vehicles have been growing faster, obviously, than car production. And our products are very well-received. So in the period last year, we think that we've also increased our share in the market.Well, that doesn't say that there are no competitors. They are out there. We have to keep ahead of them. And if you look at why our customers selecting our products because our products have better ASIL or ASIL D which is the top safety integrity rating performance and a very robust communications features in them.So that's why we've been doing well in the market. But as I said, there are competitors. We have to go through an end-to-end combat to win the designs. The good news then we have is that we've got really great success in China, which is where actually the biggest growth is recently and that helps, where we've had design wins in pretty much all geographies around the world.So that kind of talks to the strength of our product line and our technology.Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets. -- Bruce and Tunc, you guys have brought down the cost structure a fair bit over the last several quarters. How should we be thinking about opex, as we think through fiscal '20? -- Sure. As we said, right, we brought it down $7 million this quarter. It's actually down, if you kind of look at the guidance we gave for Q4 in the low-180s, we'll probably be down 4% year over year, roughly. So I think we have done a good job responding to the current soft environment.I think we will continue to be diligent and have price controls around spending until we're confident in kind of the growth, kind of, returning to our industry. Our model has always been that we'll grow opex at about half the rate of revenue on a trailing 12-month basis. So even if we have a forecast for a strong second half of the year, for example, that doesn't necessarily mean we're going to ramp up opex ahead of that, right? We'll continue to be cautious and make sure we've actually achieve the revenue growth before we ramp opex.Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. -- Tunc or Bruce, you're sounding more optimistic about demand recovery and then return to seasonal growth versus what we heard from Texas Instruments or NXP. So I just wanted to go back to that question about June quarter outlook. What are you seeing that is so different than kind of the more subdued tone we heard from some of your peers is, is there a big difference? And is it more company-specific design wins? Is there anything else that would create a difference in the June quarter outlook between yourself and some of your peers? -- Yes. So I'll take that one and Bruce can add, if he wants. But one of the areas where we might be seeing a difference is in the industrial space. When we look at our guidance versus some others, I think, our guidance is probably a little bit better than others.First of all, there's no doubt that the whole industrial business is impacted by the slower environment. This is in line with other companies, so there's nothing special there. I think maybe the difference is that we have seen some signs of stabilization in resales returning to seasonal trends is a good indicator there, and we're also seeing that continuing into Q4. And the inventory in the channel is -- might be less of a headwind for us because we've took it down in Q3, and we've also had inventory dollars decline in this thesis now for two quarters in a row.So we're kind of improving over off of a lower base, and it is possible that we took our medicine earlier. I mean, if you think about it, the industrial revenue declined 18% year over year in the March quarter. So that's a pretty big decline. So part of it might be that we've kind of seen a decline earlier than other suppliers, and now it's looking better off of a low base.I mean, that's the explanation I've got on the industrial side. On the automotive side, we're pretty much saying that the growth is more muted than our original forecast. Remember, our long-term forecast was low-teens growth for automotive and we're definitely below that and that gets impacted quite a bit in our infotainment business. And I don't think that is significantly different than other companies.So the biggest thesis is likely in the industrial space. And finally, if you look at our consumer business, it's kind of more balanced now with more exposure to a broader base of markets. So that's kind of helping also keeping at least on a quarter-over-quarter basis it's not falling, which kind of helps as well. So that's kind of the observations that we have versus other companies.Our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. -- In the automotive market, clearly, there's some impact from weaker production like you said in areas like infotainment. But just from your discussions with Tier 1 suppliers, do have a sense in terms of how they're managing and OEMs are managing inventory in this environment? And when you think they'll get to a level where you'd see actually some snapback from an inventory perspective in autos? -- Yes. I'll take that one, too. I mean, we do, obviously, talk to Tier 1s, but we don't have -- I have to say that we don't have a lot of access to what their inventory levels are. We kind of know how they pull product from Maxim.But in terms of what they have in their -- with or in their finished goods of ECUs, we don't really have good visibility for. So it is really hard for us to answer that question. -- OK. Maybe just a different approach in terms of just the last quarter to how they are pulling inventory? And if you're seeing any shifts, is if they kind of work through some of the weakness? -- The only thing we can say is, we basically said that our automotive business would be up this quarter, and it's not really up strongly. So I'd say that maybe that's an indication that they are using our products, but it's still feels like until if you look at market data until the second half comes, it's really hard to say over the year. -- Yes. And Craig, so this is Bruce just to add a little more color and really just to reiterate what Tunc said in his opening remarks. When we look at automotive business in the March quarter, it was up roughly 5% year over year. We continue to see very strong growth in both our battery management systems and in our driver assistance serial link products.And so as we know, that's a content story, which has been somewhat insulated from the overall market demand. That said, our infotainment business would still have content growth story as well long term, but it's larger, more mature, more correlated with the overall market, while that was done year over year in the March quarter. So we have seen that impact, but we do have the content story, which, again, makes it a little bit harder for us to parse out exactly what's the kind of impact is of global demand on auto source. -- Yes. And just to add to that, I mean, as Bruce said, infotainment was down in the March quarter year over year. And on a year-over-year basis, it looks like it probably will be done this June quarter as well.Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel. -- Would you be able to comment on linearity of orders? And where there any variations geographically? -- So Tore, this is Bruce. I think our business because it's so broad based and we shipped 900 million units, our linearity is pretty predictable. We were not a company that has back-end loaded. We've never been that -- have that linearity.And from our ship to basis, still the majority of our products ships to Asia. And so from that point of view how we can track linearity, there wasn't any real change from a geographic point of view, but that's primarily just influenced because of where they ship to mainly goes to Asia. -- Tore, where you asking the linearity of the orders or of the shipments? -- Yes. I was asking about the linearity of orders throughout the quarter? -- Throughout Q3? -- Yes. So there I would say I think we saw some good, some early strength because we had very, very low turns in the December quarter, and I think people just wanted to kind of -- so we had some nice turns early on and some good booking. And then I would say it stabilized throughout the second half of the quarter.Our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso from Raymond James. -- This question is a follow-up on some of the prepared comments on inventory, particularly in the distribution channel. And I guess first, how long do you expect to get distribution down to around your 60-day target? Additionally, how much of a drag was that on revenue for the March quarter? And how much are you contemplating in the June quarter guidance? -- Yes. So our goal is 60. And as you know, days of inventory are two big factors there. One is the amount of inventory that's in the channel, how much do we shipping and then how much are resales, how much are the output.Obviously, we control what we shipping. And based on what the forecast is for resales from our distribution partners, our goal is to bring down that current 64 days down to 60. Because of the very difficult, I mean, it's difficult for us to forecast to a certain extent our business. It's much harder to forecast resales through the distribution partners.Obviously, we get forecast, but we don't have the same amount of details like we have here like backlog and other items that we can manage that with. So it's very hard for us to forecast that. And when you look at that, in the four-day decline, and with the combination of both lower shipments and obviously some improvement in resale quarter over quarter. So you can't say exactly how much benefit.Clearly though, as Tunc said, we did sort of kind of take our medicine in the March quarter because we do want to make sure kind of coming out of this slowdown, we're well-positioned from an inventory point of view and we don't have some extended drag on our business as the overall industry ramps up. -- I'm sorry, are able to quantify that in terms of how much -- what's the impact on at least March quarter revenue from the difference between sell-in and sell-through? -- No. -- Yes. Chris, you can probably calculate it yourself. Distribution is what about 40%, 45% of our business? -- Yes, 49%. -- Four days. We don't have it in front of us. We kind of hide the numbers. You can probably calculate it.Our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Macquarie Securities. -- Tunc, on the data center business, the inventory correction that you mentioned, it seems to be taking a little longer than at least I was expecting. Could you give us a bit more color as to what's going on there? And then I'm just curious as to are there any market share dynamics at play as well here? -- Well, honestly, it's taking longer than I expected, also. So it doesn't feel to us like there's any market share that's of issue here. The designs that we won, we're maintaining. Most of the customers are not really that interested in redesigning any way their systems for this generation of products.But I think, especially driven probably by concerns last year over shortages of components and so on, it seems like the end customers, the hyperscale customers and partially the module markers were overpurchasing and this is taking longer for that to burn off in the supply chain. We are getting indications from customers that, that will burn off and shipments will resume most likely in the second half of the calendar year, but I wouldn't read anything more than that into these shipments resuming for those products and revenues returning.Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. -- I guess a question on gross margins. I think you said that inventory reserves led to the modest miss from March. Can you provide some clarity on that? And then as you think about going into June and September and beyond, and I guess considering a desire to work down just the inventory as well as some of the mix issues that you've outlined both good and bad across your different segments, how should we think about the outlook to gross margins into a recovery? -- Yes. So when we look at the March quarter, and you're right, we did kind of come about a point below where we had expected to come in. And that was inventory reserves and just that's the noncash charge, which is basically equal to. We look at sort of what our forecast is for one to two years by product and then we compare that to the inventory we have and to the extent we have more inventory than we have demand that drives an inventory reserve.As you might expect a little bit from a psychology of forecasting, when you are in a slowdown, people kind of bring down the long-term forecast. We're never -- no one is very good at forecasting inflection points up or down. And so when that happens, we bring down the long-term forecast and that generally results in an inventory reserve charts. Now as the business comes back and we ship to the extent that we ship products that we previously reserve for, those would come in at 100% gross margin.But we have a consistent methodology. We follow that throughout the cycle. And in this situation, we ended up with about a point 100 bps impact due to that higher-than-normal inventor reserve. As we think about going forward, we're highly confident -- I'm confident that gross margin will return back into our target range of 67% to 70%.Obviously, we're forecasting to get back up to about 65.5% at the midpoint in the June quarter as that kind of -- that's the benefit of both return to normal for inventory reserves and a little bit better mix with Industrial strongly up. Assuming revenue continues to improve, that will improve utilization in our loan remaining fab and our back-end test facilities, and we'll see, we lost a point in the March quarter for that as well. So that gets you back up. And I think when we get over kind of roughly, if you look historically when we get over $600 million, we should be back in our target range for gross margin.So going forward, all the same tailwinds exist out there for us kind of maximizing utilization at our remaining fab up in Oregon, the favorable pricing environment, the mix of business as we grow industrial, as we grow our distribution business. All of those will provide tailwinds for gross margin long term, and we're still very confident that, that's the gross margin we'll continue to expand long term within our target range.[Operator instructions] Our next question comes from the line of William Stein from SunTrust. -- I'm hoping you can talk about trends in the comps end market if you exclude the 100-gig optical both in the guided quarter? And as you look out over the next couple of quarters, what are you expecting that end market, please? -- So if you exclude the 100G basically data center market, if you just look at comps and talk about infrastructure comps, which I believe you're asking. Obviously, there are opportunities there for us. In the prepared remarks I talked a little bit of them. This new generation of comps infrastructure or 5G or 4G plus whatever you call it, there are obviously opportunities there for Maxim.Those opportunities are in some optical products we have for base station backlog. We have power management products to go both in the base fan units, as well as the remote radio units and a whole bunch of other general purpose products that end up in this market. So we received the question about what is Maxim's exposure and opportunity in 5G. It definitely is an opportunity for us, but it is not as large as some of our competitors, which have single chain products in that space as well.So we see that as an opportunity. In general, if you look at our revenue in the last couple of quarters into the comp's infrastructure, it's been pretty weak. It's mostly general purpose products that are in the older-type base station parts. So the broad base of general purpose products we're selling have not been selling that well.But in terms of the 5G opportunity, it looks like we just beginning to ramp the products that I mentioned and we expect those to start growing in the second half of calendar-year '19.Our next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves from RBC Capital Markets. -- I just wanted to shift the focus a bit to the consumer segment. We're getting some differentiated data points with the markets coming back, but then you guys printed kind of a lighter than expected, I guess, consumer business, but it sounded that's improved. So maybe you can provide us a more granular update on what's happening on the smartphone side of the business? And what you guys expect the second half of the full calendar year? -- So let me take that one. So if you look at our consumer business, just to give you some color, about half of our consumer business is in smartphones and the other half is mix of hearables, wearables and tablets and gaming, all kinds of other types of products. So from our viewpoint, we have been executing a strategy to increase the diversity of the revenue base in the consumer business, and we have been doing that successfully so that we've grown the piece that's the diverse part of that revenue. Going forward, that revenue has a different seasonality than our smartphone business.So what we said about this quarter being flat was basically because we have weakness in smartphones and we see seasonality in the other markets beginning to come back, which is the broad-based piece offsetting each other. Longer term, we have in our largest customer, they are basically selling fewer phones and we have less content in those phones. So that's the headwind that we have on the smartphone side. And we continue to grow the other piece of the business, which is more diversified and more stable.So that's kind of the dynamics. So long term in consumer, we expect to be flat or maybe slightly up a few percentage points, but it's not going to be a big growth area for the company most likely.Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. -- And actually, this is a follow-up question to the last question on consumer because for the last couple of years, as you mentioned, with the diversification away from smartphones, your September quarter actually has been profiling more like a traditional consumer business as you gear up sort of for the seasonally stronger second half, meaning that it's been growing sequentially. I think this year, you've got your flagship gaming customer ramping a new platform with your power management products, you've got new wearables, tablets and so on. And so is this a fair assessment that sort of consumer normal seasonal now for you guys is probably up sequentially in the September quarter? -- Yes. Harlan, so this is Bruce. I mean certainly, we've talked and Tunc talked about it as well. I mean our seasonality is changing such that we're now going to follow probably a more traditional consumer seasonality, which is generally stronger in the September quarter.Historically, I have been doing this job for a while. Whenever I get in trouble, whenever I try to forecast consumer out more than a quarter. So I'm not going to do that, but you're accurate in that. The normal seasonality now is sort of stronger in that September quarter.And then the other dynamic that does occur is to the extent that within this broad base of consumer, there are product launches out there whether, as you said and we called out, in the June quarter, for example, we are seeing some upside in the gaming area. We see upsides in tablets as there are certain product launches there, same thing with wearable devices. So you have that kind of a normal consumer seasonality and then you have sort of on top of that product introductions by our customers.And I'm not showing any further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to hand the program back to you for any further remarks. -- OK. Thank you, Jonathan. That does conclude today's conference call.

The information in this presentation accompanies the financial disclosures in our earnings press release and on this conference call. During today's call we will be making some forward-looking statements. In light of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, I'd like to remind you that these statements must be considered in conjunction with the cautionary warnings that appear in our SEC filings.Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements in this call involve risks and uncertainty and that future events may differ materially from the statements made. For additional information, please refer to the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings which are posted on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Tunc. -- All right. Thank you, Kathy. Good afternoon to all our participants and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Maxim Integrated. Our December quarter results came in below expectations due to the soft environment. However, we are encouraged to see bookings return to normal levels in recent weeks. We believe our business model enables us to be successful in any environment and we continue to generate strong free cash flow despite current conditions.Our strong free cash flow and positive net cash balance enable us to increase our share buyback and continue our industry-leading dividend, and we are on track to return 125% of free cash flow to shareholders this fiscal year. We continue to believe that buying our shares is the best use of our cash in the current environment.Before I turn to my end market commentary, I want to remind investors that our second fiscal quarter last year was a 14-week quarter and was impacted by the transition to sell-in accounting at one distributor. My comments on December quarter year-on-year comparisons adjust down year-ago quarter revenue for both of these items.Let me know discuss December results and current quarter outlook, starting with automotive. In the December quarter, our automotive business was up 8% from the same quarter last year. We continued to see the strongest demand signals from battery management systems for electric vehicles and driver assistance content. However, in our infotainment and auto body electronics business, we are seeing sub-seasonal performance, driven by slower car sales.We do see ample content growth opportunities for Maxim in driver assist, or ADAS applications, in power management and point-to-point serial link data communication products. At the Consumer Electronics Show, we held a record number of customer discussions on our battery management, driver assistance and power management solutions. Our latest generation of GMSL-2 automotive serial linked products transport video, audio and data at a 6-gigabit per second transfer rate and can also transport 1 gigabit per second Ethernet.We expect to introduce additional GMSL-2 products in the coming year and have already won designs at seven different OEMs. Our business in battery management systems for electric vehicles continues to grow in global footprint and scale, and we discussed our latest generation products with customers at CES. Additionally, we announced new families of high voltage automotive power solutions that efficiently control and supervise the hundreds of watts of power required for advanced driver assistant systems. In the March quarter, we expect automotive to be up sequentially and up in the high single-digits from the same quarter last year, supported by continued strong demand for battery management systems, but offset by lower overall car sales.Let me next turn to the industrial market. In the December quarter, industrial was down 6% from the same quarter last year. Throughout the quarter we experienced slow bookings and resales across most of our product lines sold to the industrial broad market and to factory automation customers. Bruce will provide more detailed commentary on the dynamics of our distribution business right after me.We continue to believe in the long-term growth trajectory of factory automation in the areas of interface and communications that bring intelligence to the factory edge, digital isolation and isolated power and protection solutions, and ultra efficient and tiny footprint power modules. In the March quarter, we expect industrial to be down sequentially with core industrial flat.Let me next discuss communications and data center. In the December quarter, comms and data center was down 13% from the same quarter last year. As we expected, we saw a pause in demand for 100G laser driver products for optical modules used in hyper scale intra data center applications, and a decline in demand for communications infrastructure products.In the March quarter, we anticipate comms and data center revenue to be strongly down sequentially, with continued softness in 100G laser driver shipments, and in broad base of building block products. We continue to believe in the long-term growth opportunities in the data center market.Finally, let me turn to consumer. In the December quarter, consumer was up 7% from the same quarter last year due to the holiday ramp of our broad-based business in tablets, wearables and peripherals. In the quarter, we introduced a number of new power management products, including mini (inaudible) and highly integrated battery chargers to address a broad set of consumer applications, including smart watches, fitness and health monitors, wireless headsets, body cameras and e-pens. These products extend battery life, provide excellent signal to noise performance for adjacent sensors, in fact in multiple power rails within the tiny design footprints required for wearable mobile devices. In the March quarter, we expect consumer to be strongly down sequentially due to normal post-holiday seasonality of our broad-based consumer business and below historical growth in smartphones.To reiterate what I have said previously, we have built Maxim to be successful in any environment. One, we continue to grow content and generate new design wins in high quality, diversified and long product lifecycle markets such as automotive and industrial. Two, our flexible manufacturing structure ensures consistent world-class gross margins. Three, we continue to exert tight spending controls. And four, we have low capital intensity in manufacturing. All of this results in strong, predictable free cash flow, all of which we return to shareholders.With that, I will now turn the call over to Bruce. -- Thanks, Tunc. Revenue for Q2 was $577 million, down 1% from the same quarter a year ago, normalizing for the 14-week quarter and sell-in accounting revenue transition that occurred last year. While this is clearly a period of soft demand, as Tunc has said, we are built to perform in any environment. Our trailing 12-month free cash flow, excluding one-time payment in Q4 FY '18, grew 8% from the last year. And we are executing on our plan to return 125% of free cash flow to shareholders in the current fiscal year, with our rate of buyback nearly doubling in Q2 from the previous quarter.Our revenue mix by major markets in Q2 was approximately 28% consumer, 27% industrial, 24% automotive, 18% communications and data center, and 3% computing. Our industrial and automotive businesses comprised over half of our revenue in the quarter.Turning to the distribution channel, distribution comprised 44% of Maxim's revenue in the December quarter. We ended Q2 with 68 days of inventory in the distribution channel. Channel inventory dollars decreased by 2%, but was offset by lower-than-expected resales. Resales were down 12% from the same quarter a year ago, with weakness noted across most markets and geographies.We continue to closely manage our supply chain, our inventory in the distribution channel and our distributors performance given the uncertainties in the industry. We remain committed to bring down our days of channel inventory to our target of 60 days or less. However, given the lower demand environment, this may take a few quarters.Turning to the P&L, Maxim's gross margin excluding special items was 65.9%, down 2.6 percentage points from the prior quarter, with the decrease driven by one-time credits in Q1 and higher inventory reserves in Q2.Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $188 million, down 3% from the prior quarter and below our guidance, reflecting tight cost controls. Q2 GAAP operating income, excluding special items, was $192 million. Operating margin was 33% of revenue, down from the prior quarter due to lower revenue. Q2 GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, was 13%. GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.60, up an estimated 2% from the same quarter a year ago after normalizing for the 14-week quarter and sell-in accounting revenue transition that occurred last year.Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, overall, total cash, cash equivalents and short term investments decreased by $603 million in the second quarter to $1.96 billion, due to the repayment of our $500 million bond that came due in November and higher share buyback. Total debt is now $1 billion or approximately one time trailing 12-month EBITDA.Q2 inventory days ended at 129, up five days from Q1 due to lower revenue. Inventory dollars were up 1% from the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $13 million in the quarter. Trailing 12-month free cash flow was $919 million or 37% of revenue, which is up 8% over the same quarter last year. Our free cash flow yield is 6% at yesterday's closing stock price. Our free cash flow per share was $3.28. For capital return, share repurchases totaled $208 million in Q2 as we bought back approximately 4 million shares. Dividends totaled $127 million in the quarter or $0.46 per share. Based on yesterday's closing stock price, our dividend yield is 3.3%.Our beginning Q3 backlog with $372 million. Based on this beginning backlog and expected turns, we forecast Q3 revenue of $520 million to $560 million. This is the result of continued content growth in automotive, offset by softness we are seeing across a broad set of customers and end markets. Q3 gross margin, excluding special items, is forecasted at 64% to 66%, down slightly from Q2. Our flexible manufacturing strategy is working as expected to minimize the gross margin impact of lower revenue. Q3 operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be down from Q2 to the low to mid 180s due increase cost control and response to the lower revenue.Our tax rate for Q3, excluding special items, is expected to be 14%, up a percentage point from the prior quarter. 14% is the best estimate to use for modeling purposes for the balance of fiscal 2019. For Q3 GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.49 to $0.55. For FY '19, we expect capital expenditures to be just above our targeted range of 1% to 3% of revenue due to lower revenue and required upgrades at our one internal fab.In summary, while we expect a sequential decline in Q3 revenue given uncertainty in the current environment, we are built to perform in any environment. We believe automotive, industrial and data center are high quality, long term secular growth drivers. Our flexible manufacturing strategy enables us to maintain high profitability and we will continue to tightly control operating and capital expenses. These factors result in high quality earnings and strong cash flow which support our fiscal 2019 plans to return 125% of free cash flow to shareholders. As a result of this increased buyback during this industry slow down, we will exit this period with greater earnings power.With that, I'll turn the call over to Kathy. -- Thanks, Bruce. That concludes our prepared remarks and we will now open the call for questions. We'd like to continue the same Q&A process that we've used previously. We'll take one question from each caller so we can get to as many people in the queue as possible. And as usual, if you have a follow-up question, please enter back into the queue. Jonathan, could we please have our first question?Certainly. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your question, please. -- Good afternoon, and solid job on the quarterly execution in a pretty tough environment. Industrial was down about as expected in December. But unlike your automotive business, you're not seeing the sort of normal seasonal, sort of quarterly uptick in the March quarter. And I guess the question is, is it still the broad base sort of SMB customer base that is driving the declines in margin? And I think you've mentioned core industrial is expected to be flat. How do you guys define core industrial? And as you think about sort of just the very near term trends thus far here in January, wondering if the team is seeing any signs of stabilization in bookings trends in industrial? -- So, on the industrial space, I mean, the weakness that we're seeing, if you recall last quarter, it really start -- started with a broad base of customers. But throughout the quarter it kind of expanded into other customers as well. But let me try to answer, yes, there are a couple of questions in there. So, core industrial for us and majority of it is in control and automation, over half of it, but it encompasses other areas as well.But what we are seeing is that weaknesses both in small, medium customers, as well as some of our larger customers were that they're seeing a pause from their customers in terms of ordering equipment. But if you recall, our industrial business also has some verticals in it. And some of those verticals especially ATE (ph) we've seen a lot of weaknesses, especially in -- going into Q3 right now. So it's kind of broad based. There's some special verticals that are being especially week and I don't think we should be that surprised by ATE being week with the whole industry seeing a downturn. So that's kind of gives you an idea. -- Thank you, Harlan.Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Your question, please. -- Thanks a lot for letting me ask a question. Tunc, just want to go into your comments on the bookings getting better recently, and in general just talk about linearity throughout the quarter, what got worse in the December quarter and then what's getting better, any geographic or end market color you could provide around how bookings acted in those two quarters would be helpful. -- So what we -- if you recall what we said when we were entering Q2, we'd said that we'd seen orders weekend in the last couple of weeks of September. And in commentary later we said that things had not improved, they've gotten worse. I guess until the beginning of December, after which the bookings actually got worse in terms of orders. What we're seeing now is actually kind of a broad based. It's kind of too early with only three weeks of data to be able to tell you accurately which markets are stronger than others. So I think we're not going to go there in terms of trying to explain that, but essentially what we saw in January is that the order rates really improved from the prior few months that we saw. So that's what -- that's the information that we shared. Bruce, do you want any more color to that? -- No, I'll just say, Ross, I think when we look at sort of the kind of the broad based business and we usually use kind of distribution as a proxy for that, we really saw the weakness in the December quarter in China, I mean, it was much lower. I mean, it was literally kind of down double-digits quarter-over-quarter when seasonally it's usually up, kind of low double-digits quarter-over-quarter. So that's really where we saw that weakness.The rest of Asia was also week, right, we saw some weakness in Japan and Taiwan. And then, the Americas and Europe were actually kind of in line with seasonality. I mean, it's not like they were doing great, but they weren't as that. So really we saw our weakness in Asia, to say, on the retail side through distribution which is about 44% of revenue. So it's a pretty good proxy, and not as that in Americas and EMEA. -- Thank you. -- Yes. -- Thanks, Ross.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Your question, please? -- Hi, thank you. I'm a little confused with the comment on the bookings turning to normal levels, just a little bit of clarification. So is that just coming back from a really bad December? And then a related follow on is how is that factoring into your factory loadings? Thank you. -- Yes. So this is Bruce, so -- in order to -- Tunc said, right, we sort of when -- at the end of September, we saw bookings kind of go from a normal level where we had been booking down substantially, and kind of stayed there in a quarter, as Tunc said, it kind of weekend near the end of the quarter. And what we're seeing now in January is sort of return to normal bookings. So at those level, so that's still early, it's three weeks. So certainly can't draw any conclusions from that, but just as a data point, we wanted to share that with investors. We certainly haven't drawn any conclusions from it yet. We're still obviously managing the business expenses, both operating and capital tightly.As far as impact to moves, you saw our inventory is still at 128 -- 129 days. And so we're obviously have reduced moves in the factory both in response to the lower revenue and in order to adjust our inventory on our balance sheet to bring that down as well. So clearly that's what --- those moves are down. I think it's still a very strong statement to say that kind of gross margins are holding up at the 65%, even with the lower revenue and with moves at a level to begin to reduce inventory. -- Okay, so you're not changing your -- OK. Thank you. -- Go ahead. Sorry. -- No, my question was that as you said, just to keep it clear, is -- it's too early, you're not calling a bottom and you're just saying that this is too early to draw any conclusions, your factory loading are still along the trajectory of what you thought earlier or later in the year, right? -- Yes, I mean, we're looking... -- Okay. -- We have inventory on the balance sheet. So -- and I said before, I don't like inventory. So we're working to adjust that. -- Thank you, sir. -- Thank you, Ambrish.Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley. Your question, please. -- Yes, thank you. Tunc, just a question on the automotive market. You mentioned some of the legacy kind of infotainment seen an impact from lower car sales, which has been evident in the marketplace. So just wanted to get your sense in terms of the December quarter when you really start to see that and what type of volatility are you seeing from customers in terms of whether they adjust production for lower sales. -- Well, I wouldn't -- so obviously we did see it in the quarter. I wouldn't really -- it was not volatility, it was just a general reduction in the number of units that were being ordered. It wasn't a -- there wasn't any sudden action that we saw from anybody in particular, frankly, just broadly people were ordering fewer of the parts that they used the order. So -- and when that -- when we asked a question about why, usually the answer was it's just lower cars sales without really giving anything specific. So I don't think that it happened in a way that was a reaction to something from the auto suppliers, it was kind of gradual. -- Okay, thanks for that. -- Did I answer what you were asking? Or were you asking something else?No, you did; appreciate that. -- Right, you're welcome. -- Thanks, Craig.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your question, please. -- Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Tunc, I'm just kind of curious, when you look at your backlog entering into the March quarter and look at sort of your guidance for March, it implies sort of a turns coverage which is kind of in line with sort of the eight quarter average, plus or minus a little bit. And I'm just kind of curious, you know, as we go through correction periods, can you rely upon turns that consistently and what had been a little bit more conservative to kind of guide to turns coverage, that -- that's kind of below what we've seen over the last eight quarters when business was was pretty good? -- Yes. Hi, John, this is Bruce. I'll take this. Certainly in the current environment, we did no in any way shape or form lean forward on our turns forecast to get to that number. So, if we look at sort of our turns the booking and that kind of actually at the low end of sort of a kind of our historical range. When we look at our beginning backlog as a percent of net revenue, it's a little bit lower. One thing to always remember about our Q3 is to the extent that there is any type of ramp at our largest customer, they always place those bookings within the quarter. So, they always show up as turns.So, even with smartphones being down, just on a sequential basis, the third quarter always has a little bit higher turns historically than other quarters. And so, that may be one area that just contributes. But, no, we did not lean forward. You know our philosophy here, being an engineering company is we forecast what we think is the most likely number and balanced on kind of upside and downside. -- Perfect. Thank you. -- Thanks, John.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Your question, please. -- Yes, thank you. And I have to ask Bruce this question since he is going to be retiring, since I got a (inaudible) question. So, Bruce, you talked about gross margin sensitivity, with revenue down 10%, impact to gross margin is 1% to 2%. Is that kind of -- was inventory days at 110 or does that math going to change now with inventory days at 129? -- Yeah, So, first off, I'm not going anywhere soon. So, you're not getting rid of me. So, I'm sorry to let you know that. But, no, I think when we look at the gross margin and we said, yeah, for a 10% decline down 1% to 2%, I think that's appropriate throughout the cycle. Obviously, there's other issues that are going on as far as like we say we are trying to burn off inventory. That make push it up like closer to like 2% impact.If you look at the -- kind of the guidance that we gave for Q3, right, we're basically down a point, right. We're at 65.9 in Q2. We guided to 65 in Q3 and when you look at revenue, we're sort of down quarter-on-quarter, we are down 6%. So, we are a little bit over, but that's -- probably that point, right, that's sort of in line just because of the inventory burn off as well. -- Sound good. Thank you. -- Now that we're on a more flexible model, keeping the factors low to the secondary effect, which is -- which had a much less impact than it used to 10 years ago. -- It's a good point. Thank you, Tunc. -- Thanks, Tore.Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of Chris Caso from Raymond James. Your question, please. -- Yes. Thank you. Just a question following up on some of the earlier questions. And I guess my question is, what sort of linearity have you assumed with the guidance? And I ask that because I realize, you know, this is a particularly tricky quarter with Chinese New Year in the middle. You've seen some improvement in bookings in January, but the last two quarters, I guess we've seen some deceleration at the end of the quarter. So just trying to understand what sort of assumptions you made in putting together the guidance that all into consideration? -- Yeah, so this is Bruce. Generally speaking, at Maxim linearity within a quarter is not -- we don't -- it's not that important. We're a very broad based business. We shift thousands of parts to thousands of customers throughout the quarter. So we're not back end loaded. So when we do our forecast, we don't -- we look at it for a total quarter. We don't look at it month-by-month.As far as Chinese New Year, our view of that has always been demand is demand, maybe it gets pulled in a little bit depending, you know, the bookings get pulled in maybe and then you have a slow week, but then it comes back. But over an entire quarter, that really shouldn't change the overall demand environment, the timing of Chinese New Year. So we don't try to forecast that as well when we look at sort of the bookings and turns forecast for the quarter. -- Yeah, I mean, especially Chinese New Year is in the middle of the quarter. So it doesn't have the effect. If it were at the end, it would be a consideration, but it's in the middle so it doesn't. -- Yeah. -- Thank you. -- Thanks, Chris.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please. -- Yeah, thank you so much for taking the question. I was hoping to learn a little bit more about the automotive business, what kind of trends you're seeing in the different applications. You guys talked about strength in BMS data (ph) and I suppose a little bit of weakness in your legacy infotainment business, but what sort of growth rates did you see in the December quarter and what kind of growth rates are embedded in your March quarter guidance? Thank you. -- Yes, so in terms of growth, as I said in my prepared remarks, I mean the growth areas for the December quarter was basically in battery management systems and in AS and the others were either -- infotainment was either flat or slightly down. But those growth rates were very strong. I mean, they're both of them were in the 40% to 60% on a year-over-year basis. So that market continues to do or that sub market of automotive continues to do well for us.Getting into the March quarter, the battery management systems is still pretty strong, probably in those ranges. The ADAS is still double-digits, probably not as strong as BMS frankly, but it's still in the double-digits. And I think the trend that we do see in those markets are secular and they're going to go on for a long time because more and more cars are being built, essentially powered by batteries and more and more driver assistance going into cars.So, those two are really good content growth stories for automobiles. And also remember that electric cars also in addition to just having systems required for battery management, they still need all the other stuff, they still need infotainment, they still need driver assist. So, that's a really good trend for us in terms of future growth. That's the color I can give you about in the short-term what they look like, last quarter and this quarter. -- Very helpful, thank you. -- You are welcome. -- Thanks, Toshiya.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from Macquarie Securities. Your question, please. -- Thank you for taking my question. Tunc, I was hoping you could put the current cycle in a perspective. I mean obviously historically, we've had this inventory-driven cycles typically late in the cycle, we had extending lead times and double bookings and then followed by cancellations and then a couple of quarters of inventory digestion. And then that followed a typical snap back. You know, we never had much of a lead time extending in the cycle. I don't recall many companies talking about double bookings either. So, I'm just curious how do you see the recovery from here on compared to some of the previous cycles that we have seen in the past? -- Yeah, so let me make a few comments. I think that first of all, let me just talk about Maxim for a second. So, for us, we've had multiple years, I think five or six years where we had lead times that were relatively short and even through the up cycle, we were able to -- because of our flexible manufacturing, we're able to keep up with the demand increases and not have shortages.I don't think that's been the same for the entire industry. There is many market segments that did see lead time extensions, especially in some of the discrete products, memory, all these areas where we had all kinds of lead time extensions. So, I think we have a kind of a distorted view from our space because we didn't have those and it's really hard for us to be able to tell whether there's going to be a snap back or not and how strong it's going to be from where we sit.By the way the other item you mentioned was double ordering and cancellations. And I think we've said in previous calls in the summer that we didn't have double orders that we could detect. And I think some of you also asked about cancellations and those were all normal for Maxim. And they haven't really changed that much for us right now either. So I think we're not a good company because of our supply chain working pretty well to be able to time when you have a recovery back from an inventory correction or not, but I think that the industry has gone through some of the symptoms that you talked about in your question, about linked -- especially lead time extensions in some markets in some components. -- Got it. Thank you. -- You are welcome. -- Thanks, Srini.Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of CJ Muse with Evercore. Your question, please. -- Yes , good afternoon, thank you for taking the question. I guess in this uncertain environment you're still putting up pretty spectacular free cash flow. So curious, how are you thinking about OpEx beyond the March quarter? Are you stepping up the gas on any R&D projects or just treating as normal and how should we think about the trajectory there as long as the uncertainty persists? -- Yes, I'll take that first CJ and then maybe Tunc can comment as well. So, first off, it is nice to being a CFO with a really experienced management team. As soon as we saw kind of a slow down coming, all the GMs started kind of looking at their spending and being a little bit more careful about that. And so, you know, when we kind of came out as a finance team and kind of gave new lower targets to people, everybody was pretty much there.To be very clear, we're being prudent to the extent we have invest areas, whether that's in factory automation or automotive or data center or even some of our like broad based consumer businesses that we've been investing in, we will continue to invest in those. That said, when a company is spending -- we were spending around $195 million a quarter on OpEx, there's always areas that you can look at and pull back on. And so we've done exactly that. We came in below $190 million in December quarter and we're going to be in probably the low to mid 180s in March and we have the playbook where we'll watch and we will continue to watch the order flow. We won't get ahead of it, but if we see things improving, then we'll kind of -- we'll adjust and if we see things stay the same or weaken, then we'll adjust as well. So it's very much a real-time process here at Maxim and I think it is just the benefit of having a management team that's experienced and our business is cyclical and I think, fortunately for me as CFO I have -- get to work with people who are good at managing through it. -- Yes, (multiple speakers) a pretty good job. -- Thanks, Bruce. -- Yeah. -- Thanks, CJ.Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of William Stein from SunTrust. Your question, please. -- Great. Thanks for taking my question. Tunc, can you remind us how big that 100 gig optical driver business is? And with the slow down there, is that a matter of customers transitioning to 400 gig or maybe a share loss or is it more just a pause in demand and along with that maybe any expectations for recovery there? Thank you. -- Yes, so first of all, Bruce can look at the numbers, but in terms of what we see in the market, we definitely see it as a pause. We're not seeing it as a loss of sockets in the laser drivers that we're selling. And it was -- if you recall, it was really two things that we cited that caused it, one of them was an issue with one of our customers' products, a technical issue with it. So that caused a supplier reevaluation or change. So that was one of the reasons. But the other thing, I think it's pretty clear now, it's come out in the last few months that the capital spending by the cloud customers has gone down. So that also has an effect. But the biggest reason for the pause was the fact that there was a technical challenge that a customer had to go through, unrelated to our product, by the way.So that's why we're pretty confident that we have -- we don't have a share loss issue here. Now having said that, it clearly -- the pause is also being caused by the fact that even though they have this technical issue, they were really not crying out for these parts. They must have had enough inventory to carry them through this period of the pause. So that's the way we're seeing it. It's really -- I have not heard that it's because of a transition to faster data rate. If there is, we have those products as well in our pipeline. But that's not what we're seeing for the inside of the data center type applications. -- And just to size the business for you, right, we've said before that our our data center business was sort of mid single-digit, 5%, 6% of revenue and cloud was about half of that and optical was the primary driver within the cloud. So what -- it's not really a large business for us. It was driving outsized growth for us for a couple of years, I think. And -- which was great, that slowed down and as Tunc said, maybe they sort of needed some time to digest some of this inventory that we were shipping it, you know, kind of 50% year-over-year growth rates, off a small base, but clearly there was strong shipments for an extended time period. -- Great. Thanks guys. -- Yeah. -- Thanks, Will.Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Christopher Rolland from Susquehanna. Your question, please. -- Yes, this is David Donnelly on behalf of Chris Rolland. Thanks for taking our question. Just want to dig in a little deeper on the March guide for consumer, if we could, that was strongly down quarter-over-quarter. Is it just new seasonality now that you're diversified into many different customers or is this guidance largely just driven by a weaker handset environment? -- This is Bruce. And the answer to your question is yes. So it is both new seasonality. As you know, as we've gone to a more broad based consumer business, which has, you know, generally has strong in the September and December quarters, which we saw, good strength in those quarters, in those kind of broad based businesses, tablets, wearables, peripherals, gaming, etc. And then it's, you know, typically down in March. So that is some new seasonality for us in our broad based business. In addition, we are seeing I think, like others, weakness in smartphones such that we're seeing kind of below historical levels for smartphones in the March quarter.So I think it's a combination of both. I think overall we still feel very good about the broad based consumer business. It grew you know very -- those grew very strongly in this kind of, you know, 20%, 30% range year-over-year in the December quarter and they're just going through their kind of normal seasonal softness in March. -- Got it. Thank you. -- Thanks, David.Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to the management for any further remarks. -- Okay. Thank you, Jonathan. That does conclude today's conference call.

But investors who are willing to absorb the near-term pain and take advantage of secular semiconductor trends over the long run should keep  (NASDAQ: SWKS) ,  (NASDAQ: XLNX) , and  (NASDAQ: MXIM) on their radar. Let's see why.Image Source: Getty Images.Skyworks Solutions looks well prepared to overcome the industry downturn thanks to its strong margin profile. In fact, all three companies discussed in this piece carry this trait. data by For comparison, the average operating margin of the semiconductor industry is around 27%, whereas all the ones in the chart above are over 30. Skyworks is at the top of this list and it won't be surprising if its margins get better on account of favorable technology trends in smartphones and the Internet of Things.Carrier aggregation -- which increases bandwidth -- for instance, will give Skyworks' business a nice shot in the arm as it supplies necessary technology.Looking ahead, demand for Skyworks' aggregation switches will increase with the advent of  cellular networks. That's because 5G networks require the aggregation of a wide range of spectrum bands from 30 GHz to 300 GHz as compared to the 4G network that uses frequencies below 6 GHz.Considering that 5G smartphone shipments are forecast to increase from just 2 million in 2019 to 1.5 billion in 2025, it can be safely said that Skyworks Solutions is sitting on a massive opportunity.Just like Skyworks, demand for Xilinx's programmable chips is going to take off thanks to their  (AI). It is estimated that the market for FPGA (field-programmable gate array) chips that Xilinx deals in will be worth $12.1 billion in 2024 as compared to $6.9 billion at the end of 2016.Xilinx is in a solid position to take advantage of this growth, as it controls nearly 60% of the FPGA market.  holds the remaining market share in this space, and it is likely that it could lose more ground because of a delay in its 10-nm (nanometer) production process. Xilinx is all set to launch its next-generation FPGAs based on the  , while Intel's competing 10-nm platform will probably  , assuming that there are no further delays.Ideally, Xilinx's chips based on a smaller manufacturing node should give it a leg up over Intel. That's because a smaller nanometer indicates that the chip is made using an advanced process, which allows for more processing power and lower power consumption. As such, Xilinx can widen its technology lead over Chipzilla, as the latter will remain on the 14-nm manufacturing process for at least two years.In all, Xilinx looks set to corner a bigger share of the FPGA market. This is one of the reasons why the company's earnings are forecast to grow at a compound annual growth rate of nearly 16% over the next five years. This marks a terrific improvement over the 4% annual earnings growth that Xilinx has recorded in the past five years.Maxim Integrated has managed to get its growth back on track of late thanks to  its automotive business. Its revenue increased 8% in the recently concluded fiscal year, which marks an improvement over the 5% annual revenue growth it clocked in fiscal 2017. The good news is that Maxim believes that its automotive business will grow in the low teens going forward.The automotive business supplied 22%, or $139 million, of Maxim's total revenue during the quarter ended in June. This translates into an annual automotive run rate of $556 million. Using a 13% growth rate (the company's low-teens estimate), Maxim's annual automotive revenue could exceed $1 billion in the next five years, nearly double where it stands right now. Given that Maxim has generated $2.48 billion in revenue in the trailing 12 months, the automotive business looks all set to give its figures a nice boost in the future.More importantly, Maxim is in a solid position to grow the automotive business thanks to its partnerships with the likes of  . Maxim's integrated circuits have been chosen by NVIDIA to power its advanced self-driving car systems, including the DRIVE Pegasus and the Xavier platforms.The good news for Maxim is that NVIDIA's autonomous driving platforms are witnessing higher engagement levels thanks to its solid ecosystem of partners. Maxim's long-term prospects appear rosy.In the end, we can conclude that all three companies could deliver nice gains to investors in the long run despite short-term hiccups, thanks to their reliance on secular growth trends. That's why investors should hold tight and possibly accumulate these three stocks if they show signs of short-term weakness.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Shares have added about 12.4% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Maxim due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Maxim Integrated Products reported fiscal first-quarter 2019 adjusted earnings of 75 cents per share, increasing 25% from the year-ago quarter and 2.7% sequentially. The figure also came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Revenues of $638.5 million increased 10.9% year over year and inched up 1% from the previous quarter. This was driven by strong momentum across automotive, industrial, consumer and data center markets. Further, the company's distribution channel also contributed well throughout the quarter.The top line was within the company's guidance of $615-$655 million and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $634 million. The company generated 28% of its total revenues during the reported quarter. Revenues in this market increased 12% from the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by factory automation products, content growth in medical products and broad market sales growth. This market yielded 21% of revenues during the fiscal first quarter. Further, revenues were up 15% on a year-over-year basis. This can primarily be attributed to strong performance of battery management systems for electric vehicles and driver assistance content, revenues from which surged 60% from the year-ago quarter. Moreover, increasing design wins for battery management systems and expanding customer base due to new product introductions aided Maxim's performance in this market. Maxim generated 28% of revenues from this market. Revenues in this market went up 13% year over year, driven by the company's solid momentum across wearables, gaming, tablets, smartphones and peripheral markets. Revenues in this market went up 9% from the year-ago quarter and accounted for 20% of the total revenues in the reported quarter. This was due to strong performance of 100G optical products which mitigated the sluggishness in communications infrastructure. This market accounted for 3% of the total revenues during the quarter under review. The company's performance in this market was weak and consequently revenues declined 9% year over year.Non-GAAP gross margin was 68.5%, up 160 basis points (bps) year over year and 50 bps sequentially.Non-GAAP operating expenses of $194.2 million decreased 0.2% sequentially but increased 6.5% year over year. However, as a percentage of revenues, the figure contracted 30 bps sequentially and 130 bps year over year.Operating margin was 38%, up 280 bps from the prior-year quarter and 290 bps quarter over quarter.As of Sep 29, 2018, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $2.56 billion compared with $2.63 billion as of Jun 30, 2018.During the quarter under review, cash flow from operations was $207.2 million, increasing from $146.7 million in the last reported quarter. The company used $18 million for capital expenditure during the fiscal first quarter.Further, Maxim spent $112 million in repurchasing shares and made $128 million of dividend payment (46 cents per share).For fiscal second-quarter 2019, Maxim expects revenues in the range of $570 million to $610 million.Gross margin is expected within 66-68% on an adjusted basis (excluding special items). Earnings per share are expected in the range of 59-65 cents on an adjusted basis.Management expects to retain its strong momentum in the automotive market in the fiscal second quarter, backed by the company's strengthening content in driver assistance applications and well performing battery management systems.However, management has announced that industrial market will be significantly down due to sluggish bookings and weakening momentum across the company's customers. Further, slowing shipment of 100G optical module remains a hindrance for the company's performance in the data center market.Moreover, seasonal fluctuations in the consumer market are headwinds for Maxim's top-line growth in the fiscal second-quarter 2019.In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. The consensus estimate has shifted -14.41% due to these changes.Currently, Maxim has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a D. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise Maxim has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

This raised panic among investors, leading to huge selloffs on Thursday.That said, chip stocks have been largely responsible for the long-running market rally. However, fears of a bubble are making a comeback courtesy of a bunch of market watchers, who feel that the trade war has started taking a toll on chip stocks.However, the sector's fundamentals are still strong, with global semiconductor sales increasing once again in August, per the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA). Given this scenario, it makes semiconductor stocks must haves for your portfolio.On Oct 4, investors' confidence was dented after Deutsche Bank reduced its 2019 earnings estimates by 5% on average for as many as eight chipmakers. The firm cited weakness in business activity as a major reason that could affect the semiconductor industry.This resulted in investors panicking, leading to huge selloffs. This saw shares of Texas Instruments Incorporated  , Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.  and Analog Devices, Inc.  plummeting 2.1%, 2.3% and 2%, respectively.The PHLX Semiconductor index (SOX) declined more than 1.8%. Understandably, trade war fears have been making investors jittery. China is one of the biggest markets for semiconductors and investors are panicking that a full-fledged trade war could hit the chip stocks.Semiconductor stocks may have been taking a hit of late but chip stocks have been responsible for the market's rally for quite some time now. Trade war fears have been gripping markets, making investors jittery. Despite this, the Semiconductor Industry Association on Oct 1 said that global semiconductor sales reached $40.16 billion in August, up 14.9% year over year. Moreover, global semiconductor sales were 1.7% higher than July's total of $39.49 billion.This is also the first time that monthly global chip sales have topped the $40 billion mark. According to John Neuffer, president and CEO, Semiconductor Industry Association, \"Sales remain strong across every major semiconductor product category and regional market, with the China and Americas markets standing out with the largest year-year growth.\"Also, regional sales compared to August 2017 increased in China to 27.3%. Moreover, per research firm, Inkwood Research, the global semiconductor market is projected to witness a CAGR of 7.67% between 2017 and 2024.China is one of the biggest markets for semiconductors and trade war fears have been denting investors' confidence. However, the impressive sales figures are a proof that the fears might just be overblown. Also, China's limitations in building its own tech industry might restrict it from acting against U.S.-based chipmakers.The United States is the largest semiconductor manufacturing country, while China is its biggest market. Trade war fears definitely have dented investors' confidence but chip stocks aren't as susceptible to trade war as industrials. Also, China's limitations in building its own tech industry might restrict it from acting against U.S.-based tech players.Given the robust demand for semiconductors and an increase in global semiconductor sales once again in August, the recent fears may be overblown.

Now I'll turn the call over to Tunc. -- Thank you, Kathy. Good afternoon to all our participants and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in Maxim Integrated. Our September quarter results were solid.Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue and profitability grew strongly, driven by Automotive, Consumer, Industrial, and Data Center. Looking forward, we are seeing softening business conditions. However, we believe our business model enables us to be successful in any environment. Due to our strong free cash flow and positive net cash balance, we plan to return 125% of free cash flow to shareholders this fiscal year by increasing the share buyback.We believe buying our shares is the best use of our cash in the current environment. I want to remind investors that our second fiscal quarter last year was a 14-week quarter and was also impacted by the transition to sell-in accounting at one distributor. My comments on December quarter year-on-year comparisons adjust down year-ago quarter revenue for both of these items. Let me now discuss September results and current quarter outlook, starting with Automotive.In the September quarter, our Automotive business was up 15% from the same quarter last year. We continue to see the strongest demand signals from battery management systems for electric vehicles and driver assistance content. Our content growth opportunities for Maxim in ADAS applications continue to be centered on power management and point-to-point serial link data communication products. Recently, we introduced a new generation of serial link products for transporting video, audio, and data in automotive applications.This GMSL-2 technology supports 6 gigabit per second transfers for display and driver assistance and can also transport 1 gigabit per second Ethernet. Our technology includes diagnostic capabilities to assist the health of the link and is compliant with automotive safety integrity level standards, making it suitable for autonomous drive applications. The first pair of products lead many GMSL-2 products to follow in the coming year. We received extremely strong customer pull for this product family.Customers have ordered over 90,000 engineering prototypes in the first three months and we had already won designs at seven different OEMs. Turning to battery management systems for electric vehicles. We are growing our global footprint as design wins from prior years translate into today's revenue growth. Battery management systems and driver assistance revenue grew over 60% from the same quarter last year.In the December quarter, we expect Automotive to be strongly up sequentially and up in the mid-teens from the same quarter last year. We expect the strength to come from content increases in secular growth areas, offsetting slowdown in global auto production. We expect battery management systems revenue for electric vehicles to nearly double from the same quarter last year with growth across several geographies. In addition, we expect continued content growth in driver assistance applications.Let me next turn to the industrial market. In the September quarter, industrial was up 12% from the same quarter last year. Our growth in industrial benefited from content growth in factory automation and medical products. In our broad market business and distribution, we continue to see double-digit resales growth from the same quarter last year.However, we began to receive weaker bookings and slower resales within a broad base of customers in the latter part of the quarter. Bruce will provide more detailed commentary on the dynamics of our distribution business. We continue to believe in the long-term growth trajectory of factory automation. We will be showcasing our latest technologies serving the digital factory at the Munich electronica trade show in November.Our Industry 4.0 areas of focus include: first, robust interface and communications products that bring intelligence to the factory edge; second, small thermal-efficient digital isolation and isolated power and protection solutions; and third, ultra-efficient and tiny footprint power modules. We believe that we are in the early days of the deployment of industrial 4.0 control systems in factories around the world, and this movement has at least a few more decades before the market saturates. In the December quarter, we expect industrial to be strongly down sequentially. This reflects our assumption that recent weakness in bookings and resales at broad-based customers and through distribution will continue, given the uncertain environment.Let me next discuss Communications and Data Center. In the September quarter, Comms and Data Center was up 9% from the same quarter last year. We experienced strong growth in 100G optical products for the data center, combined with slower growth in communications infrastructure. In the December quarter, we anticipate Comms and Data Center revenue to be strongly down sequentially with a temporary slowdown in 100G optical module shipments after many quarters of strong growth.We believe we are in the middle innings in the deployment of 100G optical modules for hyperscale data centers and expect this business to return to growth in the first half of calendar 2019. Finally, let me turn to Consumer. In the September quarter, Consumer was up sequentially and up 13% from the same quarter last year. Due to continued strong performance of our broad-based business in tablets, wearables, smartphones, gaming, and peripherals.In the December quarter, we expect Consumer to be strongly down sequentially due to seasonality. To summarize, we have built Maxim to be successful in any environment. One, we continue to grow content and generate new design wins in high-quality, diversified and long product life cycle markets, such as automotive and industrial. Two, our flexible manufacturing structure ensures consistent world-class gross margins.Three, we continue to exert tight spending controls. And four, we have low-capital intensity in manufacturing. All of this is driving strong and predictable cash flows, giving us confidence to increase our share buyback plan during fiscal year 2019, returning 125% of our free cash flow to investors. With that, I will now turn the call over to Bruce. -- Thanks, Tunc. We're pleased to announce that we're increasing our return on capital commitment from 100% to 125% of free cash flow for Maxim's fiscal-year 2019. The increase will all go toward incremental share buybacks for the balance of fiscal-year 2019. At the current stock price, we expect the Q2 buyback will approximately double compared to Q1.Also our board has approved a new share buyback authorization of $1.5 billion. Our increased share buyback program reflects our strong net cash position and our belief that buying our shares is the best use of our cash in the current environment. As a result of the increased buyback during this industry slowdown, we will exit this period with greater earnings power. Let me now turn to Q1 results.Revenue for Q1 was $638 million, up 11% from the same quarter a year ago. Our revenue mix by major markets in Q1 was approximately 28% from Industrial, 28% Consumer, 21% Automotive, 20% Comms and Data Center, and 3% Computing. Our Industrial and Automotive business comprised roughly half of our revenue in the quarter. Turning to the distribution channel.Distribution comprised 46% of Maxim's revenue in the September quarter. We ended Q1 with 63 days of inventory in the distribution channel. Resales were up 14% from the same quarter a year ago, but resales to broad-based customers were weak. This softness affected distribution performance, primarily in the last month of the quarter.Our delivery lead times are still five to seven weeks and have been in this range for over six years. We continue to closely manage our supply chains, our inventory in the distribution channel and our distributors' performance given the uncertainties in the industry. We remain committed to our days-of-channel inventory target of 60 days or less. Turning to the P&L.Maxim's gross margin, excluding special items, was 68.5%, up 50 basis points from the prior quarter with the increase driven by ongoing tailwinds and onetime items. Operating expenses, excluding special items, were $194 million, down slightly from the prior quarter, reflecting continued cost controls. Q1 GAAP operating income, excluding special items, was $243 million. Operating margin at 38% of revenue is up from the prior quarter and up 280 basis points from the same quarter a year ago.Q1 GAAP tax rate, excluding special items, was 13% above our guidance of 9% to 10%, reflecting the latest IRS-proposed rules regarding tax reform. GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, was $0.75, up 25% from the same quarter a year ago. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Overall total cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments decreased by $63 million in the fourth quarter to $2.56 billion.Please note that we pay out our employee bonus in Q1. Q1 inventory days ended at 124, down three days from Q4. Inventory dollars were down 2% from the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $18 million in the quarter.Trailing 12-month free cash flow was $915 million or 36% of revenue, which is up 12% over the same quarter last year. Our free cash flow yield is 6.7% at yesterday's closing stock price. Our free cash flow per share was $3.24. For capital return, share repurchases totaled $112 million in Q1 as we bought back approximately 1.9 million shares.Dividends totaled $128 million in the quarter or $0.46 per share. This reflects the 10% increase in the dividend that our board approved last quarter. Based on the increase in dividend and yesterday's closing stock price, our dividend yield is 3.8%. Moving on to guidance, I want to remind investors that our second fiscal quarter last year was a 14-week quarter and was impacted by the transition to sell-in accounting at one distributor. Adjusting for both of these items, we estimate our normalized revenue in Q2 of last fiscal year was around $580 million.Our beginning Q2 backlog was $418 million. Based on this beginning backlog and expected turns, we forecast Q2 revenue of $570 million to $610 million. Adjusting for the 14-week quarter and the sell-in accounting transition in the same quarter a year ago, the midpoint of our guidance reflects approximately 2% growth in Q2 compared to the same quarter a year ago. This is the result of continued content growth in automotive, offset by the softness we are now seeing in the broad market.Q2 gross margin, excluding special items, is forecasted at 66% to 68% down from Q1. This is driven by one-time items that benefited Q1 and lower revenue in Q2. The modest gross margin impact from lower Q2 revenue is due to our flexible manufacturing strategy. Q2 operating expenses, excluding special items, are expected to be flat with Q1 despite the full-quarter impact of our annual merit increase due to continued tight cost controls.Our tax rate for Q2, excluding special items, is expected to be 13%, flat with the prior quarter. 13% is our best estimate to use for modeling purposes for the balance of fiscal 2019. For Q2 GAAP earnings per share, excluding special items, we expect a range of $0.59 to $0.65. For FY '19, we expect capital expenditures to be at the high end of our targeted range of 1% to 3% of revenue as we perform required maintenance at our internal fab.I would also like to note that we plan to pay off our $500 million bond that will come due in November. In summary, we expect modest growth in Q2 revenue compared to the same quarter last year due to our diversified end market exposure, despite uncertainty in the current environment. Our flexible manufacturing strategy enables us to maintain high profitability while mitigating the risk of building excess inventory. And we will continue to tightly control operating expenses.All these factors result in high-quality earnings and free cash flow. Our positive net cash position allows us to increase our return of cash to shareholders from 100% to 125% in fiscal 2019. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kathy. -- Thanks, Bruce. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now open the call for questions. [Operator instructions] Andrew, could we please have our first question?[Operator instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. -- Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and good to see the diversification in the business playing out here. On the guidance, industrial looks like the biggest driver of the sub-seasonal trend in the December quarter and it looks like within that it's mostly your broad markets, SMB business. Can you guys just provide us with some color in terms of which geographies you're seeing most of the shortfall? Any color on some of the sub-segments within that? And, I guess, most importantly from a bookings perspective, have the declines stabilized, thus far, here in the December quarter? -- Hi, Harlan. This is Bruce. I'll take that. So, you're exactly right.The biggest area for slowdown had been in the Industrial broad-based market. We've actually seen that globally. It was pretty kind of across all geographies we saw that weakness in our industrial business. We started to see that in kind of the September or late September when the bookings slowed down.I think it's too early to make a call on whether those -- whether that stabilized or not. Obviously, we're continuing to monitor that information and manage it closely and managing our inventory in the channel and our inventory on our own books, right, to make sure we manage that closely. But we haven't seen -- I think it's too early to say whether or not that softness has stabilized or is starting to bounce back. -- Thank you, Harlan. -- Thank you.Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. -- Hi, guys. Wanted to dive a little bit into a similar sort of question on the automotive side. I know you have the BMS and the ADAS side as offsets, but that business growing still 15% year over year is very impressive relative to a laundry list that's quite long of negative data points further upstream from where you guys are. So, I guess, any color you could give about how the company offsets some of that with content above and beyond what you've already said Tunc.And is that another shoe to fall similar to what your description of industrial just was to the prior question? -- Yes. So, if you look at the automotive side, we have seen reports obviously of some of the Tier 1s and some of the car companies saying their growth has flattened or in some cases declined. But if you look at our business, we've had segments of it that we've been investing in. And of those segments, I think the one that will be the most sensitive to unit will be the infotainment piece and we do see that that growth is less than it was a year ago.So, the content growth is still offsetting the unit declines, is the way that I read that in infotainment. And in the other segments, large segments that we've invested in which are BMS, or battery management systems, and in ADAS the growth there we have is much, much larger than any decrease in unit sales of cars. So, the combination of all that is ending up giving us still a good mid-teens-type growth long term. Previously we've guided everybody to be in the low-teens.We're not really changing that. I think that that remains and basically the large content growth we're seeing plus secular growth in BMS and in ADAS systems is really letting us grow despite the fact that there is some headwinds in terms of unit car sales globally right now. So, at the current view and the view we gave of this quarter, we showed still growth year over year that was pretty healthy. Beyond that, obviously it's harder to say but our story is more of a content growth and secular growth driver story in automotive rather than the unit car sales. -- Thank you. -- Thanks Ross.Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Your line is now open. -- Hi, thank you. Bruce, I was looking at accounts receivable, up 60%. That's a pretty large increase. I went back and looked at -- my model goes back all the way to pre-Dallas days and I haven't seen such a big increase.So, what's driving that please? -- Yeah. So, I think there's a couple of things, one, just the sort of the timing of the business and sort of the mix of business that we had. If you looked at this quarter, we had a strong consumer quarter and some of those are larger customers which get a little bit longer payment terms, and so you had a little bit mix of that business. And if you're comparing this to year over year, we actually had some timing that went the other way for us a year ago in Q1.I would say that, we've absolutely noticed that same fact and we're aggressively working to bring down DSO back to kind of around the 40 days, which is our target, and you can expect that we'll execute on that. The other area in the working capital side is inventory, which we did bring down three days from 127 to 124 internally, but our goal is to get that down closer to our target of 110 days. And with our flexible manufacturing strategy, we're able to bring down and manage that inventory without having significant impacts to our gross margin. So, we're going to aggressively manage our working capital during this kind of soft spot in the industry.And, of course, just by definition, right, as revenue declines, you'll see benefits on the cash flow line from AR. So, both bringing down the DSO and then the lower revenue will generate free cash flow growth for us in the next several quarters. -- OK. Thank you. -- Yes. -- Thanks, Ambrish.And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. -- Thanks for taking my question. On the slowdown, what are your customers saying? Have they paused certain projects and those could resume whenever the macro condition stabilizes or do you think they pre-bought to get in front of tariff? And trade issues and if it's the latter and there is some excess inventory, is there a way to quantify how much you are above a normal level? -- Yes. So, this is not that easy for us to see, frankly. Remember that what Bruce mentioned, and we talked in our prepared remarks, was we're seeing a broad-based customer slowdown. So, most of these customers are actually buying through distribution.So, we're one layer removed actually from the customer and their comments. If you look at a lot of our direct customers, the larger customers, that's not where we're seeing this effect. However, I'll give you some commentary. We have asked the question to some of our automation customers and their response basically was that they are hearing that some of their end customers are kind of hesitating to build up capacity in China.I don't know how widespread that is, but we've heard it from some customers kind of to wait and see how the tariffs clear up. But I want to caution everybody, this is not like we ran a survey and we have a lot of inputs from people. We just have a few customers saying this. And the reason for the broad-based slowdown, since we don't directly talk to them, is really hard for us to say what the underlying causes for that, but it could be the things that you mentioned.Maybe they do have ordered inventory ahead or so on but we don't really know. -- OK. Thank you. -- Thanks, Vivek.And our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. -- Yes, thank you. Bruce, a follow-up question on distribution in terms of some of the slowing you're seeing there. Anything from a demand perspective versus inventory? So, as you check into that and you've seen the orders flow, what's the feedback loop in terms of maybe some slower resales versus inventory a little high that's being worked out? -- Yes. I mean, clearly we saw resales, which were still up 14% in the quarter year over year . So, that's still healthy demand. But if you sort of parse that a little bit, clearly the very -- the smallest of those customers through distribution, that's where we saw, I think, a lot of the weakness and clearly that -- as I mentioned in the earlier question, we saw that kind of on a global basis.The slowdown also happened kind of late in the quarter and so it's relatively new and as Tunc just mentioned, we're trying to figure out what's going on and we're talking with our distribution partners. But it's very difficult for us to get a good handle on that. I will say to the extent that in certain geographies where it's -- there's a Maxim specific story, whether that's BMS in China or automotive in Japan or gaming in Japan, those parts of our distribution business were very strong. So, automotive continues to do very well and our broad-based Consumer business is doing well also.So, the real slowdown that we're seeing is mainly in the kind of the industrial broad-based businesses. -- OK. Appreciate all the color. Thanks. -- Yes. -- Thanks, Craig.And our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is now open. -- Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just sort of curious on the Comm segment. You said it pulled back and it had been strong for a couple quarters.Just kind of curious if that should be -- the 100G market should be less cyclical, just kind of your comments on why it's pulling back and anything you can comment on as you look into the next couple of quarters in terms of design activity and any comments on 100G in general? Thanks. -- Yes. So, the 100G business for Maxim has been a bright spot now for the last year, year and a half. It does had strong growth. Our products and technology were very well accepted by customers.Nothing there has really changed in that respect. However, there are some customer issues that are unrelated to the Maxim product that's causing them to kind of take a breather for a quarter. That's what we're hearing. So, the growth has pretty much slowed down.But we really expect from what we hear from these customers that in the first half of next calendar year, this will pick back up again and we'll return to growth. So, nothing fundamentally has changed, but there's some customer issues that are not related to us. And those are things that they don't really like us to talk about too much. So, those are good questions to the hyperscale providers, but not to Maxim.So, nothing fundamentally wrong. I think it's going to be strong growth for the company long term. -- Thanks, Tunc. -- Thanks, Blayne.And our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. -- Yes, good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Bruce, I know you've talked about year-over-year growth in Auto for the December quarter. And I know these adjustments from last year, Industrial being down strong sequentially.Does that lead to like a down mid-teens year over year? Am I doing those adjustments right for the December quarter? And if that's the case, that seems to be worse than peers. So, I'm kind of curious, if you can help me kind of parse out the different buckets in Industrial. Is this really being driven by the fact that you guys are over-indexed to factory automation, and that's been an area that's been weak up the supply chain for a couple of quarters now, or can you help me understand why you would be down more than most of your peers in that bucket? -- Yes, and I apologize to everyone. It's always very difficult to do that comparison with the adjustments due to Avnet and the 14th week, and so that's difficult and especially I didn't kind of parse it out at the sub-segment level. That said, I want to be very clear when we do that math ourselves internally, we see our Industrial business in Q2 down low single digits, right. So it is down a little bit year over year, but it's low single digits.So, from that point of view, I think it's a little bit different than maybe the math that you did but understand it's difficult for you to be able to do that math. When we look at it, it is the broad-based business. Some of that does get included in factory automation. And that may be our speculation, as Tunc indicated, maybe just wait-and-see on some of these CAPEX projects on the factory automation side.But again, that's just what we've heard from a couple of our customers that then sell into China, so it's tough for us to know. But overall we are seeing the slowdown in Industrial. We do see it kind of down year over year in Q2 at around kind of low single digit. And that was after -- again, it kind of held up in the first quarter kind of growing 12% year over year. -- Thanks, Bruce. -- Yes. -- Thanks, John.And our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citi. Your line is now open. -- Hey. Thanks, guys. Could you just talk about where you first saw the weakness either by end market or geography? And then where have you seen the weakness most recently? -- Yes, I'll take that. It's difficult to parse that out. I mean, again, it was in Industrial, as we said it was sort of at near -- it was the end of the quarter when we started to see that and it was broad-based and across all the geographies. So, I wouldn't say it was -- we saw it in one area first or another area.So, and it's still pretty early and I think all of us are much better at accepting cycles backward looking, and I'm sure that will be true again through this cycle. -- Great. Thanks, guys. -- Yes. -- Thanks, Chris.And our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is now open. -- Yes. Thank you. So, Tunc, when you talked to some of these factory automation customers, you mentioned that they're pausing. Did you get a sense that they were kind of pausing to wait how the trade situation unfolds or are they now kind of looking at transferring manufacturing out of China and, therefore, you're starting to see the pause.I'm just trying to understand how long this is going to last and I don't know if you have any color you could share with us. -- Well, I'll share with you what I know, which is not going to be a whole lot. The -- remember it's the automation customers and we're talking about their comments about their customers. So, it's really hard to understand. But it looked like they were mostly waiting for, as you said, the trade situation or the tariff situation to resolve itself.But as we all know, it hasn't yet. And it's not really known how long it's going to take to resolve, if ever, frankly. So, it's not really that clear whether this will be just let's wait and then we'll build the factory somewhere or let's wait and it gets resolved. I think the world is going to continue to need products to buy, so I don't think that the long-term growth in factory automation or productivity increases is going to change.So, the demand is going to be there but right now I think a lot of customers are kind of in a \"let's wait and see before you make a big decisions mode.\" But I don't -- I think this fundamentally does not change our belief that automation is going to be a great area for growth for Maxim for years to come. -- Thank you, Tunc. -- Thanks, Tore. -- Hey. This is Bruce. I actually just want to clarify something that came up with the earlier question on the AR. We're close to it, so I just assumed people knew.But just make sure that there's clarification there. There is an accounting change that went into effect in our -- beginning our first quarter of fiscal year, where basically we used to report in the accounts receivable line that used to be net of any reserves associated with that. And so, the accounting change now moved that reserve down into the liability side. So, now you're seeing gross AR.And so if you're just looking at that, you have to -- if you don't grab the reserve that's down in the liability section, then absolutely it'll look very, very large. So, you have to do an adjusted DSO calculation. I'm sorry about that, but just to get an apples-to-apples comparison. So, anyway I just wanted to clarify that point.That said, we've -- still even on an adjusted basis, we've seen some increase in our DSO and we're working to bring that down. But certainly, if you haven't made the adjustment, it would look much, much worse than it really is. So, again, I apologize, but I just wanted to clarify that. -- Yes, just for everybody to know, I mean, our terms have not changed with customers. And we're collecting as aggressively as we always have been, so nothing's changed in the fundamentals.Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. -- Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping you could provide a little bit more color on your consumer business. It seems like you had a pretty good quarter in September. It seems like you're guiding to a seasonal December quarter.But curious, what kind of trends, what kind of momentum did you see at your large smartphone customer? What are your expectations with that customer going into December and perhaps into the early part of 2019? And other parts of consumer, where I think you've done a great job in diversifying your application and customer mix over the past couple of years. How sustainable is growth in that business over the next year or so? You guys talked about wearables, tablets, gaming. Wearables and tablets are necessarily growthy markets, if you will. And in gaming, I think one of your larger customers just had a very huge product cycle.So,curious how you think about sustainability there. Thank you. -- Yes, so actually you answered most of the questions yourself, which is great. So our strategy has been, as you well put, to diversify the consumer business and to broaden both the customers, the markets we're getting into, and the types of products that we sell. And we've made good headway in that, now we have a broader base, customer base. And we are selling into all the markets you mentioned, into tablets, wearables some gaming products, many other broad-based applications.So, that is going well. With our largest customer obviously, we still have a good relationship. We have -- and they plan to still continue to make smartphones. So, we'll have some business there in the company.But always remember that our philosophy here is to broaden that business as much as we can which gives us more stability and less changes from year to year. And also make sure that our goals to have a business that we can rely on in terms of cash flows is going to be there. So, I think we've made great progress. We've been reporting about it for a while now.And your questions about the largest customer, the relationship is good. It's very healthy. And as we do each year, we have to win the business every year and that for that market there's no change. -- Yes, this is Bruce. -- Thank you. -- This is Bruce. Just to add on to what Tunc said. While that relationship with our large customer is good, we still expect that customer to be less than 10% for this fiscal year. And then also just to reiterate what Tunc said, I think it's important for people to understand with this broad-based business, they're all kind of small wins.And yes, we're going to win and lose some of those but to the extent that we continue to kind of leverage our power management, our audio products across this broad base, we think that's what allows us to deliver sort of this very broad-based stable Consumer business. And as you said, even with the second quarter seasonally down, we still expect it to be up in sort of the low to mid-single-digits year over year. So, I think that's just evidence of the kind of the transformation we've done within our Consumer businesses. -- Very helpful. Thank you so much. -- Yes. -- Thanks, Toshiya.And our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Evercore. Your line is now open. -- Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I guess a two-part question. First one, are you seeing stronger dollar weakening in emerging currencies as a headwind, have customers discussed that? And then secondly, as you think about the higher tax rate versus that 9% to 10% you were thinking before, is that a function of more U.S.revenues expected in the mix in fiscal '19? And should we think about that 9% to 10% as we move into fiscal '20? Thank you. -- Sure. So, the first question on the currency, 99% of our revenue is in dollars. And so from that point of view, we haven't -- that doesn't impact us and even for our customers that translate, like some of our distribution partners, that the currency has not come up. So, we don't see that as an issue for us.On the tax side, the reason it came in at 13% versus our guidance of 9% to 10%, when we guided in July, it was based on our best understanding of the kind of the new tax reform laws. The IRS subsequently released kind of proposed rules in September that countered some of our assumptions. And then we ended up at around the 13%. We do expect that 13% based on what we know is kind of the best estimate to use for modeling going forward and it was really about just learning -- getting all the rules out there.It wasn't about mix of our business or anything related to operational aspects of the business. -- Yes, one other thing on the currency aspect. As Bruce said, most of our sales are in dollars, so it doesn't matter for us. But obviously changes in currencies of different countries do affect the sales of their end products to their customers and their competitiveness. However, Maxim is a global company, so we're pretty much selling to all these customers.So, who wins or loses doesn't affect us that much. So, this is really not on our radar as a concern or something to think about. -- Thank you. -- Thanks, C.J.And our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Raymond James. Your line is now open. -- Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. Just a question with respect to guidance and how much of -- within that guidance the weakness you're attributing to end demand as compared to inventory? And I know that is probably easier to answer with respect to the distribution channel and end market customers. You said, I think, that the distributor inventory was 63 days, which is ahead of your target.How fast do you expect to get that within your target levels and how much of a headwind does that present? -- Yes. Certainly, we're committed to our target of 60 days or less and we're always working to achieve that. I would say the biggest wild card for us on that is resales, right, and the ability to forecast that, especially when we're still kind of in early days of this softness that we're seeing. So, it's difficult for us to predict, say, this quarter on where channel inventory will be.Absolutely our commitment over the long-term, medium term is to get that number to 60 or less and we absolutely will get there. So certainly, and that's something we'll report every quarter and you can track our progress against that. -- Got it. Thank you. -- Yes. -- Thanks, Chris.And our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. -- Thanks for taking my question guys. So, I guess, if I hear this correctly, you guys are talking about the slowdown really being more or less Industrial-centric at this point. So, I'm wondering if you kind of just think back to the past cycles in '13 and '15, is it rare for a correction to be happening in just one end market versus perhaps spreading to other segments? If you just maybe help me understand your conviction on how this is Industrial-specific where's the risk that you expect in your other market? And then how would you react if this is a more widespread correction across your further markets? -- Yes. So, as you pointed out, we've obviously been through a few of these cycles before. And what I can say is my experience has been that, each one of them is a little bit different than the previous one. So, it's too early to compare or build a model saying this cycle looks like the previous one.So, let me just make sure that that's clear. The things that we do know is that since we've been through a few of them, both Bruce and I, we know how to manage through these cycles. We know what to do in terms of making sure the company does well. Compared to prior cycles, I think Maxim is much better able to be successful, mainly because we're more diversified in our revenue base.We have a better profitability model and our gross margins are much less sensitive to volume. Now, your question about will it spread to other areas from Industrial? Yes, there's some background sound there which... -- Maybe the caller could mute? -- Yes, mute. All right. Thanks. So, in terms of, will it spread into the other markets? It's really difficult for us to assess that.But the important thing to realize is that a bigger portion of our small customer or broad customer revenue is coming from our Industrial customers. So, there's fewer revenue that's going through small customers in other markets, frankly. So, that's one point. And the other one that's -- I think most people have already heard about is unit sales of cars that's kind of slowed down a little bit, but we're -- as I said, we're pretty immune to that one.So, I think that we'll be doing fine in that area. So, hard for us to predict and each cycle is a little bit different, but I think we'll do well in the cycle if it extends or gets more concerning or more. -- Thank you. -- Yes. And this is Bruce, just to add on exactly what Tunc said, it's always difficult to predict. But as he said, I think we're much better positioned to do well and I think our strong cash position, strong cash flow going forward really allows us to increase our buyback during this period and really buyback our shares in potentially a weak environment, which we think is, by far, the best investment of our cash. And absolutely, we believe, we'll come out stronger on the back end of this cycle, however long it lasts because of the strength of our business model, the strength of our cash flow, and our commitment to use that to invest in Maxim because we believe that this is a company with a very strong long-term value proposition. -- Thank you, Amit.And our next question comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri with Macquarie. Your line is now open. -- Thank you. Bruce, I have a question, I want to go back to the inventory comment. So, as you bring down your channel inventory, could you talk about what your plans are for your own balance sheet inventory? And it looks like you're bringing that down as well. My question is does it make more sense to actually carry a bit more inventory on your own balance sheet as opposed to in the channel given the environment? And then if you were to bring down your own balance sheet inventory, how much of a headwind is that to your gross margins and how should we think about it? Thank you. -- Sure. And I think most people who know me know I hate inventory. I just think it's a result of inefficiencies in the supply chain. And what we've done is by moving to a flexible manufacturing strategy, I think we have that ability to react both on the upside and the downside to changes in demand.And so absolutely I think we got a little bit ahead of ourselves when we got to 127 days last quarter and I stated that very clearly. And we're committed to bringing that down. We brought it down three days this quarter to 124. And absolutely, our goal, if you look at our internal plan, are to continue bringing that number down irregardless of the demand environment.And because of that flexible manufacturing strategy, we don't expect that that will be a big headwind on gross margin. Obviously, there's some. I had said kind of publicly in prior occasions that we did sensitivity analysis and we said that if there was a 10% decline in revenue, it might be a 1% to 2% impact on the gross margin. And here you can see in this quarter, we're down about 7.5% sequentially and we're seeing about a 1 point impact to gross margin as a result of that.So, overall, we feel like the strategy we undertook a few years ago when we transferred the company is the right strategy throughout a cycle both good and bad and we feel comfortable with that and we're absolutely committed to bringing down inventory, both off our balance sheet and within the channel. -- Thank you. -- Yes. -- Thank you, Srini.And our next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Your line is now open. -- Hey, guys. As we look at semis guide this season we're getting a pretty big difference between companies. And it seems like those companies that were kind of notorious for longer lead times are guiding better and those with shorter lead times, like you guys, or QI, let's say, are having a little bit more challenging 4Q. And I guess I'm wondering those with short lead times like yourself, do you think maybe you guys are taking lumps a quarter earlier than the others or perhaps just the correlation to lead times is more of a coincidence.Just any thoughts you guys might have there would be great. -- Yes, that's probably a good model to build after the cycle is over. But we don't really have enough insights into how the companies are working down their longer lead times, when they get to see this versus those with short lead times. My intuition would say short lead time companies would probably see it quicker, but we -- I don't have any data to back that up. -- OK. Thanks, guys. -- Thank you, Chris.And our next question comes from the line of Cody Acree with Loop Capital. Your line is now open. -- Thank you, guys, for taking my questions. Bruce, with your 63 days of channel inventory and your target of less than 60, do you get a sense in talking to distributors that this is likely to linger into the March quarter or are you comfortable that just getting within that kind of 60-day range is going to be a sufficient leanness of the channel inventory? -- Yes. I mean, it's very difficult for us to understand how long this will last. So, I think from that point of view, I don't think we have any unique insights there. We're just managing it based on what we're seeing and working to pay close attention to resales and adjust shipments appropriately to find that right balance between supporting the appropriate level of inventory.Because as I said, part of our distribution is supporting Automotive, which is doing well, right, part of it is supporting some of the similar broad-based Consumer businesses that are doing well. And so with the flipside being we need to closely manage the inventory for like the Industrial and broad-based businesses. So, we're trying to find that right balance, while bringing it down to the 60 days. As I said, I think it's very difficult with -- in the current flux of the current environment to predict exactly when that's going to happen.My commitment is, we absolutely will continue to work on that and get to that level. The exact quarter really depends on the environment and what happens with resales. -- Great. Thank you. -- Yes. -- Thanks, Cody.Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. -- Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me sneak in a follow-up here. Just two somewhat housekeeping items. Bruce, you mentioned that the gross margin had some one-timers in the fiscal first quarter.I was hoping you could size that. And when you talk about OPEX controls, just talk about the variability of what you guys can do in OPEX if revenue does get worse as we head into the first half of calendar '19. -- Yes. Hi, Ross. So, the one-time benefit was about 50 bps so that 68.5%, about 50 bps was the one-time and then to go from the 68% to the 67%, the midpoint of our guide is sort of that 1 point that I talked about around the revenue impact. Concerning OPEX, clearly we've said that we're going to keep it flat in the second quarter and that's despite -- it's about a $3.5 million impact of our annual salary adjustment that happen in the September quarters and that you get a full quarter impact.So, we're already offsetting that number in the quarter. And we'll do our normal -- we'll look at the kind of the discretionary spending first, right, incremental headcount add, travel. If this extends over time, Tunc and I have been through these cycles many things, we have the playbook. We know exactly how to work through that.So, we're confident that we'll be able to manage OPEX appropriately. I do want to say we'll make sure we continue to invest in those important businesses for us, right, the high-growth areas that we talked about whether that's Automotive, factory automation, the Data Center, broad-based Consumer. But that said, within a large company, there's always opportunities to manage our cost appropriately and I think over the years, we've shown that we're pretty good managers in that area. -- Thank you. -- Yes. -- Thanks, Ross.[Operator instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. -- Thanks for the follow-up. Bruce, maybe just again on the gross margins, so it's 67% without the one-time. So that would be kind of flat year on year even though sales are up? Anything going on there? Was it just a different mix than you anticipated? -- No. To be honest, I'll have to look at that and I'll get back to you on a year over year because generally our gross margins have been trending up over time and we've seen that strength, so -- but I'll get back to you on the follow-up question. -- OK. Thank you. -- Yes. -- Thanks, Vivek.Thank you. And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Kathy for closing remarks. -- Thank you, Andrew. That concludes today's conference call.

It is the next-generation evaluation and development platform, also known as MAXREFDES101.With the launch of this platform, Maxim aims at providing various health parameters to wearable designers and health application developers by monitoring the electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate and body temperature of an individual.This, in turn, will enable the designers to meet the complex challenges while developing accurate wearable solutions, thus saving development time.We note that these wearable platforms are likely to help the company in attracting more designers to its platforms. This will improve the company's clientele, driving its top-line growth.Notably, shares of Maxim have returned 24.2% in a year's time, outperforming the  's rally of 0.9%.With the increasing demand for fitness trackers and wearables in today's technically advanced world, designers are putting in immense efforts to provide proper and valuable health information to customers by developing improved apps and wearables.Per the latest report from Allied Market Research, the global fitness tracker market is expected to witness a CAGR of 19.6% between 2017 and 2023, and reach $62.1 billion by 2023.Also, Maxim is well poised to cater to growing needs of precise data and sensors in this market, backed by its strong wearable platforms.The HSP 2.0 platform contains MAX32630 DARWIN microcontroller, MAX32664 biometric sensor hub with embedded heart-rate algorithm, MAX30205 human body temperature sensor, MAX86141 optical pulse oximeter and heart-rate sensor, among others. All of these will help designers extract vital health-related data, and thereby develop accurate wearable solutions.The company's strong focus toward expansion and innovation of its product portfolio remains a tailwind. Moreover, enhanced and new products help the company in acquiring clients.Maxim's HSP 2.0 platform, along with its precise data, is expected to bring in more design customers.In June, the company rolled out its evaluation and development platforms  MAX-HEALTH-BAND and MAX-ECG-MONITOR. While MAX-HEALTH-BAND monitors the heart rate and activities of an individual, MAX-ECG-MONITOR detects heart-rate signals and ECG as well.Maxim's varied product portfolio helps the company perform well across all end markets. Furthermore, it assists the company to win clients and expand globally.The company is gaining traction with its innovative products that bode well for Maxim's market position. | Currently, Maxim carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Each endured their own declines today, albeit none as severe as MACOM's -- a likely consequence of MACOM's more than 30% pop since its  in early May.To justify his bearish calls, Svanberg argued that after two straight years of strong growth, the analog and mixed-signal semiconductor market is increasingly showing signs that it may have peaked. What's more, customer inventory building ahead of proposed tariffs has resulted in lower visibility into near-term growth.Svanberg added that MACOM, in particular, could struggle given its higher debt load relative to peers in its space, especially if interest rates continue to rise.In the meantime, you can be sure investors will be watching these trends closely, with MACOM's next quarterly report slated for mid-November.

This strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks that have impressive prospects and are trading at a discount.The GARP approach leads to the identification of stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.That means a portfolio created on the basis of GARP strategy is expected to have stocks that offer the best of both value and growth investing.The GARP strategy seeks to offer an ideal investment by utilizing the best features of both value and growth investing. Investors adopting the GARP approach will prefer to buy stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Both strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.GARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics - price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is also considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.And that's what we're screening for today\u2026Get the remaining stocks on the list and start putting this and other ideas to the test.

After all, dividend titans such as  ,  ,  , and  have a handsome payout that exceeds the sector's average yield of just 1.1% by a wide margin.What's more, a closer look at the dividend-paying stocks in the tech sector throws up some interesting names that could become the next Cisco or Intel. Let's take a look at two tech names --  (NASDAQ: SWKS) and  (NASDAQ: MXIM) -- that already pay a solid dividend, but also possess the potential of increasing their payout consistently in the future.Image Source: Getty Images.Skyworks has been paying a dividend since 2014. Impressively, the company has raised its payout every year since initiation. In fact, it recently bumped up the quarterly payout by 19% to $0.38 per share, which translates into a yield of 1.70%. Now, you might not be very impressed by Skyworks' dividend yield at first, but you will surely be intrigued by the fact that it has got a lot of room to increase the payout.After the recent dividend increase, Skyworks's annual dividend expense will come to approximately $272 million based on the number of shares outstanding. The company has generated around $914 million in net income over the trailing 12 months. So, it will be paying 29% of its trailing net income in the form of dividends even if there is no earnings growth over the next year.As such, the company is sitting on a comfortably manageable  that could be increased in the future to return more value to shareholders as some important catalysts materialize.For instance, Skyworks is all set to benefit from emerging technologies such as the  (IoT) and  . IoT, for example, is already  for the company's nonmobile business, which now supplies 30% of Skyworks' total revenue. But this is only the beginning, as the chipmaker's partnerships with the likes of  and  will allow it to get into fast-growing markets such as smart lighting and machine-to-machine (M2M) connectivity.Sierra, for example, is a global leader in M2M connectivity with a third of the market under its control. The IoT specialist is using 17 Skyworks devices to power its M2M wireless modules. This could be a big deal for Skyworks in the long run, as the global M2M module market is expected to clock an annual growth rate of 23% through 2022, according to TechNavio.It won't be surprising if Skyworks continues clocking double-digit earnings growth over the long run. Moreover, the rise in net income will help the company boost its free cash flow. This is a green flag for investors since management is focused on returning all of the free cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, paving the way for further dividend growth at the chipmaker.Unlike Skyworks, Maxim Integrated has a handsome yield and a longer payout history. The chipmaker has been regularly paying a dividend since 2007, and after the latest 10% hike, its yield stands at just over 3%. This fat yield is a result of Maxim's generous  of 60% as management returns all of its free cash flow back to shareholders.Maxim's free cash flow generation in the recently concluded fiscal year was $932 million, excluding a one-time payment of $178 million to the IRS. The company paid out dividends worth $438 million, while $408 million was spent on share repurchases. So Maxim used 47% of its free cash flow for paying dividends, which is a much more conservative figure.In all, the increase in the company's free cash flow has been the key to the consistent growth in its payout. Maxim needs to increase its free cash flow if it wants to extend its eight-year history of raising the payout, and that can be achieved by boosting the bottom line. The good part: Wall Street expects Maxim's earnings to grow in the mid-teens over the next five years. But it won't be surprising if it exceeds that expectation thanks to fast-growing end markets.The automotive market is one of Maxim's biggest catalysts. The chipmaker currently gets 22% of its total revenue from this segment, though it looks all set to make a bigger contribution because Maxim has struck deals with most of the major tech companies that are looking to enable connected cars.Its clients  and Qualcomm, two chipmakers that have established a solid base in connected and self-driving cars. NVIDIA, for instance, is bolstering its self-driving platform with the help of Maxim's high-speed integrated circuits. Given that NVIDIA has a huge ecosystem of more than 200 partners developing self-driving cars using its platform, Maxim could win big with this partnership.However, Maxim's automotive business is a lot more diversified. The company says that 28 automotive OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) have decided to use its designs, and there are more than 70 cars being manufactured using its chips. As more connected cars hit the road in the future (and there are going to be a lot of them), Maxim's automotive revenue will keep getting better.Both Skyworks and Maxim Integrated are focusing on new technology trends such as the Internet of Things, connected cars, and 5G wireless technology. All these markets are still in their early phases of growth, and both companies have done well to cut their teeth in these areas. As such, both chipmakers look well-placed to boost their earnings going forward, which will give them room to improve free cash flow and increase the dividend payout.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(NASDAQ: MXIM) , however, is one of the few companies in this sector that bucks the trend handsomely.The company makes analog circuits used in consumer devices, data centers, and industrial applications, among others. Though it's not in a very fashionable business, Maxim's products play a critical role in powering electrical devices by enabling data transfer between different sensors. But what's really fashionable about Maxim is its solid dividend yield of over 3%, which easily puts the sector's average to shame and gives income-oriented investors a great option to tap into emerging tech trends.Image Source: Getty Images.Maxim has been paying a dividend for 15 years and recently raised the quarterly payout by 10% to $0.46 per share. As it turns out, the company has consistently increased its dividend every year since 2010, and it looks well placed to keep up the trend in the future thanks to a manageable  of about 60%.This might seem on the high side considering that a semiconductor titan such as Intel pays out closer to 40% of its earnings in the form of a dividend. But investors shouldn't miss the fact that Maxim is focused on returning all of its free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.The company generated $932 million in free cash flow last fiscal year (excluding a one-time payment of $178 million to the IRS), $438 million of which was returned to investors through dividends. By comparison, it bought back $408 million of shares. So 47% of Maxim's free cash flow is going out in the form of a dividend -- a more manageable figure. More importantly, the company has consistently grown its free cash flow over the past five years.Data by Recall that the dip you see in 2018 above is due to that one-time IRS payment. Maxim's ability to sustain its dividend depends on its ability to increase free cash flow, and that, in turn, depends on its earnings power.The good part: Maxim is going after lucrative markets that helped it boost earnings per share (excluding special items) by 28% in fiscal 2018.I already mentioned that Maxim's chips are used in various verticals, but the company is looking to tap into areas that will allow it to outgrow the broader semiconductor market. Automotive is one such niche, where the chipmaker has struck  , including  , to sell its connectivity chips. What's more, Maxim is expanding its automotive alliance -- the company announced a partnership last month to develop in-car infotainment systems with  , which has been making impressive progress in connected and self-driving cars.German auto giant  , for instance, has decided to use Qualcomm's Snapdragon 820 chipset to power its infotainment systems. Automotive software specialist  has also decided to rely on Qualcomm hardware for powering infotainment systems and cockpit controllers.Maxim can get access to these Qualcomm partners, as some of its chips now support the Snapdragon 820 automotive platform. More specifically, Maxim's power management and USB charging solutions, as well as other connectivity solutions, are now optimized to work with Qualcomm's automotive chips.The company is now in a stronger position to take advantage of the in-vehicle market, which is expected to double in size over the next five years. The automotive business already makes up 22% of Maxim's total revenue.But this doesn't mean the company is ignoring other opportunities. Allied Market Research estimates that sales of wearable fitness devices will grow at almost 20% annually for the next six years. To attack this space, Maxim has also launched a couple platforms that will help device makers accelerate their time to market.Such moves are probably the reason Maxim's top-line growth is starting to pick up the pace. The company expects a 10% year-over-year jump in the revenue this quarter, up from the 5% growth it clocked last quarter.Maxim's move to diversify its customer base and venture into fast-growing markets should improve its earnings power going forward. Not surprisingly, consensus estimates suggest that its earnings could grow at almost 14% per year for the next five years. Combine that with its budding track record as a dividend payer, and Maxim makes for an interesting prospect to both income and growth investors.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Maxim Integrated Products wasn't one of them!

However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is also a tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks.

(Symbol: MXIM) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $60.50, changing hands for $60.83/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 16 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $50.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $73.00.

The segment's revenues increased from the prior-year quarter, driven primarily by factory automation products, content growth in medical and broad market initiatives.Consumer end market, Maxim's second-largest segment, also generated 31% of the revenues, up year over year. The increase was due to an above average flagship smartphone shipments and growth in broad-based consumer business.The Communications and Data Center end market accounted for 19% of the revenues, flat from the year-ago quarter. The robust growth of 100G optical products was offset by broad-based softness in communications infrastructure.The Automotive end market generated 20% of revenues.

One way to invest in the connected car boom is through  (NASDAQ: MXIM) , an\u00a0analog integrated circuit vendor.The chipmaker has displayed remarkable growth in its automotive business over the years as the semiconductor content in vehicles has increased. In fact, the automotive sector has been the key to its financial resurgence over the past year, setting the stage for stronger long-term growth as the connected car market gains momentum.Image Source: Getty Images.Maxim divides its revenue into five segments. Just four years ago, automotive was one of its smallest end markets, supplying just\u00a08% of the top line. But now, it accounts for 21% of total revenue, becoming its third-largest source of revenue after its industrial and consumer businesses. What's more, automotive is Maxim's fastest-growing business, and its increasing clout has been important in boosting the company's top line in the past year.\n  \nData source: Maxim Integrated annual filings.Maxim expects its automotive business to grow in the low teens\u00a0in the long run. The automotive sector accounted for an estimated $131 million of Maxim's revenue last quarter\u00a0(21% of the total revenue), so it now has an annual run rate of over $520 million. Assuming that this business clocks an annual growth rate of even 10% over the next five years -- conservative by Maxim's standards -- it could generate annual revenue of almost $840 million for the company.This means that Maxim's automotive revenue could increase as much as 60% in the next five years. More important, the chipmaker has the tools to achieve such solid automotive growth thanks to an impressive clientele list that includes self-driving car pioneer  (NASDAQ: NVDA) .Maxim claims to have scored\u00a0design wins at 28 automotive original equipment manufacturers around the globe, and they are producing more than 70 different car models using its chips. And some of its customers haven't yet released their models featuring Maxim's designs.But the biggest boost for Maxim could come from NVIDIA, which recently decided to use the former's high-speed integrated circuits  in self-driving cars. NVIDIA plans to use Maxim's expertise to power its DRIVE Pegasus and Xavier platforms, which can help self-driving cars attain  . Maxim claims that its integrated circuits are tailor-made for this application.More important, the partnership gives Maxim access to NVIDIA's ecosystem of 225\u00a0partners that are developing autonomous car solutions based on the latter's hardware and software platforms. And NVIDIA has kept boosting its automotive presence by striking deals with big players such as Uber to supply autonomous car systems.Uber expects to deploy 24,000 self-driving SUVs in the next three years, and it is highly likely that NVIDIA will power the autonomous systems in these vehicles based on  . So, Maxim is getting access to an automotive gold mine with NVIDIA's help.Another catalyst that should give Maxim's automotive business a long-term boost is the electric vehicle (EV) market. The chipmaker estimates that EV-related sales constitute\u00a0just 10% of its total automotive revenue at present, but they are on track to gain impressive momentum thanks to the growing demand for battery management systems (BMS).The BMS is the brain of the battery pack that powers EVs. It manages a bunch of functions including charging and discharging, and gives the battery pack a longer life by keeping it within its safe operating zone. Not surprisingly, the BMS market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of almost 21% over the next five years as EV sales increase, hitting\u00a0$7.25 billion in value by 2022.So, there's a lot to like about the way Maxim's automotive business is shaping up, but it is the company's valuation and its dividend that should seal the deal for potential investors.Maxim Integrated has been a fairly expensive stock over the years. It carries a trailing price-to-earnings\u00a0(P/E) ratio of 43, which is in line\u00a0with rival  . However, the stock is currently expensive as compared to the semiconductor industry's average ratio of 35. But Maxim trades\u00a0at a cheap 19 times forward earnings, which clearly points toward bottom-line growth.This year, for instance, Maxim's earnings are expected to increase 25%. And it is expected\u00a0to clock a solid 15% annual growth rate over the next five years. Finally, Maxim has a handsome dividend yield\u00a0of 2.90%, and it looks set to become a solid dividend play over the years, thanks to management's decision to return all\u00a0of its free cash flow to investors.The company recently raised its quarterly dividend by 17% as its free cash flow has jumped\u00a027% during the trailing 12 months to $849 million. By comparison, the company has paid\u00a0out $389 million in dividends over the past year, which means that it has so far paid almost 46% of its free cash to investors in the form of dividends.So, the consistent increase in Maxim's earnings should boost its free-cash-flow profile going forward, which should lead to a higher dividend payout.Maxim Integrated's automotive segment has a lot going for it. The company estimates that the semiconductor content in each car will double\u00a0to $200 in the next five years as the adoption of advanced driver assistance systems and infotainment systems increases in connected cars and self-driving vehicles.Maxim is on track to ride this opportunity thanks to a terrific client base. And it will pay investors handsomely with a solid dividend yield at the same time, which makes it a good investment considering the valuation.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(Symbol: MXIM) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $59.47, changing hands for $61.00/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 17 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $46.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $73.00.

(Symbol: MXIM) saw new options begin trading this week, for the April 20th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MXIM options chain for the new April 20th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $60.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.90. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $60.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $58.10 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MXIM, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $61.27/share today.Because the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 61%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of MXIM stock at the current price level of $61.27/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $65.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 7.80% if the stock gets called away at the April 20th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MXIM shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MXIM's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $65.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $65.00 strike represents an approximate 6% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

(Symbol: MXIM) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.68), with the stock changing hands as low as $55.21 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the iShares Russell 3000 ETF (  ) back on 5/31/2000 - you would have paid $78.27 per share. Fast forward to 5/31/2012 and each share was worth $77.79 on that date, a loss of $0.48 or 0.6% decrease over twelve years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $10.77 per share in dividends over the same period, increasing your return to 13.15%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.0%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (Symbol: MXIM) is a member of the Russell 3000, giving it special status as one of the largest 3000 companies on the U.S. stock markets.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., looking at the history chart for MXIM below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.    According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, MXIM makes up 4.27% of the First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (Symbol: FTXL) which is trading lower by about 3.6% on the day Thursday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ooking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at  , one standout is the First Trust NASDAQ-100-Technology Sector Index Fund (Symbol: QTEC) where we have detected an approximate $159.1 million dollar inflow -- that's a 6.3% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 31,100,002 to 33,050,002). Among the largest underlying components of QTEC, in trading today Workday Inc (Symbol: WDAY) is off about 0.1%, Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (Symbol: MXIM) is up about 1.3%, and Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (Symbol: SWKS) is up by about 0.2%.  The chart below shows the one year price performance of QTEC, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, QTEC's low point in its 52 week range is $58.67 per share, with $83.4224 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $82.07. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" month has gone by since the last earnings report for  . (MXIM). Shares have added about 12.5% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is MXIM due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Maxim reported second-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings of 65 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Also, earnings increased 9% sequentially and 42% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues of $623 million increased 8.2% sequentially and 13% year over year. The increase was driven by major strength in the automotive and industrial end markets.The top line was within the company's guidance range of $600-$640 million and came in above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $620 million.The revenue mix in terms of major markets is discussed below.The Industrial end market remained the largest revenue contributor, accounting for approximately 29%. The segment's revenues increased year over year, driven primarily by factory automation products.Consumer, Maxim's second-largest segment, also generated 26% of the revenues, declining year over year. The decrease was due to weak demand for smart phones, partially offset by growth in broad-based consumer business in wearables, tablets, peripherals, and gaming products.The Communications and Data Center end market accounted for 20% of the revenues, flat from the year-ago quarter. The robust growth of 100G optical products and 12-volt server power used in high-speed data center applications was offset by broad-based softness in communications infrastructure.The Automotive end market generated 21% of revenues. The segment's revenues grew in the double digits year over year. The increase was driven by growth in infotainment content. Power management products for infotainment applications helped in strengthening customer relationships in automotive and earning new design wins.The Computing business contributed the remaining 4%.Non-GAAP gross margin was 67.6%, up 70 basis points (bps) sequentially and 350 bps year over year. The increase was due to higher revenues, a favorable mix and strong operational execution.Non-GAAP operating expenses of $201.2 million increased 10.4% year over year. The increase was due to an extra week included in the quarter. As a percentage of sales, research and development expenses decreased, while selling, general and administrative expenses increased.Operating margin was 35.3%, up 430 bps year over year. The improvement was driven by revenue growth and manufacturing transformation.During the reported quarter, cash flow from operations was $229.9 million compared with $220 million in the earlier quarter.

Earnings per share are expected in the range of 66-72 cents on an adjusted basis.For the upcoming fiscal third quarter, the company expects the automotive market to grow well above the seasonal, driven by continued growth in battery management system business. The industrial market will be up sequentially and from the year-ago quarter, driven by strength from factory automation content. Also, the Communications and Data Center market is likely to be up in the upcoming quarter. However, Consumer revenues are expected to increase in the March quarter, driven by above average peak shipments for smart phones.Maxim's automotive business has been growing lately. The company has invested heavily in vehicle-safety technology that could prove to be foundational for a driverless car future. During the fiscal second quarter, the company entered into a partnership with NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) to support the latter's DRIVE Pegasus as well as DRIVE Xavier for Level 4 driving platforms.Maxim remains financially strong with convincing margin expansion opportunities through its cost-saving initiatives and R&D focus on high-return investments.The company is expanding its manufacturing footprint to enhance flexibility and profitability, while lowering capital expenditure. Management also plans to optimize product lines and organization for better returns on R&D investments. These efforts are likely to enable Maxim in improving future utilization rates, reducing costs and improving gross-margin performance.Maxim is shifting to advanced node process technology development through a recent collaboration with its foundry partners. Products launched under this initiative should expand margins.Analysts were quiet during the last month as none of them issued any earnings estimate revisions. | At this time, MXIM has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is doing a bit better on the momentum front with an A.

These analog circuits transfer information in electrical devices that need to connect with other devices. This makes them ideal for deployment in automotive applications where several sensors need to communicate with one another.Not surprisingly, Maxim's automotive business has shown steady growth over the past few years, thanks to the increasing semiconductor content in cars. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the automotive business supplied 20% of the chipmaker's total revenue. By comparison, Maxim's automotive revenue was just 7% of the overall business back in the same quarter of 2014.And Maxim's automotive business isn't done growing yet. The company recently struck a partnership with driverless car pioneer  (NASDAQ: NVDA) , which could catapult its automotive presence to another level.Image Source: Getty Images.According to NVIDIA, Maxim's platform gives it what it needs to power its scalable self-driving system. According to Gary Hicok, senior vice president of hardware development at NVIDIA, \"The NVIDIA DRIVE AI platform, which is scalable from Super Level 2 to the fully autonomous capabilities of Level 5, requires high-bandwidth camera data transmission and aggregation.\"So NVIDIA has decided to go with Maxim to support high levels of automation in driverless cars. Maxim will be supplying its Gigabit Multimedia Serial Link (GMSL) serializer and deserializers to NVIDIA's DRIVE Pegasus and Xavier platforms -- which are capable of delivering  in self-driving cars.This GMSL integrated circuit provides secure, high-bandwidth connectivity in automotive applications such as infotainment systems and advanced driver assistance systems. Maxim claims that GMSL is ideal for powering autonomous cars, because the technology can address low-power requirements of cameras mounted on vehicles, as well as tackle the varying bandwidth of the sensor data flowing through the system.This isn't the first time NVIDIA and Maxim are collaborating in the automotive space. The two chipmakers partnered three years ago when NVIDIA chose Maxim to enable analog connectivity for its DRIVE CX and DRIVE PX platforms.NVIDIA was getting started in the automotive space back then, generating just $70 million in revenue from this segment. Since then, NVIDIA's automotive revenue has more than doubled thanks to a growing list of partners either using or testing its self-driving platforms, pushing Maxim's automotive revenue higher in the process.However, this latest partnership could be more fruitful for Maxim as NVIDIA claims that it is now working with more than 225 partners in the automotive space. More importantly, the graphics specialist recently  that could improve its standing in this industry.Uber, for instance, will use NVIDIA's technology to enable autonomy in its fleet of self-driving cars. It recently announced that it will be deploying 24,000  self-driving SUVs between 2019 and 2021, and it is highly likely that NVIDIA will work with Uber to help these cars drive on their own.Uber's share of the ride-sharing space in the U.S. is estimated at 77%, and it has a presence across 83 countries. This could result in stronger sales of Maxim's analog circuits as Uber launches more self-driving cars based on NVIDIA's technology.Additionally, NVIDIA is also working with  and  on autonomous driving and artificial-intelligence-enabled features. These two automakers are at the top in global car sales, which means that they can help NVIDIA sell its self-driving platform in huge numbers.This is great news for Maxim as it looks all set to ride NVIDIA's coattails toward automotive riches. But investors will need to be patient as driverless cars will not boom overnight. A new report from  estimates that autonomous car sales will hit 51,000 units annually in 2021, but rise remarkably to 33 million a year in 2040.With driverless cars becoming big in the long run, Maxim is a good way to buy in and is paying investors to wait with a dividend that yields about 2.5% at the current stock price. The stock trades at a forward  of 20.9, which is lower than the industry average of 26, giving investors another reason to take a hard look at this stock.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The industry serves as a driver, enabler and indicator of technological progress.According to the  dated Jan 19, technology is one of the six sectors predicted to report double-digit earnings growth this quarter. Per the report, total earnings for the tech sector are projected to be up 14.3% on 8.7% higher revenues.We note that the technology sector has been a robust performer over the past year. The sector has been benefiting from the increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.We believe the aforementioned emerging trends have provided some much-needed opportunity to semiconductor companies to counter the loss of business due to the declining PC market which still consumes bulk of chips. Notably, according to the latest report of World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS), semiconductor revenues climbed 20.6% year over year to $408.7 billion in 2017.It is believed that the semiconductor industry will continue to witness growth this year as well, although not as high as 2017, but still at a respectable rate. Per the WSTS report, semiconductor revenues are likely to touch $437.3 billion in 2018, representing growth of 7.7%.The industry is poised to benefit from the rising demand from the aforementioned new trends in technologies, deployment push of 5G-broadband technology across the globe and President Trump's pro-business policies, including tax cuts, deregulation and outlays on infrastructure.However, this does not ensure earnings beat for all companies in the space. It should be noted that a company's earnings outperformance is dependent on the overall business environment as well as management's ability to implement operating and strategic plans.In other words, a company may perform dismally despite a favorable business environment if it fails to capitalize on the opportunities due to lack of execution.Let's see what's in store for these semiconductor stocks, all of which are slated to release quarterly figures tomorrow.The world's largest semiconductor company  is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results.

You can see  . | Intel's earnings report will still serve as an important bellwether for the entire technology sector, but the stock has struggled to gain momentum as investors have become increasingly concerned with this chipmaker's competition. Of late, the company has been sensing the pressure from the likes of NVIDIA and Avanced Micro Devices. Nvidia's artificial intelligence processors are already at the forefront of the booming AI industry, while AMD has doubled down on its server chips. And both of these companies compete with Intel in the ever-important gaming segment.However, we anticipate the company's impressive growth at the data-center group segment to cushion its top- and bottom-line results. Increasing demand for data storage and high-performance networks has been propelling this segment's growth. As the number of smartphones and Internet-connected devices escalates, along with the rise of artificial intelligence and cloud computing, Intel's data-center business will expand.

Estimates, when compared with the year-ago quarter figures, indicate growth of 5.6% for revenues and 17.4% for earnings. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3. | The company's data-center segment is likely to continue its outperformance in the to-be-reported quarterly results, chiefly driven by the sound adoption of the latest technologies, including AI and HPC. Increasing usage of its smart-controller solutions on Intel's Parley platform is also anticipated to prove conducive to growth. Also, an improving economy and energy markets, continuing semi-cap strength, as well as demand for emerging industrial automation and motor control applications is likely to drive its Industrial market segment revenues. Nonetheless, pockets of weakness related to product transition at medical customers and push-out of some communications spending in China are likely to dent revenues.Another semiconductor company,  , is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company's revenues and earnings are pegged at $619.9 million and 64 cents, respectively, for the to-be-reported quarter.

(Symbol: MXIM) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $54.00, changing hands for $54.39/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 17 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $44.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $60.00. The standard deviation is $5.024.But the whole reason to look at the  MXIM price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with MXIM crossing above that average target price of $54.00/share, investors in MXIM have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $54.00 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Adobe Systems Inc.  , Intel Corporation  , Lam Research Corporation  , KLA-Tencor Corporation  and Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.  .The stock market's tech benchmark set a new record for all-time highs in a calendar year. While Apple helped the Nasdaq reach a record close, other Silicon Valley tech stocks continue to hover near the mark. The Cupertino-based iPhone maker reported blowout earnings results, while such an encouraging trend is noticeable for the entire tech sector.Some market pundits believe that tech stocks are riding the years-long economic expansion, while most of them attribute a part of this uptick to Trump administration's pro-business policies including tax cuts, deregulation and outlays on infrastructure.Needless to say, tech stocks are preferred by astute investors due to their proprietary technological expertise and heavy cash balances. These companies also relish high barriers to entry, which position them for faster growth in the market.Given such bullish trends, investing in some rock-solid Silicon Valley stocks for better gains seems judicious.The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite trumped all records on Nov 3. The index registered its 63rd record-closing high of this year that beat the previous record of 62 highs in a calendar year. The index has also outpaced the other major indices so far this year.While the Nasdaq has rallied almost 26% on a year-to-date basis, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones gained nearly 16% and 19%, respectively, over the same period. In fact, the tech-stacked indexes' year-to-date gains are the best since the dot-com boom of the late 1990s.Stellar quarterly results from tech-bigwig Apple helped the Nasdaq scale a record high. The iPhone maker gained 2.6% and flirted with a valuation at $900 billion. The world's most valuable company has soared 48.9% so far this year.Apple's fiscal fourth-quarter sales of $52 billion topped analysts' expectations. Almost half of the sales came from iPhone. Chief Executive Tim Cook declared that iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus sales were the best ever in the company's history. Its service units that comprise iTunes, Apple Music, Apple Pay and Apple Care, to name a few, also raked in record-high revenues.Profits also rose to $10.71 billion, while the executives showed more optimism over the current quarter. They raised the fiscal first-quarter sales guidance from $84 billion to $87 billion. This has ward off fears related to the company's flagship iPhone X production, priced at $1000. This is, incidentally, the most exorbitant iPhone model in the company's history (read more:  ).Apple isn't the only Silicon Valley tech stock moving north this season. Better-than-expected quarterly results from other tech giants like Alphabet (Google) and Microsoft also helped drive the Nasdaq to a record high.Alphabet's third-quarter earnings of $9.57 increased 91% sequentially and 32% year over year. Net revenues of $22.27 billion increased 6.5% sequentially and 21.9% year over year.

To top it, Netflix, Cisco Systems, eBay and NVIDIA continue to hover near record highs as the tech sector displays strength in the third-quarter earnings season.Total earnings for the tech companies' third-quarter earnings so far are up 22.4% from the same period last year on 9.3% higher revenues, with 81.8% beating EPS estimates and 86.4% surpassing revenue estimates (read more:  ).Hopes of pro-business legislation promised by Trump have, mostly, supported the gains among both the manufacturers of the internal technologies - the semiconductor makers and the software industry.As per Statista, corporate taxation rate in the United States is among the worlds' highest. This explains why most of the tech majors stash cash overseas. The proposed tax plan will lower taxes from 35% to 20%. As a result, tech companies' after-tax earnings will improve and will lead to repatriation of trillions of dollars held abroad by such companies. Tech companies can use this extra cash for R&D and M&As.Tech players including Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon have billions of dollars in cash reserves parked abroad. In fact, a  showed that combined overseas cash reserves for such companies exceeded the Japanese government's overall tax revenues in fiscal 2016.Investors, thus, should double down on the hottest Silicon Valley tech stocks after they cross one record after another on earnings strength, primarily, backed by favorable government policy.

(Symbol: MXIM) saw new options begin trading this week, for the March 16th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MXIM options chain for the new March 16th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $55.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.15. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $55.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $53.85 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MXIM, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $57.38/share today.Because the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 72%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of MXIM stock at the current price level of $57.38/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $60.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 6.13% if the stock gets called away at the March 16th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MXIM shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MXIM's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $60.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 5% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

Chip makers started popping up at the southern end of San Francisco Bay as early as the 1950s. A big draw back then as now: Stanford University and its bevy of researchers and research facilities. Today, seven of the biggest publicly traded semiconductor companies still call Silicon Valley home, with headquarters in such tech-friendly California cities as Santa Clara and San Jose.Despite the steady decline in computer sales in recent years -- semiconductors are the brains inside PCs -- all seven of these chip stocks have performed well during the current long-running bull market. In fact, six of the seven have handily outpaced the 348% total return (including dividends) of Standard & Poor's 500-stock index since March 9, 2009. The seventh isn't far behind.But some Silicon Valley chip stocks have performed significantly better than others over the past eight-and-a-half years. Four of the seven have even beaten the remarkable 530% total return of the Nasdaq-100 Index, which is made up of the largest non-financial stocks listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market by market capitalization. Check out Silicon Valley's best semiconductor stocks of the bull market.Ticker symbol: Share price: $39.67Bull market return: 317%Dividend yield: 2.8%Headquarters: Santa Clara, Calif.Intel is the old-timer of Silicon Valley. The company was founded in 1968 and held its initial public offering in 1971. But Intel's longevity is a big reason  . Through the end of 2016, the stock has generated a staggering $259 billion in lifetime wealth for its shareholders,  , a finance professor at Arizona State University. Returns have been leaner during the current bull market as declining demand for PCs has hurt demand for Intel's semiconductors. That has forced Intel, the world's largest maker of the central processing units that serve as a PC's brain, to find new ways to generate revenue growth. The expansion of cloud-based services has been a boon, thanks to its dominance of the market for server chips. Analysts at Credit Suisse think Intel is well-positioned for the long term because of its scale and investments in research and development.Ticker symbol: Share price: $72.81Bull market return: 421%Dividend yield: 1.9%Headquarters: San Jose, Calif.Founded in 1984, Xilinx is another longtime denizen of Silicon Valley in the chip business that hasn't pulled its weight through the current bull market. Shares trail the Nasdaq-100 Index by 109 percentage points even after accounting for dividends. A change in the landscape promises better times ahead for the maker of programmable chip technology. Although Xilinx faces tough competition from Intel, investors are excited about the payoff from selling chips to Amazon.com's (  ) thriving cloud-computing business, Amazon Web Services.

Among other areas of operation, the company, founded in 1983, supplies chips to smartphone giants Apple and Samsung. That leaves it exposed to risk if either of those partners were to have a change of plans. But Stifel analysts say the company's ongoing diversification efforts give it multiple opportunities for growth without becoming too dependent on a single customer. So while it's hard to imagine consumers abandoning their iPhone and Galaxy smartphones in droves, Maxim should be safe if they do since it depends on neither Apple nor Samsung for more than 10% of its overall business.Ticker symbol: Share price: $53.94Bull market return: 654%Dividend yield: 0.7%Headquarters: Santa Clara, Calif.Wall Street is increasingly bullish on Applied Materials. Of the 14 analysts covering the stock tracked by Zacks, 10 call it a \"Strong Buy,\" two have it a \"Buy,\" and two have it \"Hold.\" There are no \"Sell\" ratings. It's easy to see where the optimism comes from. Applied Materials' core business of semiconductor equipment and services benefits from today's trends. The rise of artificial intelligence, cloud computing, the Internet of Things, mobile devices and Big Data are driving increased demand for chips. As a supplier to the companies that make the chips powering all these technologies, Applied Materials finds itself in an enviable position. The company also supplies products for making displays for TVs, tablets, computers and smartphones. And don't be fooled into thinking of Applied Materials as a relative newcomer to Silicon Valley. It was founded in Mountain View, Calif., in 1967 - a year before Intel.Ticker symbol: Share price: $189.90Bull market return: 938%Dividend yield: 1.0%Headquarters: Fremont, Calif.Shares of Lam Research have seen some ups and down along the way, but the bottom line is that this supplier of equipment to chip makers delivered outsized total stock returns since the bull market began. Analysts at Zacks Equity Research note that the company continued its impressive earnings momentum with another better-than-expected profit beat in its most recent quarter. Furthermore, analysts are raising their profit estimates. Of the 13 analysts covering the stock polled by Zacks, 9 have Lam at \"Strong Buy,\" two call it a \"Buy\" and two rate it at \"Hold.\" Lam got its start in Santa Clara in 1980, making it one of the early players in the lucrative Silicon Valley semiconductor industry.Ticker symbol: Share price: $105.30Bull market return: 970%Dividend yield: 2.3%Headquarters: Milpitas, Calif.The KLA-Tencor we know today came into being in 1997 from the merger of KLA Instruments and Tencor Instruments. But its experience in the semiconductor industry stretches back to the 1970s, when its predecessor companies got their respective starts. Experience has paid off. KLA-Tencor shares have delivered impressive price appreciation over the last eight-plus years of the bull market, but what really sets this Silicon Valley stock apart is an unusually generous dividend. The technology sector as a whole pays an average dividend of just 1.4%, according to Dividend.com. Suppliers of equipment to the semiconductor industry, which is what KLA-Tencor does, are even more stingy. The company's competition coughs up an average dividend yield of less than 1%. In August, KLA-Tencor hiked its quarterly dividend to 59 cents a share from 54 cents, a 9.3% increase.Ticker symbol: Share price: $194.59Bull market return: 2,426%Dividend yield: 0.3%Headquarters: Santa Clara, Calif.Much like the Backstreet Boys and NSYNC, Nvidia was a unique product of the 1990s. Founded in 1993 and public since 1999, the company blossomed as computers and gaming consoles became more popular and more complex. In its early days Nvidia was primarily known in the gaming community for making high-end video graphics cards. It turns out that graphical processing units (GPUs) have a wide range of applications in today's data-rich world. From the automotive industry to mining for Bitcoins, Nvidia has customers across the business and consumer landscapes. The next big area of growth is expected to be artificial intelligence, which industry observers call the \"killer app\" for its chips. Analysts expect the company's sales to increase 30% this year, according to Thomson Reuters, while earnings per share should gain 40%. Bull market or not, it's reasonable to question whether shares in Nvidia can keep up such a torrid pace. After all, they've returned well over 2,000% in the past eight and a half years. But for now, at least, Nvidia is holding up its end of the bargain thanks to the impressive top- and bottom-line growth.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Oct 19.

In intraday trading Friday, Nvidia stock reached 195, its second record high in as many days.The total addressable market for data-center processors could be $21 billion to $35 billion over the next five years, Gill said.\"While we expect gaming to continue to grow robustly, we believe our data center estimates of $1.7 billion in fiscal 2018, $2.1 billion in fiscal 2019 and $2.8 billion (in fiscal 2020) could prove conservative addressing (a) $30 billion total addressable market,\" Gill said.Gill said he is mindful that much of the data center opportunity is priced into Nvidia's stock today, but thinks investors are underestimating the potential earnings power from that segment.Gaming currently represents 57% of Nvidia's sales, while data center is 19%, he said.He's seen evidence of pervasive adoption of graphics processing units by cloud computing services and major enterprise software firms like  (  ) and  (  ).Gill also likes Nvidia's prospects in autonomous vehicles and artificial intelligence applications, which need high-performance processors.Elsewhere in the chip sector, RBC Capital Markets raised its price target on  (  ) to 50 from 47, but kept its sector perform rating.Maxim climbed 0.4% to 49.35 on Friday.Maxim is scheduled to report its fiscal first-quarter results after the market close on Thursday.RBC analyst Amit Daryanani said he expects Maxim to report modest upside vs. Wall Street's expectations for the September quarter.\"While uncertainties remain in consumer (especially smartphone) and communication infrastructure, we think underlying trends remain favorable across key growth vectors,\" Daryanani said in a report. \"Revenue growth and demand sustainability in auto and industrial will be the key focuses on the .\"The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" 's (NASDAQOTH: NTDOY)  reportedly outsold  's PS4 in the U.S. and Japan over the last few months, and that trend could continue through the holiday season. The company sold nearly 2 million Switch units during its first full quarter on the market (which ended in June) and sees shipments hitting 10 million total by next March.That would be significantly lower than the 62 million PS4s on the market today, but it would mark a huge improvement over Nintendo's Wii U, which only reached 14 million shipments during its five years on the market.The Switch's impressive debut has helped lift Nintendo's stock price by over 70% this year, but investors should also pay attention to five of its biggest suppliers --  (NASDAQ: NVDA) ,  (NASDAQ: CY) ,  (NASDAQ: MXIM) ,  (NASDAQOTH: TOSBF) , and  (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) and how Switch sales can affect them.Image source: Nintendo.A custom version of NVIDIA's Tegra X1 SoC (system on chip) powers the Switch. This represents a big win for NVIDIA, since the PS4 and Xbox One are both powered by  's SoCs.NVIDIA previously showcased its Tegra SoC, which combines a CPU and GPU in a single package, in its various Shield devices. The Shield K1 gaming tablet resembles the Switch with its ability to connect to TVs, and is frequently cited as a  Nintendo chose NVIDIA's mobile-based SoCs over AMD's beefier chipsets.NVIDIA's Shield K1 gaming tablet. Image source: NVIDIA.For NVIDIA, securing the Switch was a big win for its Tegra business, which accounted for 15% of its top line last quarter. During that quarter, Tegra sales surged 101% annually, fueled by an 800% jump in revenue from gaming platforms and services (like the Switch) and a 19% jump in automotive revenues. RBC Capital Markets analyst Mitch Steves expects sales of Switch SoCs to boost NVIDIA's fiscal 2018 revenues by up to $400 million, which would equal 4% of its projected revenues.Cypress' CY4356EC wireless chipset provides the Switch with its Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity. These connections get the console online and sync the device with its Joy-Con controllers. Cypress inherited this chipset from  last year  its Internet of Things (IoT) business.Cypress integrated that business into its MCD (Microcontroller and Connectivity Division), which also includes programmable chips, data connectivity products, the foundry business for its emerging tech division, and the patents for its memory products. Revenue at that business rose 13% sequentially last quarter (annual comparisons are unavailable due to a restructuring of the units) and accounted for 61% of its top line.Craig-Hallum analyst Anthony Soss estimates that the Switch contributed about $20 million in incremental revenues to Cypress' top line during the second quarter, which would equal roughly 3% of its total revenue.Maxim supplies three components for the Switch: two three-phase buck regulators for regulating voltages, and a single power management IC. The impact of the Switch on Maxim's revenue growth is hard to quantify since the chipmaker doesn't break down its product sales by category and analysts haven't made estimates.However, Maxim's power management solutions are used across many other industries, including industrial machinery, audio hardware, and newer cars with driver assistance features. Rising demand for those solutions enabled Maxim to post three straight quarters of positive annual revenue growth, which ended nine straight quarters of declines.Toshiba and Samsung both supply the flash memory chips for the Switch, while Samsung supplies the device's 4GB of DRAM. Toshiba's involvement is noteworthy but not financially relevant, since it's currently  to offset losses at its U.S. nuclear business.Samsung's involvement matters more, since the South Korean tech giant is currently expanding its semiconductor unit, which is the world's leading manufacturer of NAND and DRAM chips. Revenue from that business, fueled by  worldwide, rose 65% annually last quarter and accounted for 23% of Samsung's top line.Rising sales of the Switch should help all these companies, but the impact on NVIDIA's and Cypress' growth should be easier to spot. However, Switch component sales won't offset the importance of NVIDIA's core  or Cypress' sales of programmable chips, so investors shouldn't consider the Switch to be a primary reason for buying these stocks. If you believe that the Switch has a bright future, the best play is to simply buy shares of Nintendo.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(Symbol: MXIM) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $48.38, changing hands for $48.42/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 13 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $40.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $54.00. The standard deviation is $3.905.But the whole reason to look at the  MXIM price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with MXIM crossing above that average target price of $48.38/share, investors in MXIM have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $48.38 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

The increase was driven by major strength in the automotive and industrial end markets.The top line was at the higher end of the company's guidance of $555-$595 million and came above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $575 million.The revenue mix in terms of major markets is discussed below.The Industrial, end market remained the largest revenue contributor, accounting for approximately 28% of revenues. The segment's revenues were up sequentially and year over year. The increase was driven primarily by factory automation products in the areas of interface and power management.Consumer, Maxim's second-largest segment, generated 26% of the revenues, down sequentially due to lower content in smartphones. Notably, the company's business at Samsung was below 10% of its third quarter revenue.The Communications and Data Center end market accounted for 21% of revenues, up sequentially but flat from the year-ago quarter. The sequential increase was driven by growth in data center with strong customer adoption of 100G optical products used in high-speed data center applications. The company also witnessed sequential growth in the communications infrastructure as well.The Automotive end market also generated 21% of revenues, up 13% sequentially and 26% from the year-ago quarter. The increase was driven by growth in infotainment content. The power management products for infotainment applications helped in strengthening customer relationships in automotive and earning new design wins for Serial Link USB and LED lighting products.The Computing business contributed the remaining 4%.The non-GAAP gross margin was 65.2%, up 113 basis points (bps) sequentially and 383 bps year over year. The increase was due to higher revenues and a favorable mix.Non-GAAP operating expenses of $187.2 million increased 0.8% sequentially but decreased 2% year over year.

The industrial market will be up sequentially, driven by strength from factory automation content. Also, the Communications and Data Center market is likely to be up in the upcoming quarter, driven by continued momentum expected in 100G optical products.

Neither position can be completely ruled out. But it may be worthwhile to drill down a little deeper to identify the names that still have upside potential.And what better way than to start with than the Zacks Industry Rank, which is based on the philosophy that about half of a stock's price movement can be attributed to the group (sub-industry) that it's in. In fact, Zacks studies have shown that the top 50% of Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.So today, we are going to take a closer look at the  , which is in the top 10% of Zacks-ranked industries.The group has slightly outperformed the S&P 500, having appreciated 5.5% compared to the 4.8% for the S&P 500.Sector revenues have grown in each of the last four years with the jump in 2016 being particularly high (up 31.4%). Gross profit (up 26.3% in 2016) and net income before non-recurring items (up 16.4%) show similar trends. However, the industry is investing heavily in R&D and SG&A (up 65.0% in 2016 although moving both ways in preceding years) and unlike in the past, it's tapping into the debt market to do it (interest expenses are up 134.5% in 2016 and up double digits in each of the three preceding years.A quarterly cross section shows revenues rising steadily from the Sep 2015 quarter. Gross profit dipped in the Mar 2016 quarter but barring that one quarter shows a rising trend from Dec 2014. Net income before non-recurring items has risen since Mar 2016. As with the annual trend, the quarterly performance shows rising operating expenses and capex spend (using depreciation as a proxy), as well as rising interest rates.If you add the above data to secular growth drivers like machine learning, artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, IoT, industrial and medical technology, drones (the list is almost never-ending), it's clear that this is a growth segment.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NYSE:  ),  (NYSE:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Much has been said about semiconductor stocks lately, with some of the opinion that the secular growth drivers will continue to push them up and others taking the more cautious approach that such appreciation may be risky because they are already fully valued. Neither position can be completely ruled out. But it may be worthwhile to drill down a little deeper to identify the names that still have upside potential.And what better way than to start with than the Zacks Industry Rank, which is based on the philosophy that about half of a stock's price movement can be attributed to the group (sub-industry) that it's in. In fact, Zacks studies have shown that the top 50% of Zacks ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.So today, we are going to take a closer look at the  , which is in the top 10% of Zacks-ranked industries.The group has slightly outperformed the S&P 500, having appreciated 5.5% compared to the 4.8% for the S&P 500.Sector revenues have grown in each of the last four years with the jump in 2016 being particularly high (up 31.4%). Gross profit (up 26.3% in 2016) and net income before non-recurring items (up 16.4%) show similar trends. However, the industry is investing heavily in R&D and SG&A (up 65.0% in 2016 although moving both ways in preceding years) and unlike in the past, it's tapping into the debt market to do it (interest expenses are up 134.5% in 2016 and up double digits in each of the three preceding years.A quarterly cross section shows revenues rising steadily from the Sep 2015 quarter. Gross profit dipped in the Mar 2016 quarter but barring that one quarter shows a rising trend from Dec 2014. Net income before non-recurring items has risen since Mar 2016. As with the annual trend, the quarterly performance shows rising operating expenses and capex spend (using depreciation as a proxy), as well as rising interest rates.If you add the above data to secular growth drivers like machine learning, artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, IoT, industrial and medical technology, drones (the list is almost never-ending), it's clear that this is a growth segment. So while momentum trading opportunities may be there in some cases, they may not be what value buyers are looking for.So with that let's jump to the picks for today- (NASDAQ:  )Analog Devices, Inc. is one of the world leaders in the design, manufacture and marketing of high-performance analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits used in signal processing applications.

(Symbol: MXIM) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.32), with the stock changing hands as low as $43.99 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the iShares Russell 3000 ETF (  ) back on 5/31/2000 - you would have paid $78.27 per share. Fast forward to 5/31/2012 and each share was worth $77.79 on that date, a loss of $0.48 or 0.6% decrease over twelve years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $10.77 per share in dividends over the same period, increasing your return to 13.15%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.0%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (Symbol: MXIM) is a member of the Russell 3000, giving it special status as one of the largest 3000 companies on the U.S. stock markets.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., looking at the history chart for MXIM below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3% annual yield.    According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, MXIM makes up 3.72% of the First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (Symbol: FTXL) which is trading higher by about 1.1% on the day Monday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" month has gone by since the last earnings report for  . Shares have added about 7.4% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Maxim Integrated Products, Inc  reported second-quarter fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings of 46 cents per share, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. Also, earnings were up 29.9% from the year-ago quarter.Over the past one year, shares of Maxim underperformed the Zacks categorized Semi- Analog & Mixed industry. While the industry gained 41.55%, the stock returned only 33.46%.Revenues of $551.0 million were down 1.9% sequentially but up 7.9% year over year. The year-over-year increase was driven by strength in the majority of end markets.The top line matched the company's guidance of $520 million to $560 million and came above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $536.0 million.The revenue mix in terms of major markets is discussed below.The Consumer end market remained the largest revenue contributor, accounting for approximately 31% of revenues. This segment was down sequentially but up from the year-ago quarter. The increase was driven by diversification across a variety of tablets, wearables, peripherals, smartphones and gaming systems.Industrial, Maxim's second-largest segment, generated 25% of revenues, down sequentially but up from the year-ago quarter. The segment revenue was up year over year, driven primarily by factory automation products in the areas of interface, signal chain and power management.The Communications and Data Center end market accounted for 21% of revenues, down sequentially but up from the year-ago quarter. The increase was driven by growth in data center and cable businesses.The Automotive end market generated 19% of revenues, up sequentially as well as from the year-ago quarter. The increase was driven by content growth and continued strong adoption of new products.The Computing business contributed the remaining 4%.The non-GAAP gross margin was 64.1%, up 5 basis points (bps) sequentially and 361 bps year over year. The increase was due to higher revenues and a favorable mix.Non-GAAP operating expenses of $185.6 million increased 1.1% sequentially but decreased 0.6% year over year. The year-over-year decline resulted from overall cost control, including initial savings from the company's restructuring activities.Proforma operating margin was 30.4%, down 90 bps sequentially but up 648 bps year over year.GAAP net income was $130.5 million compared with $137.6 million in the last quarter and $67.5 million a year ago.Proforma net income was $132.5 million compared with $138.2 million last quarter and $93.0 million a year ago.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $569.9 million.Gross margin is expected within 61-63% on an adjusted basis (excluding special items).Earnings per share are expected within 49-55 cents on an adjusted basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 49 cents.Maxim delivered strong fiscal second-quarter 2017 results with both earnings and revenues exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate.For the upcoming third quarter, the company expects the automotive market to be up sequentially driven by continued growth in infotainment content and strong momentum in electric vehicle battery management. The industrial market will be up sequentially, driven by strength from factory automation content. Also, the Communications and Data Center market is likely to be up in the upcoming quarter. However, consumer revenue is expected to be down in the March quarter due to lower demand from Samsung and seasonality.Maxim remains financially strong with convincing margin expansion opportunities through its cost-saving initiatives and R&D focus on high-return investments.The company is expanding its manufacturing footprint to enhance flexibility and profitability, while lowering capital expenditure. Management also plans to optimize product lines and organization for better returns on R&D investments. These efforts will likely enable Maxim to improve future utilization rates, reduce costs and improve gross margin performance to the mid 60% range.Maxim is shifting to advanced node process technology development through a recent collaboration with its foundry partners. Products launched under this initiative should expand margins.Analysts were quiet during the last one month period as none of them issued any earnings estimate revisions. | At this time, Maxim Integrated's stock has a nice stock has a nice score of 'B' on both growth and momentum front.

The company has a wide range of products that makes it possible to serve a diverse clientele. Maxim's product lines are primarily sold in the consumer, computing, industrial, automotive and communications markets. Its products are also extensively applied in consumer goods like cordless phones, digital cameras and PDAs, data processing, industrial products, instrumentation products, medical instruments, and various communications gear and networking equipment.Also, Maxim reorganized its business structure to distribute R&D, and sales and marketing resources more efficiently between business units, speed up decision-making, improve interaction and collaboration between business units, and quickly process customer feedback for implementation.However, the concentration of its mobility revenues at Samsung is a big concern, which is likely to impact Maxim's net revenues.For the fiscal third quarter, Maxim expects revenues in the range of $555-$595 million based on a quarter-end backlog of $388 million. Gross margin is expected in the range of 61-63% (excluding special items). Earnings per share are expected within 49-55 cents on an adjusted basis.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Maxim will beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Maxim has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 52 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . Maxim's Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions. | Here are some companies, which you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Applied Materials, Inc.  , with an Earnings ESP of +1.32% and Zacks Rank #1.

(NXPI) grabbed a large piece of auto market share with its $11.8 billion acquisition of Freescale Semiconductor in 2015. Qualcomm piggybacked on the strategy, announcing in October that it would acquire NXP for $47 billion.Following the Freescale deal, NXP garners over 40% of revenue from sales to the automotive industry. Some 34% of revenue at ON Semiconductor comes from automotive, 25% at Microchip, 19% at Maxim Integrated and 15% at Texas Instruments, says a Citigroup report.The growth rates of those revenues are well above industry average in many cases. Nvidia's automotive revenue rose 52% in fiscal 2017, according to results reported after Thursday's close. Texas Instruments' auto sales jumped 23% to $4 billion in 2016. Maxim's automotive revenue will rise nearly 20% in fiscal 2017 to over $450 million, estimates RBC Capital.Citigroup has estimated that Nvidia's auto revenue will hit $1 billion in 2018, owing largely to a partnership with Germany's Audi.From its roots in producing chips for car infotainment systems, Nvidia expanded into ADAS safety technology. It's now pushing into more complex, self-driving cars.Nvidia's powerful processors are well-suited for the AI - artificial intelligence - software that enables ADAS systems.

That's because this basic measure of how much investors are spending for $1 worth of earnings speaks of undervaluation. The logic is simple - a stock's current market price does not justify its higher earnings and therefore leaves room for upside.But have you ever given it a thought that stocks with a rising P/E can also be worth buying. We'll tell you why.The concept is that as earnings rise, so should the price of the stock. As forecasts for expected earnings come in higher, strong demand for the stock should continue to push up its prices. After all, a stock's P/E gives an indication of how much investors are ready to shell out per dollar of earnings.Suppose an investor wants to buy a stock with a P/E ratio of 30, it means that he is willing to shell out $30 for only $1 worth of earnings. Now, if the P/E ratio becomes 35 within a short spell of time, it means that the person is ready to pay $35 for only $1 worth of earnings. It shows that the investor expects earnings of the company to rise at a faster pace in the future owing to strong fundamentals.So, if the P/E of a stock is rising steadily, it means that investors are assured of its inherent strength and expect some strong positives out of it. Also, studies have revealed that stocks have seen their P/E ratios jump over 100% from their breakout point in the cycle. So, if you can pick stocks early in their breakout cycle, you can end up seeing considerable gains.In order to shortlist stocks that are exhibiting an increasing P/E, we chose the following as our primary screening parameters.(These two criteria point to flat earnings or a growth trend over the years.)(These two criteria show that price of the stock is increasing consistently over the said timeframes.)(Here, the case for consistent price gains gets even stronger as it displays percentage price changes relative to the S&P 500.)(A 20% increase in the price of a stock from the breakout point gives cues of an impending uptrend. But a jump of over 100% indicates that there is limited scope for further upside and that the stock might be due for a reversal.)In addition, we place a few other criteria that lead us to some likely outperformers.

That's because this basic measure of how much investors are spending for $1 worth of earnings speaks of undervaluation. The logic is simple - a stock's current market price does not justify its higher earnings and therefore leaves room for upside.But have you ever given it a thought that stocks with a rising P/E can also be worth buying. We'll tell you why.The concept is that as earnings rise, so should the price of the stock. As forecasts for expected earnings come in higher, strong demand for the stock should continue to push up its prices. After all, astock's P/E gives an indication of how much investors are ready to shell out per dollar of earnings.Suppose an investor wants to buy a stock with a P/E ratio of 30, it means that he is willing to shell out $30 for only $1 worth of earnings. Now, if the P/E ratio becomes 35 within a short spell of time, it means that the person is ready to pay $35 for only $1 worth of earnings. It shows that the investor expects earnings of the company to rise at a faster pace in the future owing to strong fundamentals.So, if the P/E of a stock is rising steadily, it means that investors are assured of its inherent strength and expect some strong positives out of it.

However, positive earnings surprises are tracking low at this stage compared with the previous quarter.Overall fourth-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are anticipated to be up 4.8% from the year-ago quarter on revenues that are estimated to increase 3.7%. This would be better than the +3.8% growth in third-quarter earnings on +2.3% higher revenues driven by easier year-over-year comparisons for the Energy sector, continuing momentum at Finance and anticipated improvement in Technology results.Earnings for the Technology sector are anticipated to be up 3.6% on the back of 4.3% higher revenues. Although earnings growth is currently trailing behind last quarter's actual growth rate of 5.2%, revenues are up 4.3% against a reported decline of 0.6%.We note that only 10.1% of the total market capitalization in the technology sector has reported till now.

Moreover, stabilizing PC shipment trend as witnessed in the fourth-quarter 2016 is positive for the company.Although Intel's shares (up 24.8%) have underperformed the Zacks  industry (up 49.7%) in the last one year, we believe that strong earnings growth driven by these factors will help the stock rebound in 2017.

(Symbol: MXIM) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $40.62, changing hands for $40.65/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 17 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $22.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $48.00. The standard deviation is $5.851.But the whole reason to look at the  MXIM price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with MXIM crossing above that average target price of $40.62/share, investors in MXIM have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $40.62 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

The segment revenue was up year over year, driven primarily by factory automation products in the areas of interface, signal chain and power management.The Communications and Data Centerend market accounted for 21% of revenues, down sequentially. The decline was due to soft communications' infrastructure spending.The Automotive end market generated 18% of revenues, slight down sequentially but up from the year-ago quarter. The increase was driven by content growth and continued strong adoption of new products.The Computing business contributed the remaining 4%.The non-GAAP gross margin was 64.0%, down 7 basis points (bps) sequentially but up 242 bps year over year. The sequential decline was due to lower revenues.Non-GAAP operating expenses of $183.6 million decreased 0.7% sequentially and 5.1% year over year.

(Symbol: MXIM) saw new options become available today, for the January 2019 expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 823 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MXIM options chain for the new January 2019 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $33.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.00. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $33.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $29.00 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MXIM, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $38.47/share today.Because the $33.00 strike represents an approximate 14% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

If an investor was to purchase shares of MXIM stock at the current price level of $38.47/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $40.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 13.85% if the stock gets called away at the January 2019 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MXIM shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.

The stock was up as much as 10.6% earlier in the day, settling to an 8% gain by 3:30 p.m. EDT.Intersil's acquisition saga began last September, when U.S. company  (NASDAQ: MXIM) was rumored to be interested in acquiring it. Consolidation in the semiconductor industry has been rampant in recent years, and an acquisition would have continued that trend.Earlier this month, Japan's Renesas Electronics was reported to be in talks to acquire Intersil for as much as $3 billion, a fact that was later confirmed by Renesas itself. According to Reuters' sources, Intersil has now decided to accept the offer from Renesas, although it's still possible that Maxim could come in with a higher bid.Intersil manufactures products that have military applications, making the process of selling itself to a foreign company more complicated. According to the Reuters sources, a long review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States could slow down the acquisition process.Acquisition rumors last year, and confirmed reports of Renesas' talks earlier this month, have sent shares of Intersil soaring. Year to date, the stock is up about 55%. A deal at this point looks fairly likely, although there's always the chance that the talks fall through.

(Symbol: MXIM) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $38.98, changing hands for $39.25/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 16 different analyst targets contributing to that average for Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $22.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $44.00. The standard deviation is $5.116.But the whole reason to look at the  MXIM price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with MXIM crossing above that average target price of $38.98/share, investors in MXIM have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $38.98 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (Symbol: MXIM) presently has an excellent rank, in the top 25% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most \"interesting\" ideas that merit further research by investors.But making Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Monday, shares of MXIM entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $33.61 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., the RSI reading has hit 29.7 - by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by  currently has an average RSI of 42.0. A falling stock price - all else being equal - creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, MXIM's recent annualized dividend of 1.20/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 3.42% based upon the recent $35.10 share price. A bullish investor could look at MXIM's 29.7 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on MXIM is its dividend history.

(Symbol: MXIM) stock, but tentative about paying the going market price of $37.77/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2018 put at the $28 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.60. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 5.7% return against the $28 commitment, or a 3.6% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to MXIM's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $28 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. sees its shares fall 25.8% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $26.40 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.60 from $28), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.6% annualized rate of return.Worth considering, is that the annualized 3.6% figure actually exceeds the 3.2% annualized dividend paid by Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., based on the current share price of $37.77. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to fall 25.83% to reach the $28 strike price.Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., looking at the dividend history chart for MXIM below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3.2% annualized dividend yield.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $28 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2018 put at the $28 strike for the 3.6% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $37.77) to be 30%.

(Symbol: MXIM) stock, but tentative about paying the going market price of $34.18/share, might benefit from considering selling puts among the alternative strategies at their disposal. One interesting put contract in particular, is the January 2018 put at the $23 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $1.65. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 7.2% return against the $23 commitment, or a 3.8% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the  ).Selling a put does not give an investor access to MXIM's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. And the person on the other side of the contract would only benefit from exercising at the $23 strike if doing so produced a better outcome than selling at the going market price. (  ). So unless Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. sees its shares fall 32.5% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $21.35 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $1.65 from $23), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.8% annualized rate of return.Interestingly, that annualized 3.8% figure actually exceeds the 3.5% annualized dividend paid by Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., based on the current share price of $34.18. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to fall 32.47% to reach the $23 strike price.Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., looking at the dividend history chart for MXIM below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 3.5% annualized dividend yield.Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $23 strike is located relative to that history:The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the January 2018 put at the $23 strike for the 3.8% annualized rate of return represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $34.18) to be 31%.

The sequential decline was due to lower utilization rates.Non-GAAP operating expenses of $186.7 million were down 3.4% sequentially and 13.4% year over year.

Last quarter, the company posted a 2.44% positive earnings surprise.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Maxim delivered mixed fiscal first-quarter results with earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missing the same. Higher earnings were primarily attributable to a stronger automotive business, lower operating expenses and a slightly lower tax rate.We expect the strong demand trend in the automotive business to continue in the second quarter.Margins were up 75 basis points sequentially but remained flat year over year. The sequential increase was driven by lower manufacturing expenditure. Of late, the company has been developing technology based on advanced process nodes in collaboration with its foundry partners. Products developed under this initiative should expand margins.The company is also taking steps to restructure operations by discontinuing investment in MEMS and touch lines of business. These cost-management initiatives will increase its profitability and drive margins. Also, the company is focusing on manufacturing and R&D to boost margins.For the second quarter, Maxim expects revenues in the range of $490 million to $520 million based on a quarter-end backlog of $329.0 million. Earnings per share are projected within 23-29 cents on a GAAP basis and 29-35 cents on an adjusted basis.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Maxim will beat estimates this quarter.

The catalyst for this market-beating autumnal jaunt? Merger rumors in NVIDIA's neck of the semiconductor woods, even tough this particular chatter never involved NVIDIA itself. On Oct. 14, the rumor mill echoed with reports that  might merge with fellow mixed-signal processor maker  . NVIDIA rose 4% that day and never looked back. Shareholders seem excited about the idea of sector giants on the prowl for a deal in the \"merger of equals\" category. Maxim and ADI never commented on those merger rumors, and the gossip has since moved on to pairing Maxim with even larger rival  . That development hasn't negated NVIDIA's potential-merger boost at all, especially since the graphics processor specialist followed up with a strong third-quarter report near the start of November.If all of that sounds like roses and unicorns, you must have forgotten about August already. Because of a with weak consumer-goods sales, DreamWorks shares fell more than 17% in that quarter.The chip market is awash in major mergers, and the time has never been more ripe for NVIDIA to define an exit strategy. In particular, I wouldn't be surprised to see Texas Instruments turning its sights away from Maxim due to broadly overlapping product portfolios, and take a closer look at NVIDIA. The overlaps would be far smaller here, making TI an instant contender in several parts of the mobile and automotive markets where NVIDIA has been eating TI's lunch in recent years.Mind you, it's all just rumors at this point. Maxim hasn't found a final buyer yet, and nobody has even hinted at talking to NVIDIA's board of directors.So NVIDIA's shareholders continue an inspiring ride that has seen share prices skyrocket 50% higher over the last six months. Maxim has only gained 24%, direct buyout rumors notwithstanding. Is NVIDIA going to Texas or Massachusetts in the near future, or perhaps nowhere at all? Grab a bag of popcorn and a comfy deck chair.

(Symbol: MXIM) saw new options become available today, for the January 2018 expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 830 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a potential opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the MXIM options chain for the new January 2018 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $30.00 strike price has a current bid of $3.70. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $30.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $26.30 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MXIM, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $34.77/share today.Because the $30.00 strike represents an approximate 14% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 68%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of MXIM stock at the current price level of $34.77/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $35.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 12.45% if the stock gets called away at the January 2018 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MXIM shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MXIM's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $35.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $35.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

It compares the average of gains in days that closed up to the average of losses in days that closed down; readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought, while an RSI below 30 suggests undervalued conditions are present.Yet MXIM's high RSI value isn't the only reason for investors to be concerned, as there has been some decidedly negative earnings estimate revisions in Maxim Integrated Products' stock as of late.

Management had then expected non-GAAP net sales between $532 million and $569 million, while non-GAAP gross margin was expected in the range of 57.6% to 57.8%. Non-GAAP net income was anticipated in the range of $127.3 million to $145.4 million, with non-GAAP earnings per share of 58 cents to 66 cents per share.Along with the first-quarter fiscal 2016 earnings release, Microchip had also announced the acquisition of Micrel for approximately $430 million in cash and issuance of 8,626,795 shares of Microchip's stock. Consequently, based on the current projections, Microchip now anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share to lie within 60 and 66 cents on revenues of $545 million to $563 million.

Last quarter, it posted a 14.29% positive surprise. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Maxim delivered mixed fiscal fourth quarter 2015 results with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missing the same. Higher earnings were primarily attributable to a stronger automotive business, lower operating expenses and a slightly lower tax rate.Revenues were up 0.9% sequentially but down 9.3% year over year. The sequential increase primarily resulted from strong demand for automotive products.However, smartphone revenues were lower than the company's expectations due to broad based weakness in the communications market. Industrial was slightly better than the company's expectationsOf late, Maxim has been developing technology based on advanced process nodes in collaboration with its foundry partners. New products from this initiative could help it expand margins.It is also taking steps to restructure operations by discontinuation of investment in its MEMS and touch lines of business. The company's steps to streamline costs will help it increase its profitability and therefore drive margins. Also, it is undertaking multiple initiatives to increase margins going forward. The company is especially focusing on manufacturing and R&D.For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, Maxim expects revenues in the range of $545 million to $585 million based on a quarter-end backlog of $366.0 million.Earnings per share are expected within 22-28 cents on a GAAP basis and 38-44 cents on an adjusted basis.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Maxim will beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 41 cents. Therefore, the Earnings ESP for the stock is 0.00%.

To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MXIM, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $32.04/share today.Because the $30.00 strike represents an approximate 6% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 62%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.50% return on the cash commitment, or 11.45% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., and highlighting in green where the $30.00 strike is located relative to that history:  Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $33.00 strike price has a current bid of $2.30. If an investor was to purchase shares of MXIM stock at the current price level of $32.04/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $33.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 10.17% if the stock gets called away at the May 2016 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if MXIM shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing MXIM's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $33.00 strike highlighted in red: Considering the fact that the $33.00 strike represents an approximate 3% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 53%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.18% boost of extra return to the investor, or 10.96% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example is 30%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 32%.

The higher earnings were primarily attributable to lower-than-expected operating expenses.Revenues were $577.3 million, up 1.8% sequentially but down 4.7% year over year. The sequential increase in revenues was primarily due to strong demand for communications and automotive products. Revenues, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $583.0 million.Communications and data center, computing and automotive end markets were the strong points, while other segments softened. The revenue mix in terms of major markets was as follows:The Consumer end market remained the largest revenue contributor, accounting for approximately 31% of revenues, down sequentially. The sequential decrease was due to normal seasonal decline in tablets and eReader shipments, partially offset by the ramp up of a flagship smartphone. Its biggest mobility customer currently represents around 15% of revenues, flat with the prior quarter.Industrial, Maxim's second largest segment, generated 27% of revenues, flat sequentially. This, however, was lower than management's expectations primarily due to weakness in the vertical segments.The Communications and data center end market accounted for 23% of revenues, up sequentially. The sequential increase was mostly attributable to strong demand for Optical products and a seasonal increase in the cable business.The Automotive end market generated 13% of revenues, reflecting a 13% increase sequentially, above normal seasonality. The increase was primarily driven by continuous share gains across a broad base of customers and products.The Computing business contributed 6% of revenues, up sequentially.The non-GAAP gross margin was 59.6%, down 70 basis points (bps) sequentially and 50 bps year over year. The decrease was attributed to lower utilization rates.Non-GAAP operating expenses of $199.7 million were down 7.4% sequentially and 10.1% year over year. The decrease was driven by overall cost controls, which included the initial savings from the company's restructuring activities.The pro-forma net income was $114.2 million, or 19% of sales compared with $93.7 million or 16.5% in the prior quarter and $123.1 million or 20% in the year-ago quarter. Our pro-forma calculation excludes restructuring, intangibles amortization, asset impairments and other one-time charges on a tax-adjusted basis.During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $182.1 million or 31% of revenues compared with $172.9 million in the prior quarter. Important usages of cash during the quarter included $10.2 million on capex, $36.8 million on share repurchases and $79.4 million on dividends.Inventory days were 116, down 8 days from the prior quarter.Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased $86.5 million during the quarter to $1.47 billion.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, Maxim expects revenues in the range of $570-$610 million based on a quarter-end backlog of $387.0 million. Management's revenue guidance reflects strong growth in the automotive segment. It also signifies the commencement of new product shipments into the mobility market.Gross margin is expected in the 53-56% range on a GAAP basis and within 58-61% on an adjusted basis (excluding special items), flat with the prior quarter. Operating expenditure is expected to be flat with the prior quarter. The tax rate, excluding special items, is expected within the range of 21-23%.Earnings per share are expected within 24-30 cents on a GAAP basis and 35-41 cents on an adjusted basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the June quarter is currently 39 cents (at the higher end of the range).Maxim delivered decent fiscal third-quarter 2015 results with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Maxim is shifting to advanced node process technology development through a new collaboration with its foundry partners. New products from this initiative could help it expand margins.It is also taking steps to restructure operations by discontinuation of investment in its MEMS and touch lines of business. The company expects to complete the sale of its touch business in the current quarter. The company's steps to streamline costs will help it increase its profitability and therefore, drive margins.Maxim's diversification strategy is starting to yield results, with its automotive and industrial businesses seeing growth.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $30.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $28.95 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of MXIM, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $31.28/share today.Because the $30.00 strike represents an approximate 4% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

The list includes San Jose - based semiconductor manufacturers: Xilinx  and Maxim, and Tokyo-based Renesas Electronics.Per reports, Avago, which seeks to diversify its business in areas ranging from analog semiconductors to radio frequency technology, is ready to pay more than $10 billion on a prospective buyout. The reports also reveal that Avago has approached private equity firm Silver Lake Partners for collaborating on a potential acquisition. However, as of now, Avago's apprehensions regarding higher prices have restricted merger talks.This is not the first time that Avago has expressed its interest in acquiring fellow chipmakers. Earlier this year, Avago made a bid for Freescale Semiconductor. However, fellow Apple  chip supplier NXP Semiconductors announced in March that it was acquiring Freescale for over $11.8 billion, which Avago believed was too expensive.Avago Technologies is a premier designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of analog semiconductor devices and digital, mixed-signal and optoelectronics components and subsystems.Maxim, on the other hand, is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of semiconductor analog and mixed signal integrated circuits (ICs). The company has a broad product portfolio that includes analog-to-digital converters, amplifiers and comparators, communications devices, data converters and management components, sensors and wireless products.With Avago aspiring to expand its business, there's no doubt Maxim would be on the list of its potential buyout targets.The semiconductor industry is one of the best-performing spaces within the tech sector. These companies often form the backbone of the technology world and are part of an industry that posted sales of $340.3 billion in 2014, up 7.9% from $315.4 billion posted in 2013. The semiconductor industry was in fact one of the top performing industries in 2014.But things don't always go as expected. Analysts believe that the semiconductor business is maturing, which has created a need for larger companies. The flurry of mergers in the semiconductor space basically stems from deep growth issues as the decline in the personal computer industry restricts growth potential and the lower-margin mobile-device industry hampers profits. By merging with other established players, chip companies can capitalize on economies of scale, reduce costs and expand their footprint.As per Thomson Reuters data, global semiconductor M&A reached $31 billion in 2014, the maximum since 2011.All said and done, whether Maxim and Avago's talks will materialize into a deal and help them expand their collective market share remains to be seen.Maxim has a Zacks Rank # 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Last quarter, it posted a 13.79% positive surprise. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Maxim delivered decent fiscal second quarter 2015 results with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues coming in line with the same. Moreover, earnings surpassed management's guided range, primarily attributable to lower-than-expected operating expenses and higher-than-expected revenues.Revenues, though within management's guidance range, were down 2.3% sequentially and 8.6% year over year. The sequential decrease in revenues was primarily due to weaker demand for communications infrastructure products.The company remains committed to growing its Mobility revenue by diversifying the customer base and targeting new opportunities like wearable devices. Its automotive and industrial businesses are also seeing growth.Of late, Maxim has been developing technology based on advanced process nodes in collaboration with its foundry partners. New products from this initiative could help it expand margins.It is also taking steps to restructure operations by the closure of the San Jose fab and discontinuation of investment in its MEMS and touch lines of business. The company's steps to streamline costs will help it increase its profitability and therefore drive margins.For the third quarter, Maxim expects revenues in the range of $565-$605 million based on a quarter-end backlog of $378.0 million. Gross margin is expected be in the 52%-56% range on a GAAP basis. It is expected to be in the range of 58%-62% on an adjusted basis (excluding special items). Operating expenditure is expected to be down sequentially. Earnings per share are expected to be 20 cents - 26 cents on a GAAP basis and 32 cents - 38 cents on an adjusted basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 35 cents (at the midpoint of the company guided range).Our proven model does not conclusively show that Maxim will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. : The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, currently stands at -14.29%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 30 cents is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents. : Maxim's Zacks Rank #3 when combined with a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and #5 (Sell rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies, which you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:SBA Communications Corp.  with Earnings ESP of +38.46% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)LG Display Co., Ltd.  with Earnings ESP of +64.29% and a Zacks Rank #2DigitalGlobe, Inc.  with Earnings ESP of +30.00% and a Zacks Rank #2Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Maxim reported $577 million in revenue and $0.40 in adjusted EPS for its fiscal third quarter. These results represented year-over-year declines of 5% and 7%, respectively. Wall Street analysts had expected $585.2 million in revenue and $0.35 in adjusted EPS, so the report was somewhat of a mixed bag. However, it's Maxim's forward guidance that's causing some consternation among investors today, as it now expects to generate between $570 million and $610 million in revenue for Q4, resulting in EPS ranging from $0.35 to $0.41. Both ranges are weaker than Wall Street's expectations on the high end. Analysts had expected $618.5 million in revenue and $0.44 for the fourth quarter. Maxim is now expected to earn $1.48 per share on revenue of $2.35 billion for its 2015 fiscal year, which would be weaker than 2014's results by 9% on the bottom line and 4% on the top line. Both Maxim's top and bottom lines have been in slow decline since the end of its 2013 fiscal year, and the company's underwhelming guidance offers no indication that this slide will be reversed any time soon.Companies with no forward momentum have been nonetheless buoyed in recent years by the widespread hope that business will eventually improve, but this hope has been eroding for many stocks in 2015. Maxim is just the latest casualty, and now that its shares have dropped from post-recession highs, it seems likely that the correction will continue without any financial forward momentum to arrest it.

The stock is currently trading at a forward P/E of 20.8x with long-term earnings growth expectation of 8.0%.High quality standards, solid performance, reliability features, ease of use, pricing and diversity of products make Microchip one of the better-positioned companies in the semiconductor universe. The company registered healthy revenues in third quarter fiscal 2015 driven by broad-based growth across all product lines. With a diligent focus on right-sizing the various components of inventory holdings, Microchip was also able to reduce its inventory during the quarter.Microchip is one of the fastest growing providers of 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in the world. The microcontroller business of the company continued to outperform the industry and enabled it to gain significant market share. Microcontroller revenues in calendar year 2014 were up 13.8% year over year, setting an all-time record for each of the three microcontroller segments.The company also registered record sales of 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in calendar year 2014. While the 16-bit microcontroller business climbed 27.7% for the year, 32-bit microcontroller revenues were up 41.3% with new design wins and applications.Microchip expects to continue this momentum and strengthen its position as the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry. The company is increasingly expanding its touch business beyond handsets and tablets in areas, such as automotive industrial applications.The Analog business has also become one of the largest analog franchises in the market. Revenues from the analog products were up 15.3% from the year-ago quarter to $125.5 million. With strong design wins in a broad range of applications, revenues from the analog business were up 15.7% in calendar year 2014 and set an all-time record. In order to further capitalize on this burgeoning business potential, Microchip is developing and introducing a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products.During third-quarter fiscal 2015, the company hiked its quarterly cash dividend from $0.3565 cents to $0.3570 cents per share, representing the 44th dividend increase since its inception. Microchip has returned over $2.4 billion to shareholders as dividends and $1.4 billion in share repurchases since the inception of its dividend program.

(Symbol: MXIM) was identified as having a larger market cap than the smaller end of the S&P 500, for example Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (Symbol: MLM), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true \"apples-to-apples\" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (Symbol: MXIM), the market cap is now $9.75B, versus Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (Symbol: MLM) at $9.59B.Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of MXIM vs. MLM (Note that we have found 4 splits in the  ):Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which indices will include the stock, and which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and \"tosses out\" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller \"up-and-comers\" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). And ETFs that directly follow an index like the S&P 500 will only own the underlying component of that index, selling companies that lose their status as an S&P 500 company, and buying companies when they are added to the index.

Moreover, earnings surpassed management's guided range, primarily attributable to lower-than-expected operating expenses and higher-than-expected revenues.Shares were up over 5% to $34.80 during afterhours trading, primarily due to strong earnings and a positive guidance indicating enhanced growth prospects in all the segments.Revenues in the reported quarter were $566.8 million, down 2.3% sequentially and 8.6% year over year. The sequential decrease in revenues was primarily due to weaker demand for communications infrastructure products. Revenues however came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and within management's guidance range.Consumer and automotive were the strong points while other segments softened. The revenue mix in terms of major markets in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 was as follows:The  end market remained the largest revenue contributor, accounting for approximately 33% of revenues, up 7.4% sequentially. The sequential increase was due to improved performance at the company's leading mobility customer and an increase in revenue from other mobility customers in both tablets and in shipments for a wearable product.Also, the company's diversification efforts and strong demand helped to increase revenues. Its biggest mobility customer currently represents around 15% of revenues, up from 13% in the prior quarter but down from 28% of revenues in fiscal 2013. , Maxim's second largest segment generated 27% of revenues, reflecting a 5.8% sequential decline. This was in line with management's expectations and was primarily due to normal seasonal trends in the core Industrial end market.The  end market accounted for 23% of revenues, reflecting a 13.6% decrease sequentially. The sequential decline was primarily attributable to weakness in the enterprise server business and also the weakness in optical infrastructure equipment.The  end market generated 12% of revenues, reflecting a 6.6% increase sequentially, in line with management's expectations.

The sequential decrease was attributed to lower internal fab utilization, which declined from 71% in the first quarter to 60% in the second quarter.Non-GAAP operating expenses of $215.7 million were down 2.1% sequentially and 4.7% from the year-ago quarter. The sequential decrease was driven by overall cost controls, which included the initial savings from the company's restructuring activities.The pro forma net income was $93.7 million, or 16.5% of sales compared with $108.6 million or 18.7% in the prior quarter and $102.5 million or 16.5% in the year-ago quarter. Our pro forma calculation excludes restructuring, intangibles amortization, asset impairments and other one-time charges on a tax-adjusted basis.During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $172.9.0 million or 30.5% of revenues compared with $117.0 million in the prior quarter. Important usages of cash during the quarter included $18.6 million on capex, $60.0 million on share repurchases and $79.0 million on dividends.Inventory days were 124, down 1 day from the prior quarter.Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased by $62.0 million during the quarter to $1.38 billion.For the third quarter of fiscal 2015, Maxim expects revenues in the range of $565 million-$605 million based on a quarter-end backlog of $378.0 million. Management's revenue guidance reflects strong growth in automotive segment and a seasonal increase in industrial.

New products from this initiative could help it expand margins.It is also taking steps to restructure operations by the closure of the San Jose fab and discontinuation of investment in its MEMS and touch lines of business. The reduced investment will take out an additional $3-4 million of costs. The company's steps to streamline costs will help it increase its profitability and therefore drive margins.Maxim's diversification strategy is starting to reap fruits in Consumer and its automotive and industrial businesses are also seeing growth. The latest pipeline of automotive technologies in infotainment, safety and driver assistance applications will further enhance the company's financial position.The company remains committed to growing its Mobility business by increasing diversifying the business, broadening the customer base and targeting new opportunities like wearable devices. At the same time, it is taking down costs related to its consumer segment because these efforts will take time to convert to revenue.Currently, Maxim's shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Internal inventories were up slightly.Industrial and personal electronics remained the two most important end markets for the company, although communications equipment and automotive also made sizeable contributions.Management has successfully steered the business into analog and embedded processing applications, which typically yield a more stable business as well as stronger margins.The Analog, Embedded Processing and Other Segments generated 65%, 20% and 15% of quarterly revenue, respectively.The  business grew -1.2% sequentially and 13.6% year over year. Power management was the main driver of growth from the year-ago quarter although HPA, HVAL and SVA also grew.The  segment, which includes the processor, microcontroller and connectivity product lines, was down 5.8% sequentially and up 10.9% from last year. Growth from the year-ago quarter was fairly broad-based across product lines.The  segment, which includes DLPs, custom ASICs, calculators, royalties and some legacy wireless products was down 25.7% sequentially but down 14.2% year over year. Legacy wireless products again impacted the year-over-year decline and custom ASICs were also down.Net product orders were $3.18 billion in the last quarter, down 4.8% sequentially and up 12.3% year over year. Backlog declined 12.0% sequentially and was 16.1% below the year-ago level. Turns sales dropped 2.7% sequentially, growing as a percentage of sales from the previous quarter.TI's gross margin of 58.0% was down 41 bps sequentially and up 381 bps from the year-ago quarter. The gross margin benefited from higher volumes, higher utilization and a better mix of analog and embedded processing revenue (now 85% of revenue). TI exceeded its long-term gross margin target of 55% in the last quarter and its low-cost manufacturing capacity will continue to expand margins as long as loading remains high.Operating expenses of $760 million were down 4.4% sequentially. The operating margin was 34.7%, down 96 bps sequentially and up 721 bps from the year-ago quarter. All expenses increased as a perentage of sales from the previous quarter but were down from the year-ago quarter.The Analog, Embedded Processing and Other segments generated operating margins of 38.7%, 17.0% and 34.5%, respectively. The Analog margin expanded 140 bps sequentially, Embedded Processing 98 bps with Other declining 595 bps. Margin increases from the year-ago quarter were significant across all segments.Management called out two adjustments (a 5 cent gain from the re-instatement of the federal research tax credit and a 2 cent gain from the sale of assets) excluding which the pro forma net income came to 69 cents,Ongoing restructuring gains and acquisition charges (that will remain steady over the next five years) were around 5 cents.The pro forma net income was $730 million, or a 22.3% net income margin compared to $826 million, or 23.6% in the previous quarter and $618 million, or 20.4% in the year-ago quarter.On a GAAP basis, the company reported a net profit of $ 76 cents a share compared to a net profit of 77 cents in the previous quarter and a net profit of 46 cents in the comparable prior-year quarter.Inventories increased 1.9% sequentially to around $1.78 billion, with inventory turns remaining up from 3.3X to 3.08X. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) went from 39 to around 35. TI generated $1.27 billion in cash from operations, spending $125 million on capex, $698 mllion on share repurchases and $356 million on cash dividends. During the quarter, spending on share repurchases dropped 1% while dividends increased 13%.At quarter-end, TI had $3.64 billion in long-term debt and $1.00 billion in short-term debt. During the quarter, the net debt position dropped by $358 million. It also had net underfunded retirement plans of $98 million.TI provided guidance for the first quarter.Accordingly, TI expects revenue between $3.07 billion and $3.33 billion (up 7.3% sequentially at the mid-point) and in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.20 billion.Restructuring charges will be negligible and non-cash amortization charges related to acquisitions will remain in the range of $80- $85 million for the next five years. The annual effective tax rate will be around 30%.The EPS for the quarter is expected to be 57 to 67 cents, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents.Texas Instruments is prudently investing its R&D dollars into several high-margin, high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets. This is gradually increasing its exposure to the industrial and automotive markets, while reducing its exposure to the volatile consumer/computing markets.TI, along with chipmaker Intel (  ) remains one of the few semiconductor companies that depend on internal capacity for manufacturing the bulk of its devices. But since it has the policy of building out capacity ahead of demand, it is able to make opportunistic purchases. As a result, it is able to contain capex at up to 4% of sales even while on any expansion plan.We remain optimistic about TI's compelling product line, the differentiation in its business and lower-cost 300mm capacity that should in combination drive earnings. We note that channel inventories remain very low, meaning that demand is likely to remain strong, driving factory loadings and therefore, sustainable margins.TI shares carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Other semiconductor stocks worth considering include Microchip (  ), Monolithic (  ) and Maxim (  ), all of which have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The sequential revenue decrease of 9.7% was primarily due to lower smartphone volumes at the company's largest mobility customer.However, earnings were within management's guided range, primarily attributable to a higher gross margin, reduced operating expenses and a lower tax rate, offset by lower revenues.Of late, Maxim has been making a strategic shift to advanced node process technology development through a new collaboration with its foundry partners. Also, the company remains committed to growing its Mobility business by increasing content opportunities, broadening the customer base and targeting new opportunities like wearable devices.Maxim's overall strategy of mixed signal and analog integration is bearing fruit and has long-term growth prospects. All these efforts taken together are expected to help the company deliver good results in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.For the second quarter, Maxim expects revenues in the range of $540 million-$580 million based on a quarter-end backlog of $379.0 million. Gross margin is expected to be in the 55%-59% range on a GAAP basis and 58%-62% on an adjusted basis (excluding special items). Operating expenditure is expected to be flat sequentially. Earnings per share are expected to be 19 cents to 25 cents on a GAAP basis and 26 cents to 32 cents on an adjusted basis (excluding special items).Our proven model does not conclusively show that Maxim will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen.

The annual review is an attempt to strengthen its non-transaction base revenue.Launched in Jan 1985 and traded as 'NDX', several small-, mid- and large-cap, fast growing companies of the core trade sector such as computer hardware & software, telecommunications, retail & wholesale trade and biotechnology have found place in the Nasdaq-100 index. These U.S. and internationally-based companies are ranked on their market value and solid growth history such as Apple Inc. (  ), Comcast Corp. (  ) and Adobe Systems Inc. (  ).The technological, basically non-financial, stocks are traded as options derivatives against the Nasdaq-100 that allow the investor to earn from changes in the index value with a limited amount of money at risk. Meanwhile, the premiere set of high-ranked stocks that the index holds makes it the bellwether index of such tech stock portfolio.Furthermore, the Nasdaq market data used in the ranking review is updated with total shares outstanding at the end of October every year and is submitted to the Securities Exchange Commission in a public filing, by the end of November.Individual investors can access this index through exchange traded funds (ETFs) like Nasdaq 100 Trust that was previously known as QQQQ. Nasdaq-100 is also the benchmark index for other popular ETFs.Accordingly, this year, Nasdaq has added about 44 rapid-growth biotechnology companies, along with software, airline and manufacturing companies like Electronic Arts Inc. (  ), American Airlines Group Inc. (  ) and Lam Research Corp. (  ), respectively.Notably, Nasdaq also added lower tier shares of some of the high-potential stocks like the Class B shares of Twenty-First Century Fox and Class C shares of Liberty Global plc. At the same time, a handful of underperforming stocks like Expedia Inc. (  ), F5 Networks Inc. (  ) and Maxim Integrated Products Inc. (  ) were dropped from the Nasdaq-100 list.Through this index, Nasdaq incorporated a multiple asset class that diversifies risk and maximizes return. Moreover, annual re-ranking helps maintain strategic discipline and firmness in this index portfolio.The reshuffling further signals the company's promptness to capitalize on the volatility that the markets offer from time to time, and gain from a growth driven portfolio. These efforts will not only accelerate Nasdaq's operating leverage but also improve volumes and competitiveness.The efficiency of the Nasdaq-100 index or NDX is also reflected by its consistently solid performance, yielding one-year and five-year returns of about 20.3% and 132%, respectively. This is against the S&P 500 index that clocked one-year and five-year returns of about 12.1% and 79.8%, respectively.The solid performance and leading position of the Nasdaq 100 index also indicates the investors' growing risk appetite that equates to affinity for high growth-potential assets. Economic recovery and rising volatility has opened up new avenues of growth in the tech sector, given the increased listings witnessed in tech and digital commerce startups lately.Going forward, we believe the rapidity of tech companies will continue to boost investors' sentiment in the Nasdaq-100 index, thereby auguring a healthy growth outlook.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

There was a sharp 22% drop in the XSD to a low of 61.09. In the subsequent snap-back rally in the market, the XSD retraced 38% of its decline.When an industry group goes from leading the pack to lagging badly, it usually represents a combination of fundamental factors and a change in market psychology. Clearly the psychology regarding the XSD ETF has turned very negative. The Chaikin Power Bar indicates that only 4 stocks in the XSD have a bullish  while 23 have a bearish rating. This puts XSD last in the 20 SPDR Subsector ETFs rankings based on the Power Gauge ratings.The sell-off in the Semiconductor group was triggered by a negative earnings report on 10/9 from Microchip Corp. () in which they blamed weakness in demand from China and overall weakness in the semiconductor group. This turned out to be very misleading as Intel (), the market leader in semiconductors, subsequently came out with a positive earnings surprise and raised their guidance for the next quarter citing improving trends in PC sales and in tablet sales as well.The bounce in stocks like Skyworks Solutions (), which makes chips for the iPhone 6 and others, suggests that the market threw the baby out with the bath water in its reaction to MCHP\u2019s dour forecast. It also suggests that MCHP was trying to deflect attention away from its own troubles by blaming the industry as a whole.The Chaikin Portfolio Health Check is an excellent tool to help zero in on the weakest stocks in any ETF, and in the SPDR Semiconductor ETF (XSD) there are indeed 23 bearish rated stocks.By looking at the individual component stocks through the lens of the 20 factor , you can easily find the stocks in the XSD ETF with the weakest price potential over the next 3-6 months. These are the stocks to avoid as they are likely to underperform the XSD as well as the overall market.The Chaikin Power Grid in Portfolio Health Check (see below) maps stocks and industry groups from strong to weak so you can easily determine the best and worst stocks in any ETF. To find the weakest stocks in the XSD, we look to the bottom left quadrant of the Power Grid (weak Power Gauge stocks in weak industry groups) where we find stocks with the worst potential for price gains over the next 3-6 months. There we see stocks like RF Micro Devices (), Cypress Semiconductor (), Maxim Integrated Products (), First Solar () in addition to the aforementioned Microchip Technology.Over time, weak stocks in weak industry groups will underperform the market.One stock to consider buying in the SPDR Semiconductor ETF is Skyworks Solutions which makes chips for the very successful iPhone 6. SWKS sold off from a high of 59.25 after the iPhone 6 launch to a panic low of 44.06 last week. It has subsequently rebounded to 54.07 as investors realize that Microchip\u2019s woes are not endemic to the semiconductor industry as a whole. Adding further emphasis to the overdone sell-off is SWKS\u2019 raising guidance last week for the 3rd quarter, ahead of their earnings report on 11/6/14. Skyworks pre-warned to the upside in June but the market didn\u2019t pay attention. The 10/14 pre-warning came in the midst of a panic sell-off but the subsequent snap back rally of 25% suggests that investors now get this powerful earnings story.Buy SWKS on any dips of 1 \u00bd to 3 days, particularly if they are in sympathy with stock market pull backs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) shares have declined nearly 10% since the company reported fourth quarter fiscal 2014 earnings and provided a tepid guidance on Jul 24. Earnings excluding special items of 43 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents. Moreover, it was down 1.9% from the year-ago quarter. The decline was primarily due to lower revenues at the Consumer, Industrial and Computing end markets and inventory reserves.Revenues in the reported quarter were $642.5 million, up 6.1% sequentially and 5.6% on a year-over-year basis. The sequential increase in revenues was primarily attributable to growth across all its main businesses and solid strength in its balanced portfolio, despite softness in the mobility business. However, revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $650.0 million.The  end market remained the largest revenue contributor, accounting for approximately 35% of revenues compared with 38% in the prior quarter. The sequential decline was due to weakness in smartphones and tablets, mainly at its biggest customer.Mobility consumers are rapidly shifting toward the latest generation devices, while demand for prior generation products is falling at an increasing rate. Decline in previous generation smart devices at company's leading customer adversely affected the business. Older mobility products, specifically tablets, generated lower-than expected revenues.Maxim's expansion intopower management sensors, motion control, MEMS, audio amplifier and other areas of smartphones, tablets and hybrid devices is proving to be beneficial as it secured design wins for its sensor technology. , Maxim's second largest segment, generated 27% of revenues compared with 31% in the prior quarter and grew 10% on a year-over-year basis. The year-over-year rise was attributable to persistent growth in the core industrial end market and support from vertical industrial markets. In the core industrial end market, the company has introduced distributed control in the factory by allowing solid and effective designs that are heat efficient in the industrial atmosphere.The  end market generated 10% of revenues. The company experienced broad-based rise in infotainment as mobility user experience shifted to the Automotive market. Moreover, the segment also witnessed an increase in new design wins across numerous applications and customers.The  end market accounted for 23% of revenues compared with 17% in the prior quarter and up 30% from the year-ago quarter. The sequential increase was driven by continued strength due to the release of China 4G LTE and better demand from a number of OEMs. The year-over-year increase is attributable to organic growth in server applications, driven by positive synergies from the acquisition of Volterra technology. Moreover, its cable infrastructure business continues to witness growth due to the adoption of the company's highly developed data converter products.The  business contributed 5% of revenues compared with 14% in the prior quarter.Non-GAAP gross margin was 60.4%, up 31 basis points (bps) sequentially but down 194 bps year over year. The sequential increase was attributed to higher utilization at fabs, partially offset by higher inventory reserves. Inventory charge for the older generation mobility products, especially tablets, negatively impacted margins.Non-GAAP operating expenses of $226.9 million were up 2.2% sequentially and 6.0% from the year-ago quarter.Pro forma net income was $123.9 million compared with $123.1 million in the prior quarter and $129.5 million in the year-ago quarter. Our pro forma calculation excludes restructuring, intangibles amortization, asset impairments and other one-time charges on a tax-adjusted basis.During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $234.0 million or 36.4% of revenue, up from $211.7 million in the prior quarter. Inventory was 103 days, a drop of 6 days from the previous quarter.Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased $141.0 million in the fourth quarter to $1.37 billion.Net capex was $22.0 million compared with $26.0 million in the prior quarter. Maxim has $1.0 billion of long-term debt flat compared with the prior quarter.Maxim spent $74.0 million on cash dividends and $41.0 million on share repurchase of 1.2 million shares in the reported quarter. The company declared a cash dividend of 28 cents per share to be paid to shareholders, representing an 8% sequential increase in dividend.For the first quarter of fiscal 2015, Maxim expects revenues in a range of $580-$620 million based on a quarter-end backlog of $377.0 million. Management's revenue guidance reflects a cautious outlook toward smartphone and tablet shipments at its largest customer. Moreover, shipments into other Mobility opportunities can be delayed.Management expects industrial market revenues to be down due to seasonally lower core industrial sales. Automotive is expected to be slightly up as the company continues to deliver on its pipeline of design wins. Management has a cautious stance for the consumer segment as it expects consumer to be down significantly due to softness in smartphones at its largest customer, partly offset by a number of new Mobility products. Communications and data center is forecast to be flat from a strong June, with continued support from the fiber optic infrastructure build-out and base station consumption. Lastly, computing is expected to be flat with the June quarter.Gross margin is expected be in the 56%-59% range on a GAAP basis and 59%-62% on an adjusted basis (excluding special items). Operating expenditure is expected to decline roughly 1% to 2%.Earnings per share are expected to be 27 cents - 33 cents on a GAAP basis and 34 cents-40 cents on an adjusted basis (excluding special items). The tax rate, excluding special items, is expected to be within the range of 18%-20% of revenues. Capex is expected to be at 3-5% of revenue.Maxim reported disappointing first quarter results with the top and bottom lines missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Maxim's business has a well-diversified portfolio of products and abilities. It has increased its focus on the faster-growing consumer and computing end markets.Maxim's long-term fiscal strategy of growth, leverage and return is on the right track. Of late, Maxim has been attempting to diversify its exposure within the Mobility market in several ways such as expanding its tech offerings for mobile devices, growing revenue and content.The consumer market is also moving towards more innovation with new content prospects across new smart devices platforms and the fast growing wearables and portable devices space. All these efforts are aimed at extending its foothold in various spheres. Moreover, diversification of customer base, beyond its existing leading customer, to Chinese producers and other important OEMs indicate healthy growth prospects for the company.The company aims to integrate simpler device design, higher performance, power and space efficiency in its different businesses including Automotive, Industrial, Communications and Datacenter. This integration will benefit the company with more secular growth in the analog industry.Moreover, its margins are expected to improve with better inventory controls and stringent cost control methods. While Maxim's portfolio and pipeline remain solid and its end-market diversity commendable, we believe its exposure to the consumer and computing markets increases risks. Moreover, its strong business model coupled with strong profitability allows it to return a significant portion of its free cash flow to shareholders.Currently, Maxim's shares carry a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Better-ranked semiconductor stocks include Fairchild Semiconductor International Inc. (  ) and ON Semiconductor Corp. (  ) and Analog Devices (  ), all carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, earnings excluding special items of 43 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents. Moreover, they were down 1.9% from the year-ago quarter.

(Symbol: MXIM) were yielding above the 3% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.04), with the stock changing hands as low as $34.65 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the iShares Russell 3000 ETF (  ) back on 5/31/2000 - you would have paid $78.27 per share. Fast forward to 5/31/2012 and each share was worth $77.79 on that date, a loss of $0.48 or 0.6% decrease over twelve years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $10.77 per share in dividends over the same period, increasing your return to 13.15%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.0%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 3% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable.

Last quarter, it posted a 10.26% positive surprise. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Maxim posted decent third quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the top line matching the same. The sequential revenue decrease of 2.4% was primarily due to a decline in consumer and computing revenues.The decline in the consumer market was attributable to normal seasonality, which was partly offset by the ramp of a new smartphone at the company's main consumer. Computing revenues declined primarily due to a decline in both notebook and server businesses.Of late, Maxim has increased its focus on the faster-growing consumer and computing end markets. It has been diversifying its position within the mobility market in several ways, such as expanding its tech offerings for mobile devices, growing revenue and content in the mid-range smartphone market with significant growth in China and so on.The company aims to integrate simpler device design, higher performance, power and space efficiency in its different businesses. The increased integration in its devices should help it drive secular growth in the automotive, industrial communications and data center markets.For the fourth quarter, Maxim expects revenues in a range of $635-$665 million. Backlog is expected to be $413.0 million.While GAAP gross margin is expected be in the 58%-60% range, GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of 38 cents - 42 cents. Capex is expected to be maintained at 5-7% of revenue.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Maxim will beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 48 cents. Hence, the difference is 0.00%. Maxim's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), when combined with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and #5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies, which you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Earnings excluding special items of 43 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents.Revenues in the reported quarter were $605.7 million, down 2.4% sequentially and flat on a year-over year basis. The sequential decline in revenues was primarily due to a decline in consumer and computing revenues. However, revenues were on par with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The  end market remained the largest revenue contributor, accounting for approximately 38% of revenues compared with 39% in the prior quarter. The sequential decline was due to normal seasonality, which was partly offset by the ramp of a new smartphone at the company's main consumer.Maxim's expansion into sensors, motion control and other areas of smartphones, tablets and hybrid devices is proving to be beneficial as it secured design wins for its sensor technology. Further, Maxim is also expanding its mobile solutions toward mid-range smartphones as high-end smartphones are witnessing a slowdown globally. It gained new power system on a chip (SoC) wins in the quarter. ,  Maxim's second largest segment, generated 31.0% of revenues compared with 28.0% in the prior quarter. The sequential rise was attributable to persistent growth in Automotive and signs of strength in the core industrial business. In Automotive, the company experienced broad-based rise in infotainment and LED lighting applications.The  end market accounted for 17.0% of revenues compared with 16.0% in the prior quarter. The sequential increase was driven by strength in base stations due to the release of China 4G LTE and implementation of superior data converter products in cable infrastructure business.The  business contributed 14.0% of revenues compared with 17.0% in the prior quarter. The sequential decline was primarily due to decline in both notebook and server businesses.Non-GAAP gross margin was 60.1%, up 190 basis points (bps) sequentially but down 340 bps year over year. The sequential decline was attributed to lower fab employment and higher inventory reserves.Non-GAAP operating expenses of $222.2 million were down 1.9% sequentially but up 2.8% from the year-ago quarter. The sequential decrease in operating expenses was mainly due to the extra cost synergies from the Volterra factor as well as lower spending due to stringent cost control.Pro forma net income was $123.1 million compared with $102.5 million in the prior quarter and $134.6 million in the year-ago quarter. Our pro forma calculation excludes restructuring, intangibles amortization, asset impairments and other one-time charges on a tax-adjusted basis.During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $211.7 million or 35.0% of revenue, down from $234.4 million in the prior quarter.

Capex is expected to be maintained at 5-7% of revenue.Maxim reported decent first quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the top line matching the same. Revenues increased year over year while earnings declined.Maxim's business has a well-diversified portfolio of products and abilities. It has increased its focus on the faster-growing consumer and computing end markets.The company aims to integrate simpler device design, higher performance, power and space efficiency in its different businesses including Automotive, Industrial, Communications and Datacenter. This integration will benefit the company with more secular growth in the analog industry.However, Maxim has outperformed the broader market owing to its superior technology and innovation, which leads to continued design wins not just in the U.S. but also in emerging markets.Of late, Maxim has been attempting to diversify its exposure within the Mobility market in several ways such as expanding its tech offerings for mobile devices, growing revenue and content in the mid-range smartphone market with significant growth in China and so on.Additionally, Maxim has been on the lookout to expand beyond smartphones with gaming devices, tablets, wearables and e-readers. All these efforts are aimed at extending its foothold in various spheres.While Maxim's portfolio and pipeline remain solid and its end-market diversity commendable, we believe its exposure to the consumer and computing markets increases risks.

Its products have very wide-ranging application in consumer goods like cordless phones, digital cameras, DVD players and PDAs data processing equipment like computers, printers and workstations industrial products like temperature, pressure, velocity, and/or flow controllers and robotics products instrumentation products like automatic test equipment, analyzers, testers and measuring equipment medical instruments like blood glucose meters, blood oximetry and imaging instruments and various communications gear and networking equipment.Revenues were generated from five primary end markets. Automotive was formerly a part of the Industrial segment. However, due to its strategic importance, high growth, and size it is now being reported separately. Other reorganizations include shifting data storage and servers from Computing to the Communications and Data Center end-market, and financial terminals from Computing to the Industrial end-market. In 2014, revenues from consumer, industrial and communications and data center markets were 39%, 29% and 18% respectively. The Computing segment contributed 12% while automotive generated 3%.Note: auto generated 10% of revenue in 4Q when management started breaking it out separately. So revenue contribution from the segment as depicted in the above chart relates to its 4Q contribution only.A significant percentage of the wafer manufacturing continues to be carried out at Maxim's three fabrication facilities, although increasing amounts are being outsourced to partner foundries Epson, Powerchip and Maxchip. In 2014, the company outsourced 50% of production to these foundries, down from 53% in 2013.The company has operations in the Asia/Pacific region, the U.S. and Europe. In fiscal 2014, the Asia/Pacific region generated 71% of revenue, which was down 3% from 2013. China was the largest contributor within Asia, with a 41% share of total revenue. The U.S. and Europe generated 13% each declining1.0% each from 2013. The rest of the world generated 3%, declining 0.5%.Products are distributed in the U.S. and Canada through a direct sales force and support system. Products are sold through direct sales and applications organization, as well as other unaffiliated distributors. Distributors generated 36% of sales in 2014. Avnet was the primary global distributor, accounting for around 17% of the company's revenues in 2014. Samsung, the only customer generating more than 10% of revenue, accounted for 20% of revenues for the year.The most significant competitors are Analog Devices, Intersil Corporation, Linear Technology, National Semiconductor and Texas Instruments.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

(Symbol: MXIM) was identified as having a larger market cap than the smaller end of the S&P 500, for example Unum Group (Symbol: UNM), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true \"apples-to-apples\" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (Symbol: MXIM), the market cap is now $8.83B, versus Unum Group (Symbol: UNM) at $8.77B.Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of MXIM vs. UNM (Note that we have found 4 splits in the  ):Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which indices will include the stock, and which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and \"tosses out\" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller \"up-and-comers\" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). And ETFs that directly follow an index like the S&P 500 will only own the underlying component of that index, selling companies that lose their status as an S&P 500 company, and buying companies when they are added to the index. So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at TheOnlineInvestor.com find value to putting together these looks at comparative market capitalization daily.At the closing bell, MXIM is up about 0.1%, while UNM is up about 0.2% on the day Thursday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" 's (  ) second quarter fiscal 2014 earnings (excluding special items but including stock-based compensation expenses) of 36 cents per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents.Revenues in the reported quarter were $620.0 million, up 6.0% sequentially and 2.5% on a year-over year basis. The sequential rise in revenues was primarily on account of the acquisition of Volterra. However, revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $623.0 million.The Consumer end market remained the largest revenue contributor, accounting for approximately 39.0% of revenues compared with 43.0% in the prior quarter. The sequential decline was due to weakness in home entertainment.Maxim's expansion into sensors, motion control and other areas of smartphones, tablets and hybrid devices is proving to be beneficial as it secured design wins for its sensor technology. Further, Maxim is also expanding its mobile solutions toward mid-range smartphones as high-end smartphones are witnessing a slowdown globally.Industrial, Maxim's second largest segment, generated 28.0% of revenues compared with 29.0% in the prior quarter. Although Automotive grew for the fourth straight quarter, the Industrial business declined slightly due to seasonal weakness in Smart Meter and Medical businesses.The Communications end market accounted for 16.0% of revenues compared with 15% in the prior quarter. The sequential increase was driven by robust performance from Networking and Datacom segment.The Computing business contributed 17.0% of revenues compared with 12.0% in the prior quarter. The sequential improvement in the Computing business was mainly on account of the Volterra acquisition.Non-GAAP gross margin was 58.2%, down 250 basis points (bps) sequentially and 330 bps year over year. The decline in gross margin was attributed to unfavorable product mix, lower factory utilization and higher inventory reserves.Non-GAAP operating expenses of $226.4 million were up 9.2% sequentially and 4.9% from the year-ago quarter. The increase in operating expenses was mainly due to the Volterra factor as well as the impact of the annual merit rise and equity grants.Pro forma net income was $102.5 million compared with $119.5 million in the prior quarter and $124.8 million in the year-ago quarter. Our pro forma calculation excludes restructuring, intangibles amortization, asset impairments and other one-time charges on a tax-adjusted basis but includes stock based compensation charges in the last quarter.During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $234.0 million or 38.0% of revenue, up from $96.0 million in the prior quarter. Inventory was 110 days, flat sequentially.Total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased by $115 million in the second quarter to $1.15 billion.Net capex was $46.0 million compared with $33.0 million in the prior quarter. Maxim has $1.0 billion of long-term debt compared with $500.9 million in the prior quarter.Maxim spent $73.0 million on cash dividends and $59.0 million on share repurchases in the reported quarter.For the third quarter of fiscal 2014, Maxim expects revenues in a range of $590-$620 million. Backlog is expected to be $366.0 million. Management expects consumer market revenues to be subdued in the third quarter as the March quarter happens to be seasonally soft for mobility products. Communications revenues are projected to increase in the third quarter. Maxim expects Industrial revenues to grow significantly in the third quarter. Computing revenues, however, are projected to go down in the next quarter.Gross margin is expected be in the 56%-58% range on a GAAP basis and 60%-62% on an adjusted basis (excluding special items).Earnings are expected to be 37 cents - 41 cents on a GAAP basis. The cap-rate, excluding special items, is expected to be within the long term range of 16.0%-20.0%.Maxim's business is well-diversified. It has increased its focus on the faster-growing consumer and computing end markets.However, Maxim has outperformed the broader market owing to its superior technology and innovation, which leads to continued design wins not just in the U.S. but also in emerging markets.Of late, Maxim has been attempting to diversify its exposure within the Mobility market in several ways such as expanding its tech offerings for mobile devices, growing revenue and content in the mid-range smartphone market with significant growth in China and so on. Additionally, Maxim has been on the lookout to expand beyond smartphones with games in tablets and e-readers. All these efforts are aimed at extending its foothold in various new spheres.While Maxim's product line and pipeline remain solid and its end-market diversity commendable, we believe its exposure to the consumer and computing markets increases risks. Moreover, its strong business model coupled with strong profitability allows it to return a significant portion of free cash flow to shareholders.Currently, Maxim's shares carry a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Better-ranked semiconductor stocks include  (  ) and  (  ), both with a Zacks Rank # 1 (Strong Buy) and  (  ) with Zacks Rank # 2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  , or TI) reported fourth-quarter earnings that were down sequentially but up year over year.Results were helped by an improving mix of business and good cost control.

Internal inventories were flattish sequentially and management stated that inventories at distributors were also consistent with the third quarter. It appears that TI continues to ship largely to consumption.The Analog, Embedded Processing and Other Segments generated 62%, 20% and 18% of quarterly revenue, respectively.The  business declined 3.2% sequentially while growing 12.0% year over year. The sequential decline was broad-based across product lines, with with HPA declining the most, followed by HVAL, power management and then SVA. All product lines contributed to the year-over-year increase in analog revenue although power management products saw the strongest increase.The  segment, which includes the processor, microcontroller and connectivity product lines dropped 9.6% sequentially and grew 10.6% from last year. Microcontrollers and connectivity products grew sequentially but remained below year-ago levels. Processors were flat sequentially and down year over year.The  segment, which includes DLPs, custom ASICs, calculators, royalties and some legacy wireless products was down 14.0% sequentially and 27.0% year over year. The sequential decline was attributable to seasonal softness n the calculator business. The legacy wireless business remained a major drag in the year-over-year comparison.Net product orders were $2.83 billion in the last quarter, down 10.0% sequentially and up 4.1% year over year. Backlog declined sequentially, as order growth was slower than revenues. Turns sales dropped 5.5%, although they were up slightly as a percentage of revenue.TI's gross margin of 54.2% was down 68 bps sequentially and up 565 bps from the year-ago quarter. The sequential decline was volume-related. The solid increase from the year-ago quarter was attributale to better mix (analog and embedded processing is now 82% of revenue) and higher utilization rates, especially at the more advanced fabs.TI is now very close to its long-term gross margin target of 55%. The low-cost manufacturing capacity will continue to expand margins as utilization rates increase.Operating expenses of $807 million were down 3.1% sequentially. The operating margin was 27.5%, down 165 bps sequentially and up 770 bps from the year-ago quarter. All expenses increased sequentially as a perentage of sales. All except SG&A declined from last year.The Analog, Embedded Processing and Other segments generated operating margins of 30.0%, 6.8% and 15.3%, respectively. Analog and Embedded Processing margins shrank 18 bps and 564 bps on a sequential basis. The Other segment margin declined 1,228 bps due to continued decline in the legacy wireless business.The pro forma net income was $618 million, or a 20.4% net income margin compared to $721 million, or 22.2% in the previous quarter and $417 million, or 14.0% in the year-ago quarter. The fully diluted pro forma earnings per share were 56 cents compared to 65 cents in the previous quarter and 37 cents in the Dec quarter of last year. The pro forma calculations for the last quarter exclude the impact of restructuring gains and acquisition-related charges, as well as tax adjustments.On a GAAP basis, the company recorded a net profit of $511 million, or 46 cents a share compared to a net profit of $629 million, or 57 cents per share in the previous quarter and a net profit of $264 million (23 cents per share) in the comparable prior-year quarter.Inventories were flattish sequentially at around $1.73 billion, keeping inventory turns at around 3.2X. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) went down from 43 to around 36. TI generated $1.20 billion in cash from operations, spending $107 million on capex, $734 million on share repurchases and $326 million on cash dividends.At quarter-end, TI had $4.16 billion in long-term debt and $1.00 billion in short-term debt. During the quarter, the net debt position declined $239 million. It also had net underfunded retirement plans of $86 million.TI provided guidance for the first quarter and said that the tax rate for 2014 would be 27%.Accordingly, TI expects first quarter revenue to come in between $2.30 billion and $3.07 billion (down 11.3% sequentially at the mid-point), well below the consensus estimate of $2.95 billion. Management stated that the decline was because of the legacy wireless business, excluding which, revenue for the first quarter would be flat sequentially and up 10% year over year.The EPS for the quarter is expected to be 36 to 44 cents, the mid-point being 5 cents lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 45 cents.Texas Instruments is prudently investing its R&D dollars into several high-margin, high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets. This is gradually increasing its exposure to the industrial and automotive markets, while reducing its exposure to the volatile consumer/computing markets.The last few years have also seen other analog companies, such as  (  ) and  (  ) increasing focus on industrial and automotive markets. These markets have better secular drivers (energy efficiency in industrial and increasing electronic content in automotive). They also generate higher margins.Therefore, this strategy along with higher utilization rates will likely help improve the company's profitability. For TI, the turnaround in the communications infrastructure market is an added positive that should contribute to its top and bottom lines.While we remain optimistic about TI's compelling product line, the increased differentiation in its business and lower-cost 300mm capacity that should in combination drive earnings, we recognize that the channel is more conservative than it has been before.Therefore, TI shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), similar to analog peer  (  ).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) has recently announced the pricing of senior unsecured notes aggregating $500 million.

However, the combination of Maxim's Zacks Rank # 2 (Buy) and 0.0%  makes surprise prediction difficult. We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and #5 (Sell rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: (  ), Earnings ESP of +2.84% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

After the announcement, shares of Volterra and Maxim jumped 54.8% and 3.41%, respectively, over yesterday's closing price.The deal will be completed in early December subject to pending regulatory approvals.Calif.-based Volterradevelops low-voltage power-management chips for the computing, storage, networking and consumer markets.For 2012, Volterra posted revenues of $168 million and net income of $22.8 million, representing year-over-year increasesof 11% and 8%, respectively.Maximstated that the acquisition will strengthen its position in the enterprise and communications markets. The acquisition will also allow Maxim to develop and offer high-current power management solutions in the industry.Currently, the demand for chips that provide greater operational efficiency and consume less power is rising due to increased adoption of mobile devices. Infact, a Databeans report states that power management is the largest and fastest-growing product segment in the analog market.Also, a research report from HIS states that the power management IC market will grow 7.6% to $32.2 billion in 2013. The growth will be driven by strong demand for portable handheld devices, including mobile phones, consumer electronics equipment, hybrid and electrical vehicles, the smart grid and medical equipment.As per a forecast by TechNavio, the global smartphone market will increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10% through 2016. Another research firm IDC forecasts that total smartphone shipments will reach 1.5 billion units in 2017, posting a CAGR of 16% over the next five years, which represents significant growth opportunity for Maxim. The acquisition therefore makes sense for Maxim. The company can expand in the fast-growing low-energy chip market and concentrate more on the smartphone market, which is expecting robust growth in the long term.Maxim has already witnessed strength in the smartphone market, where it has secured a number of wins. Its chips are already used in Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's high-end Galaxy smartphones such as S4 and Note 2. Also, Maxim is expanding its mobile solutions toward mid-range smartphones as high-end smartphones are witnessing a slowdown globally.The Volterra acquisition will help Maxim to further increase its market share in the smartphone market, which requiresmore of energy saving chips. We believe that the acquisition will broaden Maxim's customer base, providing the company with a significant competitive edge.Maxim has a well-diversified business. The company is continuously increasing its focus on the faster-growing consumer and computing end markets. However, in the last-reported fourth quarter, Maxim's earnings of 44 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents or 6.4%.

Revenues missed management's guidance range of $610-$640 million.The  end market remained the largest revenue contributor, accounting for approximately 44% of total revenue, down 9.7% sequentially but up 2.9% year over year. The sequential decline was due to weakness in smartphones as it was impacted by inventory correction for Samsung's S III, which is also Maxim's largest customer.Maxim is expected to face slowdown due to weakness in demand for Samsung's latest flagship device Galaxy S4 and inventory correction. However, Maxim is making in-roads into several other Samsung offerings.Maxim's expansion into sensors, motion control and other areas of smartphones, tablets and hybrid devices is proving to be beneficial as it secured design wins for its sensor technology. Further, Maxim is also expanding its mobile solutions toward mid-range smartphones as high-end smartphones are witnessing a slowdown globally. , Maxim's second largest segment, generated 29% of revenues, up 16.6% sequentially and 12.1% year over year. Maxim benefited from strong order bookings in the automotive, smart meter and medical end market segments, which was offset by weakness in control and automation segment orders.Currently, Maxim is focusing on ASSP solutions as it provides highly integrated products in select end market segments such as automotive, smart meters and medical. It is also trying to strengthen its position in the general purpose market by providing high-performance analog building block products.Revenues from the  end market were up 7.7% sequentially but down 5.7% year over year to 15% of total revenue. The sequential increase was the result of improvement in the Networking and Datacom segment, which was offset by decline from base stations. Maxim is witnessing strength in sales in cable infrastructure products. Maxim is also witnessing improvements in its fiber optics business due to improvements in the Chinese markets. It also secured a new design win for PON deployments with a major Chinese vendor.Maxim is focusing on delivering next-generation networks with improved coverage, capacity and reduced power consumption. Further, management expects the introduction of highly integrated solutions across its broad range of technologies to help drive network performance going forward.Revenues from the  business were up 0.5% sequentially but fell 19.6% year over year and contributed 12.0% of revenues. The weakness was due to the decline in notebook sales.GAAP gross margin was 61.1%, down 111 basis points (bps) sequentially and 42 bps year over year. The decline in gross margin was related to lower factory utilization and higher inventory reserves.GAAP operating expenses of $220.3 million were down 0.7% sequentially and 6.6% from the year-ago quarter. Sequentially, lower research and development (R&D) expenses as a percentage of sales as well as lower restructuring and asset impairment charges positively impacted the gross margin. As a result, GAAP operating margin decreased 67 bps sequentially but rose 236 bps from the year-ago quarter to 24.8%.Pro forma net income was $129.5 million or a 21.3% net income margin compared with $134.6 million or 22.3% in the previous quarter and $134.7 million or 22.3% of sales in the year-ago quarter. Our pro forma calculation excludes restructuring, intangibles amortization, asset impairments and other one-time charges on a tax-adjusted basis but includes stock based compensation charges in the last quarter.Including these items, the company recorded GAAP net income of $119.0 million or 40 cents per share compared with $128.8 million or 43 cents per share in the previous quarter and $110.6 million or 37 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.Inventories were up 2.8% to $275.6 million. The cash and marketable securities balance was $1.20 billion, down $373.0 million or 23.7% during the quarter.Cash generated from operations was $214.4 million, with Maxim spending around $48.9 million on capex. Maxim has $503.6 million of long-term debt.Maxim authorized a new share repurchase program worth $1 billion and increased cash dividend by 8% to $0.26 per share. Maxim spent $69.5 million on cash dividends and $193.2 million on share repurchasesFor the first quarter of fiscal 2014, Maxim expects revenues in a range of $570-$600 million. Backlog is expected to be $357 million.Gross margin is expected be in the 59%-62% range on a GAAP basis and 60%-63% on an adjusted basis.Earnings are expected to be 34 cents - 38 cents on a GAAP basis and 37 cents - 41 cents on an adjusted basis.Maxim's business is well-diversified. It has increased its focus on the faster-growing consumer and computing end markets. While consumer is showing signs of strength, there are issues in the computing business that may hurt its results in the near term.However, Maxim has outperformed the broader market owing to its superior technology and innovation, which leads to continued design wins not just in the U.S. but also in emerging markets.While Maxim's product line and pipeline of new products remain solid and its end-market diversity commendable, we believe its exposure to the consumer and computing markets increases risks.Currently, Maxim's shares carry a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Last quarter, it posted a 7% positive surprise. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Despite posting a year-over-year increase in the top line, primarily boosted by consumer and computing end markets; higher costs and the resultant contraction in margins kept the lid on earnings.However, management is positive about the automotive end market as it clinched several design wins in the last quarter. Steady growth in distributor design registrations also boosted revenues. Maxim also witnessed stronger demand for its femtocell offerings.Further, Maxim started shipping for Samsung's flagship device, S4. It also expanded its product portfolio to sensors, motion control and other areas of smartphones, tablets and hybrid devices, which will increase its dollar content per device.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter stands at 47 cents per share while that for fiscal 2013 stands at $1.80.Maxim has surpassed estimates in the trailing four quarters, which resulted in an average positive surprise of 8.57%. We believe that Maxim has the potential to beat expectations in the upcoming quarter as well.The last 30 days saw no estimate revisions for both the fourth quarter and fiscal 2013. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimates for both periods have remained unchanged.The chances of a big surprise are unlikely given the lack of catalysts during the quarter.

Makers of chip manufacturing equipment have advanced even more sharply. Chip designers -- the so-called fabless chip group -- have marshaled a much less impressive gain.Robust smartphone and tablet computer sales are expected to help push chip sales into a positive growth mode this year following a year-to-year decline in 2012, says Michael Palma, research manager for market tracker IDC.\"We are going into a better market environment, it's a better economy,\" he said. \"There is going to be an increase in consumer spending and a better end market will help a wide array of providers.\"This year, the chip sector is also expected to see a mix of capital investment, increased research and development spending and even some change in business models as firms fight for share in a fast-moving and increasingly competitive market.Among the 44 companies in IBD's Electronic-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group, about half trade above $10 a share. Only about one quarter of the group have market capitalizations of more than $5 billion.But size doesn't necessarily equate to profit. The six chip companies with EPS Ratings of 90 or better have market capitalizations of $8.7 billion or less. The largest players in the group includeIntel (  ), with a market cap of $120.3 billion andTaiwan Semiconductor (  ), weighing in at $98.3 billion.The most profitable players includeMagnaChip Semiconductor (  ),Maxim Integrated Products (  ) andCree (  ).MagnaChip showed EPS growth of 76%, 196% and 212% as earnings rebounded in its last three quarters. Maxim climbed from 2% to 24% and 36% in the same period while Cree jumped from 8% to 28% and 70% over the last three quarters.The players don't compete with one another, but tend to dominate their niche markets. One key to success in the chip business is offering a best-in-class technology in a competitive market, says Samuel Wang, an analyst for Gartner, a research firm.\"If you identify a special market and you are really good at it you can grow very fast,\" he said.MagnaChip owns more than 3,000 patents on chips generally targeted to commodity based, high-volume markets. It also operates a foundry that fabricates chips for other companies. Maxim makes analog chips that power a wide array of sensors and controls. Cree's line of LED chips are used for everything from TV backlight illumination to street lights.All three companies have seen profits rebound in the past three quarters following a series of declines. Cree has six quarters of solid sales growth under its belt. MagnaChip has seen some recovery in revenue growth in the past three quarters, while Maxim's sales have posted a much more modest rebound.Chips have become central components in everything from cars to consumer electronics. The health of the semiconductor industry is largely dictated by demand for such products.Global sales of semiconductors are expected to rise between 3% and 4% this year from $295 billion last year. Chip sales declined 2.2% in 2012, according to a May 22 report from IDC.In March, Gartner predicted that global chip sales would grow this year to $312 billion, up 4.5% from last year and reach $382 billion in 2017.Even with declines in sales, PCs still account for the highest percentage of chip sales. Though smaller, sales of chips designated for smartphones and tablets are growing fast.Global shipments of smartphones are expected to rise 33% this year to 932 million vs. 700 million last year. Similarly, worldwide shipments of tablets are expected to jump 32% to 225 million vs. 171 million last year, says Strategy Analytics, a research firm.Demand from consumers and companies for better and faster devices capable of handling new technologies should drive more growth, says Wang.\"Human's desire for faster speed, faster communication and more power to serve their data use is endless -- companies want to make better products, better cars, so all of those require better chips,\" he said.Climbing chip sales also help boost the fortunes of companies that provide foundry and assembly services.By 2017 global revenues from chip foundry companies -- those that manufacture chips as an outsourced service -- will reach $47 billion, up 27.3% from an expected $36.9 billion this year, says Gartner. Worldwide revenue from semiconductor assembly and test services will reach $35.3 billion, up 36.8% from an expected $25.8 billion this year, Gartner says.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (  ), the world's leading foundry, grew revenue by 19% last year. A similar performance is likely this year, says Wang.\"That was tremendous growth and this year we think they can double-digit growth again -- their growth was mainly driven by the fast rise of chips in mobile devices,\" he said.But the chips are not up for all players.Intel (  ), a multibillion-dollar gorilla in the chip market, has been stung by the declining PC market. Company revenues were flat last year and have declined in the last three quarters.\"Intel is very challenged,\" said IDC's Palma. \"They have a very weak outlook in the PC market and they are trying to expand into phones and tablets.\"With profits and revenues in decline since 2011,Texas Instruments (TXN) exited the smartphone and tablet market on Jan. 1 to focus on its core analog and embedded processors used in automotive, industrial equipment and enterprise communications.Many venture funds are avoiding chips. In Q1 venture investments in chip companies fell 41.5% to $132.6 million vs. the year-earlier quarter, says PricewaterhouseCoopers and the National Venture Capital Association. And funding likely won't approach last year's $936 .9 million, which fell 30% from 2011, says Tracy Lefteroff, global managing partner of PWC's venture capital practice.\"They are capital intensive (deals) and they take a long time to put together -- it's not like a plug and play Internet-related company that you can get up and running in a couple of months,\" he said.The chip industry revolves around rapid technical advances. Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung all recently announced capital spending plans for 2013 with one clear goal, says Andy Ng, an analyst for Morningstar, in a May 20 report.\"(They) are making significant investments this year for strategic purposes, aiming to expand capabilities in the most advanced semiconductor fabrication technologies,\" he wrote.Progress in the chip business depends on continual R&D investments. About 50% is software. Size is a concern but not the only one, IDC's Palma.\"It's about speed and having a design that works at a tiny scale; that is crucial and expensive,\" he said.Investments come at a price. One example is MagnaChip. Company EPS is expected to shift from growth of nearly 23% in Q2 to year-to-year declines of 7.4% in Q3 and 14% in Q4 as its R&D spending increases, says Suji De Silva, an analyst for Topeka Capital Markets.\"They have made some acquisitions and they are investing in some areas that we think will bear fruit and that is hurting the year-over-year EPS,\" he said.The chip market is dictated by factors ranging from consumer spending, the macro economy and changes in technology.\u0095  Demand for chips is expected to rise this year. Smartphone and tablet sales are a primary driver. But so is speed and performance, says Gartner's Wang.\"You want to store your data in the cloud, store more photos on your computer or your iPhone or take more photos with higher resolution or get a higher definition HDTV with better resolution -- the appetite for those better features is endless,\" he said.\u0095  In the past, the industry has been cyclical largely due to oversupply issues. It's likely to happen again, Wang says. \"You can never manufacture chips perfectly matching what is required by manufacturers and consumers,\" he said. \"You can only estimate how many TVs you are going to sell this summer.\"Some chip companies rely on only a few customers for a large amount of their revenue. Intel's three largest customers accounted for 38% of its revenue in Q1 whileSanDisk 's (SNDK) 10 largest customers comprised 49% of its revenue in the March quarter.The demand for speed and performance also supercharges competition. Not all companies will win, says IDC's Palma.\"Winners are the ones that are able to execute on unique value proposition, so sometimes it's about being in tablet or having a strong position in automotive,\" he said. \"If you can't differentiate yourself, this is a very brutal market to be in.\"The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  , or TI) reported second-quarter earnings that were up sequentially but down year over year. Earnings fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents by 4 cents or 9.7%. Investors clearly reacted to the GAAP numbers, which included one-time gains of 16 cents. As a result, shares appreciated 1.95% following the announcement.TI reported revenue of $3.05 billion, which was up 5.6% sequentially and down 8.6% year over year (in the middle of the recently narrowed guidance range of $2.99 billion to $3.11 billion).With lead times remaining very low (mostly at 6 weeks), visibility remains low. However, distributor inventories remain lean, so TI is largely shipping to consumption. Internal inventories increased only slightly, which is not a concern given the growing backlog.TI changed the segment reporting structure in the fourth quarter, with the wireless segment being dissolved and relevant portions being included in the remaining segments. TI provided pro forma numbers for historical periods to enable suitable comparison.Accordingly, the  business grew 5.9% sequentially while declining 3.1% year over year. TI attributed the sequential increase to a resurgent SVA (both industrial and automotive), which the company stated was already taking market share, ahead of plan. Both HVAL and HPA also contributed to the sequential increase. Power management was a dampener, as timing-related weakness at certain handset and gaming customers offset strength in other areas.The  segment, which now includes the processor, microcontroller and connectivity product lines grew 10.2% sequentially and 6.6% from last year. Processors were the strongest product line in the last quarter, although microcontrollers and connectivity products also grew.The  segment, which now includes DLPs, custom ASICs, calculators, royalties and some legacy wireless products was up 1.2% sequentially and down 28.4% year over year. The legacy wireless business was a drag, offsetting the growth in all other segments.Net product orders were $3.14 billion in the last quarter, up 6.0% sequentially and down 8.0% year over year. Backlog increased nicely for the second straight quarter, with turns sales increasing by over 4%. TI currently generates around 50% of its revenue from the consignment model, which is having a positive impact on turns sales.TI's gross margin of 51.5% was up 390 bps sequentially and 202 bps from the year-ago quarter. Two factors are contributing to the improving gross margins at TI. The first is the improving leverage from its low-cost manufacturing capacity, as production is increased.The second is the improving mix, as low-margin wireless becomes a smaller percentage of TI's total revenue. These factors are driving the gross margin toward the long-term target of 55%.Operating expenses of $860 million were down 2.1% sequentially. The operating margin was 23.3%, up 611 bps sequentially and 186 bps from the year-ago quarter. All expenses declined sequentially as a perentage of sales although cost of sales declined the most, followed by R&D and then SG&A. Cost of sales was also the main reason for the increase from last year, since lower R&D was more than offset by higher SG&A.The Analog, Embedded Processing and Other segments generated operating margins of 23.8% (up 564 bps sequentially), 8.7% (up 749 bps) and 63.7% (up more than 50 percentage points), respectively.The pro forma net income was $513 million, or a 16.8% net income margin compared to $398 million, or 13.8% in the previous quarter and $536 million, or 16.1% in the year-ago quarter. The fully diluted pro forma earnings per share were 42 cents compared to 35 cents in the previous quarter and 46 cents in the Jun quarter of last year. The pro forma calculations for the last quarter exclude the impact of restructuring gains and acquisition-related charges, as well as tax adjustments.On a GAAP basis, the company recorded a net profit of $660 million, or 59 cents a share compared to a net profit of $362 million, or 32 cents per share in the previous quarter and a net profit of $446 million (39 cents per share) in the comparable prior-year quarter.Inventories were up 1.2% to $1.72 billion, which resulted in inventory turns of 3.4X, down slightly from 3.6X in the previous quarter. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) went up from 42 to around 45. TI generated $674 million in cash from operations, spending $97 million on capex, $721 million on share repurchases and $309 million on cash dividends.At quarter-end, TI had $4.17 billion in long-term debt and $1.00 billion in short-term debt. During the quarter, the net debt position moved up slightly. It also had underfunded retirement plans of $134 million.TI provided guidance for the third quarter and updated its limited estimates for fiscal year 2013.Accordingly, TI expects third quarter revenue to come in between $3.09 billion and $3.35 billion (up 5.7% sequentially at the mid-point), which is a shade better than the consensus estimate of $3.20 billion. Legacy wireless products are expected to decline by around $90 million sequentially. The rest of the business is expected to be up 9%.The EPS for the quarter is expected to be 49 to 57 cents, the mid-point being slightly lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents.For 2013, TI expects R&D expenses of 1.5 billion (unchanged), capex of 0.5 billion (unchanged), depreciation of $0.9 billion (unchanged) and an annual effective tax rate of 24% (up from previous guidance of 22%).Texas Instruments is prudently investing its R&D dollars into several high-margin, high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets. This is gradually increasing its exposure to the industrial and automotive markets, while reducing its exposure to the volatile consumer/computing markets. In the last quarter, TI's SVA business saw notable strength, so the strategy is likely paying off.The last few years have also seen other analog companies, such as  (  ) and  (  ) increasing focus on industrial and automotive markets. These markets have better secular drivers (energy efficiency in industrial and increasing electronic content in automotive). They also generate higher margins.Therefore, this strategy along with higher utilization rates may enable the company to move closer to its long-term margin targets. For TI, the turnaround in the communications infrastructure market is an added positive that should contribute to its top and bottom lines this year.We therefore remain optimistic about TI's compelling product line, the increased differentiation in its business and lower-cost 300mm capacity that should in combination drive earnings.However, unlike analog peers such as Microchip Technology, Intersil and  (  ), its declining wireless business is likely to be a drag on TI. Therefore, TI shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while most of its analog peers have a more favorable rank.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["o the  (INDEXSP:.INX) decided to upgrade US debt on Monday.

The company determines on the record date, which usually occurs two days after the ex-dividend date, which shareholders qualify for the dividend. Shareholders listed as holders of record after the record date then receive their dividend on the date of payment established by the company. Those purchasing right before the record date forfeit the dividend and normally get the stock for a reduced amount.It  may seem an anachronism in this era of high frequency trading, but the dividend rate rules are in force since it can still take up to three business days for transactions to be credited to and settled in an investor's account.Below are five stocks that schedule May 20 as their ex-dividend date.

Intellectual Property revenues were down 40.4% sequentially and 34.3% year over year.The broadening of its relationship with Hynix (an 8-year contract) should help revenues in the future. Tessera has had problems with its largest licensees:  (  ), Powertech and SK Hynix that have impacted its revenues over the past year.Tessera has come out winner in some cases, for instance, the $1.5 million it recovered in past production payments in the last quarter. Notably, the company recovered $24.7 million in past production payments in the Dec quarter, which was the main reason for the sequential decline. Excluding these amounts in both periods, core revenue was up 3.8% sequentially.Tessera is also developing other licensable technology beyond the traditional packaging area that should translate to additional revenues going forward.The Digital Optics line declined 46.3% sequentially and 28.2% from last year. The sequential decline was due to reduced focus on fixed camera module sales as management shifts focus to core MEMS products.The GAAP gross margin was 74.5%, down 249 basis points (bps) sequentially and 1,318 bps from a year ago. A high gross margin is typical for a technology company that is largely dependent on the licensing model.Tessera's quarterly operating expenses were $87.7 million, up 30.7% from $67.1 million reported in the previous quarter and 70.1% from $51.5 million in the year-ago quarter. The operating margin shrank 18,450 bps to -207.3%, impacted by much higher research and development (R&D) and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses (as a percentage of sales). Litigation charges have also jumped up and were more than 4X the amount in the year-ago quarter.Tessera's pro forma net loss was $21.4 million or 68.9% of revenues compared to loss of $15.4 million or 28.9% of revenues in the Dec 2012 quarter and loss of $3.3 million or 7.0% of revenues in the Mar quarter of 2012. Our pro forma calculation excludes restructuring charges and intangibles amortization charges on a tax-adjusted basis but includes stock-based compensation. The pro forma estimates may not match management's presentation due to the inclusion/exclusion of some items that were not considered by management.Net loss on a GAAP basis was $44.6 million ($0.85 per share) compared to net loss of $19.6 million ($0.38 per share) in the Mar 2012 and $8.1 million ($0.16 per share) in the Dec quarter of 2012.Tessera's balance sheet remains strong, despite the $39.9 million reduction in cash and short-term investments to $402.7 million. It has no debt.Inventories were down 32.8% during the quarter, with turns going from 32.5X to 31.4X. DSOs went from 20 to around 15. Capital expenditure in the quarter was $68.1 million, down from the fourth quarter capex of $72.5 millionManagement declared a cash dividend of 10 cents per share for the second quarter payable on Jun 13, 2013 to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 23, 2013.For the second quarter of 2013, Tessera expects revenues in the range of $42 million-$50 million. Intellectual Property revenues are expected in the range $38-$45 million whereas Digital Optics revenues are expected in the range of $4-$5 million. GAAP operating expense is expected between $77- $81 million. GAAP loss per share is forecasted to be in the range of 40-45% with tax rate of 30%.Tessera remains a company with good intellectual property, which it has protected with great difficulty. However, management is keen on shifting to a lower-margin but safer product-oriented model involving camera modules for mobile devices.We believe the company is on the right track as this could reduce if not eliminate the significant litigation expenses it has been incurring. The fact that the target market is fast-growing is an added bonus. We are encouraged by the fact that Samsung is licensing Tessera's unique software technology for face recognition.

Revenues were within management's guidance range of $580-$610 million.The  end market remained the largest revenue contributor, accounting for approximately 49% of total revenue, up 6.4% sequentially and 26.6% year over year. Maxim witnessed strong growth due to strength in smartphones, as it started shipping to its largest customer, Samsung for its S4 smartphone model.Maxim is expanding its product portfolio to sensors, motion control and other areas of smartphones, tablets and hybrid devices, which will increase its dollar content per device. , the second largest segment generated 25.0% of revenues, flat sequentially but down 1.9% year over year. In the last quarter, Maxim benefited from strength in the automotive end market and a slight increase in general purpose industrial categories, which were however offset by weakness in other areas.Currently, Maxim is focusing on ASSP solutions as it provides highly integrated products in select end market segments such as automotive, smart meters and medical. It is also trying to strengthen its position in the general purpose market by providing high-performance analog building block products. However, this segment is affected by macroeconomic variables.Revenues from the  end market were down 6.7% sequentially and 12.8% year over year to 14.0% of total revenue. The sequential decline was the result of continued softness in the Networking and Datacom segment. Maxim is witnessing strength in sales in cable infrastructure products. It expects that revenues from the Networking and Datacom segment will improve in the coming quarters.Maxim is focusing on delivering next-generation networks with improved coverage, capacity and reduced power consumption. Further, management expects the introduction of highly integrated solutions across its broad range of technologies to help drive network performance going forward.Revenues from the  business fell 14.3% sequentially and 15.3% year over year and contributed 12.0% of revenues. The weakness was due to the decline in notebook sales.The GAAP gross margin was 62.2%, up 215 basis points (bps) sequentially and 346 bps year over year. Management stated that the improvement in the gross margin was related to higher factory utilization, lower reserves and lower one-time items.GAAP operating expenses of $221.8 million were down 9.8% sequentially and 0.8% from the year-ago quarter. Sequentially, lower research and development (R&D) expenses as a percentage of sales as well as lower restructuring and asset impairment charges positively impacted the gross margin, offsetting the rise in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses (as a percentage of sales). As a result, the GAAP operating margin increased 609 bps sequentially and 592 bps from the year-ago quarter to 25.5%.Pro forma net income was $134.6 million or a 22.3% net income margin compared with $124.8 million or 20.6% in the previous quarter and $99.5 million or 17.4% of sales in the year-ago quarter. Our pro forma calculation excludes restructuring, intangibles amortization, asset impairments and other one-time charges on a tax-adjusted basis, but includes stock-based compensation charges in the last quarter.Including these items, the company recorded GAAP net income of $128.8 million or 43 cents per share compared with $76.6 million or 26 cents per share in the previous quarter and $22.7 million or 8 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.Inventories were up 4.0% to $268.0 million. The cash and marketable securities balance was $1.57 billion, up $542.8 million or 52.7% during the quarter.Cash generated from operations was $211.7 million, with Maxim spending around $54.9 million on capex, $70.4 million on cash dividends and $66.3 million on share repurchases. Maxim has $503.6 million of long-term debt.For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, Maxim expects revenues in a range of $610-$640 million. Backlog is expected to be $386 million.On a GAAP basis, gross margin is expected be in the 61-64% range.Earnings are expected to be 45 cents - 49 cents on a GAAP basis.Maxim's business is well-diversified. It has increased its focus on the faster-growing consumer and computing end markets. While consumer is showing signs of strength, there are issues in the computing business that may hurt its results in the near term.However, Maxim has outperformed the broader market owing to its superior technology and innovation, which leads to continued design wins not just in the U.S. but also in emerging countries.While Maxim's product line and pipeline of new products remain solid and its end-market diversity commendable, we believe its exposure to the consumer and computing markets increases risks.Maxim's shares currently carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Investors could also consider some other stocks that are slated to report this earnings season with positive Zacks Rank and Expected Surprise Prediction or ESP (Read:  ).

More importantly, earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents by 4 cents or 14.3%. Investors were upbeat about TI's results, so shares remained buoyant during the day and appreciated an additional 1.7% in extended trading.TI reported revenue of $2.89 billion, which was down 3.2% sequentially and 7.6% year over year (slightly better than the mid-point of the recently narrowed guidance range of $2.80 billion to $2.91 billion).With lead times remaining very low (they dropped to 6 weeks going into the second half of 2012), visibility remains low. Additionally, inventories remain lean at all customers and particularly at distributors, which further reduced inventories during the quarter.TI changed the segment reporting structure in the last quarter, with the wireless segment being dissolved and relevant portions being included in the remaining segments.The  business fell 1.3% sequentially and 2.3% year over year. TI attributed the year-over-year decline primarily to SVA, which continues to shift to a consignment model. HVAL and HPA also declined and were offset by increase in the power management product line. HVAL and power management product lines negatively impacted the sequential performance.The  segment, which now includes the processor, microcontroller and connectivity product lines grew 2.7% sequentially and 3.9% from last year. The year-over-year increase was driven by microcontrollers and connectivity products supported by flattish processor sales. Microcontrollers also increased on a sequential basis.The  segment, which now includes DLPs, custom ASICs, calculators, royalties and some legacy wireless products was down 11.5% sequentially and 24.5% year over year. All except DLP products and royalties declined from the year-ago quarter. Insurance proceeds received in the year-ago quarter also made comps difficult.The sequential decline was driven by legacy wireless, custom ASIC and royalties as offset by increase in calculator revenue and consistent DLP revenue. The legacy wireless products target the volatile smartphone and tablet markets and are being phased out by TI. Therefore they were responsible for much of the decline in segment revenue from both the previous and year-ago quarters.Net product orders were $2.96 billion in the last quarter, up 8.8% sequentially and down 8.6% year over year. We estimate that backlog increased sequentially, with turns sales increasing by around 9%. TI currently generates around 45% of its revenue from the consignment model, which is having a positive impact on turns sales.TI's gross margin of 47.6% was down 88 bps sequentially and 210 bps from the year-ago quarter. The gross margin was the net result of weak revenue and low utilization rates. In addition, year-over-year comps were difficult because of insurance proceeds received in that quarter. The gross margin remains well below the long-term target of 55%.Operating expenses of $878 million were higher than the previous quarter's $855 million. The operating margin was 17.2%, down 261 bps sequentially and 142 bps from the year-ago quarter. All expenses increased sequentially as a perentage of sales. However, the decline from the year-ago quarter was mainly because of the lower gross margin, as the decline in R&D more than offset the increase in SG&A.The Analog, Embedded Processing and Other segments generated operating margins of 18.2% (down 690 bps sequentially), 1.2% (down 77 bps) and 13.0% (up more than 51 percentage points), respectively.The pro forma net income was $398 million, or a 13.8% net income margin compared to $417 million, or 14.0% in the previous quarter and $400 million, or 12.8% in the year-ago quarter. The fully diluted pro forma earnings per share were 35 cents compared to 37 cents in the previous quarter and 34 cents in the Mar quarter of last year. The pro forma calculations for the last quarter exclude the impact of restructuring and acquisition-related charges, as well as discrete tax items.On a GAAP basis, the company recorded a net profit of $362 million, or 32 cents a share compared to a net profit of $264 million, or 23 cents per share in the previous quarter and a net profit of $265 million (23 cents per share) in the comparable prior-year quarter.Inventories dropped 3.2% to $1.70 billion, which resulted in inventory turns of 3.6X, up slightly from 3.5X in the previous quarter. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) went up from 38 to around 42. TI generated $360 million in cash from operations, spending $84 million on capex, $679 million on share repurchases and $232 million on cash dividends.At quarter-end, TI had $4.2 billion in long-term debt and $1.5 billion in short-term debt. During the quarter, the net debt position moved up slightly. It also had underfunded retirement plans of $196 million.TI provided guidance for the second quarter and provided some limited estimates for fiscal year 2013.Accordingly, TI expects first quarter revenue to come in between $2.93 billion and $3.17 billion (down 5.7% sequentially at the mid-point), which is more or less in line with the consensus estimate of $3.04 billion. Legacy wireless products are expected to decline by around $60 million, or 30% sequentially. The rest of the business is expected to be up 8.5% (in line with normal seasonality.The EPS for the quarter is expected to be 37 to 45 cents, below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents.For 2013, TI expects R&D expenses of 1.5 billion, capex of 0.5 billion, depreciation of $0.9 billion and an annual effective tax rate of 22%.Texas Instruments is prudently investing its R&D dollars into several high-margin, high-growth areas of the analog and embedded processing markets. This is gradually increasing its exposure to the industrial and automotive markets, while reducing its exposure to the volatile consumer/computing markets.The last few years have also seen other analog companies, such as  (  ) and  (  ) increasing focus on these areas. These markets have better secular drivers (energy efficiency in industrial and increasing electronic content in automotive). They also generate higher margins. Therefore, this strategy along with higher utilization rates may enable the company to move closer to its long-term margin targets.We therefore remain optimistic about TI's compelling product line, the increased differentiation in its business and lower-cost 300mm capacity that should in combination drive earnings in the longer term.However, while improved growth prospects are driving results for analog peers such as  (  ) and Maxim, TI is going through a transition where its declining wireless revenue and extra capacity are likely to restrict earnings growth. TI shares therefore carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while most of its peers have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) is set to report third quarter 2013 results on Apr 25. Last quarter it posted a 2% positive surprise. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Despite posting a year-over-year increase in the top line, primarily boosted by consumer and computing end markets; higher costs and resultant contraction in margins kept the lid on the company's earnings.However, management is positive about the automotive end market as it won several design wins in the last quarter. Steady growth in distributor design registrations also boosted revenues. Maxim also witnessed stronger demand for its femtocell offerings.Maxim believes that its partnership with Avnet may result in new opportunities in industrial markets.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Maxim is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP (Read:  ) and a Zacks Rank #1, #2 or #3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. The Most Accurate estimate stands at 41 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at 42 cents. That is a difference of -2.38%. Maxim's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) when combined with a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and #5 (Sell rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: (  ), Earnings ESP of +300.0% and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) (  ), Earning ESP of +62.5% and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) (  ), Earnings ESP of +100.0% and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ith the continued rise in the use of electronic devices and smart phones, product designers these days are facing challenges to incorporate advanced features in the handsets that are driven by high-capacity batteries.

The revenues were within management's guidance range of $595-$625 million.The  end market remained the largest revenue contributor, accounting for approximately 46% of total revenue, down 4.9% sequentially. The 4.9% sequential decline in revenue was driven by weakness across product lines. However, the main reason was Samsung working down mobile phone-related inventories, a situation that should reverse in the current quarter. Home entertainment and appliances, which are a smaller part of Maxim's segment revenues also continued to decline in the last quarter.Maxim is expanding its product portfolio to sensors, motion control and other areas of smartphones, tablets and hybrid devices, which will increase its dollar content per device. , the second largest segment, generated 25.0% of revenues, up 1.2% sequentially. In the last quarter, Maxim benefited from strength in medical and smart meter markets that offset the weakness in its general purpose products. Better internal lead times also helped shipments in the last quarter.The industrial automation & control segment remains weak mainly because of distributors reducing inventories during the quarter. The weakness is likely to continue, given macroeconomic trends.Revenues from the  end market were down 2.9% sequentially to 15.0% of total revenue. The sequential decline was the result of continued softness in the traditional telecom business as offset by strength in the femtocell market.

The weakness was due to the decline in notebook sales.The GAAP gross margin was 60.0%, down 187 basis points (bps) sequentially but up 119 bps year over year. Management stated that the sequential contraction in the gross margin was related to lower utilization rates.GAAP operating expenses of $245.8 million were up 11.6% sequentially and 5.3% from the year-ago quarter. Higher R&D as a percentage of sales, as well as higher restructuring and asset impairment charges added to the lower gross margin, offsetting the decline in SG&A (as a percentage of sales). As a result, the GAAP operating margin declined 713 bps. although it was still 6 bps up from the year-ago quarter. All expenses declined year over year as a percentage of sales.The pro forma net income was $124.8 million or a 20.6% net income margin compared with $139.1 million or 22.3% in the previous quarter and $100.7 million or 17.0% of sales in the year-ago quarter. Our pro forma calculation excludes restructuring, intangibles amortization, asset impairments and other one-time charges on a tax-adjusted basis, but includes stock based compensation charges in the last quarter.Including these items, the company recorded GAAP net income of $76.6 million or $0.26 per share compared with $127.9 million or $0.43 per share in the previous quarter and $88.1 million or $0.29 per share in the year-ago quarter.Inventories were down 0.4% to $257.7 million.

The company currently generates a significant percentage of its revenues from the consumer and computing end markets. While consumer is showing signs of strength, there are issues in the computing business that may hurt its results in the near term.However, Maxim has outperformed the broader market owing to its superior technology and innovation, which leads to continued design wins not just in the U.S. but also in emerging countries.While Maxim's product line and pipeline of new products remain solid and its end-market diversity is commendable, we believe its exposure to the consumer and computing markets increases risks.Maxim's shares currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors should look out for some other stocks that are slated to report this earnings season with positive Zacks Rank and Expected Surprise Prediction or ESP (Read:  ).

Consequently, the increased dividend will be paid on December 28, 2012 to stockholders of record as of December 17, 2012.The 4% increase in dividend is encouraging and should support share prices in the sluggish market.

This enhances the battery life, which is critical for applications in energy-saving and battery-powered wireless sensor networks. This will also help the designing of wireless sensor applications.Short-range wireless applications are required in environmental monitoring, industrial building automation and security, access control, structural health and tank level monitoring, among others. Previously, AA batteries were used to run these power-hungry applications, which were not only rather expensive but also had a low shelf life.In the modern era, power consumption is a major issue. Natural resources such as coal and crude oil are all depleting at an accelerated rate. Hence, power saving is the need of the hour and the requirement for power management devices is soaring.Microsemi's ZL70250 addresses the need for power efficiency in short-range wireless applications, which is critical for day-to-day operations in modern industries.According to research conducted by GBI Research, sales of power management integrated circuits (ICs) may grow at a CAGR of 6.7% to reach $22.7 billion by 2016.

However, operating margins shrunk 43 basis points (bps) sequentially due to special charges related to restructuring activity.Management expects fourth quarter revenue between $685 million and $715 million (a 0-5% sequential increase), gross margin of 65%, operating expenses of around $231 million and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of 54 to 60 cents.(Detailed third quarter earnings results can be viewed in the blog titled: Out of the 20 analysts providing estimates for the fourth quarter, 2 analysts made downward revisions while 1 out of 22 analysts providing estimates for fiscal 2012 made a downward revision in the last 30 days.The majority of analysts expect fourth quarter revenue/earnings to come in below Street consensus estimate due to a weak overall demand environment. They expect poor demand particularly in the Industrial and Communications end markets, which together comprise roughly 67% of Analog's total revenue.They also expect a weak first quarter guidance due to the sluggish macro environment and tight inventory management.However, a few analysts believe that share gains in its Automotive and Consumer segments could help to mitigate the decline.

The three product lines generated 44%, 27% and 14% of quarterly revenue, respectively.Power management and reference products remained at roughly 7% of revenue, down 1.4% and 17.3% from the previous and year-ago quarters, respectively. These products are generally sold in the consumer market. Management has refocused the business over the last few years to concentrate on this fast-growing product line.DSPs (9% of total revenue) were down 2.6% sequentially and 4.4% year over year.Analog Devices generated a pro forma gross margin of 65.6%, up 33 basis points (bps) sequentially, down 167 bps year over year and short of management's guidance of a 50 bp sequential increase. The sequential improvement was on account of slightly better utilization rates. The decline from the year-ago quarter was mainly on account of significantly lower volumes. Mix was relatively neutral to both the sequential and year-over-year comparisons.Operating expenses of $235.4 million were up 3.5% sequentially and 2.0% from the July quarter of 2011. Special charges related to restructuring activity were $5.8 million in the last quarter, which was the main reason for the operating margin shrinking 43 bps sequentially and 568 bps year over year to 31.1%.The pro forma net income was $169.8 million, or a 24.9% net income margin compared to $162.9 million or 24.1% in the previous quarter and $219.9 million or a 29.0% in the year-ago quarter. The fully diluted pro forma earnings per share were 56 cents, compared to 53 cents in the previous quarter and 71 cents in the July quarter of last year.Since there were no one-time items in any of the quarters, the GAAP and non GAAP net income and EPS were the same.Inventories increased 2.7% to $345.8 million, with annualized inventory turns dropping sequentially from 3.1X to 3.0X. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) inched up to 46. Cash generated from operations was around $137.7 million. Analog Devices spent $39.2 million on capex, $89.5 million on cash dividends and $17.3 million on share repurchases in the last quarter.Management expects fourth quarter revenue of $685 million to $715 million (a 0-5% sequential increase) with the gross margin of 65%, operating expenses of around $231 million and diluted EPS of 54 cents to 60 cents. Analysts polled by Zacks expected earnings of 60 cents per share when Analog Devices reported, at the high end of the guided range.Given improving order trends toward the end of the quarter and historic low lead times, Analog Devices expects most end markets to turn around in the current quarter. Channel inventories also appear lean, meaning that the company is shipping to consumption.Despite the positive commentary, guidance was again below our expectations likely reflecting conservatism. Particularly so, since Analog's end markets appear to be looking up. Nevertheless, we expect some fine-tuning of estimates, which should keep the company a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold rating over the next 1-3 months).We note that other analog peers, such as  (  ) and  (  ) are also ranked #3 (short-term Hold).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) fourth quarter earnings excluding special items and including stock based compensation expenses beat the Zacks Consensus by 6 cents.Fourth quarter revenue of $605.0 million was up 5.9% sequentially, down 3.4% year over year and exactly in line with management's guidance range of $590-620 million, or up 3.3% to 8.5% sequentially. En market performance was mixed in the last quarter.The  end market remained the largest, with a quarterly revenue contribution of around 43%, up 11.1% sequentially and 15.3% year over year. The strong performance in the last quarter was because of the production ramp of Samsung's Galaxy S3 smartphone, which uses Maxim's power SoC chipset. Samsung has emerged as the leading smartphone maker in the U.S., surpassing  (  ). Therefore, Maxim's relationship with Samsung is a big positive.Maxim stated that it continued to see strong demand in its consumer business (not just smartphones, but also tablets) on account of the buildup for the holiday season. Overall, opportunities continue to unfold in the smartphone, tablet and other markets. Maxim is now focusing on more integrated solutions, which are expected to gain momentum this year. , the second largest segment, generated 26% of revenue, which was up 2.0% sequentially and down 10.3% from the year-ago quarter. The sequential improvement was in the automotive and control & automation segments.Management sees continued demand for its solutions for the power meter (particularly in China) and automotive segments. Automotive revenue is also expected to increase because of production ramps at some customers (growth in automotive infotainment is the primary driver here). The industrial automation & control segment remains weak mainly because of distributors cutting inventories during the quarter.Revenue from the  end market was down 0.3% sequentially and 18.7% year over year to 16% of total revenue. The sequential performance was the result of growth in base stations that was more than offset by softness in the legacy business.Since base station demand is returning to normal, there will be no spike in the following quarter. Management expects continued growth in the networking segment with core communications remaining soft.Despite the broad-based weakness in the market, Maxim's  business grew 5.9% sequentially, with the revenue contribution remaining stable at 15%. However, revenue was down 14.8% from last year.Going forward, Maxim continues to see strong demand in the financial terminals segment, which will, however, be offset by weakness in notebooks and peripherals. China remains a strength for Maxim.Management does not provide specific information on orders, as shifts in customer vendor managed inventory programs distort quarter-to-quarter comparisons.We estimate that orders were up low-single-digits in the last quarter, leading to a slight increase in backlog. The book-to-bill remained above unity. Turns sales were up slightly in the last quarter, while backlog sales also increasing. Supply chain activities improved, with Maxim's delivery lead times continuing to decline. Internal inventories jumped, however, as there were some builds for the upcoming holiday season.The pro forma gross margin was 63.0%, up 261 basis points (bps) sequentially and down 61 bps year over year. Management stated that the stronger gross margin was related to higher utilization rates.Operating expenses of $214.0 million were flat sequentially and up 1.4% from the year-ago quarter. This contributed to the 471 bp sequential expansion in the operating margin. However, it was still 229 bps down from the year-ago quarter. All expenses declined from sequentially as a percentage of sales, with cost of sales declining the most, followed by R&D and SG&A coming in almost flat.The pro forma net income was $136.2 million, or a 22.5% net income margin compared to $101.2 million, or 17.7% in the previous quarter and $130.2 million, or 20.8% of sales in the year-ago quarter. Our pro forma calculation excludes restructuring, intangibles amortization, asset impairments and other one-time items on a tax-adjusted basis, but includes stock based compensation charges in the last quarter.Including these items, on a fully diluted GAAP basis, the company recorded net income of $110.6 million ($0.37 per share) compared to $54.5 million ($0.18 per share) in the march 2012 quarter and $124.7 million ($0.41 per share) in the June quarter of 2011.Inventories were up 10.0% to $242.2 million, with inventory turns down from 4.1X to 3.7X. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) went up from around 47 to around 48. The cash and marketable securities balance was $956.4 million, up $20.4 million or 2.2% during the quarter.Cash generated from operations was $190.1 million, with maxim spending around $77 million on PP&E, $2 million on acquisitions, $64 million on cash dividends and $56 million on share repurchases. Maxim has just $5.59 million of long term debt, as most of its debt ($303.5 million) will now have to be paid in the near term. Long-term liabilities were $438.7 million at quarter-end.In the first quarter of fiscal 2013, Maxim expects revenue of $605-635 million (up 0-5% sequentially). The backlog is $393 million, but the guidance calls for higher turns sales, which should be within its capacity.The gross margin is expected be in the 59-62% range on a GAAP basis and 61-64% on an adjusted basis. Mix, utilization and inventory reserves will be variables impacting the gross margin. Operating expenses excluding special items are expected to be up around 3% from June.The tax rate, excluding special items, is expected to be 20-22%. All this will yield earnings of 38-42 cents on a GAAP basis and 41-45 cents on an adjusted basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was 43 cents when the company reported, exactly in line with management's own expectations.Capital expenditure is expected to be down sequentially. Maxim's targeted capital expenditures remain 5-7% of revenue.Maxim is a well-diversified business, although it has increased focus on faster-growth markets in the last few years. Therefore, the company currently generates a significant percentage of its revenue from the consumer and computing end markets. While consumer is showing signs of strength, there are issues in the computing business that may be expected to hurt its results in the near term.However, Maxim has done better than the market, because of its superior technology and innovation Therefore, design wins continue, not just in the U.S. but also in emerging countries, such as China.While Maxim's product line remains solid and its end-market diversity is commendable, we think its exposure to the consumer and computing markets increases risks.Maxim shares currently carry a Zacks Rank of #3, implying a Hold rating in the near term.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ne investor is guarding against potential downside in Maxim Integrated Products as the chip maker continues to drift.optionMONSTER's Depth Charge monitoring system detected the purchase of 2,500 February 28 puts for $2.55 and the sale of an equal number of February 31 calls for $0.57.

Low visibility, slow end market demand, weak order trends, European macro concerns, and intensifying competition could be the reasons for downward revisions.Texas Instruments delivered a decent second quarter with pro forma earnings per share of 46 cents, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 cents.The company reported revenue of $3.34 billion, which was up 6.9% sequentially and toward the middle of the recently narrowed guidance range of $3.22-$3.48 billion. The strength in the quarter came from growth in core Analog, led by power management and growth in HVA and Logic.Gross margin was 49.5%, down 22 basis points (bps) sequentially, impacted by lower insurance proceeds. It also declined 199 bps from the year-ago quarter, mainly on account of low utilization rates as well as lower revenue.Estimate revisions for the upcoming quarter indicate declining sentiments, with 22 out of 27 analysts making downward revisions in the last 30 days. Also, for fiscal 2012, 17 out of 22 analysts made downward revisions, with only 1 analyst moving in the opposite direction.The Zacks Consensus Estimate was 48 cents when the company reported its second quarter earnings. Texas Instruments projected third quarter revenue to come in between $3.21 billion and $3.47 billion (flat sequentially at the mid-point), well below the consensus estimate of $3.54 billion. The earnings for the quarter are expected at 34 cents to 42 cents per share.The weak guidance provided by the management made the analysts to lower their estimates which took the Zacks Consensus Estimate to 44 cents. The analysts are also of the opinion that Baseband continues to be a headwind for the Wireless segment, which the company expects to phase out completely by the end of the year.The majority of analysts believe that TI's guidance reflects a broad-based market slowdown, as well as company-specific weakness in wireless. However, they contend that once the end-markets improve, the company will recover soon, given its compelling product line, new design wins and significant gross margin leverage.However, longer term, the analysts believe that TI's analog and embedded businesses will continue to drive growth. They also see potential margin expansion opportunities from the company's cost cutting initiatives along with growth in higher-margin businesses. Additionally, the analysts contend that 300mm RFAB and cost synergies from the NSM acquisition will likely lead to margins and earnings upside going forward.Impact on EstimatesAs the majority of analysts have lowered their estimates over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has fallen 5 cents to 44 cents for the upcoming quarter and 7 cents to $1.69 for fiscal 2012. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate fell 6 cents for the upcoming quarter and 11 cents for fiscal 2012.We remain optimistic about Texas Instruments' compelling product line, the increased differentiation in its business and its lower-cost 300mm capacity. Also, the addition of National Semiconductor strengthens its product line-up and brings on board additional capacity.We also believe that some of the new designs (analog and embedded processing products) getting into volume production should help the gross margin to move up toward its long-term target of 55%.Moreover, in 2011, the company announced the closure of a couple of 6-inch facilities in Hiji, Japan and Houston, Texas, transitioning the remaining products to more advanced facilities. Of the $215 million in charges, $112 million were taken in the fourth quarter of 2011, with the remainder being spread out over the next seven quarters. The restructuring is expected to generate annual savings of $100 million a year.However, we remain concerned about the macro weakness, Texas Instruments' larger exposure to wireless communications infrastructure, and National's huge debt balance, which has negatively impacted the balance sheet.Increasing competition from  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) is also a matter of concern.We, therefore, have a short-term Hold recommendation (Zacks Rank #3) on Texas Instruments' shares.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) reported first quarter 2013 adjusted earnings of 16 cents per share, which was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The adjusted or non-GAAP earnings per share exclude amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, but include stock-based compensation expense. The quarter's earnings dropped 24.7% from the year-ago level.Despite the miss, the company's shares leaped 23%, reflecting positive investor sentiment on the back of strong revenue guidance.Total revenue for the first quarter was $99.0 million, up 7.3% on a year-over-year basis. This was slightly below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $101.0 million, affected by lower sales of  's (  ) iPhone, iMac and iPod. Apple happens to be Cirrus' prime customer, with 62.0% share of 2012 revenues.Segment-wise, Audio Product revenue increased 13.5% year over year to $80.7 million, while Energy product revenue came in at $18.3 million, down 13.6% year over year.Reported gross margin in the quarter was 54.0%, up from 51.7% in the year-ago quarter.Operating margin was 10.6% versus 15.5% in the year-ago quarter. The company's total operating expenses increased 28.8% on a year-over-year basis. Higher operating expenses were mainly due to 32.7% and 23.6% year-over-year increases in research and development (R&D) and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, respectively.Net income on a GAAP basis was $6.9 million or 10 cents per diluted share compared with $9.2 million or 13 cents in the year-ago quarter.Excluding the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets but including stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $10.6 million or 16 cents per diluted share compared with $14.5 million or 21 cents in the year-ago quarter.Cash and short-term investments were $166.7 million versus $181.9 million in the previous quarter. The company has no long-term debt.Management has provided an upbeat outlook for the second quarter. Revenue is expected to be $170.0-$190.0 million, with gross margin in the 52-54% range and total operating expenses of between $49 million and $53 million.Cirrus affirmed that its new products would hit the market very soon, increasing consumer acceptance and boosting its sales. As a part of that effort, the company is heavily investing in R&D, which it believes will soon start paying off.Based on the new launches, higher sales of mobile devices and SSDs (solid state drives) and wins at Apple, Cirrus forecasts solid growth for the rest of fiscal 2013.The Zacks Consensus Estimates for second quarter and fiscal 2013 are pegged at 34 cents and $1.48 per share, respectively.Cirrus posted a weak first quarter with the bottom line matching the Zacks Consensus Estimate and the top line missing the same. Revenues could be better but lower iPhone sales took a toll on the company. But Cirrus provided an upbeat second quarter guidance, which was enough to encourage investors.We are also positive about the strong demand for its analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits for audio products.However, keeping in view Apple's weak third quarter results (announced last week) and uncertainty regarding the ramp of iPhone 5, we believe that the guidance is a bit aggressive.Overdependence on Apple and stiff competition from the likes of  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) leads to a Zacks #4 Rank, implying a short-term Sell rating.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) is scheduled to announce its second-quarter fiscal 2012 results on July 23, 2012, and we notice downward movements in analyst estimates.Texas Instruments delivered a decent first quarter with pro forma earnings per share of 42 cents exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13 cents.The company reported revenue of $3.12 billion, which was down 8.7% sequentially but just over the revised guidance range of $2.99 billion - $3.11 billion. The weakness in other areas was partially offset by a full quarter of National's contribution and a stronger-than-expected wireless business.Texas Instruments' gross margin was 49.7%, up 379 basis points (bps) sequentially, benefitting from the insurance claim received. However, it declined 189 bps from the year-ago quarter, mainly on account of low utilization rates as factory loadings stayed at around 50%.Recently, the company narrowed its revenue and earnings expectations for the second quarter of 2012.The chipmaker now expects sales of $3.28-$3.42 billion versus its previous guidance range of $3.22-$3.48 billion. The earnings outlook has also been narrowed to 32-36 cents per share from the previous guidance of 30-38 cents.For 2012, TI expects R&D expenses of $2.0 billion, capex of 0.7 billion, depreciation of $1.0 billion and an annual effective tax rate of 28% (could change with re-instatement of federal R&D tax credit that expired in 2011-end).(Detailed earnings results can be viewed in the blog titled: Order Trends Point To Growth at TIOut of the 20 analysts providing estimates, none revised the estimate for the second quarter in the last 30 days. Over the same period, 8 out of 23 analysts made downward revisions for fiscal 2012.The analysts lowered their estimates due to their negative view on weak macro-economic conditions and channel inventory destocking. Further, the analysts are of the opinion that the wireless segment will not perform well in the upcoming quarter due to further declines in the baseband business, which the company expects to phase out completely by the end of the year.However, longer term, the analysts believe that TXN's analog and embedded businesses will continue to drive growth for the company. They also see potential margin expansion opportunities from the company's cost cutting initiatives along with growth in higher-margin businesses. Additionally, the analysts contend that 300mm RFAB and cost synergies from the NSM acquisition will likely lead to margins and earnings upside going forward.In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate increased by a penny to 39 cents for the second quarter, but was down 3 cents to $1.74 for fiscal 2012.Over the 90-day period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remains unchanged for the second quarter and was up 1 cent for fiscal 2012.We remain optimistic about Texas Instruments' compelling product line, the increased differentiation in its business and its lower-cost 300mm capacity. Also, the addition of National Semiconductor strengthens its product lineup and brings on board additional capacity.We also believe that some of the new designs (analog and embedded processing products) getting into volume production should help the gross margin to move up toward its long-term target of 55%.However, we remain concerned about the macro weakness, TI's larger exposure to wireless communications infrastructure, and elevated inventory levels.Increasing competition from  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) is also a matter of concern.Hence, we expect the company to report in line with the lowered guidance provided in its mid-quarter update.We, therefore, have a short-term Sell recommendation (Zacks Rank #4) on Texas Instruments shares.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) has announced that its new power management chips are now being used in Samsung's Galaxy\u00ae SIII mobile phone.The Maxim chipset selected by Samsung comprises three-power management SoCs: one to power the quad-core Exynos 4412 application processor based on  (  ) architecture, the second to power the LTE baseband processor and the third for other power management functions such as battery charging and USB enhancements.The new chipset is a big improvement from the previous generation product in terms of energy efficiency, USB enhancement and form factor. Therefore, management's claim that the product enhances the SIII with respect to speed of charging, battery life and size may not be false.Samsung launched the SIII in May 2012 in London and by the end of May launched it in India, Europe and the Middle East. Its U.S. launch has been delayed slightly.As per market research firm IDC, Samsung sold 44.5 million smartphones in the March 2012 quarter versus 35.1 million iPhones sold by  (  ). Samsung thus managed to pick up 30.6% market share, racing ahead of Apple's market share of 24.1%.Statista, a statistical analytics website, forecasts that by the end of 2016 there will be 192.4 million smartphone users in the US. Alone. In addition, a study by IDC suggests that smartphone shipments will grow worldwide at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18.6% until 2016.Samsung has been launching newer and better versions of its smartphone models at frequent intervals, while withdrawing older models. The pace of new launches has therefore helped the company maintain consumer interest.Maxim's association with Samsung is a big positive, since Samsung has been using successive generations of its products. At the same time, we need to bear in mind that mobile phone life cycles are very short, so Maxim has to be on its toes to ensure that it doesn't miss a design cycle. Given the stiff competition in the market from other analog companies like  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ), the company could quickly lose a socket.In the third quarter, Maxim reported revenue of $571.2 million, down 3.4% sequentially, 5.9% year over year and within management's guidance range of $555.0-585.0 million. Revenue was down across all end-markets except industrial, which was flat sequentially.Currently, both Maxim Integrated Products Inc. and Apple Inc. have Zacks Rank of #2, implying a short-term Buy recommendation.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ecently,  (  ), or \"TI,\" narrowed its revenue and earnings expectations for the second quarter of 2012.

The earnings outlook has also been narrowed to 32-36 cents per share from the previous guidance of 30-38 cents.Though the chipmaker has narrowed its guidance range, the midpoint remains unchanged. According to Thomson Reuters, the analysts also expect sales of $3.35 billion (in line with the midpoint of the management guidance).Specifically, management stated that the wireless segment will decline sequentially. Even in the last quarter, revenue from the wireless segment was impacted by lower demand in the baseband business, which the company expects to phase out completely by the end of the year.However, TI's Analog and Embedded Processing segments are expected to post solid sequential growth. Orders and backlog are also expected to grow sequentially based on strong demand.TI expects the industrial market to recover faster than expected and the addition of a solid product line-up from National Semiconductor, acquired last year, to drive strong overall results this year. On the whole, management commented that the business is doing well and results are expected to be as expected.In the past few quarters, TI had been lowering its guidance due to soft market conditions and weakness in the handset and industrial end markets. This is the first time in the past year that the company has not lowered the midpoint of the guidance. TI remains confident about the end-market recovery and expects National Semiconductor to boost its results in the analog-chip market.Though the first quarter earnings were down 18.4% sequentially and 28.6% year over year, management stated that the first quarter should be regarded as the bottom, with growth expected to return in the second. The fact that orders of $3.24 billion were up both sequentially as well as from the year-ago quarter, also point to growth at TI.We believe the addition of National Semiconductor strengthens its product line-up and brings additional capacity onboard. Additionally, the company's compelling product line-up, the increased differentiation in its business, restructuring activities and lower-cost 300mm capacity should drive earnings in the longer term.Increasing competition from  (  ),  (  ),  (  ), and  (  ) remains a concern.Currently, TI has a Zacks #3 Rank, which translates into a short-term Hold rating.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ecently announced,  (  ) expanded its zero-drift operational amplifiers (op amps) with the launch of its MCP6V11 and MCP6V31 single amplifiers.

Revenue was down across all end-markets except industrial, which was flat sequentially.The  end market was the largest in the last quarter, with a quarterly revenue contribution of around 41.0%, reiterated. The sales in the consumer end market suffered because of seasonal trends. The March quarter is a seasonally slow quarter for Maxim. However, management remains optimistic about stronger smartphone demand going forward.Maxim expects that the smartphone segment will strengthen this year. Maxim's USB charging chip is gaining ground, with production ramping for Japanese digital video and DSLR cameras. An e-reader using its USB chip is also ramping production. Management is also focusing on a new smartphone platform, launched by one of its customers. , the second largest segment, generated 27.0% of revenue. The segment was flat, impacted by the distribution side of the business, where distributors stopped building inventories. Maxim expects the security and automotive segments to improve again in the next quarter, with the impact offset by a couple of medical customers.Control and automation (the largest chunk of the business right now) should see some improvement, however, as channel inventories are very lean according to management and shipments are mainly to consumption.Revenue from the  end-market declined sequentially to 17% of total revenue. Continued weakness in the traditional telecom business and base station inventories has impacted Maxim's business. However, while the telecom market remains weak, base station revenue is expected to rebound, as inventories get back to normal levels.Despite the dismal performance in the last quarter, the  market remains important for Maxim, given its 15.0% revenue contribution. Revenue from the end market was down sequentially, but should see some growth over the next two quarters, as  (  ) Romley ramps production.Maxim's 6-gig SAS-expanded products should see traction when this happens because of the increased storage requirements. A Chinese financial terminal manufacturer using Maxim's secure microcontrollers is also ramping production, which should translate to additional revenue for the company.China remained the single largest contributor in the last quarter, with a revenue share of 45% (up 15.2% from last year). Korea accounted for 7% (down 38.2%) and Japan 5% (down 25.3%). The rest of Asia brought in another 15% of total quarterly revenue, which was up 17.0% year over year. The U.S. and Europe generated around 12% and 13% of revenue, respectively. The two regions were down 22.2% and 24.4%, respectively.Management does not provide specific information on orders, as shifts in customer vendor and managed inventory programs distort quarter-to-quarter comparisons.The orders showed an improvement in all 4 major markets. The order lead time was reiterated and the book to bill ratio is above 1.The GAAP gross margin was 58.7%, down 10 basis points (bps) sequentially and 270 bps year over year. Management stated that the weaker gross margin was related to lower utilization rates, lower spending and lower inventory reserves.Operating expenses of $223.5 million were down 4.2% sequentially and 7.1% from the year-ago quarter. This contributed to the operating margin declining 20 bps sequentially and 740 bps from year over year. Both R&D and SG&A also decreased significantly as a percentage of sales, although not as much as cost of sales.The GAAP net income was $22.7 million ($0.07 per share) in the third quarter, compared to $88.1 million ($0.29 per share) in the prior quarter and $136.3 million ($0.45 per share) in the prior-year quarter.Excluding special items such as restructuring, intangibles amortization, impairment charges, acquisition expenses, discontinued operations and other one-time items on a tax-adjusted basis, adjusted net income $99.5 million or 33 cents in the quarter, compared to $100.7 million or 34 cents in the previous quarter and $121.7 million or 40 cents in the year-ago quarter.Including these items, on a fully diluted GAAP basis, the company recorded a net income of $22.7 million ($0.07 per share) compared to $88.1 million ($0.29 per share) in the second quarter of 2012 and $136.3 million ($0.45 per share) in the the March quarter of 2011.Cash and cash equivalents were $936 million up 14.6% sequentially. Inventories were down 5.6% to $220.2 million. The cash generated from operations was $196.5 million, of which the company spent over $70 million on PP&E, $64.0 million on cash dividends and $29.0 million on share repurchases. Maxim has $308.7 million of long-term debt and long-term liabilities of $420.7 million.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, Maxim expects revenue of $590.0-620.0 million (up 6% sequentially). The backlog is $388.0 million.The gross margin is expected be in the 60-63% range on a GAAP basis and 62-63% on an adjusted basis. Mix, utilization and inventory reserves will be variables impacting the gross margin. Operating expenses excluding special items are expected to be up 2-3% from March. The tax rate excluding special items is expected to be 20-24%.All this will yield earnings of 34-38 cents on a GAAP basis and 37-41 cents on an adjusted basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was 34 cents when the company reported, but has moved up 4 cents since then.Capital expenditures are expected to be 5-7% of revenue in fiscal 2012 due to expansion of manufacturing and new facilities.Management declared a cash dividend of $0.22, which will be paid on June 6, 2012, declared on May 21, 2012.The Zacks Rank on Maxim shares is #3, implying a short-term hold recommendation.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n line with its plans announced earlier on its conference call, analog IC-maker  is injecting $200.0 million into its four wafer fabrication facilities in Beaverton, Oregon; Dallas and San Antonio, Texas; and San Jose, California.While Maxim did mention that the funds would be used for upgrading and modernizing its facilities, it did not specify how long this would take. However, the company expects fourth quarter capex to skew expectations for 2012 while capex for 2013 remains within the guided range. This seems to indicate that most of the charge will be taken in the fourth quarter itself and any additional expenditure will be spread out evenly over time.Maxim's exposure to fast-growing markets, such as smartphone, tablets PC, factory-automation equipment and automotive requires the company to stay abreast of technological advancements. The level of innovation in these markets is typically very high and product cycles are short. Therefore, it is very easy to lose a socket (miss a design cycle), which could result in significant losses for the company.Therefore, Maxim's decision to replace old machinery with next-generation equipment, upgrade its process technology, move to newer technology nodes and consolidate production from recent acquisitions comes at the right time. We believe that this initiative is likely to improve Maxim's competitive position versus peers such as  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ), among others.As per research conducted by IDC, the global semiconductor market grew 3.7% to $301.0 billion in 2011. Further, the market is expected to grow 6-7% this year. Estimates provided by Databeans indicate that the analog segment of the market contributed over $42 billion, or 14%. Maxim was the fifth largest player in the segment, with a 4.8% market share, having grown around 4% from 2010.In the third quarter of 2012 (the last-reported quarter), Maxim posted revenue of $571.2 million, down 3.4% sequentially, 5.9% year over year and within management's guidance range of $555.0-585.0 million. Revenue was down across all end-markets except industrial, which was flat sequentially.Currently, Maxim Integrated Products Inc. has a Zacks Rank of #3, implying a short-term Hold recommendation.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" ' (  ) fiscal second quarter earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents. Revenue exceeded the consensus by 1.4%.Analog Devices generated revenue of $675.1 million, which was up 4.2% sequentially, down 14.6% year over year and just over management's revenue guidance range of $655-$675 million (a 1-4% sequential increase).The  market generated 48% of Analog Devices' total revenue (up 11.8% sequentially and down 16.4% year over year). This is a very diversified market for Analog Devices, including the industrial automation, instrumentation, energy, defense and healthcare segments.While each sub-segment grew in the last quarter, instrumentation and energy were up over 20% each.The strong sequential performance is partly on account of positive seasonality and partly driven by improving market conditions, as customer inventories dropped to satisfactory levels, enabling Analog to ship to consumption. generated 19% of total revenue, up 2.5% sequentially and down 22.3% year over year. Analog Devices' communications business now constitutes infrastructure sales alone. Management attributed the sequential increase to both wireline and wireless customers that were prompted by growing data volumes, although growth rates remained low due to the back-end loaded quarter and continued economy-related concerns. , which now includes the computing (1% of fiscal 2011 revenue) and handset (3% of fiscal 2011 revenue) businesses, generated 16% of revenue, down 7.6% sequentially and 20.2% from a year ago. Here too, orders started strengthening toward the end of the quarter, indicating improving trends that should lead to stronger revenues going forward. Analog stated that strong design in at key consumer OEMs would support this growth.The  segment generated around 17% of Analog Devices' second quarter revenue, down 0.9% sequentially and up 10.1% from the year-ago quarter. The increase in vehicle sales, growing electronic content in vehicles and growing dollar content per vehicle for Analog helped sales in the last quarter.The year-over-year decline in revenue was more or less broad-based across product lines, with only the digital signal processing (DSP) products saying flat. On the other hand, all except the other analog category increased sequentially.Analog signal processing products (84% of total revenue) were up 4.2% sequentially and down 15.7% year over year. Converters and amplifiers were up 5.2% and 8.1%, respectively on a sequential basis, while declining 14.3% and 16.6%, respectively from last year.Other analog products were down 5.7% from the previous quarter and 18.2% from the year-ago quarter. The three product lines generated 44%, 26% and 13% of quarterly revenue, respectively.Power management and reference products remained at roughly 7% of revenue, up 2.7% and down 17.9%, respectively from the previous and year-ago quarters. These products are generally sold into the consumer market. Management has refocused the business over the last few years to concentrate on this fast-growing product line.DSPs (9% of total revenue) were up 5.3% sequentially and flat year over year.Analog Devices generated a pro forma gross margin of 65.2%, up 207 basis points (bps) sequentially, down 231 bps year over year and better than management's guidance of 64-64.5%. Both utilization and a stronger mix of high-margin industrial and communications infrastructure products were responsible for the sequential increase. The decline from the year-ago quarter was mainly on account of significantly lower volumes.Operating expenses of $227.5 million were flattish sequentially and down 3.5% from the April quarter of 2011. As a result, the operating margin expanded 324 bps sequentially even as it shrunk 621 bps year over year to 31.5%.Lower cost of sales was the main reason for the sequential increase in margin, although both R&D and SG&A also declined as a percentage of sales. However, all expenses were up significantly as a percentage of sales from the year-ago quarter with SG&A increasing somewhat less than the others.The pro forma net income was $162.9 million, or a 24.1% net income margin compared to $139.4 million, or 21.5% in the previous quarter and $245.3 million, or a 31.0% net income margin in the year-ago quarter. The fully diluted pro forma earnings per share were 53 cents compared to 46 cents in the previous quarter and 79 cents in the April quarter of last year.Since there were no one-time items in any of the quarters, the GAAP and non GAAP net income and EPS were same.Inventories increased 2.2% to $303.7 million, with annualized inventory turns dropping sequentially from 3.2X to 3.1X. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) inched up to a little less than 45. Cash generated from operations was around $226.0 million. Analog Devices spent $30.1 million on capex, $24.2 million on acquisitions, $89.4 million on cash dividends and $44.0 million on share repurchases in the last quarter.Management expects third quarter revenue of $682-$702 million (a 1-4% sequential increase) with the gross margin to increase 50 bps, operating expenses of around $231 million and diluted EPS of 54-58 cents. Analysts polled by Zacks expected earnings of 58 cents a share when Analog Devices reported, at the high end of the guided range.Given improving order trends in the back half of the quarter and historic low lead times, Analog expects most end markets to turn around in the current quarter. Channel inventories also appear lean, meaning that the company is now shipping to consumption. However, we detect caution at communications customers, which could mean slower revenue growth in the segment.Despite the positive commentary, guidance was again below our expectations likely reflecting conservatism. Particularly so, since Analog's end markets appear to be looking up.Nevertheless, we expect investor sentiments to remain low, since analysts are likely to lower their earnings estimates to reflect the guidance, thereby strengthening the Zacks Rank of #4 on Analog shares, which implies a Sell rating over the next 1-3 months.We note that other analog peers, such as  (  ) and  (  ) bear a Zacks Rank of #3 (short-term Hold), while  (  ) is currently ranked #2 (short-term Buy).The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" ' (  ) second quarter earnings excluding special items and including stock based compensation expenses beat the Zacks Consensus by a penny.Maxim's second quarter revenue of $591.4 million was down 7.0% sequentially, 3.5% year over year and missing management's guidance range of $625-655 million, or down 1.7% to up 3.0% sequentially. Revenue was down across all end-markets.The  end market was the largest in the last quarter, with a quarterly revenue contribution of around 41%, down 7.0% sequentially and up 23.6% year over year. Sales in the consumer end market suffered on account of year-end inventory rebalancing at customers and Maxim stated that it was in line with normal seasonal patterns.Growth from the year-ago quarter was due to a growing design wins and opportunities in the smartphone, tablet and other markets. Maxim is now focusing on more integrated solutions, which are expected to gain momentum this year. , the second largest segment, generated 26% of revenue, which was down 7.0% sequentially and 10.4% from the year-ago quarter due to broad-based weakness in the market. While automotive and smart grid segments continue to show signs of strength, other segments within the industrial market remain weak.Revenue from the  end market was down 7.0% sequentially and 21.9% year over year to 17% of total revenue. The GPON business remained strong in the last quarter according to Maxim.Additionally, growing braodband usage in China continued to boost infrastructure investment, which was a positive for FTTH deployment. Other areas of the business remained weak on account of soft market conditions overall.Despite the dismal performance in the last quarter, the  market remains important for Maxim, given its 16% revenue contribution. Revenue from the end market was down 7.0% sequentially and 18.8% from last year. Maxim attributed the decline to the ongoing weakness in the notebook market.China remained the single largest contributor in the last quarter, with a revenue share of 44% (down 5.8% sequentially and up 14.1% from last year). Korea accounted for 7% (down 36.6% sequentially) and Japan 6% (up 1.1% sequentially and down 17.7% year over year). The rest of Asia brought in another 15% of total quarterly revenue, which was up 10.0% sequentially.The U.S. and Europe generated around 13% and 12% of revenue, respectively. However, while the U.S. declined just 3.1%, Europe was down 15.1%. The two regions were down 11.7% and 25.0%, respectively from the year-ago quarter. The rest of the world accounted for around 3% of revenue.Management does not provide specific information on orders, as shifts in customer vendor managed inventory programs distort quarter-to-quarter comparisons.We estimate that orders were down mid-single-digits in the last quarter, cutting down the backlog significantly, with the book-to-bill going remaining below unity. Turns sales increased strongly in the last quarter, while backlog sales declined. Supply chain activities improved, with Maxim's delivery lead times dropping to six weeks exiting the quarter. Internal inventories declined.The pro forma gross margin was 60.5%, down 315 basis points (bps) sequentially and 304 bps year over year. Management stated that the weaker gross margin was related to lower utilization rates and higher inventory reserves.Operating expenses of $220.3 million were up 2.2% sequentially and 8.9% from the year-ago quarter. This helped bring the operating margin down 497 bps sequentially and 729 bps from last year. Both R&D and SG&A also increased significantly as a percentage of sales, although not as much as cost of sales.The pro forma net income was $103.3 million, or a 17.5% net income margin compared to $137.2 million, or 21.6% in the previous quarter and $132.4 million, or 21.6% of sales in the year-ago quarter. Our pro forma calculation excludes restructuring, intangibles amortization and other one-time items on a tax-adjusted basis, but includes stock based compensation charges in the last quarter.Including these items, on a fully diluted GAAP basis, the company recorded a net income of $88.1 million ($0.29 per share) compared to $133.4 million ($0.44 per share) in the September 2011 quarter and $109.6 million ($0.36 per share) in the December quarter of 2010.Inventories were down 7.8% to $233.4 million, with inventory turns up from 3.7X to 4.0X. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) went down from around 47 to around 38. The cash and marketable securities balance was $816.5 million, up $56.2 million or 7.4% during the quarter.The cash generated from operations was $249.3 million, of which the company spent over $68 million on PP&E, $12 million on acquisitons, $64 million on cash dividends and $72 million on share repurchases. Maxim has just $308.7 million of long term debt and long term liabilities are also not too high at $327.8 million.In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, Maxim expects revenue of $555-585 million (down 1-6% sequentially). The backlog is $365 million, but the guidance calls for high turns sales, which may be within its capacity given recent trends.The gross margin is expected be in the 55-58% range on a GAAP basis and 57-60% on an adjusted basis. Mix, utilization and inventory reserves will be variables impacting the gross margin. Operating expenses excluding special items are expected to be down 3-4% from December. The tax rate excluding special items is expoected to be 26-28%.All this will yield GAAP earnings of 22-26 cents on a GAAP basis and 25-29 cents on an adjusted basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was 32 cents when the company reported, but has moved down 5 cents after the company reported. Capital expenditure is expected to be be flat to down sequentially. Capital expenditures are expected to be 5-7% of revenue in fiscal 2012.Maxim is a well-diversified business, although it has increased focus on faster-growth markets in the last few years. Therefore, the company currently generates a significant percentage of its revenue from the consumer and computing end markets. These markets are not doing so well right now due to natural disasters and inventory imbalances.However, Maxim has done better than the market, because of its superior technology and innovation Therefore, design wins continue, not just in the U.S. but also in emerging countries, such as China.While Maxim's product line remains solid and its end market diversity is commendable, we think its exposure to the consumer and computing markets will negatively impact results.Maxim shares therefore have a Zacks Rank of #3, implying a Hold recommendation in the short term (1-3 months). We remain relatively more positive about other analog players, such as  (  ), which has a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) and  (  ), whichh has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) is scheduled to announce its fiscal first-quarter 2012 results on February 22, 2012. We witness limited movements in analyst estimates in the build-up to the release.Analog's fourth quarter 2011 pro forma earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents, or 4.8% due to weaker-than-expected revenue and margins, which in turn impacted earnings.Revenue in the quarter was $716.1 million, down 5.5% sequentially and 7.0% year over year, particularly due to the weakness in the communications and industrial end markets. However, the consumer segment performed well in the quarter on account of seasonal increase in demand for digital cameras, gaming systems and the like. Automotive was also up 11.2% sequentially.Gross margin of 64.3% was down both sequentially and year over year, impacted by an unfavorable mix and lower utilization rates, as Analog cut production to lower both internal and distributor inventories.Analog expects first quarter revenue to decline 5-10% sequentially with the gross margin being 63% (+/- 50 bps), operating expenses of $226-229 million and diluted EPS of 44-51 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was 59 cents when the company reported earnings, well over the guided range.(Detailed earnings results can be viewed in the blog titled: Out of the 19 analysts providing estimates for the first quarter, one made an upward revision in the last 30 days, while for fiscal 2012, one analyst made a downward revision over the same time period.The majority of analysts expect a decent first quarter with revenue and non-GAAP EPS (including options) in line with the Street consensus estimates of $662 million and $0.48, respectively. Additionally, they anticipate gross margins in line with management guidance of 63.0% (+/- 50 basis points).The analysts expect to see strength in the automotive end market and stabilization in industrial and communications, which have remained weak thus far, driven by 3G deployments in China. They also contend that increasing semiconductor content in automobiles will drive the company's revenue growth.They also believe that order trends in the analog segment are improving and channel inventory is at a record low level. Hence, they expect to see strong recovery in the second half of 2012 driven by improved demand and inventory restocking.However, a handful of analysts do not expect a strong quarter due to a certain amount of softness in the industrial and communications business and uncertainty in the current environment.In the past 30 days, there was no change to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter and fiscal 2012.Over the 90-day period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate fell 11 cents to 48 cents for the first quarter and 37 cents to $2.28 for fiscal 2012.The significant decline in the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the 90-day period was in response to management's comments during the fourth quarter , following which a majority of analysts had lowered estimates.Analog Devices is a leading supplier of analog and DSP integrated circuits. We remain encouraged by the company's dominant position in many of its product segments, and meaningfully improved gross and operating margin structures.However, we remain concerned about the tough macroeconomic environment and softness within the communications and industrial infrastructure markets. With customers continuing to cut inventories and typical first quarter seasonality, we do not expect Analog Devices to see a strong first quarter. Also, given that the company expects lower sales during Christmas and the lunar New Year, it will effectively have 14 weeks of expenses versus 13 weeks of revenue in the upcoming quarter.Analog, which competes with other large analog players, such as Intersil Corporation,  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ), holds a Zacks #4 Rank that translates into a short-term 'Sell' rating. ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) is scheduled to announce its fiscal second-quarter 2012 results on May 22.

However, the automotive segment performed well in the quarter on account of increased use of electronic content in automobiles, growing dollar content per vehicle for Analog and higher sales of vehicles.Gross margin of 63.2% was down both sequentially and year over year, impacted by lower utilization rates, as Analog tried to keep internal inventories under control.Management expects second quarter revenue of $655-$675 million (a 1-4% sequential increase) with the gross margin at 64-64.5%, operating expenses of around $226 million and diluted EPS of 48-53 cents. For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 51 cents, at the high end of the guided range.(Detailed earnings results can be viewed in the blog titled: Out of the 18 analysts providing estimates for the second quarter, none made any revision in the last 30 days.

They contend that 3G deployments and growing semiconductor content in automobiles will drive the company's future revenue growth. They also believe that wireless infrastructure is another area of revenue growth with strength in wireless base station build-outs owing to continued expansion into China, Europeand North America.However, a handful of analysts do not expect a strong quarter due to some softness in the end markets and uncertainty in the current environment. They state that demand uncertainty has continued, particularly, in industrial and communications end markets, which together comprise roughly 65% of Analog's total revenue.In the past 30 days, there was no change to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter but the estimate for fiscal 2012 dropped a penny to $2.18.Over the 90-day period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate fell 3 cents to 51 cents for the second quarter and 10 cents to $2.18 for fiscal 2012.The weak demand environment and lower-than-expected guidance announced by management during the first quarter , might have prompted the reduction in estimates.Analog Devices is a leading supplier of analog and DSP integrated circuits.

Lowe's isn't alone. Home Depot, their chief competitor, announced a $1 Billion share buyback in late March.Buybacks, or share repurchases, are when a company starts to purchase its own stock, taking it off the market. Doing so lessens the number of outstanding shares held by the public. The buying pressure tends to increase the value of the shares, as does the fact that there are now fewer shares outstanding.Another side effect: Given the decreased number of shares, earnings per share will increase if profits remain unchanged.Lowe's stock has fallen 23% this year and buybacks are expected to. $5 billion in buybacks currently represents about a fifth of the market share. If Lowe's shares are currently undervalued, a rally in company profits will mean strong return on investments for the firm.Lastly, buying up stocks reduces the cash lying around the company. Having cash tied up in equities can look more attractive on a company's balance sheet and make it less attractive of a takeover target. (Free cash transfers to the acquiring company. This essentially lowers the actual cost of acquisition.)It should be noted that companies are no better than the average investors at repurchasing their own stocks with the \"buy low, sell high\" mentality.Interested in analyzing the buyback scene?We list below some of the big companies that recently announced buybacks.

Shares slumped 2.56% in response.While the guidance was also below our expectations, the comentary was more or less as we had expected going by earnings reports from other analog players, such as  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).Analog Devices generated revenue of $648.1 million, which was down 9.5% sequentially, 11.0% year over year and just within management's revenue guidance of $645-680 million (down 5-10% sequentially, down 7-12% year over year).Analog Devices had previously cautioned about a weak first quarter, due to inventory reduction at customers and lack of sales during Christmas and the lunar new year, which would effectively result in 14 weeks of expenses versus 13 weeks of revenue.The  market generated 45% of Analog Devices' total revenue (down 7.9% sequentially and 14.6% year over year). This is a very diversified market for Analog Devices, including the industrial automation, instrumentation, energy, defense and healthcare segments.The sequential decline in the last quarter was driven by broad-based declines across customers, markets and geographies. ADI stated that the increased caution at customers due to economic concerns led them to further reduce inventories, although order rates indicated that sentiments were improving. generated 19% of total revenue, down 13.0% sequentially and 17.7% year over year. Analog Devices' communications business now constitutes infrastructure sales alone. Management stated that this business was impacted by general economic uncertainty, regulatory issues in some countries and disruptions caused by the  (  ) and T Mobile merger failing. , which now includes the computing (1% of fiscal 2011 revenue) and handset (3% of fiscal 2011 revenue) businesses, generated 18% of revenue, down 21.4% sequentially and down 19.9% from a year ago. The greater-than-expected sequential decline was attributed to the flooding in Thailand that impacted production at customers, which impacted demand.The  segment generated around 18% of Analog Devices' first quarter revenue, increasing 5.9% sequentially and 25.9% from the year-ago quarter. The growing electronic content in automobiles, growing dollar content per vehicle for Analog and increased sales of vehicles helped sales in the last quarter.The revenue decline was across all analog and power management products, although digital signal processing (DSP) increased slightly.ADI signal processing products (84% of total revenue) were down 10.1% sequentially and 11.8% year over year. All product lines within analog (converters, amplifiers and other analog products) contributed to the sequential decline, with converters declining the most, followed by amplifiers and then other analog products.Specifically, converters were down 11.8% sequentially and 13.5% year over year. Amplifiers followed, with sequential and year-over-year declines of 10.0% and 15.9%, respectivey. Other analog products saw a relatively smaller decline of 4.8% from the previous quarter and an increase of 2.6% from a year ago. The three product lines generated 44%, 25% and 15% of quarterly revenue, respectively.Power management and reference products remained at roughly 7% of revenue, down 15.6% and 15.9%, respectively from the previous and year-ago quarters. These products are generally sold into the consumer market that has been impacted by the Thailand flooding and resultant disruption in the supply chain. Management has refocused the business over the last few years to increase focus on this fast-growing product line.DSPs (9% of total revenue) were up 2.8% sequentially and 2.5% year over year.Analog Devices generated a pro forma gross margin of 63.2%, down 113 basis points (bps) sequentially, 301 bps year over year and in line with management's guidance of 63% (+/- 50 bps). Gross margins were impacted by lower utilization rates (below 70% in the last quarter from 73%), as Analog tried to keep internal inventories under control.Operating expenses of $226.0 million were flattish sequentially and up 1.5% from the January quarter of 2010. As a result, the operating margin shrunk 456 bps sequentially and 731 bps year over year to 28.3%.On a sequential basis, R&D increased the most as a percentage of sales, with SG&A and cost of sales also increasing. As may be expected, all expenses also grew year over year as a percentage of sales.The pro forma net income was $139.4 million, or a 21.5% net income margin compared to $183.5 million, or 25.6% in the previous quarter and $203.8 million, or a 28.0% net income margin in the year-ago quarter. The fully diluted pro forma earnings per share were 46 cents compared to 60 cents in the previous quarter and 66 cents in the January quarter of last year.Since there were no one-time items in any of the quarters, the GAAP and non GAAP net income and EPS were same.Inventories increased 0.7% to $297.2 million, with annualized inventory turns dropping sequentially from 3.5X to 3.2X. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) went down to 43 from 44. Cash generated from operations was around $214.8 million. Analog Devices spent $25.3 million on capex, $74.4 million on cash dividends and $78.4 million on share repurchases in the last quarter.Given improving order trends through January and February, ADI expects industrial revenue to increase in the next quarter. The consumer business is expected to increase slightly in line with normal seasonality. The momentum in the autootive business is also ikely to be sustained. However, will likely remain weak for one more quarter and recover thereafter (going by customer feedback).Management expects second quarter revenue of $655-$675 million (a 1-4% sequential increase) with the gross margin at 64-64.5%, operating expenses of around $226 million and diluted EPS of 48-53 cents. Analysts polled by Zacks expected earnings of 54 cents a share when Analog Devices reported, just over the guided range.Analog Devices had another bad quarter, impacted by economic concerns and caution at customers. However, if management commentary is to be believed, order trends have already started improving, with both January and February coming in notably stronger. As a result, management now expects the first quarter to be the trough for orders, revenue and margins.Despite the positive commentary, we note that guidance remains below our expectations for the next quarter. We think this is likely to trigger downward revision to estimates, containing price appreciation and keeping the Zacks Rank at #4 (short-term Sell rating). ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ith the Nasdaq finishing near session lows on Friday, it is no surprise to find many Nasdaq stocks trading lower and closing in or near  territory.What has been more of a surprise, however, is the small number of Nasdaq stocks that are trading lower and moving toward oversold territory - but are still trading above their 200-day moving averages.Why does this matter? Because when it comes to quality pullbacks, the snapback rallies that take stocks out of oversold territory tend to be more powerful and more enduring when they happen in bull market territory - in other words, above the 200-day moving average - compared to bear market territory.So keeping our focus on the Nasdaq, here are three stocks that have pulled back to new short-term lows (here using 10-day closing lows), are in or near technically oversold levels, and are set to open in bull market territory when trading begins on Monday.Shares of  (  ) have closed lower for four out of the past five trading days,  by more than 8% on Friday. Although not yet technically oversold, the fact that IDIX is trading at 10-day closing lows is one feature that may begin to attract traders to the stock.

Revenue missed the consensus by 8.2%. Particular weakness in the communications and industrial markets led to weaker-than-expected revenue. This, in turn, impacted margins.The guidance was also below our expectations, but the market appears to have priced in the weakness, given that other analog players, such as  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ) also guided below expectations. Therefore, shares did not lose much in after-market trade.Analog Devices generated revenue of $716.1 million, which was down 5.5% sequentially, 7.0% year over year and just within management's revenue guidance of $715-755 million (down 0-6% sequentially, down 2-7% year over year).While the industrial segment weakened in line with management guidance, Analog Devices had guided to strength in communications infrastructure that did not materialize.The  market generated 41% of Analog Devices' total revenue (down 13.9% sequentially and 10.0% year over year). This is a very diversified market for Analog Devices, including the industrial automation, instrumentation, energy, defense and healthcare segments.The sequential decline in the last quarter was on account of increased caution at customers, as economic concerns led them to further reduce inventories. Management stated that the weakness was broad-based across product lines and geographies. Order flow started to stabilize through October and November. Analog Devices' full-year performance was good, however, due to strong revenue growth in industrial automation, instrumentation and energy markets. , which now includes the computing (1% of fiscal 2011 revenue) and handset (3% of fiscal 2011 revenue) businesses, generated 21% of revenue, up 7.9% sequentially and down 9.3% from a year ago. The sequential increase was on account of seasonal increase in demand for digital cameras, gaming systems and the like. Sales for the year were down, as Analog Devices shifted focus to higher value-added applications that are likely to generate better margins. generated 19% of total revenue, down 9.2% sequentially and 14.1% year over year. Analog Devices' communications business comes from both infrastructure and cell phones, although the focus is on the infrastructure side. However, management is now including phones in the consumer segment.Although revenue in the quarter benefited from the recovery in Japan, this was more than offset by the postponement of the build-out in China and overall inventory reduction across the world due to increased macro concerns. The mobile data segment drove revenue for the year.The  segment generated around 16% of Analog Devices' fourth quarter revenue, increasing 11.2% sequentially and 20.2% from the year-ago quarter. Growing electronic content in automobiles and strong position at customers offset macro pressures to generate the growth in the last quarter.The global recovery, better credit availability, as well as increasing electronic content per vehicle, especially in the areas of infotainment, safety and fuel efficiency remain long-term drivers. This, along with increasing demand for high-end vehicles that use Analog Devices products are positives for the company.The revenue decline was across all product lines, including analog, power management and digital signal processing (DSP).Analog signal processing products (85% of total revenue) were down 5.3% sequentially and 6.7% year over year. All product lines within analog (converters, amplifiers and other analog products) contributed to the sequential decline, although other analog products were up year over year.Converters remained the largest product line for Analog Devices, with a revenue share of over 45%. Amplifiers followed, with a 26% revenue share, while other analog products accounted for 14% of total revenue.Power management and reference products remained at 7% of revenue, down 3.3% sequentially and 4.5% from last year. The strength in this product line is the result of management's refocusing of the business over the last few years.DSPs (8% of total revenue) were down 9.3% sequentially and 12.3% year over year.Analog Devices generated a pro forma gross margin of 64.3%, down 294 basis points (bps) sequentially, 274 bps year over year and missing management's guidance of 65-66%. Gross margins were impacted by a negative mix (more automotive and consumer versus less industrial and communications) and utilization rates dropping (from 78% to 73%), as Analog cut production to lower both internal and distributor inventories.Operating expenses of $225.2 million were down 2.4% sequentially and 2.3% from the October quarter of 2010, much less than the overall decline in revenue. As a result, the operating margin shrunk 394 bps sequentially and 425 bps year over year to 32.9%.On a sequential basis, cost of sales increased the most as a percentage of sales, with R&D and SG&A increasing at more or less the same rate. All expenses grew year-over-year as a percentage of sales.The pro forma net income was $183.5 million, or a 25.6% net income margin compared to $219.9 million, or 29.0% in the previous quarter and $225.0 million, or a 29.2% net income margin in the prior-year quarter. The fully diluted pro forma earnings per share were 60 cents compared to 71 cents in the previous quarter and 73 cents in the October quarter of last year. The EPS was well below management's expectations of 74 cents.Since there were no one-time items in any of the quarters, the GAAP and non GAAP net income and EPS were same.Inventories dropped 1.4% to $295.1 million, with annualized inventory turns dropping flat sequentially at 3.5X. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) went down to 44 from 45. Cash generated from operations was around $230.2 million. Analog Devices spent $26.3 million on capex, $74.8 million on cash dividends and $82.8 million on share repurchases in the last quarter.With customers continuing to cut inventories and typical first quarter seasonality, Analog Devices will see a weak first quarter. Also, given that the company does not expect to generate any sales during Christmas and the lunar new year, it will effectively have 14 weeks of expenses versus 13 weeks of revenue.Given this backdrop, revenue for the quarter is expected to decline 5-10% sequentially with the gross margin at 63% (+/- 50 bps), operating expenses of $226-229 million and diluted EPS of 44-51 cents. Analysts polled by Zacks expected earnings of 59 cents a share when Analog Devices reported, well over the guided range.Analog Devices has not had a good quarter, which is not surprising for an analog company in the current environment. However, the thing that concerns us is the areas in which it is seeing weakness. A certain amount of softness in the industrial business may be considered normal for the December quarter, but we are talking about much more than seasonality here. Both the industrial and communications businesses were impacted by economic concerns and increased caution at customers.We are however encouraged by expectations that these businesses are likely to pick up strongly in 2012. We believe that the company has an attractive portfolio and strong position at customers that would respond quickly to a pickup in demand. In the meantime, cost containment is likely to be a key theme for maximizing earnings.Analog Devices shares carry a Zacks #3 Rank, implying a short term Hold recommendation. ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis Report ): Free Stock Analysis ReportThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ecently,  (  ), or \"TI,\" slashed its revenue and earnings expectations for the first quarter of 2012.The chipmaker now expects sales of $2.99 billion to $3.11 billion, below its previous guidance range of $3.02 billion to $3.28 billion. The earnings outlook has been lowered to 5 cents to19 cents per share from the previous guidance of 16 cents to 24 cents.We believe that management had previously projected revenues to decline as a result of macro weakness and hard disk drive shortages from the Thailand flood.Now, the company also expects the demand for its OMAP application processor, which is used in wireless devices like smartphones and tablets to take a tumble, thereby causing a further decline in the first quarter.As the fourth quarter progressed, TI saw strong demand in the month of December, which pushed up orders during the month. Hence, management expects inventory correction to end very soon and orders to improve going forward. Additionally, TI expects automotive and communications infrastructure end markets to improve and demand to pick up from the second quarter of 2012.Texas Instruments is one of the largest suppliers of analog and DSP integrated circuits. The company reported revenues of $3.42 billion in the fourth quarter of 2011, down 0.8% sequentially and 3.0% year over year.

I won't rehash all that here, but I do want to touch on something that occurred to me when reviewing a few of my trades this week.Aside from all the customary statistical analysis, I also plot a histogram of my trade results. I create a dozen or so columns on the chart, each one measuring the number of trades that resulted in X amount of profit (or loss).One column in the middle might be any trade that lost less than, say, $100, or made less than $300 (i.e., nearly breakeven). The column to the right might convey how many trades made more than $100, but less than $300; the next one on the right, from $300 to $500. Accordingly, the left side of the chart would categorize losing trades. An example below depicts 40 fictitious trades.Glancing at this chart, you can see 10 trades in this batch were closed out right around breakeven. Another eight were closed out with small profits ($100 to $300). And from there it spread out roughly evenly--a lessening amount of losers and winners as the numbers got larger, though there was a minor skew toward the right hand (profitable) side.So far, the results resemble a standard bell curve--that is, most results are around the middle, and the farther you get from the middle in each direction, the fewer results you see.But wait! There happens to be an out-of-sorts column way out to the right hand side--there were three trades that garnered more than $1,300 in profit. This is what's known as a \"fat tail\" to the bell curve, and it's what I want to focus on. Simply put, this fat tail is how a winning investor beats the market.---Any investing system that generally follows the mantra \"cut losses short, let winners run\" probably will feature a distribution curve similar to the chart above. While most people picture a winning trader as constantly and consistently churning out winners, the reality is that most successful systems endure long periods of treading water, with just a few trades responsible for most of the gains.In this example, just three out of 40 trades resulted in big money. (Note that the dollar amounts in the chart are just examples; \"big\" is a relative term.) The other trades basically canceled each other out!What can we learn from this?First and foremost, you shouldn't get discouraged if you have a streak where you win one, then lose one, then win, then lose, etc. Such action can be super frustrating, and it's probably a good idea to back off when you see this. But be sure not to get discouraged--realize that even the best traders have these back-and-forth periods; they're perfectly normal.Second, it re-emphasizes the value in cutting losses. Why? Because if you let a few small losses (in this example, say, $400) morph into bigger losers ($1,000 or more), they'll eat into the benefit you get from those big winners. In other words, you have to make sure your big winners really count.Third, you should be hesitant to tell a stock when it's gone \"too far.\" As you probably know, I think booking some partial profits on the way up is a good idea, and there are times when a profitable stock just doesn't have the get-up-and-go you're looking for, so you can sell it on the way up, too. But if you're booking small profits left and right for no reason, you'll never be able to develop a bigger winner ... and consequently, you'll have a hard time making money.Lastly ... and something that few investors really think about ... is that having a system that is so skewed can actually be very liberating. The reason is because you know that you're only one good trade away from putting a boost in your results ... or, if you're already doing well, from kicking things into overdrive. Contrast that to systems that make very small amounts of money frequently--but then lose a bunch all at once. It can be depressing in that situation, knowing that a huge grind is needed just to get back to where you started.Anyway, the major point is really to know the ins-and-outs of the methodology you're employing. That way, you'll know what is \"normal\" for your system, giving you confidence to ride out some tedious, back-and-forth periods and to shoot for those valuable big winners.--- Advertisement ---Turn Market Volatility Into Huge GainsLeverage your investments to make money in all markets!

I'm talking about  , which has been called the YouTube of China, but in reality, it's more like a combination of a Netflix or Hulu (because it offers generally professionally-made movies and shows) and YouTube (because advertising is the main source of revenue).The company just reported first-quarter earnings last Thursday evening, and while the loss per share of six cents was a bit better than expected, the real upside showed up in revenue, which totaled $19.5 million, up 174% from the year before and well above expectations. Triple-digit revenue growth has always been one of my favorite fundamental criteria, and Youku.com had 140%-plus year-on-year growth in nine of the past 10 quarters.The stock actually blasted off just as the market was topping in mid-February--it rose nine out of 10 weeks, advancing from 30 to 70 during that time. Powerful! Then came the correction, and it brought shares down to 54 last week, where they found support at the 10-week moving average.So YOKU is a great buy right here, correct? Not so fast. Leading stocks are still generally under pressure, as are many Chinese Internet-related stocks. I'm not advising people to buy many things hand over fist. But YOKU is young (it went public only last December), likely still under-owned (just 128 mutual funds own a stake) and has a ton of growth ahead of it.It's small and speculative, but a small position around here, with a stop around 52, could work out.

Last week, the average cost of a gallon of gasoline in the U.S. was $3.52, according to the Department of Energy. That's up a whopping 76 cents from a year ago. Five years ago, a gallon was $2.70; 10 years ago, it was $1.60.It's to the point that the other day, I drove an extra few miles to BJs Warehouse Club because the gas was 10 cents a gallon cheaper. Given that demand rises in the summer (leading to the industry nickname for summer: driving season) it's a good bet that $4 a gallon gasoline will be on tap by Memorial Day.The uncertainty on the world's energy flow promises to continue to roil markets too. Between Libya and other Middle East unrest and the effect that Japan's disasters will have on its increased demand to import energy to make up for the destroyed nuclear plants, the pressure is bound to continue. Plus there are the fundamental supply and demand pressures that exist anyway, as world economic activity rebounds from the recession.All of that means biofuels are likely here to stay as a part of the world energy supply. Today, biofuels are just 3% of the world supply (in terms of refining capacity), but last autumn, when gasoline prices were under control, they were projected to grow at least at a 7% clip for the foreseeable future. But there is a problem with biofuels.Here in the U.S., for instance, 40% of the latest corn crop went to ethanol. That's a stunning figure, especially considering that world grain markets are under intense pressure because of poor wheat crops in Russia and Ukraine, poor corn crops in China and disappointing harvests here in the U.S. in both corn and soy.The ability to get more from each bit of corn, whether extracting more energy from it or using less energy to extract the same amount of energy is a key hurdle to overcome. So is creating the ability to produce suitable ethanol or other biofuels from other, non-food sources.---My stock recommendation for this issue is making great strides in those areas. It's a California company called  . Specifically, Codexis produces biocatalysts, which make the creation of ethanol faster and cleaner than traditional methods.In the past, biocatalysts have been too unstable to use reliably, but because they can be utilized at room temperature and without the creation of hazardous byproducts-as in chemistry-based catalytic actions-stable, reliable biocatalysts have long been sought after. Codexis identifies and isolates the microorganisms that produce the best enzymes, then performs a series of intricate processes, including gene shuffling and mutation identification to breed proprietary \"superenzymes\" that can be used more cheaply and efficiently in the creation of biofuels. The benefits include being able to use water as a solvent at normal atmospheric pressure, eliminating the need for purification actions later on and using less energy overall.With biodiesel, which is chemically different from bioethanol (the latter is an alcohol, the former an oil), Codexis believes it has discovered a process that allows its creation both faster and cheaper.Right now, biodiesel requires intricate steps from start to finish, including halting the production process at one point to chemically modify the intermediate product, and other costly side steps. Codexis believes its process eliminates the need to chemically modify the intermediate product, allowing the process to run continually and slash expenses. Because biodiesel is chemically identical to fossil fuel diesel, this may in fact be the more promising of the two biofuel areas. Ethanol, being chemically different from gasoline, requires additional infrastructure \"drop in\" fuels that biodiesel does not.There are plenty of other companies pursuing advances in biofuels and catalysts, such as  and  , but Codexis has two characteristics that give it an edge. One is that Codexis also has a market for its superenzymes in the pharmaceutical industry. If you take Lipitor, you've experienced the end result that includes Codexis. The company's superenzymes are also sold to  and  , among others. That gives the company a solid revenue stream while it looks to ramp up the biofuels business.And the biofuels business is looking good. Codexis has been tied to Shell Oil since 2006, when the pair teamed up to produce biocatalysts for fuel production. For much of that time, Shell has provided payments to Codexis to support development (Shell will pay royalties if it uses Codexis' technology in fuel production).A big uncertainty has been whether Shell will stick with Codexis, having earned the right as of November to terminate the relationship with nine months notice (an option Codexis does not have). That uncertainty is waning, with the pair announcing in early February they will use Codexis technology to produce biofuels directly from straw and sugar cane waste by year's end. This is potentially important because Shell has also teamed with  Brazil's largest ethanol producer, which uses sugar cane as its raw material.A potential long-term bonus with shares: Codexis recently announced it has made progress in a carbon sequestration technique using custom enzymes that can be deployed in coal-fired power plants.In its most recent year, ended December 31, Codexis made $107 million (up 77%) and shrunk its net loss to $8.5 million (35 cents per share) from $20.3 million. Shares in the Cabot Green Investor portfolio are up just 8% so far from our buy price, but they look like they are in the midst of building a rock solid base around these levels to work higher in coming months. The higher gas prices go, certainly the better outlook for Codexis.Learn more about Codexis and other top Green stocks recommended by  .All the best,Brendan CoffeyFor Cabot Wealth AdvisoryThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" recently paid my electric bill and was putting the inserts into the recycling bin when I saw one detailing where all my electricity comes from. I was surprised to see that my utility, National Grid, sources 74% of my electricity from what I'd term Green resources: 34% natural gas (considered transitionally Green because it burns cleaner than oil and coal), 27% nuclear, 6% trash-to-energy, 3% large hydroelectric, 3% biomass and 1% wind. Another 12% was imported power, almost certainly hydropower from Quebec (which, if true, would bring the Green energy total to 86%), while 9% was coal and 5% oil.That surprised me, because the average American gets a lot less of their energy from Green sources. Of course, in the short term we have little choice in the matter unless we put solar on our roof or install geothermal. But most of us are locked in to what our utilities source.If you include non-electric use of energy too-mainly our cars, trucks and planes-total energy usage in the U.S. looks like this, according to the Energy Information Agency (  ): 37% is liquid fuels like gasoline, oil and other petroleum products, 23% is natural gas, 20% is coal, 8% is nuclear and 6% is renewable. That only adds up to 94%; the missing 6% can be found in rounding in the subsectors and the fact some fuels like gasoline and residential oil, were delivered in the year prior to when they were used. So count that missing 6% as fossil fuels. That means nearly two-thirds of our energy comes from fossil fuels, excluding natural gas.That's why it's such a big deal President Obama is calling for 80% of U.S. energy to come from \"clean\" sources by 2035. If you missed it, in his State of the Union address, President Obama called our national lagging in utilizing Green energy \"our generation's Sputnik moment,\" where we need to respond to catch up. He continued: \"I challenge you to join me in setting a new goal: By 2035, 80% of America's electricity will come from clean energy sources. Some folks want wind and solar. Others want nuclear, clean coal and natural gas. To meet this goal, we will need them all.\"That's a pretty bold goal, especially considering the EIA sees the percentage of oil and coal rising to 66% of U.S. energy sources by 2035 based on current planning and trends. And if you drill down into our existing Green energy data, the president's goal is even more audacious.The vast majority of what the EIA terms renewable is from large hydroelectric projects, like the Niagara Falls power project my father worked on in the 1950s. There are two things to know about hydro power: It's great and there isn't any more of it coming-there are few good sites left and with additional fish, but wildlife concerns, no Western nation even has a hydro project on the drawing board.As far as nuclear, consider that we have 104 nuclear reactors in the U.S. For the first time in 30 years new plants are being built. But only another four are expected to come online by 2018, so as a percentage of energy, nuclear will grow, but not enough to more than double America's clean energy.Even if political wrangling means we only aim for half of Obama's 80% mark, with nuclear and hydro producing slow growth at best domestically, it means solar, wind, geothermal and every other clean energy technology you've heard of have to grow exponentially in coming years to help meet clean energy goals. That means more jobs of course, through domestic research and manufacturing as well as bolstering our exports to other nations.It also means huge profits for investors.Consider this: Last year Cabot Green Investor subscribers enjoyed the newsletter's portfolio gains of 24%, the best of all the clean-and Green-stock newsletters and far better than alternative energy exchange-traded funds, green mutual funds and the broad market-and that was in a market backtracking from a recession, government funding cuts and flops in expected international climate agreements!Think of what Green will provide as the economy steadies on its feet, the market improves and governments worldwide begin refocusing on their energy independence.Let me give you a hint: It has already started and right now my subscribers are enjoying huge gains, including nearly 150% in  , 50% in a company that makes solar wafer processing equipment and 50% in an organic food maker whose shares are being gobbled up by a hedge fund legend. Plus double-digit profits in a company key to the stunning growth globally in nuclear power, a cutting edge biofuels stock that surged 17% in one day last week, a firm that installs wind turbines and photovoltaic farms, and more.The full portfolio is available only to Cabot Green Investor subscribers, but I do have one low-priced stock to recommend today that I expect to surge based on another country's clean energy plans.--- Advertisement ---Turn Market Volatility Into Huge GainsLeverage your investments to make money in all markets! Cabot Options Trader Editor Rick Pendergraft uses the market's volatility to bring his subscribers huge profit-making opportunities. Just check out these gains from the last three months:A 70% gain on a Call on Linear Technology (  ) in only 11 days!An 128% gain on a Call on Maxim Integrated Products (  ) in 15 days!A 164% gain on a Put on Cisco (  ) in ONE day!---This small stock is a play on a key driver to the worldwide boom in Green energy I haven't yet addressed. And it is perhaps the most important one to politicians: energy security. For one, it's getting harder to find oil-it was reported this week the world's largest oil company,  , has found only 95 barrels of oil to replace every 100 barrels it sold in the past decade. That's a problem, since it means there's less oil around.Secondly, world demand for oil is booming, thanks to China, India, Indonesia and nearly every other nation. Demand is so great that the International Energy Agency strongly warns that by 2035 the world needs to find the equivalent of FOUR Saudi Arabias to simply sustain today's demand levels! ExxonMobil's problem with finding oil is ultimately our problem-and a reason to go Green.There are a number of astonishingly large alternative energy programs recently put in place in areas like China and the European Union, but today I want to focus on a major, but often overlooked economy: South Korea. Korea is the world's 15th largest economy with annual GDP of $1.5 trillion-the 11th largest user of energy. It is, obviously, a major trading partner with the U.S., as attested by the prevalence of Hyundais on the road and Fila sportswear at the gym (Italian origin, yes, but Korean owned).Korea also imports a jaw-dropping 97% of its energy.It's lacking in natural energy resources, so the country has no choice but to go Green. Right now it gets just 1% of its energy from renewable resources, a reason the government has just enacted an aggressive national plan to get Greener.Right now the mandate is to quintuple the amount of renewables in the country by 2015, to 5% of national energy usage, raising that sharply in subsequent years. One additional problem for Korea, though: The peninsula doesn't have very good prospects for solar and wind. Korea's solution: fuel cells.A fuel cell is an electrochemical device that draws energy from an input through electron transfer via oxidation. That in itself is pretty amazing-after all, combustion is the dominant method of powering everything and the biggest reason global warming is such an imminent threat.The byproduct of the fuel cell? Heat and not much else. If you use the heat emitted for an obvious purpose, like heating a building or its water, you end up with a manner of consuming fuels that can claim efficiency of over 70% and in some cases 80%. A typical fossil fuel power plant operates at about 35% conversion efficiency-and of course emits acid rain-type and greenhouse gas-type particles.My stock recommendation is a Connecticut firm called  that has been researching fuel cells for decades, and has been selling them the past decade.Clients are institutions looking to reduce their carbon footprint, like Yale University, convert waste product into energy, such as Gills Onion, one of the nation's largest onion processors which uses as much as 300,000 pounds of onion waste to run its fuel cells, to industrial users looking to maximize their efficiency, such as natural gas pipeline owner Enbridge, which uses fuel cells to use natural gas ordinarily released from pipelines to relieve pressure.Korea has established fuel cells as the top tier candidate for renewable energy credits in its national Green plan. By 2030, the plan is to have the capital of Seoul generating 48% of its clean energy via fuel cells.FuelCell Energy has the inside track on selling fuel cells to Korea. For one, the major Korean conglomerate Posco, one of the world's largest steelmakers and a major power utility in Korean, owns over 10% of FCEL shares and is an existing customer. For two, no other company makes fuel cells as powerful as FuelCell Energy's.For the current year, look for FuelCell to post all-time high revenues around $111 million while narrowing its net loss to 40 cents. Shares are low-priced, a 2, and with the prospect of major Korean orders to be announced, a possible home run.We're following FCEL closely in Cabot Green Investor and will be featuring more low-priced, high-growth companies in the months ahead.All the best,Brendan CoffeyFor Cabot Wealth AdvisoryEditor's Note: Brendan Coffey is the editor of Cabot Green Investor, which ended 2010 with a 24% return, easily trumping its benchmark, the WilderHill Clean Energy Index, which fell 7%!

Calls sellers quickly piled in, betting that the stock doesn't have what it takes to rebound. MXIM ended the session down a penny to $16.68. The shares have lost 22 percent of their value since topping out over $21 in mid-April.The August 17.50 calls were the most heavily traded strike, changing hands 3,067 times for $0.90 against open interest of 1,393 contracts. The August 15 calls were also active around the same time, as the selling drove premiums down from $2.50 to $2.40. Volume totaled 2,505, more than 80 times greater than open interest.The activity is consistent with a broadly negative tone in economically sensitive sectors such as technology. It follows heavy call selling in Xilinx the previous session.News has been less-than-stellar for Maxim, which reported in-line earnings and weak revenue on April 29.Overall options volume in the name was seven times greater than average yesterday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Carrying out the thought a little further, fixed income yields are at all time lows or close to it, while the S&P 500 is 27% below its 2007 peak and 25% below its March 2000 peak. It would be tough to argue that stocks aren't relatively cheaper than bonds--I've been writing for ages that I think bonds are way overpriced and so have been keeping maturities very short and obviously bonds, or anything for that matter, can stay very expensive for a long time and stocks can stay \"cheap\" for a long time.So the market is at a point where there are plenty of well run, fundamentally sound companies with high dividend yields such that an investor spending a decent amount of time looking for names could construct a portfolio whose yield was higher than, or at least competitive with a high quality bond portfolio.The group covers a lot of ground and depending on how someone might blend them together--note not all of the big SPX sectors are included--the yield could be 5% overall without whoring out to a bunch of companies with lousy stats, in my opinion, but you can draw your own conclusions.The above mix actually could be a pretty good start to building an equity portfolio for someone but the key is  portfolio. MXIM dropped about 60% from peak to trough but that was right in line with the iShares Semiconductor ETF (  ). LLY did a fair bit worse than the Health Care Sector SPDR (  ) on the way down, dropping as much as 50%, and at the start the market's snap back but has outperformed by a little in the last year. T has done a little better than the iShares Telecom ETF (  ) fairly consistently but it did drop 40% at its trough. Eni dropped almost 60% but that was much better than the iShares Italy (  ). BPT did much better than the Energy Sector SPDR (  ) which may not be an apples to apples but from its peak about six months after the SPX's peak BPT dropped 50%. Komercni Banka dropped about 60% from its peak, which sounds bad but the Financial Sector SPDR (  ) dropped 80% at its worst. Finally MO did a little worse than the Staples Sector SPDR (  ) dropping slightly more than 30%.The point of that last tedious paragraph is that there is nothing bond-like about those results. Relative to equities, the results above are not bad and you may agree with that or disagree but again there is nothing bond-like about them. After two 50% declines in ten years another one is unlikely (not impossible of course) but even in a normal bear market, like maybe a 30% decline with no reasonable fear of financial Armageddon, the above stocks would still go down plenty even if it were to be less than the market. Down 25% in a down 30% world is a fine equity market result, or not, but again it is not bond-like. For a little bit of context I am talking about individual bonds not bond funds some of which malfunctioned during the crisis and obviously I am assuming, perhaps unfairly, someone avoided financial sector bonds.As you read more commentaries along these lines it is crucial to understand there is a big difference between buying stocks that probably won't go down as much as the market and buying bonds. A portfolio that only owns stocks like the above should be expected to go down a lot during a bear market even if they were to go down less, a lack of recognition of this ahead of time would likely cause a lot of anguish.

The August 28s priced for $0.92 to $1 and were definitely purchased. The August 30s, fetched $0.37 to $0.40, but it isn't clear whether they were bought or sold.There are two possible explanations for the transaction, both of which are bullish. If the 30s were sold, then the trade was a bullish call spread with a net cost of about $0.55. It would earn a maximum profit of 263 percent if the semiconductor stock closes at or above $30 on expiration--a level MXIM hasn't seen in more than three years.The second explanation is that both strikes were bought. That would be even more bullish and reflect a belief that the shares will rally past $30, perhaps testing their 2007 high above $35.MXIM soared about 75 percent between September and February but has been drifting lower along with most other chip stocks since then. It ended the week with a 2.19 percent gain at $26.15.After the bell Thursday it reported revenue that beat expectations and profit that was in line with consensus. Guidance for the current quarter was better than expected, thanks to strong demand for smart phones and tablet computers.
