For additional information, please see our SEC filings and the Investor Relations page of paccar.com.I would now like to introduce Preston Feight. -- Well, good morning, everyone. Harry Skippers and I will update you on our first quarter results and our business highlights. I'd like to begin by expressing my sincere thanks and appreciation to all PACCAR employees for their dedication, hard work and their upbeat spirit as we tackle today's challenges and work toward a bright future. The trucking industry has been declared as an essential business. PACCAR employees, along with our dealers, are providing critical support to our customers who are delivering medical supplies, food and essential services to our communities around the world. I also want to express my gratitude and thanks to the millions of men and women who are working hard to support those affected by the pandemic. I'm pleased to share that the PACCAR Foundation has donated $2 million to United Way and other organizations to help our communities.Over the next few weeks, we're beginning a gradual resumption of truck production at selected factories. The specific restart timing for each plant and office location is being aligned with government directives, implementation of our work and social distancing measures, parts availability from suppliers and our business needs.During this gradual restart, our highest priority is on ensuring the health and safety of our employees and their families. Looking at our first quarter financial results. PACCAR achieved good revenues and net income. PACCAR's first quarter sales and financial services revenues were $5.2 billion, and first quarter net income was $359 million. PACCAR delivered 38,400 trucks during the first quarter. PACCAR Parts achieved quarterly revenues of $999 million. Parts pre-tax profits were a record $215 million, 3% higher than the same period last year.Truck and parts gross margins were 12.3% in the first quarter. The first quarter results included $50 million in higher accruals for product support costs. PACCAR Financial achieved pre-tax income of $48 million. DAF, Peterbilt and Kenworth delivered excellent heavy-duty market share in the first quarter. Kenworth and Peterbilt's U.S. and Canada market share increased to 30.4% compared to 30% for the full year of 2019. DAF's European market share increased to 16.7% in the first quarter compared to 16.2% last year. And in Brazil, in the above -tonne segment, first quarter DAF market share increased to a record 8.7% compared to 6.1% last year. Fantastic work. PACCAR has steadily grown market share over the long term by delivering excellent value to our customers in terms of product quality, innovative technologies and low total cost of ownership. The global macroeconomic environment is uncertain at this time.Therefore, we will not provide guidance on estimated truck industry market sizes. Next quarter's truck deliveries and gross margins and PACCAR parts revenues. Our employees are doing an excellent job managing through the pandemic. We are rigorously aligning cost to the changing market conditions, including reducing capital investment and research and development costs. As a result of the company's strong culture and discipline, we have achieved consecutive years of profitability and have a bright future.Harry Skippers will now provide an update on PACCAR Parts, PACCAR financial Services and other business highlights. Harry? -- Thanks, Preston. PACCAR continues to provide strong operating cash flow for reinvestment in future growth and distributions to stockholders. Operating cash flow was $416 million in the first quarter. PACCAR delivered an excellent return on invested capital of 23% over the last years due to a combination of strong profitability and a consistent, conservative approach to investing in the business. Yesterday, the PACCAR Board of Directors announced a regular quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share. PACCAR has a strong balance sheet with $4.3 billion of cash and marketable securities, no manufacturing debt and an A+ A credit rating. PACCAR Parts achieved quarterly revenues of $999 million, which is comparable to the same period last year.Parts pre-tax profits were a record $215 million, 3% higher than the first quarter last year. To drive growth, PACCAR has made consistent investments in parts distribution capacity and customer-focused technologies. PACCAR Parts will open new parts distribution centers this year. One is in Ponderosa Brazil, and the other one is in Las Vegas, Nevada. PACCAR Parts has also made significant investments in its e-commerce platform, which is benefiting our customers and dealers in this challenging time. PACCAR Financial services first quarter revenues were $384 million, and pre-tax income was $48 million, reflecting lower used truck sales results.Kenworth and Peterbilt truck resale values commanded 10% to 15% premium over competitors' trucks. PACCAR Financial is investing to increase its retail used truck center capacity worldwide, which enhances its used truck sales margins. PACCAR Financial recently opened a used truck center in Denton, Texas, and plans to open additional used truck ] in Prague, Czech Republic; and in Madrid, Spain this year. PACCAR Financial Services has excellent ongoing access to the debt markets, including commercial paper on a regular basis issuing commercial paper on a regular basis. During the first quarter, PACCAR issued-and -year term notes totaling $632 million.In addition, in early April, PACCAR Financial issued a $400 million three-year fixed rate note. We have reduced capital expenditures by $100 million to a range of $525 million to $575 million and have reduced research and development expenses by $45 million to a range of $265 million to $295 million, as our strong financial position enables us to continue investing in important capital and R&D projects in all market conditions. And finally, we thank our excellent, independent, Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF dealers for their support of our customers. Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF dealers are well capitalized and have invested $2.6 billion in their businesses in the last years. These investments continue to make a significant contribution to PACCAR's truck market share and PACCAR parts and financial services performance.Thank you. We'd be pleased to answer your questions.[Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann of Jefferies. Your line is open. -- Hey, good morning everybody Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe, Preston, can we go back to your opening comments. I'm curious about a little more detail about how you're thinking about reopening production because you mentioned a number of things there. You mentioned sort of local regulations, you mentioned product availability, and then you mentioned kind of market demand. So there's sort of buckets to think about there. But can you give us any more color on the rate of reopening that you might expect as we go forward? -- Hi, Stephen, this is Preston. I'm very glad to tell you that the most important thing as we think about restart is, again, I keep reemphasizing this is the health of our employees, their families, our concern for getting it right, making sure we take care of them. That's Number one, that's Number two, and that's Number three for us, actually. And then as we look about it, we obviously want to make sure that we have alignment with the government agencies. That's really important to us so that we're staying aligned with best practices for how we can reopen research society. It's also important that we think about our supply base and their readiness for the restart of our factories and make sure we stay aligned with them. And then, of course, our business needs. So all those things together are where we're thinking about it.And I can really pleased with the best practices that we put in place in the factories, as far as temperature taking for our employees, the distancing protocols, separation of the employees with spacing and barriers and then wearing mass and personal protective equipment and enhanced clinics. So all those things are going into our approach for reopening the factories. It is going to be a gradual reopening. It's going to be done on a location by location basis on a phased manner. We already started some this week. In fact, we're kind of in the start-up of operations in Europe and in Australia. And then we will work through the rest of our plants in the coming weeks. And make sure we take care of the employees and bring the truck factories back up and running. -- So would you expect to have everything back up and running at some level by the end of the quarter, perhaps, that's a good way to kind of put bookends around that? -- That's a long window, and I feel pretty good about that. I think we're thinking of sooner, but we obviously don't have the final answers, and we are working through that in a constructive way with the local agencies and supply base. -- Great. Thanks. -- You bet.Your next question comes from the line of Andy Casey of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. -- Thanks, and good to talk to everybody today. -- Good to talk to you too. -- I guess, following on Steve's question, PACCAR really has a strong supply chain management track record. You mentioned that that's of the factors. A couple of questions, if I may, about that. First, have you encountered any smaller suppliers running into liquidity issues? And then second, it seems like the world may be looking at kind of a piece mail reopening in terms of when to ease the current virus containment efforts. How much of an impact/challenge could that have or be to get your operations back up and running? -- Okay. Great question. It's a fun thing to for teams to be working through right now with our suppliers. We have such good communication with them right now. That it's really helpful to know when you can tell the relationships matter is we're paying attention to what they're doing and when their restart timings are. And large and small suppliers have been doing a really good job of keeping us informed of their readiness. And they're doing the same things we are. They're trying to take care of their employees, they're trying to make sure they stay and aligned with the governments, and then they're moving forward to start and so far, that's part of the whole puzzle we're putting together and getting the truck factors back up. -- Okay. And then just a question on the on the quarter in the truck segment, the decremental margins were somewhere around 25% and 26% revenue drop. It's not the highest PACCAR has ever seen, but it's kind of higher than typical. You mentioned product accrual was running high. But could you give us a little more color on what kind of growth the margin compression? I mean, obviously, some of it is the shutdown? -- Well, I think that, as you mentioned, we had the $50 million that we took the opportunity to book for the improvement of our continuous refinement of our engines. Our MX engine was a lot of that. We're doing some software and hardware upgrades on the engine. So that's something that we want to do is make sure that our customers keep having the best experience when it comes with their engines. And as far as what the future looks like, we're going to see how the pandemic works its way through the system. And that will certainly be something we're all watching closely. -- Okay. Thank you very much. -- You bet.Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. -- Hi, good morning everyone. And glad to hear you're all doing well. -- Good morning. -- I'm wondering if you could just give us an update on dealer inventory levels? There were pressing discussions that you had last quarter, obviously, a different environment, but I'm wondering if you could give us an update on the declines in dealer inventory levels in March and anticipated declines from here and in a conversation around timing of the restart? I'm wondering if that calculus has evolved at all given potentially an opportunity to lean out inventories before ramping up production? -- Sure, sure. Glad to. So the North American industry has roughly months in retail sales and inventory, and PACCAR has less than that. We have months retail sales through March for Kenworth and Peterbilt dealers. And of our months, roughly half of that is at body builders. So that's being worked on right now. And I'm sorry, inventory is in really good shape right now. -- Okay. And in terms of the parts part of the business, can you talk about what the cadence has been in April? Obviously, very steady performance in the March quarter. I'm wondering if you you would be willing to talk about what kind of trends you've seen so far in April? -- One of the things that's interesting, and this kind of gives a little help, I hope, is that 75% of all goods are moved by trucks. And so a lot of the trucking companies are really busy right now, and they're moving around the country, taking care of our communities. And as that's happening, those trucks end up consuming parts and so there was a lot of strong activity in March, and we still have activity going on in April, and we'll kind of watch how the quarter develops, but we expect our Parts team to continue to perform really well, and they have great programs. One of the things that's been nice to watch is their e-commerce programs and the way they're handling our customers and working directly with customers and dealers to support these critical needs is going really well. -- Okay. And then in terms of the operational discussion and the conversation you just had with Andy on the warranty program. So if we back out the warranty program, decremental margins would have been 20%. Is that the sort of run rate that we're comfortable thinking through? Or is the level of being shut down for most of April, if not all of April, does that throw that type of decremental margin math off kilter as we think about what this quarter might look like? -- I think that we're your assessment of the impact of the product support fees does match into the margin. But I would say that looking forward and what it's going to be going forward, we're going to watch how the situation develops. And when we get our factories running and what the state of the economy is in the second quarter. -- Okay. And maybe just a clarification on the warranty program. Was that just a onetime over-the-air software update or across the population? Or can you just give us some context behind what exactly that warranty item was? -- Well, we had the opportunity to optimize the performance of our trucks and engines, mostly on our MX engine from the 2017 to 2019 engines. And so that was hardware and software upgrades. And this we think we got that all covered and making sure that our customers have optimally performing trucks and engines, always part of our game plan. -- Okay. Thank you. -- You bet.Your next question comes from the line of Tim Thein of Citigroup. Your line is open. -- Thank you and good morning. -- Good morning. -- The first question I had was on loss provisions within the finco. And they were certainly higher than I was expecting, at least the absolute level was not obviously not directionally, but maybe if you could comment there in terms of is there a specific region or customer set that maybe you'd call out? And I'm just thinking about how that potentially looks going forward. Should we, at least shorter term, have a more challenging backdrop for truckers, at least in North America. So maybe just how to think about, again, loss provisions and what you experienced in the quarter? -- Yes, the $15 million increase in credit loss provision reflects the weaker economy, and a weaker economy under the new CECL accounting standards result in a more volatile number. So with that weak economy, the calculation resulted in a $15 million higher credit loss provision. If we look at the finance company, the portfolio is in really good shape. We have a very healthy mix of very good A and B customers. And past dues remain really low, currently less than 1%. So a finance company is in good shape, but the weak economy and the accounting standards drive most of that increase in credit loss reserve. -- Okay. Thanks Harry. Maybe just one last one. Preston, I'm curious from the Parts team, how I'm not sure how closely they follow it. But Mackay, and I know you're not talking or you're not giving guidance on part sales specifically, but it kind of jumped out at me. I saw Mackay put out a forecast the other day that they expect, and again, this not to say this aligns with PACCAR exactly. But I'm talking about parts demand to be down like 20% in the U.S. I'm just curious if you had any comments on that. -- Well, I don't really have any comments on Mackay's numbers. I know what we're watching is a team that's got great programs and really strongly positioned to support with not just parts, but knowledge, and they're doing a great job of that. And as I said, talking to a lot of customers and our dealers, there is a lot of activity still going out there and we'll support at the level that's needed. -- I got it. Thanks a lot.Our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. -- Hi. Good morning everybody. -- Good morning, Ann. -- Good morning. On the used equipment values, about 28% of your finance book is European. And most of that, I think, is probably guaranteed residuals. So can you talk about the used pricing in the Finco business and what that might manifest how that might manifest itself as we go forward here? -- Used truck prices in Europe came down a little bit in the first quarter. North America used prices was mostly flat, of course, down compared to where we were a year ago. Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks command 10% to 15% premium over our competitor vehicles. So we're in a really good shape from that perspective. But adding new truck retail centers opening one in Czech Republic this quarter, just added in Denton, taxes. The used truck inventories, as far as we can tell in Europe are a little bit higher than where they've been, especially for the industry. DAF's used truck inventory is in relatively good shape if you compare it to where the of the inventory the industry is. Anything you want to add? That's exactly right. I mean, we are we have a lower percentage of the inventory of used trucks in Europe than the industry does, and that puts us in good positions. -- But you didn't call out used prices in Europe being weaker than they were a quarter ago or weaker than they were last year. -- They were a little bit lower than a quarter ago and lower than a year ago. -- That's kind of industrywide there. -- That's industrywide. Yes. -- Okay. And then just on production cuts, can you give us any kind of direction in terms of the number of deliveries, truck deliveries you had in Q1? And any idea as you ramp back up what you would expect deliveries to be quarter-over-quarter? I mean, I know you can't see past the second quarter. But as you ramp, any direction, at least give us a ballpark for Q1 and then where we might think about Q2 being? -- Sure, Ann. We can talk a little bit about that and that deliveries were 38,400 for the three-month period. But as far as what we'll see going forward, like I said, I'd come back to is, our biggest focus right now is making sure that our employees are well cared for and as we watch that. And take care of that, then we'll ramp back up our production line that to the demand, and we'll see where that takes us in the second quarter. -- Okay, I'll leave it there in the interest of time. Thank you. -- Okay. Talk to you soon.Your next question comes from the line of David Raso of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. -- Hi, good morning. My question is sort of bigger picture. Trying to think about this period, the nuances of how this is different or similar than '08, '09, sort of how you what are the differences, the similarities between how you're handling this period and that period? With maybe things in particular, if you could address at a minimum. You mentioned in your prepared remarks, consecutive years of profitability. Obviously, back in '09, there were quarters that were basically around breakeven. Just wanted to see if you could address the idea of this being year number 82, just if you're willing to speak to that. Second, the gross margin declines roughly were kind of 14.5%, 15%, they dropped down to 8% to 8.5% in 2009.Just trying to get some sense of magnitude, what's different about the business model, more parts, whatever it may be. And lastly, the special dividend, your balance sheet, the equipment company was still net cash back in '09, but you still chose to greatly reduce the special dividend year-over-year. Just wanted to try to lead those key pieces in answering the question of the differences and similarities of today versus the Great Recession? -- Sure, David. Good to talk with you. First off, you got to start by thinking that we did succeed in '08 and '09. And as we look at the company right now, as we sit here in 2020, we're an even stronger company than we were there. We have $4.3 billion in cash sitting on our balance sheet. We have great liquidity. We have great access to liquidity in the market still. That hasn't changed during this time frame. Our Parts business has grown over that more than a decade. And it's just a foundational part of our business and does a great job. And we have an experienced leadership team that has been through a lot of cycles, and we know how to manage things. We know how to control costs, and we have amazing trucks and engines out there.The MX engine is doing a great job and it's 43% of our build. So that's helpful to us from a parts standpoint. Just the business that we've built is really strong and is doing a good job of taking care of our customers. And freight continues to move in this environment. So we feel positive about our future and the products we have on the field and those that we're developing. -- But could you address those issues to some degree? Just the idea of however you feel the flex in your costs, how the situation may be? And even just your framework, sounds like you do expect, obviously, some uneven, but at least some reopening of the factories in the not too in the future. Can we look at '09as a guide that if you're able to stay profitable in that environment? This should be similar? The gross margins getting cut in half, roughly a little bit better than that is a framework and also the handling of the special dividend. If you can just give some parameters of the difference now versus then for those issues in particular. -- Well, let's just take the last one you mentioned on dividends, and we announced our dividends yesterday for the first quarter at $0.32 a share, which is a strong indicator of what we've done. We have a great history of dividends, and we look forward to what our future is going to be, and that's a Board decision. We take care of that as we progress through the year based upon the results. I think I don't think that it's a fair thing to think of it as an 2008, 2009 kind of a thing. They're just different. Each situation is unique. And what we've got is freight being moved and kind of giving you the kind of the truth of the matter is the freight is being moved, our company is well built, we have a great position in terms of our liquidity our cash position, our product investments, our trucks are the best in the world, and that feels pretty good. -- And the comfort in the larger parts business and a business that's more on your own vertically integrated drivetrain then back then, is that something else that we should take a little more comfort in versus '09, but at the same time, the unevenness of the production, it's really less of almost your decision that when you can ramp up. I mean, is that the yin and yang here, better about parts, a little more uncertain about the truck margins just given in a way a bit of out of your hands? -- Sure. We have the stronger foundational parts market. We have growth in our engine business, right? And in 2008, 2009, it wasn't here in North America. So that's good. I think the other thing to think about the share growth over that time frame has been significant. So we've had really strong share growth over that time, which contributes extra volume to us. And Packard does a great job. Our team is so good at adjusting the business, both in capital and expense side to think about how the business should be run. And so we really do adjust to the market conditions. -- All right. Thank you very much. I appreciate your time. -- You bet, David.Your next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss of BMO. Your line is open. -- Hey guys, how's it going? -- Good Joel, good talk to you. -- Yeah, nice to hear your voice as well. And so just to follow-up on kind of the thrust of Ann and David's questioning, does your intelligence, like what you know and see today and here, does that give you a sense that by the end of the second quarter, you'll be able to give us more a more whatever it is, like a clearer view of what the rest of the year looks like, and how things play out? -- I think that's as a general sense, it seems like by the next quarter gets through us. We'll have a lot more information than we do today. And we'll share with you what we can at that point. -- And then I wonder if you could give us a little bit of a sense like you're kind of hinting at flexibility in the factories. And every time you walk through, there's fewer and fewer people or there's more automation, whatever the right way to say it is. Can you give us a sense of some of the internal focus points you guys are kind of using this pandemic as an opportunity to come out of this situation stronger over the next or years than you were going into it? -- Well, I think what I look at is the first thing comes to my mind is, when we go to our factories, when I go to our factories, and I meet with our people, whether it's in a distribution center or a truck factory or anywhere, is just how impressive they are. And we have such an incredible group of people, and they're just exceptional. They're just exceptional people. I'm so proud of them and what they're doing. So they're the ones that are every day thinking of new ways to optimize our efficiencies and effectiveness, and they do it every day. And they continue in that vein, and we use Six Sigma as a great tool for ourselves and optimizing, and we'll continue doing that. This is accretive time for us as we look at truck production and how we come back, and we'll learn some new things, and they'll be helpful to improving the business and making us even more effective and efficient as we look forward. -- Your employees are going to make a recording of this and come back to you and ask for a raise next January. Thank you very much. -- They are the best in the world. They're fantastic.Your next question comes from the line of David Leiker of Baird. Your line is open. -- Good morning, everyone. -- Good morning. -- I want to try and dig through a little bit of kind of the segments within the trucking space and your customers. I mean there some parts that are strong, consumer-focused, package delivery-focused. There are some that are really weak, energy and auto related. Can you talk a little bit about that customer mix for you, for your products and how that would compare to the industry overall in general? -- Sure. You did a good job of summarizing what's really going on. If you look at refrigerated carriers or protein haulers, they obviously have just seen a shift in where their business is going. So those long-haul trucking companies that are delivering that are doing well. Locational segment is where we're a market leader, the market leader. And that business has been strong, and I mentioned that part of our inventory is that body builders right now. So that inventory is being built and being ready for production for a summer season. And I think as you look at some of the over-the-road trucking companies, it varies by company.Talking with some of them, they have a good base of customers and those that have a good base of customers. They're really well positioned. And there, as you said, the energy sector has been lower, but the yang of that ying is that fuel prices are down 20%. And if fuel prices are 1/3 of the operating cost for a trucking company, then that's helping them from their operating models as well. So that's kind of you characterized it well, and that's a little bit more information on it. -- Okay. Great. Thank you. That's all I needed. -- Thanks.Your next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi of Bank of America. Your line is open -- Good morning, guys. -- Good morning, Ross. -- I had a two questions. First on the PDCs and the additional ones that you're going to add, can you quantify at all how big of a global increase in parts footprint that this will represent when you open them? And do you worry at all about adding parts distribution capacity in the middle of a recession? And I'm trying to just get at, like how many you guys have added a lot of distribution centers over the last to years, and granted that market's not going to move like as volatile as the overall truck cycle. But if we're in a slower economy for a longer period of time, do you bump upping will limit at some point? Is that how much you can continue to expand that distribution network? -- Sure. We have distribution centers. We'll be adding more. I was down in the Las Vegas facility a couple of weeks ago, the new one. It's just beautiful. And I know the employees are excited to move in there because we're talking about it. I think one of the things that's happening is there's always opportunity to gain share, and we continue to use those distribution centers and the best practices around them to gain share. For example, if our distribution centers are more closely aligned to our dealer body, then we're able to deliver more overnight parts to our customers and keep their uptime at maximum levels, which is one of our key objectives, and that gives us a competitive advantage against the market. So that's part of the thinking. It's not just about parts and storing. And it's about getting them to the customers as quickly as possible, and that's going been really successful for us in helping the parts team grow the business. -- Okay. So is it fair are they all fairly similar in size if you're adding two on a network of 18? Is this sort of like a 10% increase? And will the business benefit from just some type of pipeline fill? And I don't know if that would be a second quarter event or a second half event that will help continue to support the top line for the parts business this year? -- Sure you're right in saying it will continue to support the top line growth for the business. And yes, roughly 10%. There is some variance in the size of the PDCs, but they're roughly the right order, same orders of magnitude. -- Okay. Got you. And then just lastly, can you quantify your energy exposure? I realize it's tricky, but maybe at the very least, you could tell us what portion of your U.S. and Canadian dealer network is located in the Gulf region or other energy dependent regions? And anything like that would be really useful. -- Yes. We have a very diversified portfolio. It's not concentrated overly in the energy sector. So the dealers that have there are some dealers that obviously have more exposure, but our dealers are doing just such a great job of building their businesses that they have good absorption, good parts and service businesses throughout a diversified customer bases and even for themselves. And so dealer body is in really good shape and managing that well. -- Okay, thanks. -- You bet.Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. -- Hi, Good morning, and I'm glad everyone is healthy, OK in this environment. I guess just know two questions. One, can you just talk to, like on the truck side in Europe and in the U.S. like what you're hearing from your customers in terms of trends in April and understanding you don't want to give an industry forecast, but what your customers are sort of telling you how they're thinking about the year? Because that would imply you're probably managing your business for that for whatever they're telling you?And then I guess just my second question, understanding you're taking initiatives to cut R&D and capex. But how do you think sort of the coronavirus impacts people's view around alternative technologies like EV or fuel cell relative to diesel, in particular, with diesel prices lower now? Perhaps we focus more on economics. So if you could help give color on that, that would be helpful. Thank you. -- Yes. Sure. Good to talk to you, Jamie. I'd say from a customer standpoint, we do talk to a lot of our customers and the dealers and keep track what's going on. And there is, as we said before, some segments are doing well. And some are experiencing moderate slowdowns, and that's to be expected in a situation with this much dynamic factoring going into it. But we have a good customer base, and they do a good job managing their business. So they're making the adjustments and there's some trucks that are not as fully utilized. That's true, but I'm pretty impressed with how they talk about their business and their customer base.And again, they're an essential part of our economy, and they will continue to move freight and are continuing to move freight. So that's pretty important to keep perspective on. From a tech standpoint and an R&D capex alignment to that. And when I look at that, I'd say we have some really neat programs going on. And we're continuing on some of the exciting programs that we have within our portfolios, and some of those are R&D related. So whether that's battery electric vehicles work that we're doing, that work's going to continue. We're going to keep moving along and doing the critical things that are going to build a bright future for our company and provide our customers the lowest operating cost possible. So kind of a bit of a look at what's going on. -- Okay. Thank you. Appreciate the color.Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher of UBS. Your line is open. -- Thanks. Good morning, guys. -- Good morning, Steven. -- I just you guys called out some nice market share gains across the regions. What is your order share in backlog, tell you about what your market share of retail and production might be over the next few quarters? And are there any regional differences? -- Well, yes, I think we have seen good market share gains. As we mentioned, the 30.4% in the U.S. and 16.7% in Europe and really strong 8.7% in Brazil. And in the medium side, also good growth in both Europe and North America. So that's been good. And as far as what order intake has been, I think, in the last month we have numbers for what we had was March, and we had 38% of the order intake in the month of March. We're in a good position. -- Okay. -- So more color on Europe. I think the market share growth to 16.7% for DAF has been in most markets, especially the U.K. In the U.K., our share in the first quarter has grown to 35%. So we're really benefiting from the fact that we have an excellent factory in Ley Land and are able to build our trucks for the U.K. and the U.K. -- Okay. And then you have some plans to open up some international used truck centers. How much better do you expect the used margins to be at these company-owned retail centers versus any other used sales channels that are out there? -- With the those used truck centers, one of the benefits that we have is that they predominantly sell to retail customers. And the margins we make when we sell a used truck to a retail customer are significantly higher than selling them to wholesalers or other customers. So those used truck incentives, they're really giving us a very nice return on our investment there. -- Okay. Thanks very much.Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weber of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. -- Hey, good morning, guys. Hope you are well -- Good morning. -- Well, actually, I wanted to follow-up on Steve's last question on the used sales mix. Is there any color you can provide on sort of where you see the channel mix, where it's today, where you think it's going as far as retail versus wholesale or ] anything that we can kind of used to frame what the opportunity there is to get the margins up? -- What I look at is the PACCAR Financial team has done a really good job of building this used truck center network. And we've seen even in the U.S., an uptick in the recent time of more retail activity flowing through the used truck centers. And as we build like the one in Prague and expand our capabilities, that just creates an outlet for the strong customer demand for PACCAR products in the used market. And it gives them a good place to go to get a young truck that's going to serve their needs really well, and they're happy to buy those trucks from us because they know what they're getting. That helps values. -- Right. Okay. And then sorry if I missed this, I but have you address have you talked to just the new truck pricing environment? I think last quarter, you said it was up about 2%. Just wondering if anything has changed, given the macro and also the weakness in Spain, if anybody if any of your competitors are doing anything irrational? Or is that you're still seeing positive pricing on the new truck side? -- Yes. Well, I'll let you talk to the competitors and what they do that's irrational. But for us, what we see is we've been steadiness in pricing. And I think there continues to be a strong desire to have the best trucks, which are Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF. -- Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much guys. Appreciate it.Your next question comes from the line of Courtney Yakavonis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. -- Good morning guys. Good to talk to you. I was wondering if you could just share with us a little bit more detail on how to think about some of the fixed costs associated with the plant shutdowns and then also with the plant reopenings. And if any of the protocols that you're enacting that could last for a bit longer might impact the cost basis over the next 12 to months. -- Sure. As far as the protocols we're implementing, come back to the statement because it's core to us is our biggest focus right now is making sure that our employees are cared for and operate in a healthy and safe environment. And so those protocols, things like temperature testing when they enter the facilities and making sure there's feet between them or 1.5 meters in Europe that we have put spacing and barriers where we're building the trucks, the people are wearing mass that we're doing great cleaning and that we're comparing all of our practices that I just described to other industry leaders to make sure we have the best practices in place. Those will carry on as long as they need to, to make sure that our employees are healthy and protected.And they're involved in the process and want them to feel comfortable with their environments, and that's really important to us. And then as far as the costs that we experience, right, we're a company that's always thinking about capital cost and expense costs and looking for ways to reduce them. And our teams are fully focused on that. And looking that's why you see the reduction in the capex spending plans that we outlined in our opening comments and why we're looking at R&D reductions that we can take, just so that the business is optimized and set up for this industry cycle. -- Is there anything you could share with that's just maybe about factory overhead costs that might not be getting to cut just for the weeks that you're shut down? And then if there's any difference between the shutdowns in North America versus in Europe? -- Yes, there the difference is that we have furloughed some employees during the stopping point, and that's what we've done in North America. In Europe, in the Netherlands, we have a good relationship with our unions there, with our employees there and with the government there, and they've been able to help us support people still working during the shutdown in the overhead side of the business, and that's great because we're continuing to make progress in these practices to keep a healthy and safe environment. And even on the engineering side, they're continuing to work on new projects and processes that are aligned with government support programs. -- And the support programs are in place, not only in the Netherlands but also in Belgium and the U.K. and qualifies to all those programs. -- And then just lastly, your parts margins did hold up very well this quarter. You mentioned that you've been building out the e-commerce platform, but are you seeing any structural changes that you think might last in terms of how your customers are interacting with that business in this environment? -- I think that this may hasten the move toward more and more e-commerce in the parts business. But and our team has built a great system to make that available for the customers and for the dealers to work with, and we continue to use the e-commerce and the MDI systems to help everybody have the right parts at the right places at the right time, so we can make sure our customers uptime is optimized. There may be a little bit of a move toward that furthering, and that's good for PACCAR and good for our parts team. -- Great. Thanks. -- You bet.Your next question comes from the line of Matt Elkott of Cowen. Your line is open. -- Good morning and thank you. So the truckload industry, which is an important part of your customer base has been dealing with some headwinds like rising insurance premiums and low freight rates, which was resulting in a lot of market exits. But now they also have the tailwind of lower diesel prices. So my question is if we start to see an economic rebound, while at the same time, oil prices lag and remain relatively low, which would be good for the health of the truckload industry, do you have any sense of how quickly that could translate into higher orders? And are you happy that you could see a benefit from that? -- That's a good commentary you offered. I think it's a truth of the confluence of the pandemic and the low oil prices and the fact that customers continue our customers, trucking companies, continue to deliver freight. And when they're delivering freight, they're putting miles on trucks. And so that bodes well for us in the future as they're consumable. And over time, we'll need to replace them. -- That makes sense. And then just one follow-up on the balance sheet side. You don't have manufacturing debt, but you do obviously go to debt markets in your Financial Services segment. If this economic crisis intensifies and morphs into a financial crisis, do you think you may have to borrow on your manufacturing segment for your Financial Services segment? -- So PACCAR has a very strong balance sheet with $4.3 billion in cash, a strong A+, A credit rating and no manufacturing debt. And that is exactly how we like it. -- And we've had good access to the markets. -- We do. -- We have great credit ratings and good access to the markets and we've had no trouble in getting mid-term notes and our issuances in the first quarter were $632 million, and we did an issuance in April for $400 million, and we've got really good positions to support our financial services business. -- Great. Thank you very much.Your next question comes from the line of Felix Boeschen of Raymond James. Your line is open. -- Hey morning, thanks for the time everybody. I really just have a quick question around how to think about the parts business going forward. I think obviously, trucks still moving as a positive for the business. But outside of looking at industry truck utilization, was there anything we should think about around the strong 1Q performance in that business? Dealers building parts inventory given some uncertainty ahead? Or any color on where you think inventory levels might be today? -- Sure. I think that the most significant factor is the team at PACCAR Parts has done a great job with alongside of our dealers of having the right kind of systems in place to support the customers. And so they become a go-to organization in these times. And they're doing a great job of beating the demand there. And I think that they're obviously, as the situation is dynamic, people were looking at that. And so they want to make sure that have parts on the shelf to take care of the customers, and they've done that. And as we move forward, they're consuming those parts and they'll reorder. -- Thank you. -- You bet.Your Next question comes from the line of Faheem Sabeiha of Longbow Research. Your line is open. -- Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just for starters. As far as the social distancing and the staggered shift that you guys are employing in the factories, would that have any impact on producing capacity? -- Excuse me, what was the last part? -- Would that have any impact on production capacity? -- I think that we always we think that in the market we're in, we have sufficient capacity and even bringing in these great best practices, we'll have sufficient capacity to build for our customers' needs. -- Okay. And can you provide some color around the order intake and cancellations that you've been seeing so far, at least through April, I just want to understand if your backlog is essentially holding or shrinking at this point? -- Yes. I think that through the month of April, our backlog actually improved and increased because we weren't building trucks. And so we do have good backlog through the second quarter. And we'll watch how that carries on. -- Okay. Thanks. -- You bet.Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research. Your line is open. -- Thank you and good morning. My question is just on your visibility into any future supply chain disruption from all the obvious impacts. Does that feel like a major uncertainty still? Or is your visibility in the supply chain and how your suppliers are working, seeing less volatile and less of a disruptive risk? -- You bet. We're working really close with all suppliers, have daily contact with them, and we have a great strong supply base, and we choose them further strength and continue just alignment with them so that when we restart, they're ready to go and aligned with us being ready to go. So these are daily conversations. There's nothing that seems unstable right now. It's just making sure they put the best practices and care for their people, which they want to do and line up with the government directives. -- Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And you've made a number of helpful comments on parts. Are you able to say from telematics or otherwise, how far miles driven or down in April, just to give a sense of real-time pulse the economy? -- Yes. That's interesting. We do have in North America, all of our trucks are connected. So the people can work trucks are connected and we watch vehicle miles traveled and we watch utilization of the fleet. And while it's down just a little bit, it's also holding up pretty well and remains at high levels over the historical framework. -- Okay. Thank you. -- You bet.Your next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea of Vertical Research. Your line is open. -- Hi. Good morning. -- Good morning. -- With respect to the facility restart and you talked about deploying safety protocols and government regulations and supply chain. Can you talk about any government regulations today that prevent you from operating? And are there protocols that you have not yet deployed or are sort of facilities ready to operate and regulations aren't restricting you, and it's just about sort of comfort level with supply chain? -- Well, we continue to work in alignment with the initial declarations, which is that trucking is an essential business and the parts supply is an essential business. So that's one of the things that we work with. And then the other is to make sure that these best practices we put in for our employees are sufficient and are robust and protect them well. And those things in alignment are what define our restart strategy. -- And so you're still rolling out some of those safety protocol actions at facilities? -- Indeed, we are and staying lined up with each state and their directives as well. -- Got it. Okay. Thanks very much. -- You bet.Your next question comes from the line of Rob Salmon of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. -- Hey. Good morning, guys and thanks for taking our questions. -- Thank you. -- So I guess kind of pigging back on the adjustments you guys have made to the factories to obviously protect the employees and respect social distancing. Is there any cost quantification that you can kind of help us think about whether it's the impact to gross margins? Or kind of incremental cost per piece associated with the cleaning, with the temperature taking as well as phasing out employees a little bit more than we would historically have seen? -- No, there's nothing that's in concrete. We take the temperatures of the employees. We're going to as they come back into the factories, preproduction, make sure everybody is healthy when they can work. That's good for everybody. And then the teams are doing a really good job of just bringing in safety protocols that work with truck production, and that overlay has gone very well in our factories where we're starting up. -- And like Preston has said, the Number one priority is the safety of our employees. And there might be some costs associated with that, but that's not the Number one player. -- Of course, you guys made that very clear and we'll kind of keep that in mind. As we're looking forward or as we look through kind of the first quarter, can you give us a sense of what the parts revenue cadence was by month? Like did we see any sort of major difference in your parts revenue in the month of March relative to January, February? -- It was relatively flat through the quarter. I mean, there were weeks and differences by weeks, but it was relatively flat through the first for each of the months. -- That's helpful. And then on the provisions for the losses on the receivables, with the step-up that we saw, obviously, kind of tied to the economy. Were you seeing any difference in terms of the receivables that you have for the customers relative to dealers and kind of of those channels? Was there was there a big customer impact? I'm just trying to better understand as we think about the impact looking forward. -- No. We talked about the past dues being really low. And most customers are in a good position to pay their bills on time. Finance company is doing well. We're financing a stable portion of the trucks that we sell. And with all good well dated customers that pay their bills. -- Appreciate it, guys. -- Yeah. You bet. Have a good day.Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Loop Capital Management. Your line is open. -- Thank you very much and thank you for taking my question. I guess two questions. Number one, following up on what Jamie was asking earlier, is it more a deferral on capex and R&D or more of a structural adjustment, where maybe we're not going to do certain things. And where do you think in terms of the I think Jamie was hinting is the EV movement slowing down because low fuel prices and pushing things out. But in terms of looking at R&D programs or capital spending, where is the flex? And kind of what do you think should be pushed out in this kind of environment? -- Okay. Happy to answer that question with you. So I would say that is whether deferred or canceled, we have a great portfolio of projects. They all have good returns and provide values to our customers. And so with those projects, often what we're looking at right now is, can we do a phase now? Can we postpone a phase to a later point? Very few that will cancel. We just look at how well they can be done and if we can be more efficient at doing them. And as that lies into the EV movement or autonomous vehicles or connected vehicles, those technologies continue to be progressing into the truck industry in the coming years, and PACCAR is going to continue to be a leader in offering EV vehicles to our customers and developing autonomous vehicles, leveraging partnerships and working with their suppliers and doing in-house development so that we can have all of those ready when our customers want them, and we'll continue to have that leadership position. -- Okay. And that answers both questions. Thank you. -- You bet. Thank you.And there are no further questions in queue at this time. Are there any additional remarks from the company? -- Yes. I guess I'd just like to close by saying thank you to everybody for the call. And again, just to recognize the outstanding people in our company that are doing such a fantastic job. And then also to recognize those people that are handling and managing and working with the COVID situation around the world and our heartfelt thoughts and prayers are with them, and we're all going to come through this stronger in the final analysis.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- \n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In just the few days since his company began publicly trading, Milton has compared his Nikola to e-commerce monolith , warned  he's looking to , and then didn't balk when asked about an analyst's suggestion that the maker of hybrid semi-trucks could be worth more than $100 billion.Musk, chief of budding big rig rival  , responded because ... well, that's what he does.

Electric cars are cool, and electric trucks solve a major problem. It's also fun to watch two bigger-than-life CEOs spar while wearing their egos on their sleeves.Image source: Getty Images.There's an incredibly important question not enough people are asking about the matter yet, however, while they're distracted by the juicy headlines. That is: How much money is there to be made by manufacturing the tractors that pull trailers across the world's roads?Answer: More than you might think.It's a cyclical (and somewhat psychological) business. S&P Global estimates worldwide sales of semitrailers reached 2.3 million last year, falling just a bit from 2018's record-breaking figure of closer to 2.4 million. At the time, trucking companies were anticipating a swell of sustained demand into 2020.That demand wasn't sustained, of course. Even without the effect of the COVID-19 contagion, fleet owners began to feel they overbought. To correct their course, S&P Global reckons the industry will only purchase around 1.7 million new rigs this year, followed by a 10% uptick in 2021.Given the numbers for all four years, we can roughly say heavy-duty haulers sell at a clip of about 2 million per year.As for their retail cost, the sticker price can vary widely for a new truck. Frost & Sullivan pegs the figure between $110,000 and $125,000. A look at dealers' lots suggests many drivers and fleet owners will pay in excess of $150,000 for a new semitrailer, jibing with the numbers Tesla was using to make its cost-comparison with its rig that was first revealed in 2017. Tesla's truck will cost more, starting at $150,000 with some models expected to sport a sticker price of $200,000 each, although they're cheaper to operate in the long run when factoring in fuel savings.But, let's conservatively say the typical cost of a new diesel rig is $125,000. At that price, multiplied by next year's estimated unit sales of around 1.9 million, the so-called \"big rig\" market is worth about $240 billion per year. That's big.Nikola and Tesla won't be able to capture all of that market, of course. Not only will the two electric semitrailer makers -- Tesla's is 100% battery-powered, while Nikola's is a hybrid engine sometimes  -- be competing with one another, they're competing with other companies also venturing into the battery-powered heavy-hauling arena. Truck name Freightliner is working on an all-electric hauler that's expected to go into production next year. Kenworth, owned by  , as well as Geely-owned Volvo are also getting the electric truck game, and while both are behind Nikola and Tesla on this front, they're not miles behind the leaders of the relatively new category.Then there's the matter of logistics. Although the world will need around its typical 2 million new semitrailers next year, S&P Global predicts the North American market will only need around 200,000 new ones next year, up from this year's expected 150,000. Europe usually buys about 100,000 more than the North American market does in any given year. Electric rigs can certainly be shipped overseas, but it's not easy or particularly cheap to deliver an 80,000-pound metal monster across an ocean.Ergo, the easy market will be somewhat limited to near where Nikola and Tesla are making their battery-powered trucks. That's Fremont, California, for Tesla, though it also needs components from its Sparks, Nevada, facility. Nikola operates production facilities in Arizona and Germany. But it may ultimately be easier to set up multiple production facilities all over the world than to try to serve the whole market from only one or two locations.Still, even a fraction of a $240 billion sliver of the  is a nice chunk of change. Even a 10% share of the market translates into more than $20 billion worth of annual revenue for a name able to garner that much share from the mostly diesel market.On that note, Tesla indicated as far back as 2018 that it was sitting on orders for more than 2,000 of its electric rigs, while Nikola reports it had to stop taking orders after preorders reached a retail value of around $14 billion. The backlog was simply getting too big. There may be enough room for both companies to thrive with their  diesel-burning semitrailers.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $62.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $60.00 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of PCAR, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $67.10/share today.\n\nBecause the $62.50 strike represents an approximate 7% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if PCAR shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for PACCAR Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.

Not only will the two electric semitrailer makers -- Tesla's is 100% battery-powered, while Nikola's is a hybrid engine sometimes  -- be competing with one another, they're competing with other companies also venturing into the battery-powered heavy-hauling arena. Truck name Freightliner is working on an all-electric hauler that's expected to go into production next year. Kenworth, owned by  , as well as Geely-owned Volvo are also getting the electric truck game, and while both are behind Nikola and Tesla on this front, they're not miles behind the leaders of the relatively new category.Then there's the matter of logistics. Although the world will need around its typical 2 million new semitrailers next year, S&P Global predicts the North American market will only need around 200,000 new ones next year, up from this year's expected 150,000. Europe usually buys about 100,000 more than the North American market does in any given year. Electric rigs can certainly be shipped overseas, but it's not easy or particularly cheap to deliver an 80,000-pound metal monster across an ocean.Ergo, the easy market will be somewhat limited to near where Nikola and Tesla are making their battery-powered trucks. That's Fremont, California, for Tesla, though it also needs components from its Sparks, Nevada, facility. Nikola operates production facilities in Arizona and Germany. But it may ultimately be easier to set up multiple production facilities all over the world than to try to serve the whole market from only one or two locations.Still, even a fraction of a $240 billion sliver of the  is a nice chunk of change. Even a 10% share of the market translates into more than $20 billion worth of annual revenue for a name able to garner that much share from the mostly diesel market.On that note, Tesla indicated as far back as 2018 that it was sitting on orders for more than 2,000 of its electric rigs, while Nikola reports it had to stop taking orders after preorders reached a retail value of around $14 billion. The backlog was simply getting too big. There may be enough room for both companies to thrive with their  diesel-burning semitrailers.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Nikola Corporation wasn't one of them!

Below is a chart showing PCAR's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $60.00 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 50%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).   Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 13.32% boost of extra return to the investor, or 20.42% annualized, which we refer to as the YieldBoost.\n\n\nThe implied volatility in the put contract example is 54%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 53%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 252 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $58.58) to be 34%.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Mr. Ken Hastings, PACCAR's Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Hastings, please go ahead. -- Good morning. We would like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name is Ken Hastings, PACCAR's Director of Investor Relations and joining me this morning are Preston Feight, Chief Executive Officer; Harrie Schippers, President and Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Barkley, Senior Vice President and Controller.As with prior conference calls, we ask that any members of the media on the line participate in a listen-only mode. Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including general, economic and competitive conditions that may affect expected results. For additional information, please see our SEC filings in the Investor Relations page of paccar.com. I would now like to introduce Preston Feight. -- Good morning. Harrie Schippers and I will update you on our excellent fourth quarter and record full year 2019 results and business highlights. Thanks to PACCAR's outstanding employees around the world, 2019 was the best year in the company's 114 year history. PACCAR achieved record revenues of $25.6 billion and record net income of $2.39 billion, a 9.3% after-tax return on revenues. PACCAR strong financial performance in 2019 benefited from PACCAR Parts record pre-tax profits of $831 million and PACCAR Financial Services pre-tax profits of $299 million. PACCAR has achieved 81 consecutive years of net income and a total shareholder return in 2019 of 45%. The company has paid a dividend every year since 1941. In 2019, PACCAR declared dividends of $3.58 per share a 16% increase over 2018. Total dividends declared were a record $1.24 billion.PACCAR's fourth quarter revenues were $6.1 billion and fourth quarter net income was $531 million. PACCAR delivered 45,700 trucks during the fourth quarter compared to 49,300 in the third quarter. There were fewer build days and lower build rates in North America compared to the third quarter. [Technical Issues] remained steady.The U.S. economy performed well in 2019, which contributed to a strong truck market. In 2019, U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck retail sales were 309,000 units, the second highest truck sales in history. During 2019, Kenworth and Peterbilt combined market share increased to 30% compared to 29.4% in the prior year. In 2020, the U.S. economy is expected to grow by about 2%. The new U.S. MCA and China Phase 1 trade agreements could provide upside in the economy and are good for PACCAR. We estimate that 2020 U.S. and Canada Class 8 truck market to be in a range of 230,000 to 260,000 vehicles. European above 16-tonne truck registrations were 320,000 vehicles in 2019, reflecting continued robust customer demand after several years of steady economic growth. DAF delivered a strong 16.2% market share. In 2020, the European economies are projected to continue growing and we expect another excellent truck market with above 16-tonne registrations in a range of 260,000 to 290,000 vehicles.I would like to recognize PACCAR's high performing Kenworth, Peterbilt, and DAF dealers who are the best in the industry and important contributors to our success. Truck and parts gross margins were 14.4% in the fourth quarter. Truck pricing increased during the quarter, more than offsetting costs. In the first quarter, we expect deliveries to be 5% to 7% lower than the fourth quarter due to normalized markets and build rates in North America. First quarter truck and parts gross margins are estimated to be around 14%. PACCAR continues to take a rigorous approach to controlling costs throughout the business cycle and delivers industry-leading operating margins.Other 2019 accomplishments included PACCAR delivering a record 199,000 trucks worldwide. Kenworth, Peterbilt, and DAF expanding the range of battery electric, hybrid, and hydrogen fuel cell trucks in field testing with customers; and South American deliveries increasing by 60%. The company's focus on sustainable business practices were recognized by the environmental reporting firm CDP. For the second consecutive year, PACCAR achieved an A rating, which puts us in the top 2% of more than 8,000 companies which report to CDP. PACCAR is one of only 35 companies in the United States to earn the A rating. In addition, we're proud that Peterbilt, Kenworth and PACCAR Parts were recognized as top workplaces for women by the organization Women in Trucking. Harrie Schippers will now provide an update on PACCAR Parts, PACCAR Financial Services, and PACCAR's investments in future growth. -- Thanks, Preston. In 2019, PACCAR Parts generated record annual revenues of more than $4 billion and record annual pre-tax profit of $831 million. Annual parts revenue grew 5% and profit grew 8% compared to 2018. Parts fourth quarter revenues were $994 million and quarterly pre-tax profit was a strong $205 million.PACCAR has steadily increased its truck and engine market share over the years, resulting in a greater number of PACCAR trucks and engines in operation. At the same time, PACCAR has consistently expanded its network of parts distribution centers such as the ones opening this year in Las Vegas, Nevada, and Ponta Grossa, Brazil. Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF dealers have made large investments to increase their service capacity. The growing part of PACCAR trucks and power trains and the enhanced parts distribution and service network grant [Phonetic] future long-term growth. In 2020, we estimate part sales to grow by 4% to 6%.PACCAR Financial Services achieved 2019 records in annual revenues of $1.48 billion, new business volume of $5.6 billion, and portfolio assets of $16.1 billion. The portfolio continues to perform well with low past dues and low credit losses. Fourth quarter pre-tax income was $68 million, the same as in the third quarter. PACCAR Parts and PACCAR Financial Services profit contributions enhance PACCAR's financial results through all phases of the business cycle. I'm pleased to share that in 2019, PACCAR was recognized for its products and manufacturing innovations. DAF earned Truck of the Year awards in the U.K., Poland, Czech Republic, and Slovakia and the Green Truck Logistics Solution Award in Germany.Kenworth Chillicothe and Peterbilt Denton each earned a prestigious 2019 Manufacturing Leadership Award from the National Association of Manufacturers. At the CES Technology Show in Las Vegas earlier this month, PACCAR showcased a Level 4 autonomous vehicle and two battery electric trucks. We had a terrific turnout of people interested in PACCAR technology and the opportunity to see the trucks first-hand. Kenworth, Peterbilt, and DAF have each announced that they will begin producing alternative powertrain trucks in the next 12 to 18 months. PACCAR is a leader in all powertrain technologies that drive our industry including diesel, battery, hybrid, and hydrogen fuel cell. PACCAR invested a record $744 million in capital and and $327 million in R&D expenses last year. In 2020, we're planning capital investments in the range of $625 million to $675 million and R&D expenses of $310 to $340 million. These capital and R&D projects will develop the next generation of fuel-efficient vehicles and enhance the company's manufacturing and parts distribution facilities. Thank you. We'd be pleased to answer your questions.[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tim Thein with Citigroup. Your line is now open. -- Thank you. Good morning. Preston, maybe, the first one just on the guidance here for the first quarter. I'm looking at build rate in the industry level at least projected build plans for North America calling for a modest -- a small sequential step up from 4Q to 1Q and I'm curious how PACCAR fits into that in terms of within the context of that I think you said down 5% to 7% deliveries where North America fits in relative to Europe and some of the other markets? -- Sure, as we just said, we do expect deliveries to be overall 5% to 7% lower and that's kind of matching to where the market really is. North America is more of that than Europe is. Europe's been fairly stable for us through the fourth quarter and into the first quarter and real issues matching to where the normalized market has become where we're seeing the normalized market. So it's nice for us as we have a pretty good percentage of the backlog, I think it is roughly 34% of the backlog and compared to the inventory where there -- we are a smaller percentage of the inventory. In fact, we only have about two months worth of inventory, 2.5 months of inventory sitting in there. So we are in pretty good shape that way and it's just normalizing to the market. -- Okay, all right and then on the margins in the first quarter, there is obviously, you'll get a little bit more help from a seasonal perspective in the second quarter, but how are you considering that roughly 14% margin today in the first quarter relative to the full year? -- So when you look at the first quarter and it's kind of where we stop our guidance to it is we look at the 14%, I think that's really continuing to deliver as PACCAR does excellent industry leading margins and that's kind of consistently good for us and we're pleased to be able to deliver that and that's really because of the performance of our teams on the truck side, the financial services side, and the Parts team and in composite that works really well. -- Alrighty, I will now pass it on. Thank you. -- Okay, thank you. Have a good day.Our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. -- Hi, this is Thompson Rich [Phonetic] on behalf of Ann. -- Hello. -- Hi, quick question on SG&A, which came in a bit higher than we had modeled for the fourth quarter. Can you just talk about what drove the year-on-year increase. Is Q4 a fair run rate for 2020? -- When we look at SG&A, one of the nice things for PACCAR is we have the lowest SG&A in the industry by a [Phonetic] substantial. We do a great job of managing that. As a percentage of sales, it was actually down in 2019 at the end of the year and we always take a look, we have a rigorous approach to cost control at all elements of the business both in up cycles and down cycles and we continue to manage that cost to the great levels we maintain. It's how we think about it. Consider very little things, very little is fixed costs and just try to do a great job. -- Okay and can you discuss new orders in North America and Europe for PACCAR relative to the industry. I think last quarter you noted your backlog represented 36% of the industry backlog. Where does it stand at the end of Q4? -- Sure, our backlog is really sitting around 34% is what we have now. As we look at orders, orders are a complicated thing because it depends on everybody's inputs for what's an order and what's been canceled. So what we think about more is we make sure that what we're building has a firm order a customer name on it, and that's what we do and so we've been able to adjust our build rates aligned with our orders and that carries us forward as we look into next year.Our next question comes from Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Your line is open. -- Hey, gGood morning, gentlemen. I'm curious, Preston, based on what you know today, obviously things could change, but are the run rates for each of your factories kind of what you'd expect to be sort of stable through the year or do you think at some point there will be another production cut needed? -- I think we think about it in a little bit more close in view than that. We think about whether the orders we have right now present the backlog we need to keep the factories running smoothly and that's where we're at right now. We've continued to adjust as I said, we think, first quarter's deliveries will be down 5% to 7% and build kind of matches that. Actually, it has to tie together. So that's where we're thinking about in the first quarter. We are operating in what we think is a good economy, GDP growth is going to be up almost 2% in the U.S. We think European GDP is growing. So there is some positive reasons to think about the economy and the operating environment. So we'll see what happens through the course of the year as far as build. -- Okay, thanks. And can you just comment on what you're seeing in terms of used pricing and I'll pass it on. -- Sure, used pricing as we said in the last quarterly is continuing to be a headwind. I think in the last time we talked about it being somewhere in the double-digit declines and so a nice thing for being part of PACCAR, as we have an amazing team in our PACCAR Financial Services Group that does a great job of managing the used trucks. We sell the best trucks in the industry and the second owners love buying PACCAR products. It's really one of our inherent advantages and the other part of it is, I think we continue to invest in our used truck organization so that we add new used truck centers throughout Europe and North America to make sure that we are meeting the market needs as we grow our market share, it means there is ultimately more used trucks and we want to take care of our customers with those used truck centers. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. -- Thanks a lot. Good morning. -- Good morning. -- I want to kind of flip over to Financial Services. Revenue was quite strong. Can you comment on what drove the strength in revenue and then also within the Financial Services, the provision for losses on receivables dropped on an absolute basis sequentially against what continues to be a pretty challenging used truck price environment that you just described and I'm just wondering what the drivers were for that as well? -- Sure. Harry, you want to? -- Sure. So the PACCAR Financial had a good quarter. We have a good portfolio, record revenues, so that drives a lot of the profit improvement, but like Preston said used trucks continue to be a headwind for the finance company. We expect that that will continue in the first quarter and customers continue to pay their bills. Past dues are low, below 1% and credit losses are favorable too. So we expect with all of that the first quarter results of the finance company to be very similar to the fourth quarter. -- Okay. Thank you and just Harrie, back on the revenue, it went up pretty significantly year-over-year, but also sequentially -- was there any? -- Sure, some of that reflects the increased volume of used truck sales that flow through the finance company. -- Oh OK. Okay, thank you very much. -- You're welcome.Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. -- Yes, hi, good morning and good afternoon everyone. I'm wondering if you could please talk about what you're seeing out of your competitors in the U.S. and Canada. Typically, when we are heading into a production downturn, you folks are the first to cut production and your market share in the initial stages of a downturn is typically lower as a result and this time your production share actually went up in the first quarter, a reduction here, can you just talk about what you're seeing out of your competitors and what's driving the different cadence in terms of your production share in this fourth quarter compared to the past couple of production downturns? -- Well, what we experience right now is we have just fantastic products out there with great dealer network, great products out there, and I think there just is strong demand for our products. This really is simply as it can be put as people want to drive the best trucks and have the best services and the best powertrains and that's what we offer. So we build again -- coming back to what -- we build to what an order -- to the orders we have and that's driving our increase in share and that's as simple as we think about it, it's really kind of a nice picture for us because they're great products. -- And when you look at the overall inventory picture for the industry. So we're exiting '19 with about 73,000 trucks in inventory, which if you apply prior cycles, looks like the industry need to take out about 20,000, maybe 30,000 trucks out of dealer inventories. What does that picture look like for PACCAR just as the natural transition for some custom end applications that are completed at the dealer site, how much do you anticipate your dealer inventories coming down in '20. -- It's a good question. Our inventories are in a really good shape. You said 73,000. So that's kind of a round number. If I use a round number for us, call it 18,000 of Kenworth and Peterbilt combined. It obviously depends when you start it, but as we have 30% of the market share, we really only have 25% of the inventory. So that says again that we're in pretty good condition and some of that inventory, quite a bit of that inventory is with body builders right now. So we have the leader in the vocational market and so some of those trucks are getting bodies put onto them right now. -- And then on the parts business, you folks have continued to have pretty steady performance even though there has been some puts and takes for freight markets, can you just talk about in your outlook for 4% to 6% growth how much is the contribution from your engines hitting the sweet spot -- the new truck lineup hitting the sweet spot for parts consumption versus underlying freight traffic. Can you just give us a bit context directionally how you're thinking about the pieces relative to the outlook? -- Yeah, I think that there is a couple of things going on and the parts team continues to do an outstanding job. They have great technologies they are employing. It is something that we maybe don't give enough sharing of. Their e-commerce program is outstanding and that's doing a great job of making sure we have the right products at the right places. As we mentioned in our earlier comments, we're investing in distribution centers as well. A new distribution center coming online this year in Las Vegas, Nevada, another one in Ponta Grossa in Brazil. Those contribute to parts performance. We continue to grow our proprietary power trains you mentioned. So I wouldn't say that's stable. That's a growing opportunity for us. Last year, we finished at 43% for engine sales being with our MX engines. So that's great. It was 47% actually in the fourth quarter. That's another opportunity for us. You mentioned the great trucks and the growing share they contribute to the parts teams growth. There's just a lot of great things happening on the parts team and so we have a great future to look forward to there. -- So you don't need really strong pickup in freight volumes to get the 4% to 6% growth target? [Speech Overlap] -- No, I think what you see is the freight volume does drive demand, but it's really about the size of the part bigger -- bigger influences or size of the part, size of your proprietary content and that takes a few years to mature where parts consumption is really growing. Again, looking forward, I think that we have a great amount of freight being hauled right. Freight tonnage was up last year over 3% and so that's going to contribute to utilization, we agree with you on that. -- I appreciate the discussion. Thanks. -- Have a good day.Our next question comes from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America. Your line is now open. -- Yeah, good morning guys. -- Good morning. -- I just had a question on decremental margin. I mean, if you go back to 2016, you seem to have sort of a similar revenue composition of down truck production but very steady parts and that translated into kind of 15%-ish type decremental gross margin pre-R&D. Is there any reason why you shouldn't be able to sustain a similar level of performance or anything to think about this time around versus versus then? -- No, I think you characterized it well and then we think about incrementals and decrementals in that 15% to 20% range and so what as you said, we saw in the 2016 time frame and I think that's a nice way to look at it going forward. -- Okay, great. And then the parts business has remained very resilient but certainly did decelerate a bit as the year kind of grinded on. Are you seeing any type of maintenance deferrals amid softer market conditions and when you say that you expect the business to be up 4% to 6% in 2020, is that somewhat second half weighted or do you think we'll see this acceleration back to that growth trajectory out of the gate in the first half of the year? -- Yeah, I think that the 4% to 6% obviously is what we said for how we look at it going forward and I don't think I would try to stratify that by quarter. I think its going to be good performance throughout. Obviously, there can always be moments of cyclicality that are impossible to kind of guess where people are going to be by weeks or a month, but in general with great freight volumes, a great parts team, the right product lineups and the right investments, it's going to continue to deliver. -- And then just on the SG&A, the question you got before. Are you trying to say that SG&A as a percentage of sales overall should be roughly similar to where it was in 2019? -- Well, that's, if you go back and look, that's where SG&A has kind of run for us. Again, comparing it to the industry, it's significantly, the leanness of PACCAR shows through and we continue to do a great job of managing that SG&A and I think we'll continue to do that going forward. -- Well, I think the context of the prior question was just that it did jump a little bit in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter. So just realistically, if we're looking at it for the full year, I'm just trying to get a sense if I take your sales if it's going to -- -- Take a longer view of it and look where PACCAR has historically performed and know that we'll perform in that same level, as I think I would guess I'd share is we will continue to rigorously manage our costs and control them and make the right decisions to build the future of the company in a great way. -- Okay and then just lastly on the R&D side, I mean you're guiding to sort of stable R&D, but in the context of getting to production models for your alternative powertrain models over the next year and a half, how should we think about that. I guess I'm a little bit surprised that that number is not ramping up a little bit as you're moving in that direction? -- I think we have an amazing team of engineering people around the world and they're doing a fantastic job of looking at how we should go to production. We're working closely with all the customers who's interest is in alternative powertrains and we'll have the right technologies for those customers when it comes time. We continue to do that in PACCAR's way which is with good decision, making prudent investments, and leveraging our supply base and the other companies that are out there. -- Thanks very much. -- You bet.Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. -- Hi, good morning. I guess two follow up questions one within the U.S. when you're talking about your orders and your backlog, can you distinguish between what you're seeing on the vocational side versus line-haul side. If there is any variation there and then just second a nuance when you're talking about Europe relative to the retail sales guide and relative to what other customers have come out to set it sounds like you're seeing Europe sort of more stable. I'm just wondering if Europe is trending a little better than what you would have thought so far and if so what geographies are driving that? Thank you. -- Let's take the first part of the question, I think we are the leaders in the vocational market, Peterbilt and Kenworth are, and they do a great job of that. The vocational market is is doing really well throughout U.S. and Canada. Housing start is up, construction being strong. PACCAR does a great job there and so that's a good percentage of our orders. We're obviously pleased with how that's working and feel like that will continue through the course of the year as the economy develops. I think from the European side of the question, I think Europe is working the way we thought it might work into the first quarter where our build rates have been stable there for two quarters now, more than two quarters and we're delivering good market share and people are loving the DAF trucks. Freight continues to be moved from Central and Eastern Europe into Western Europe. That's kind of a continuing trend line -- macro trend and we benefit from that because DAF is a market leader in those areas and it really contributes to our success. -- Okay. Thank you. -- You bet.Our next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is now open. -- Thanks. Good morning, guys. -- Hey good morning. -- Good morning. Wondering how you feel about the second half visibility and your confidence in the outlook, obviously in the first half you have more backlog, but curious how you formed your full year market view and your assumptions in the first half versus the second half? -- Yeah, I think what we did is we said that we have a growing economy. So that's contributory. We're very close with all our customers and we spend a lot of time talking to them about how their businesses are working because that's really the underlying principle for how our build will develop. In the last even few weeks last week or two, I've talked to several of my friends that are refrigerated carriers, flatbed haulers, and truckload carriers throughout the country just to see how their businesses are running, they're running well and yet, we still feel like there will be some, there was probably an over-buy in 2018/2019 and so that's going to normalize itself into the 230,000 to 260,000 kind of a market for U.S. and Canada. -- Are those customers telling you that they're going to start stepping up their orders at some particular point in the year to be able to hit that -- make that 230,000 to 260,000 market number work? -- It's not that specific. I think people buy trucks when they need them and there is a huge population of people buying trucks, so it would be not accurate to model it that way, not that specifically. -- Okay and then just one quick one on the FinCo as you think about 2020, should we sort of carry forward this Q4 profitability level for the whole year of 2020 or do you think there would be some fluctuations on that relative to just demand and used values. -- I think the team has done a really nice job in the FinCo of delivering good performance. We expect that performance to deliver through the first quarter and then we'll watch as the year develops through that. -- Okay. Thank you.Our next question comes from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. -- Hey, good morning, everybody. -- Good morning. -- I just wanted to circle back on the Europe question, I think, if my numbers are right, your market -- the DAF share actually ticked down a little bit 2019 versus '18. Is there anything you'd call out there from a regional or country perspective and do you think that that reverses here in 2020? Thanks. -- Yeah, so two thoughts to that is, we had 16.2% in the 2019, which was the second best year ever, which is coming off of our 16.6%, you're right, that was up 1 [Phonetic] point and 1.3% [Phonetic] we had huge gain and we've held on to that gain and we have good momentum right now I think. The other part of it is on the medium-duty side, we grew our share from 9% to 9.7% during the course of 2019. So we actually grew there and then I think it's -- I wouldn't try to isolate down from that. The U.K. did really well, but we are performing well in a lot of the markets in Europe and I think the DAF trucks are really performing and helping our customers be successful. -- Okay, thanks and then just to follow up on, I think you mentioned pricing price-cost was positive in the fourth quarter, anything you'd call out for your thoughts for 2020. Do you expect that to continue? -- I think what we saw was prices were a little bit realized over a little bit over 2% [Phonetic] and costs were less than 2% and we'll watch what happens in 2020 and see how that model develops for us, but there's obviously going to be fluctuations as we go forward? -- Okay. That's all I had. Thanks guys.Our next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. -- Hi, thank you. I wanted to pick up on the point about price cost. Is the first quarter, the implied deliveries are down about 17% year-over-year and in that context, I think the 14% gross margin would be viewed as fairly impressive? Price cost you said was positive in the fourth quarter, can you give us some sense the cadence or what do you expect for the first quarter. I think people are just trying to figure out if there is a risk to the top line, what's the decremental on it. In the first quarter, the setup on the guide, again relatively impressive at 14% gross margin with that kind of delivery decline. So can you help us a bit on maybe mix in the backlog, price/cost in the first quarter. We're just trying to get a sense of the resiliency of that again, relatively impressive decremental in the first quarter? -- I think -- thanks for the question, David. I think when we think about it, it's really about making sure we have the right -- that we are building the right quantity of trucks, which is obviously based on having the right orders and so we have those matched well together. We're not seeing tremendous fluctuations in costs. We're not seeing tremendous fluctuations in price. So the fact that we had a good price realization in the fourth quarter was advantageous to us and we'll see what happens as we get into 2020 and watch what that model looks like? -- So the price/cost spread in the first -- in the fourth quarter, you don't expect it to be terribly different in the first or second, I think we were just trying to figure out is that really a mix, price cost benefit to get you to stay at 14% gross margins or is it just structurally with parts and so forth that we can be somewhat comfortable even if we do want to model more conservative top line that the gross margin resiliency is there, I mean that's the kind of spirit of the question. -- Yeah, I think if I try to get the spirit of it, it really if you think about prices because the team does a great job of supporting customers and people are willing to pay for our trucks. That's the overarching thing on price to me is that people want PACCAR products because they are the best and then they are willing to buy those products. I think that part of the truck part and other gross margin performance has to do with the strong performance of our parts organization. So that is a -- as truck sales is down, parts mix is up, that's a contributor as well and really just both of those things that keep us performing at the industry leading levels? -- But it's not necessarily because price/cost gets notably better in the first quarter as and maybe some thought your costs are down from steel? -- So there's nothing substantial there. -- All right. Appreciate it. All right, thank you. -- You bet.Our next question comes from Courtney Yakavonis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. -- Morning, guys. Just back on the FinCo again. I just wanted to understand because it seemed like your pre-tax profit was down and I think Steven asked earlier, just about carrying forward the margin, but was there anything one-time that was impacting margins this quarter or is it just the weaker used values. Are there any impairments or increased depreciation expenses that are really causing that big step-up in the interest in other borrowing expenses? -- Yeah, your final statement is characterizing it accurately. What you say is we had record new business volume in 2019, the $5.6 billion that was a contributor to revenue growth and then more volume on the used side was the other contributor to revenues and that was the headwind on the profit side. -- And I think you mentioned that you're still seeing the double-digit declines in used. Have you seen any stabilization in used values or is it's still wait and see kind of how that market checks out? -- Well, it is a dynamic market. I think that the nice thing is, as I said and it can't be over-stressed, the fact that especially maybe the second or equally the second owners really like our products. So that's helpful to us from the price position compared to the rest of the industry. So that works to keep us at a premium, not just for the first, but the second owner and then I would share your comment that things have stabilized a little bit. We see one way to look at that is that the amount of inventory coming in is equal to the inventory going out. So that's helpful as well. We're not building used inventory and so kind of the state of where it is right now. -- And then just on the capex side, I think your capex for the year came in about $100 million below what your guidance had been and you obviously didn't change the capex guidance for next year. So just wanted to understand kind of what that discrepancy was and if anything, is proceeding ahead of schedule or any projects got cut? -- No, in fact that's not exactly how we saw it. We saw capex was kind of slightly higher than where we'd started and we have a good cash flow or capex plan for 2020 as well, which is going to deliver the great products we need. I wonder if you're looking at the cash flow statements more than your capex commitments. -- Okay. Yeah, I was looking at the 575 [Phonetic] versus the guidance for $625 million to $675 million but maybe that's the issue. -- I think that's what you're looking at. I think so -- [indecipherable] is the number that we're talking about for 2019. -- Okay. Perfect. Thank you for clarifying that. And then, and then just lastly, I think the comments that your build has remained steady. I just want to make sure that, that means that you really don't anticipate any further production cuts from the build rates that you are at currently? -- I think what we said is we would expect in the first quarter that deliveries will be down 5% to 7% and that's obviously matching the order intake. -- Okay, perfect. Thank you.Our next question comes from Joel Tiss with BMO. Your line is now open. -- Hey guys, how is it going? -- Really good how about for you? -- Hanging in there. Yeah, so I wonder if we could, if you could spend a minute just talking about Latin America, about how the setup is? Kind of what your market share is looking like and how you think you can gain a little bit more share in 2020 and just kind of the setup of the market there? -- Sure, it's been a fantastic journey for us there. We have a great set of dealers really neat products down there. We've got a lot of of success with the dealers and the customers. I think the brand reputation for DAF in Brazil has grown tremendously in just a very short period of time. We're looking at our market share growth opportunities as being substantial. We think that the market is relatively stable down there. So Brazil comes in at 75,000, the South American market overall is 100,000 to 110,000. As we noted, we increased our deliveries by 60% last year in South America. So, substantial growth that way. We'll just look forward to continuing growing the truck sales. The parts business is doing really well. We introduced the Financial Services business for customer financing in Brazil last year. So a lot of good activity happening for us in South America. -- Okay. Thank you. -- You bet.Our next question comes from Felix Boeschen with Raymond James. Your line is now open. -- Yeah, hey, thanks for squeezing me in here. I appreciate some of the color on the parts outlook but as for sort of dissecting some of the different buckets within the business, I'm curious if you have an update on the TRP Stores. How many do you plan to add next year and maybe any color on some sort of same-store sales growth number in that existing base of the stores? -- TRP has been a great addition for us in reaching a new customer base. They've done a fantastic job of that. There's 210 stores now that are in operation. So that's growth year-over-year. We'll keep growing the number of stores where they make sense with our dealers all around the world. That's in Europe, it could be in Russia, it could be in South America and North America, all of the above, really. So we'll continue to see the brand grow and perform well and bring new customers to PACCAR. -- Okay. And then just curious to see if you have an update on the margin profile into next year for the parts business. On one hand, you obviously have the aging MX engine population and then the other one the TRP revenue increase. So any color would be appreciated on that? -- I think the margin profile will stay relatively in the same range. -- Okay, like 27%, 28%. -- That kind of range. -- Got it. Thank you. -- You bet.Our next question comes from Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Your line is open. -- Hi guys, good morning, good afternoon. -- Good morning, good afternoon. -- Hey, going back to the MX engine, it looks like you had a pretty strong fourth quarter. I don't know how much of that increase was mix of customers that you're shipping the engine out to, but how are you thinking about your penetration rate for this year? -- So we have a great powertrain offering, obviously the MX engine that's a core of it. We have great relationship with Cummins as well who does a great job of supporting our customers with their powertrain. We did grow our MX engine share to 47% in the fourth quarter for a full year average of 43%. Part of what enabled that is we invested in manufacturing capacity in the course of the year last year. So we have adequate capacity to build as many MXs as we want for the customers and we look forward to seeing that continue to grow as we move through the cycle. -- Okay, got you and then just a clarification, again on the Financial Services revenue, can you tell us how much your used truck sales were up in the quarter? -- I don't have that detail sitting around in front of me, but they did increase. I just don't know the number in front of us. -- Okay. Thank you. -- You bet.Our next question comes from Matt Elkott with Cowen. Your line is now open. -- Good morning and good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I think your heavy-duty percentage tends to be around 85% historically. So first, are you still comfortable with that breakout longer term. And the second part of my question, what was it in the fourth quarter? -- So I think that that general percent is OK but we have great growth opportunities in the heavy side and the medium side as we look forward to it. So we'll continue to see share develop at PACCAR positively. Take a steady approach to it and been very successful growing share and we'll continue to find that same success. I don't think there'll be much of a shift though and I don't have the exact number, but you can -- your numbers of ratios are about right. -- Okay and do you think that you may have picked up some share with the the GM strike in the Class 6 to Class 7 categories in the fourth quarter? -- I think we picked up share because we just have great trucks, great people, great dealers. -- Got it and then just one other question that's -- if we take a longer-term view, could you update us on your strategic priorities, anything that's likely to become more of a focus, more of a growth driver, whether it's a specific region or more vertical integration of PACCAR engines or alternative technologies or anything else? -- Well, you hit some of them, right, we're going to keep growing organically. We're going to grow geographically where it makes sense and provides a profit for the corporation and we're going to keep making the prudent investments in technologies that deliver great trucks and powertrains to our customers when they need them. So all of those will be areas that we grow in. -- Great, thank you very much. -- You bet.Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is now open. -- Yeah, hey everybody. My question is, you gave helpful comments on the European market share. Are you willing to sort of talk about your theme of improving straight truck market share, where that's progressing and whether you need that to work to sort of get above a certain threshold. Any update you can give us there? -- It continues to be a focus. We continue to do well with it. We did grow as a percentage there in the straight truck market. That's going to continue to be an area of what we just talked on the prior question is organic growth for us. -- Are you growing both -- well, you have room to grow both tractor and straight truck share in Europe or is there any kind of limit on the tractor side? -- No, there is no limit. I mean, we're the market leader in tractors and we'll continue to be enjoying that and looking for extension of that and growing on the straight truck side as well. -- So we have the product in the straight truck side. So if you look at markets where that has been for a long time, the U.K. Netherlands, Belgium, a straight truck market share is about the same as the tractor market share. So we do have the products. It's just a matter of growing that business also in markets like Germany, France, Italy, and Spain. -- Okay. Thank you. And if I can, I don't know if this is an answerable question, but I'll ask it anyway. Just what's your -- in a normal up and down cycle, what's your preferred pacing of production changes given supply chain given ramping et cetera, would you be looking to make adjustments one and two quarters out or two quarters and three quarters out, just, I know you don't try to hold a lot of inventory and not trying to stop the dealers, just a little bit about the rhythm of how you think about production changes? -- Yeah, I think we build trucks to order is the essence of it, which is different than the automotive industry. What we do is when we talk to our customers and they need to truck, then we schedule that in and we try to maintain some kind of a visibility whether that's four, eight, 12 weeks and that's how we define our production schedules. -- Okay. No. Thank you. -- All right.Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research. Your line is now open. -- Hi, good morning. My impression so far and commentary around pricing expectations is that it's more of a wait and see into 2020? What we saw the last time, demand did soften in 2016 is that there was a little bit of pricing pressure and I'm just curious whether you anticipate that we should be looking at something similar just given a little bit softer demand or if you're seeing anything different out there across competitor behavior that would suggest that the pricing can hold up? -- I think if you think of in terms of truck part and other, in the truck side, there will be obviously market dynamics drive differences, but we have a continued strong performance, an increasing percentage of our performance coming from parts and they are doing a great job. So it's a little bit of a balancing factor to it looking back to prior cycles, but no, I don't think you should think that PACCAR's going to do anything except deliver the best margins in the industry. -- And then I guess related but a little bit more of a mix type question. Similarly, going back from if we just track 2015 to 2016, the average truck price was down and it was more than just a pure pricing effect. Is there anything to just be aware of with general mix in a softer demand environment and what that means for average unit pricing just given the mix effect. -- I don't really think so. I don't think there's anything in there. -- Okay, thanks a lot.Our next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Loop Capital Markets. Your line is now open. -- Thank you very much. Hi everyone. Hey, you know, lot of the real smart questions have been asked here, I just want to follow up with one. I think I know the answer to and just a detail, but when you're giving the 5% to 7% down figure. That's sequentially versus 4Q, that's not a year-on-year number. Correct? -- Yes, correct. -- Okay, thank you. And then secondly, with the U.S. pulling back a little bit more than Europe, at least in the outlook. How should I think about tax rate or are there any other changes that I would think about to some of the other line items that would occur as a result of that? -- Yeah, I don't think -- there is not going be much change in tax rate overall. -- Okay, so consistent with where we are this year. -- Yes. -- Okay, that's all I have. Thank you very much and congratulations. -- You bet. Have a great day.[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. -- Hello. Again, thanks for the follow-up. Two questions, one short-term. I know it's a smaller volume market for you, but you have a pretty good share over there. I'm wondering if you could comment on whether you expect the Australian natural disasters to have any tangible impact on 2020 demand? -- Well, first of all, our hearts and prayers go out to the people there and the country that has been affected -- adversely affected to it. No, I don't think in the longest term that it is going to have any impact to us. We'll continue to be the market leader. -- Okay, thanks and then separately, longer term, you talked about it at CES and then again in the release today, the battery electric trucks expected to hit the market a year to-year and a half from now. Are you, based on your work with the customers, seeing any potential for acceleration in adoption rates versus what you originally expected or is it pretty much on track? -- I think it's pretty much on track. It has to make commercial sense or be regulated in and we have really good partnerships that we're working with to bring the right trucks to the customers and we will supply them the best trucks, the best alternative powertrain trucks as they need them. -- Thanks and then a little bit more detail on that, Preston, you have kind of divergent, I think divergent potential regulations going on between the EPA and CARB maybe that's been closed, but is there potential for a significantly different adoption rate in let's say California and associated states versus the rest of the country? -- There could be. I mean that can happen. It can happen in Europe that way as well. I think from our standpoint, that's not going to material effect how we develop the products. What we're going to do is develop the best technologies with the highest performance and then we will just supply those for the markets they need based upon where the customers are operating. -- Okay, thank you very much. -- You bet.There are no other questions in queue at this time. Are there any additional remarks from the company? -- We'd like to thank everyone for joining the call and thank you, operator.[Operator Closing Remarks] --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- \n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Although all three face headwinds in 2020, their valuations appear to have Armageddon scenarios built in, and merely avoiding worst-case outcomes could lead to strong price rises. Let's take a closer look at all three.Image source: Getty Images.It hasn't been a perfect year for the company. Slowing industrial production growth negatively affected its composites segment and lower volumes and production curtailments in the North American residential fiberglass market led to lower profits at insulation. Meanwhile, management expects U.S. industry shingle shipments to be flat in 2019. On the bright side, Owens Corning's roofing sales are expected to rise due to taking market share -- partly down to more favorable geographic exposure.Data source: Owens Corning presentations.\u00a0EBIT is earnings before interest and taxation.Looking ahead, management is taking action to produce annual cost savings of some $25 million by 2021 in insulation. Hopefully, a pick-up in industrial production in the second half of 2020 will also aid its composite segment. Roofing demand is always a function of a combination of underlying conditions in the housing market and the effects of weather and major storms. Around 70% of demand comes from repair and remodeling and new construction. Clearly, there's scope for volatility in roofing revenue due to the weather, but underlying conditions in housing remain positive.House prices continue to rise, new housing permits are growing again, and the U.S. months supply of new single houses has dropped to levels indicating a need for housing expansion. data by All told, Owens Corning looks capable of getting back on track in 2020. What's more, its stock is trading on a forward PE ratio of less than 13 times earnings and 15 times current free cash flow (FCF). It looks like a good . data by These two companies have three things in common:Starting with Dana, it's no secret that the light vehicle market (, Jeep, and  are key customers and Dana generates around 40% of its revenue from the market) and the heavy truck market -- (Daimler,   and  are key customers and Dana gets 29% of its sales from the market) are set for a difficult 2020. Meanwhile, its off-highway sales -- 21% of revenue -- could also be challenged if the  given recently by another customer,  is correct.Indeed, here's a look at the recent industry estimates given by Navistar on its recent earnings report.Data source: Navistar presentations. Class 6-8 U.S. and Canada.It's not going to be a great year for an axle, power technology, and driveshaft manufacturer like Dana, and just as Navistar dampened down expectations recently, there could be more negative news to come.But here's the thing. Dana's valuation is so cheap that you can't help thinking there is a huge margin of safety baked in. For example, the company's current market cap is $2.6 billion; add in net debt and it gives an enterprise value of $5.2 billion.Digging into the details, on the investor day presentation in March 2019, management outlined expectations to generate $2 billion in free cash flow from 2019-2023 with free cash flow jumping from $243 million in 2018 to $465 million in 2020.  Obviously, expectations have been reduced in the near term due to the slowdown in the economy, but Dana is still expected to produce around $230 million in 2019 leading to $409 million in 2020 -- equivalent to around 15% of its current market cap. Frankly, the light vehicle and truck market is going to have to enter a sustained downturn before Dana doesn't look like a good value.Around a quarter of this company's sales go to the transportation market, and Altra also has significant exposure to other markets, such as factory automation (15% of sales) and a bunch of other heavy industries such as energy (7%), metals and mining (7%), and materials handling (6%).It all adds up to a difficult 2020, and analysts have sales dropping 3.4% in 2020 only to grow again by a similar amount in 2021. It's a sobering outlook, and just as with Dana, don't be surprised if there are some negative revisions to expectations along the way. Such things happen when end markets are trending downwards.That said, management expects $1 billion in free cash flow over the next five years. Given that Altra only trades on a market cap of $2.3 billion and an enterprise value of $3.8 billion, there appears to be a significant amount of leeway built into the current valuation so as to deal with anything other than a severe downgrade to expectations.If you can ignore some potentially bad news and possible downward revisions to earnings expectations in the coming months, then these stocks might work for you. They all look cheap on a free cash flow basis, and provided the economy doesn't enter a severe contraction, they are likely to look like a very good value at the end of the year.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The British investor is always highly vocal on big-picture issues like the environment and asset class valuations, so I thought it would be interesting to see what stocks his firm has been buying in an uncertain economic environment.Image source: Getty Images.Before diving into the stocks, it's worth noting that the size of the fund is in the ballpark of $14 billion, so even the largest position by value, \u00a0 at $290 million, only constitutes around 2% of the total portfolio. Meanwhile, one of the smaller holdings in the portfolio,\u00a0\u00a0, is arguably more significant as Grantham's position constitutes around 1% of the market cap of the stock, compared with just 0.3% of 3M's.That said, no one  because they are hoping to lose money, so all the buys are relevant. Here are seven interesting industrial stocks worth noting in Grantham's portfolio and how those positions changed in the most recent quarter.\u00a0Data source: Grantham, Mayo, & van Otterloo SEC filings.The three stocks that immediately grab your attention are Applied Materials, PACCAR, and Aptiv. It's been a pretty grim year in the semiconductor sector in terms of operations -- Applied Materials just reported a 13% decline in its fiscal full-year 2019 net sales -- but it's been a great year for semiconductor stock prices as the market has bought into the idea that the trough in the industry has passed --  by  CEO Joe Kaeser. Grantham's purchase of Applied Materials could be taken as another vote of confidence in an industry that is traditionally a good early bellwether of the economy.Trucking is also a highly cyclical industry. And the sector is arguably looking like a good value right now due to being oversold on expectations of a sharp drop in demand in 2020 after a few years of strong growth.  But some leading commentators are talking about  and history suggests that truck sales tend to overshoot and undershoot industrial production. In other words, if you think that U.S. industrial growth will be solid in 2021 and onward, then there's a strong case for buying trucking stocks like PACCAR. data by In a similar vein, the automotive-supplier stocks have been sold off due to a combination of falling production, the  strike, and concerns over the impact of the trade conflict. That said, valuations across the sector are looking attractive. And if global sales/production could start to stabilize in 2020 -- it surely will at some point -- then buying stocks like Aptiv, as Grantham did, could make sense. data by Grantham's additional purchases of the three mega-cap stocks came before they all gave their third-quarter earnings. \u00a0largely on the back of good conditions in commercial aerospace -- United Technologies would later .

As such, Federal Signal's mix of street sweeping, sewer cleaning, safe digging, and road marking machinery offers investors exposure to the need to maintain and improve U.S. infrastructure. Trading at a P/E of 17.3 times 2020 estimated earnings, the stock looks like a good value,\u00a0particularly for one with .All told, Grantham's purchases probably don't signify any big opinion on the industrial sector, but if you do want exposure to the area, then the stocks above are a good place to start looking for it. There's a nice mix of stocks with recovery potential (Aptiv, Applied Materials, and PACCAR), conglomerates with exposure to a strong aerospace market (United Technologies and Honeywell), a small-cap pick (Federal Signal) and 3M's dividend yield of 3.4%.\u00a0When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Here's what to look out for.Image source: Getty Images.According to most industry forecasts and current trends, the trucking sector is set for a severe contraction in 2020, as it normalizes from a couple of years of torrid growth that\u00a0followed the slowdown in heavy industries caused by the slump in commodity prices in 2015-2016: data by .However, it looks like this news has largely been .

With 2020 set to be a down year for the industry -- the latest results from Navistar only served to confirm this expectation -- it's understandable if the market decides to take a dim view of prospects. That said,\u00a0there's a strong case for the argument that stocks in the sector remain a good value. Here it is.\u00a0Image source: Getty Images.The uncertainty in the timing of the cycle of trucking demand makes guidance very hard to formulate. It's a common feature of investing in such stocks that guidance can turn out to be too optimistic on the way down and too pessimistic on the way up.Unfortunately, the industry is heading down in 2020, and Navistar's updated guidance demonstrates how easy to is to overshoot on guidance when an industry is cyclically declining. Note that the guidance given on the investor day is from just three months ago.MetricCurrent GuidanceInvestor Day, September 2019Industry Retail Deliveries of Class 6-8 trucks and buses, U.S. and Canada (units)\"Low end of the range\"335,000 to 365,000Revenue$9.25 billion to $9.75 billion$10 billion to $10.5 billionAdjusted EBITDA$700 million to $725 million$775 million to $825 millionData source: Navistar presentations. EBITDA = earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization.Discussing the outlook for 2020 on the fourth-quarter , Navistar CEO Troy Clarke painted a picture of lower economic growth in 2019 leading to a year of transition for the industry. However, he also noted that \"recent industry orders have been running below replacement level, as I believe the industry is working through a period of transition and then orders will pick up and recover in the second half of the year.\" In other words, a recovery in orders and ultimately a recovery in revenue should be in place by 2021. Discussing the matter further on the , Clarke said that should the economy slip into something \"that might look like a manufacturing recession in the first half of 2020\" then \"the recovery in orders in the market may be something that takes place late in 2020 or early in 2021.\" Of course, the economy could slip into a deeper and more lasting recession, in which case all bets are off, but under Clarke's bad-case scenario the recovery in orders expected in the second half will merely be pushed out by a quarter or two.It appears that the argument over truck demand, and Navistar earnings, isn't about  a recovery will happen but rather about . In other words, when the overall economy starts to grow at above 2% again, Clarke believes freight demand will exceed capacity and freight companies will start to order trucks again. In addition, truck prices will need to stabilize before companies buy new trucks again.The good news is that the current analyst earnings estimates -- the 2020 EBITDA consensus is inside Navistar's range -- seem to suggest there is enough room for error in them to leave Navistar still looking like a good value.The key figure to focus on in the table is the enterprise value (EV) or market cap plus net debt to EBITDA. The EV/EBITDA multiple is . I'll come back to that shortly, but first note that the modest recovery expected in 2021 and 2022 would still leave revenue below the level of the boom years of 2018 and 2019, and that Navistar's margin expansion plans are expected to result in high-single-digit earnings growth from the trough formed in 2020.Navistar20162017201820192020 (Estimate)2021 (Estimate)2022 (Estimate)Revenue$8,111 million$8,570 million$10,250 million$11,251 million$9,467 million$9,753 million$9,849 millionEBITDA$508 million$582 million$826 million$882 million$722 million$774 million$850 millionEV/EBITDA*13.511.88.37.89.58.98.1Data sources: Navistar presentations and analyst estimates. *Based on the current enterprise value of $6.85 billion.To put these figures into context, here's a look at Navistar's valuation during the last trough in heavy truck sales at the end of 2016 compared to those of industry peers  and . For reference, the forecast EV/EBITDA for PACCAR and Cummins at their trough in 2020 is for 13.4 times and 9.1 times, respectively. In addition, all three are expected to generate earnings significantly in excess of those generated in the last trough, in 2016. data by When you put it all together, the stock looks like a very good value, but anyone buying in will have to appreciate that it's not going to be a smooth ride, and it's possible that some downward revisions to earnings estimates could come along. It's not easy predicting the timing of a cycle.Nevertheless, if you believe in the long-term prospects for the U.S. economy and trucking demand, trucking stocks are attractively priced right now and have a good margin of safety for what's likely to be a rough six months.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

If the stock's future profile will show a company about to set upon a long-term growth trajectory, and it's trading at a reasonable valuation, then it's a safe bet that the market will be buying the stock. With this approach in mind, here are five large-cap stocks that could look a lot better exiting 2020 than they do entering it.Image source: Getty Images.The following table is a brief look at what investors can expect in the coming year, some of the catalysts that could make their stocks soar, and the potential risks they face in the near future.\u00a0Data source: Author's analysis.\u00a0Growth prospects are one thing, but to be an attractive buy, a stock must be trading at a good value relative to those growth prospects. So for context, here's a chart of all these stocks' forward price-to-earnings ratios, based on analysts' consensus estimates. data by With the exception of Danaher, they all look reasonable. But here's the thing about Danaher: It operates in the highly rated life sciences and diagnostics markets, and its relative free-cash-flow-based valuation looks good.Moreover, Danaher is about to buy GE's biopharma business for a net price of $20 billion -- a unit that generated $1.1 billion in\u00a0free cash flow. It's therefore paying 18 times\u00a0free cash flow for an operation it believes will add $1 in EPS by the fifth year after the deal closes -- and Danaher is on track for $4.75 in EPS in 2020.  Frankly, this acquisition looks a great value, and not least when you consider that peers in the life sciences & diagnostics industries (see chart below) trade at much higher price to free cash flow ratios.\u00a0\u00a0 data by If the trade wars continue or get worse, or if the economy goes into  -- or if both happen concurrently -- all of these companies' prospects would be hurt to some degree. However, of the five, UPS and PACCAR would be particularly exposed to those threats. That said, UPS appears to have made progress with  that's aimed at improving its network and enabling it to better serve the growing e-commerce segment.The company's margins expanded in the third quarter, and it has even started dialing back its planned capital spending. If UPS can continue to do that over the next couple of years, then it could get back to converting nearly all of its net income into free cash flow -- a positive outcome for investors. data by In the case of truck manufacturer PACCAR, a protracted economic slowdown and/or trade war would put a drag on demand for freight hauling capacity, and therefore take a bite out of truck sales. Absent those headwinds, though, there's an argument to be made that the anticipated slump in truck sales in 2020 will merely be a natural correction after a couple of years of strong growth, which in turn came on the heels of the\u00a02015-2016 decline in demand that was caused by a slump in commodities prices.If that thesis proves accurate, then\u00a0PACCAR's current price-to-earnings ratio of 14.8 would not be a high valuation for a cyclical stock at the low point of its earnings.  data by You win no prizes for correctly guessing that returning the 737 MAX to service is Boeing's key priority for 2020 -- the issue has been hanging over its commercial aircraft segment.

Moreover, , and Boeing remains a .\u00a0Data source: Boeing presentations.If you can tolerate the uncertainty over the 737 MAX, then Boeing stock is worth buying.The case for buying Raytheon stock, by contrast, is based on the idea that shareholders will end up owning Raytheon plus the aerospace businesses of  , which are on track to come together in a new company, .The acquisition looks like a wise move on Raytheon's part because UTC's aerospace businesses (Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace) are firing on all cylinders right now.  Also, while the post-deal ownership split appears to be a fair representation of the two companies' near-to-mid-term cash flow --\u00a0Raytheon shareholders will get 43%, and UTC shareholders 57% --  it's probably a better deal for Raytheon, as it might not fully reflect the long stream of earnings to come from Pratt & Whitney's geared turbofan engine on the Airbus A320 NEO.If the U.S. economy goes into a recession, then all of these stocks are likely to underperform. But if you believe that 2020 will be a year of moderate, stable growth that leads into a more of the same in 2021, then you should give all of these companies serious consideration.

[Operator Instruction].I would now like to introduce, Mr. Ken Hastings, PACCAR's Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Hastings, please go ahead. -- Good morning. We would like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name is Ken Hastings, PACCAR's, Director of Investor Relations, and joining me this morning are Preston Feight, Chief Executive Officer; Harrie Schippers, President and Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Barkley, Senior Vice President and Controller.As with prior conference calls, we ask that any members of the media on the line participate in a listen-only mode. Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including general economic and competitive conditions that may affect expected results. For additional information, please see our SEC filings and the Investor Relations page of paccar.com.I would now like to introduce Preston Feight. -- Good morning. Harrie Schippers and I will provide you an update on PACCAR's excellent third quarter results and business highlights. To begin, I'm proud of our employees around the world who provide our customers the highest quality trucks, powertrains, and transportation solutions.In the third quarter PACCAR achieved sales and financial services revenues of $6.4 billion and net income of $608 million, resulting in a strong 9.5% after-tax return on revenues. PACCAR net income increased 11% compared to the third quarter of last year. PACCAR achieved robust truck, parts, and other gross margins of 14.9% in the third quarter, and also for the year to date.Through the first nine months of the year, our team achieved record revenue and earnings. PACCAR delivered 49,300 trucks during the third quarter, compared to 52,200 in the second quarter. This reflects fewer billing days in Europe, due to DAF's regular summer shutdown, which was partially offset by higher deliveries in North America.In the fourth quarter, deliveries will be lower by 6% to 8% compared to the third quarter, due to fewer production days in North America and lower daily build rates in North America and Europe. Fourth quarter truck, parts and other gross margins are estimated to be in the range of 14% to 14.5%.PACCAR declared third quarter dividends of $0.32 per share and year-to-date dividends of $0.96 per share. Year-to-date dividends were 19% higher than dividends declared in the same period last year. We repurchased 833,000 shares of stock during the third quarter, and there is $431 million remaining in the current $500 million Board of Directors' authorization.PACCAR continues to create a full lineup of innovative truck models and technologies. Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF have introduced a range of electric powertrain vehicles in the last two years, that customers are field testing in a variety of applications. PACCAR is well positioned to supply the industry with a complete set of powertrain technologies, including battery electric, fuel cell and diesel engines. This year, PACCAR has opened two global software research and development centers in the U.S. and Europe that are accelerating the development of embedded vehicle software, and PACCAR connected vehicle solutions for our customers.The PACCAR Innovation Center in the Silicon Valley, which we opened in 2017, complements PACCAR's extensive R&D efforts, and is focused on the development of PACCAR level 2 and 4 autonomous trucks. PACCAR will showcase many of our innovative products and technologies at the North American Commercial Vehicle Show in Atlanta next week, and at the CES Technology Show in Las Vegas in January. We hope to see you there.We are pleased to share that Kenworth, Peterbilt and PACCAR parts were each recognized as top employers for women at the Women in Trucking Annual Conference. We were honored for excellent work environment and company culture, that supports gender diversity. Harrie Schippers will now provide an update on PACCAR's truck segment, PACCAR Parts, Financial Services and investment priorities for next year. -- Thanks Preston. Our 2019 forecast, for Europe's greater than 16-tonne truck market, to be in a range of 310,000 to 320,000 units, reflecting continued modest economic growth and strong truck demand. Next year, the Eurozone and U.K. economies are expected to grow about 1%. We expect 2020 to be another good year, with the European above 16-tonne truck market in a range of 260,000 to 290,000 vehicles.The U.S. economy is growing 2.3% this year, with 50-year low unemployment, and strong consumer spending. Freight tonnage has grown 4.2% year-to-date. In the U.S. and Canada Class 8 industry retail sales continue to grow in 2019, following the strong orders and production over the last two years. We estimate 2019, U.S. and Canadian Class 8 industry retail sales to be in the range of 310,000 to 320,000 trucks. We expect 2020 to be another good economy, and estimate the U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck markets to be in the range of 230,000 to 260,000 trucks, in line with normal replacement demand.The South American above 16-tonne truck market should be in the range of 95,000 to 105,000 trucks this year, and slightly higher in 2020. In Brazil, the above 16-tonne truck segment is projected to be in a range of 65,000 to 75,000 vehicles this year and slightly higher next year. PACCAR Parts business generated strong quarterly revenues of $1 billion. Quarterly pre-tax income was $207 million, 10% higher than the third quarter last year. Consistent investments in parts distribution capacity, customer focus programs such as fleet services and TRP Stores, and a growing number of PACCAR trucks and engines in operations, drove these results. Since 2013, DAF, Kenworth and Peterbilt dealers have opened nearly 200 TRP retail stores on six continents. The stores provide high quality TRP branded, aftermarket products and services to owners of all makes of trucks, trailers, buses and engines. PACCAR Parts is constructing two new distribution centers, that will open next year.A 250,000 square foot facility in Las Vegas, which will make efficient use of solar power and 160,000 square foot facility in Ponta Grossa, Brasil. We expect part sales to grow by 4% to 6% next year.PACCAR Financial Services earned third quarter pre-tax income of $67 million. The portfolio was a record $15.6 billion this quarter, and performed well, with low past dues. In the third quarter, industry used truck inventory increased, and used truck pricing declined. Kenworth and Peterbilt truck resale values commanded 10% to 15% premium in the market. We estimate 2019 capital spending to be in the range of $675 million to $725 million, and R&D expenses to be $325 million to $335 million. In 2020, we're planning for capital investments of $625 million to $675 million, and R&D expenses of $320 million to $350 million. These investments will continue to enhance PACCAR's truck, powertrains and transportation solutions.Thank you. We'd be pleased to answer your questions.[Operator Instruction]. Our first question comes from Joel Tiss with BMO. Your line is now open. -- Wow, I'm not used to be in first. How is it going guys? -- [Speech Overlap]. -- Wow, first time for everything, I guess. So I just wondered if you could give us any sense of production levels for 2020, after mentioning, kind of -- we got a sense where the industry is going to be, and then mentioning that inventories for the industry are up a little bit? And I just wondered if you could give us any sense of where your production -- where you're thinking for 2020? -- Sure, as we've watched the industry normalize, if you look at inventory, we really think that right now, it's not in that shape at all for us. We just have 2.4 months of of inventory retail sales sitting out there, so that's a nice level. In good shape. We've already adjusted our backlog to be -- we have 36% of the backlog in the industry. So that's in good shape. And then as we look forward and think about build rates, we took adjustments into the -- end of the third quarter there, both North America and Europe to get them right for the markets, so that we feel like we've got a reasonable build going into 2020. -- Okay. And can you give us any sense about the parts, margins, I could see and we can all see in 2019, the margins are up a little bit, profits growing faster than revenues. You gave us a revenue number for next year, is there enough momentum in the business and the new parts distribution centers to be able to do that again in 2020, you think? -- I think the guidance we gave on the 4% to 6% growth, and I think margins would likely be comparable to what we saw this year. -- In the 27% to 28% range, that's what we typically see for parts. -- That's great. Thank you very much guys. -- Thank you, Joel.Our next question comes from Stephen Volkmann with Jefferies. Your line is now open. -- Hi, good morning. I'm not used to Joel being first either. -- Good morning. -- But maybe I'll pile on to his question a little bit. So Preston, just thank you for the comments around sort of production expectations. Is it your expectation at this point, that the production declines that you've kind of baked in for -- here in the second half of 2019, will be enough, and that you'll be able to sort of keep stable through 2020, is that the way, the plan is laid out? -- I think we'll watch what happens in 2020. I don't think it's going to be an even year, every month will be different. I mean every quarter will be different. So we'll make sure that we adjust build rate appropriate to the orders we have. Right now we have reasonable backlog in the first quarter, especially in North America. So we feel like we've got ourselves about right and we'll watch as the year comes along, what we need to do, whether it's go up or down in build rate. -- Okay, understood. And can we talk, maybe this is a Harrie question, just a little bit about the decremental margins since -- I guess it will be decremental next year. You've done a good job holding your incrementals kind of in the mid-teens, with an occasional high teens kind of number. I'm just curious as you have sort of more vertically integrated a little bit with your engine growth in the U.S. and all these parts distribution centers, etcetera. Do you think your decremental margin will also be in that kind of mid-teens level, or is there a reason to think it could be higher, because of the additional investment? -- I think we've -- historically we've seen incremental and decremental margins in the 15% to 20% range and I would expect that to be similar for next year. -- All right. Super. Thank you so much. I'll pass it on. -- All right. Have a good day.Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. -- Thanks. Hello everybody. -- Hello Andy. -- A couple of questions. First on the Financial Services and this is kind of [Indecipherable], but SG&A and provision for losses on receivables were up a little bit sequentially and year-over-year, what was driving that change, and was it due to any specific region? -- What we saw in Financial Services, we've had really a low credit losses. We've had low past dues. The portfolio continues to perform really well. In fact, we're pretty pleased with that portfolio. The only headwind we've had in in Financial Services was used trucks. -- Okay, thanks. Preston. And then, I just want to make sure I have this right, if I compare the truck segment performance to Q3 '18, you had a pretty beneficial gross spread between the 12% revenue increase, and the 3% volume growth. And I recall Q3 last year had some timing issues related to buyback contracts and stuff like that. Was that the difference in the revenue growth and the volume growth really driven by comps and pricing, or was there something else that occurred in the quarter? -- Yeah, if you just think about what this quarter was about, we did have reasonable pricing influence, that more than offset costs. So I think those are the things that drove our stronger margin performance for the quarter. I don't know if I've gone back in terms of kind of a bridge to the 3Q of '18 numbers and what was going on back in there. We did have fewer operating lease deferrals in Q3 of '19 versus Q3 of 2018, and therefore, that that helped our revenue a bit. -- Okay, thank you. And then on the used truck market in North America, you mentioned inventories are growing I think, have you started to see the price trends kind of gradually decline? Are we starting to see more double digit? -- So if you think about used trucks, one of the things that has been nice for PACCAR, is we've made investments over the past few years to grow our used truck capability. We created a new used truck center in Los Angeles. We're in the middle of creating one in Denton, Texas, it will open in the fourth quarter. Obviously PACCAR's used trucks provide a premium value in the marketplace. So that's a nice thing for our customers, and really have a 10% to 15% premium over our competitors. And actually sometimes, more than that compared to some of the competitors. But we have seen the used truck market in general, go into that double digit level of declines on that 10% to 15% decline, and that's already been kind of dealt with through this quarter. -- Okay. Thank you very much.Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. -- Yeah, good morning. Yes, our data that we analyze and publish shows that while you do garner a premium in the used market, you're seeing these prices are down year-over-year just like everybody else's. So thank you for confirming that. My question is around the month of inventory at your dealer, it has been, you know 2.4 months, but that's based on a trailing 12 month -- trailing sales, which are at a peak. So isn't it inevitable, that as we go into next year, those months of supply at the dealers are going to expand, and you're going to have to cut production. So could you just talk about that, and why you wouldn't have to under-produce retail sales going into next year, despite the fact that you got higher backlog? -- Well, I think -- maybe that's a little bit less than I would think about it. And I think we feel like the inventory, while you admit it, while you acknowledge is trailing run rate. We still do talk to our dealers all the time and our customers all the time, and we see that there will be good demand for the products, as we look forward. So I would say that, the last quarter's order intake has been lower, but as we get into the fourth quarter and we're meeting with customers, talking about what next year's buying pattern is going to be, I expect people will be buying trucks, and I think that indeed the occasional market seems to continue to be very solid throughout the country, throughout Canada. So I would expect that our inventory is OK. As far as adjustments go to production, like we said earlier, I think we make those adjustments up and down, as the market demands it. -- Yeah, that's for sure. And then just based on your guide's history. I know the truck cycles over the long term and a lot of them have been man made. But if we're going into a decline in 2020, for whatever reason, have we ever seen a cycle that's on a one year decline, or should we be bracing for a couple of years and then back to normal again. Just your perspective on that from your years of experience will be beneficial. Thanks. -- Yeah, that's a tough thing to forecast out what kind of a decline rate there would be. And if it might last longer than a year. I think we probably look at this and say, there are still strong economic fundamentals in the U.S. and Canada right now. GDP is positive, tonne miles are high. I think, we think there is normalizing of the market estimate of 230,000 to 260,000 is just -- kind of feels like where things are happening too. As far as it being beyond next year. No idea if it's just a pause in the economy, and that it will reaccelerate, or if it will slow down for more than a year. -- Okay, Well, I'll leave it there. I appreciate your color and insight. Thanks. -- Thank you, Ann.Our next question comes from David Leiker with Baird. Your line is now open. -- Good morning. This is Erin Welcenbach on for David. So my question for you is, just how firm does the backlog look from an industry perspective, and when would you expect order activity to pickup this year, if at all? -- Sure. Well, I think that we've already done a good job of looking into our backlog and working with our customers, just to make sure that we had real backlog, and that if there were cancellations, we took them. If there were different scheduling needs, we've addressed them. I can't speak for the total industry, but I feel like -- we feel like our backlog is in a reasonable shape right now. -- Okay. And then my second question is just, maybe if you can provide some additional color on your thoughts for Europe, and any regional variances you would expect next year, given your outlook for double digit declines in sales. -- One of the things we've seen in Europe has been -- that the U.K. has done quite nicely for us this year. So in spite of all the news around it, and maybe that will continue. We also are the leading brand of tractors throughout Europe. And as we watch Europe really expand East -- continue to expand east in development, our DAF premium products do a great job throughout all of Europe, and we have market leadership in countries like Poland and we are strong in Hungary and Romania and those kinds of countries. So as the total market of Europe matures, DAF does very well, enables us to grow share there. -- Great. Thanks for taking my questions.Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. -- Good morning, everyone. This is Ben Burud on for Jerry. -- Good morning, Ben. -- Good morning. Just wanted to spend a few more minutes on Europe. So the second quarter of production adjustments in a row it seems, and it seems to be the main driver of deliveries, only increasing 3% year-over-year in the quarter. I believe your guide three months ago was 5% to 7%. So can you just spend a little more time on what drove the softness there, if that's continuing? And if you guys like to flex production over there, on a quarterly basis or if there is second production adjustment, what was more of a surprise, any color there would be helpful. Thank you. -- Sure. I think I think your comments are reasonably accurate, as we did take the adjustments to Europe, to where -- a point where it matched the market demand. And we've seen that we've held onto our market share gains with our build rates. So we're setting at like 16.4%, which is near historic highs for us, in market share. So we think we have it balanced about right now. And Europe was probably a little sooner coming down than maybe we thought it might be, and that's why we made the necessary adjustments, and it feels like we're setting the right levels. -- Got it. And then, can you give us an update on how you're thinking about dealer location growth next year, for the TRP locations? Are you still thinking of adding 50 new locations per year, and any expected increase in Kenworth and Peterbilt dealers in 2020? -- Yeah. We have -- I mean I'll start by just saying, we have the best dealer network in the industry, and I mean spent a lot of time with them. They're fantastic business partners. We see significant investments from them in North America and in Europe. So it's one way to think about this, is that they're constantly renewing their facilities, and adding service bays and shop capability, to make sure our customers maximize their uptime. And so we'll watch next year that they'll continue to make those investments into new facilities, with lots of great plans around adding locations. And we'll see some location growth in North America. What I'd expect more in Europe, is it will be -- the continuing development of replacement locations and improved service bay capability or more service bay capability. And to your point of, TRP Stores, we will be adding TRP Stores in 2020 as well, probably much along the lines as we have, in this year. -- Got it. Thank you. -- Sure.Our next question comes from Tim Thein with Citigroup. Your line is now open. -- Thank you. Good morning. First question, just on a -- from a mix standpoint, this revenue per truck that -- call it 10% or almost 10% year-over-year growth, was that just all that contribution from North America being a bigger part of the deliveries, or is there kind of underlying content growth or mix story that's also contributing? -- No, you've got it about right. It's mostly contribution from North America. -- Okay, -- Pricing improvement, right? -- Yeah. -- Right, right OK. And then just back on the Financial Services and the pre-tax profits; in terms of the increase, I know that we have limited disclosure here in the release. But the increase in that interest and other line, how much of that is a change in terms of higher depreciation, that we will potentially be sustained going forward, versus maybe impairments or losses on used, that are presumably more one-time in nature? And the spirit of the question is just, should we assume a kind of a similar run rate in terms of a -- from a profitability perspective in the third quarter, or were there some kind of one timer's within that line? Thank you. -- So as far as the continuing to profitability, we think the strong profits we had in the third quarter will continue going forward and for the detail of your question, I will let Michael want to address that one. -- Yeah. We did have some impairments that were taken, and we also adjusted our depreciation to reflect expected future impairments. And so that run rate will continue going forward. And as Preston indicated, will be reflected at a similar pace in coming quarters. -- Got it. Thank you.Our next question comes from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America. Your line is now open. -- Yeah, good morning, good afternoon guys. -- Hey, good morning, good afternoon. -- I'm just trying to understand gross margins in a more draconian scenario than what you're forecasting for next year. I mean, I think if you go back in gross margins ex R&D in more of a garden-variety downturn have been around 12% to 13%. But you've got to go back like seven or eight years to see it. I'm just wondering, how do you think gross margins look in the next downturn, whenever it comes, in relation to that 12% to 13%, given the way the company has evolved over the last decade, particularly with the growth in the Parts business? -- I think one of the great strengths of PACCAR, is that we are always looking at operational efficiency gains, not just in one year, but over the course of time. We're always thinking about cost control. So as we head into markets like the normalized market we're facing, we've already been aggressively thinking about cost control, and I think that's enabled us to deliver the solid gross margins we had this quarter, and even the quarterly gross margins we predict for next quarter in 14% to 14.5%. So I think that we are always managing the business efficiently for the benefit of our customers, and we think that 14% to 14.5% that we deliver next quarter will be pretty solid. -- Yeah, I mean, I realize that. I wasn't asking about next quarter. I'm not asking you for it to forecast when the next trough is. I'm just saying, when eventually it does come, what do you think your gross margins would look like with -- in comparison to what prior downturns looked like? I mean, I imagine you're -- it has been very difficult to stay in the 14% to 14.5% range, if Class 8 build -- goes to sub 200,000 number. -- Well, that's kind of hypothetical to us. Just to think where it might go down to and how we might react in those circumstances. But you can imagine, that we will always be focused on cost control, and we have a long, long history of all different markets back through the recession of 2009, and we still continue with profitability and we'll continue to do a good job in those, even if those circumstances were to return, which we don't predict. -- Okay. How quickly can you reduce SG&A, as Class 8 production normalizes, and what will be the source of the savings? And just how should we think about SG&A into next year, as we revert back to replacement level demand? I mean if we model it at 2.3% of sales or so for this year, does it stay at that ratio in 2020, as production normalizes, or do we see it -- the ratio move higher? -- Yeah, I think what we're always looking for in those in SG&A, and in our spending is to make sure that we are developing the right products and services for customers looking into the future. And so as we shared, we think the level of spending for us on R&D and capital our capital come down a little bit. R&D is roughly flat, and I think in SG&A, we will apply rigorous disciplines, to make sure that the costs are appropriately controlled. -- And is that just from flexing the workforce, or what are the other -- is that the main source of savings, if -- when you get to that point? -- Workforce is one, contracts is another, licensing agreements, work we do, those kinds of things, all get looked at. We really don't think of things in terms of a lot of fixed pricing. -- We go through our overhead budgeting process every year, as a zero based budgeting process, and we review all necessary spending in detail and make sure that we're keeping our organization as lean as possible. -- Got it. Thanks Harrie. And then can you just remind us the percentage of your European deliveries that come from the U.K.? I seem to remember, it's around 20%, is that in the right ballpark? And can you remind us what portion of Leyland's capacity sold to the U.K. market versus the European Union? I mean on that note, could you shift production out of the U.K. to DAF in the Netherlands to serve Europe, if we did go through a hard Brexit? -- So I as we think about the U.K. one of the beautiful things for us is, we have great production capacity in the U.K. We also have it in Eindhoven, and so we were able to flex depending on what Brexit might or might not be appropriately for the market, so we can build the trucks we need in the U.K., in U.K., and we can build all the trucks, the CFXs [Phonetic] we need for the continent, we can build on the continent as well. So that gives us good flexibility, and I think Harrie, you were looking at the number... -- The U.K. typically is between 15% and 20% of our European production. -- Okay. So most of the existing production, at least for a year like this year, would just be -- would be for the U.K. market out of the U.K. factory? -- Yeah, that's -- we can use it for both, and we have enough there to support the U.K. and we have enough capacity in Europe to support Europe. -- And being the only truck manufacturer that has a factory in the U.K., that could give us a very nice advantage. -- Got it. Thanks guys.Our next question comes from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. -- Hi, good afternoon. I guess one question, as you're thinking about the commentary that you made about decrementals of the 15% to 20% or so, are there any variances or differences as we think about where the weakness is coming from, are the decrementals dissimilar and the U.S. and Europe are not so much anymore with being more vertically integrated the U.S. now. And then I guess my second question regards to -- relates to sort of price costs. Obviously pricing has been pretty strong for you guys this year, and the downturn that you guys are forecasting, do you think you can hold sort of price in that material cost could potentially be a tailwind for you? Thank you. -- Yeah, I think it will be -- your second part of question is quite possibly true, and we'll continue to manage price to best of our ability in the market, and we are always aggressively looking at our cost structure. And, as you mentioned, that could be a bit of a tailwind for us, in terms of what happens next year, as in 2019, suppliers are running at full capacity, some inefficiencies in their ships. So maybe there's some upside in that. -- And just the first part, difference U.S. versus Europe in terms of impact on margins? -- Yeah, they're very similar, very similar -- Okay, thank you.Our next question comes from Courtney Yakavonis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. -- Hi, thanks for the question. I just wanted to go back to the clarification on the comments on your build rate being appropriate for the orders you have right now in the backlog for the first quarter. So is your assumption then that -- at the beginning of 2020, that we should return to that kind of replacement rate of 20,000 orders a month? Or is your current build rate kind of assuming, that we remain at this sub-15,000 orders, and the backlog can fill in the rest. And then also just wanted to make sure that the comment was, that the September build rate is the right assumption we should have, going forward? -- Well, we've made adjustments in the first parts of October for our build rates, so this is coming at that. So we think we've got that set up right. When I think about our backlog and build rates for next year, we still have quite a healthy backlog, and so there could be a little bit of a more time for the normalization to that quarter intake of 20,000 per month, as you put the number out there. But orders are definitely starting to pick up. It's a very normal part of the cycle to have late summer be quiet, and then as people are putting their capital budgets into place, then to see the fourth quarter be a time of ordering, and we're seeing that right now. So whether it's going to be exactly at level this month or it will take a month or two to normalize out, it should normalize out. -- Got you. But it sounds like before the beginning of the year, you do expect that return. And then just on CapEx and R&D, you gave us guidance for 2020 and I think there's a bit of a step-down in CapEx versus '19 but still an elevated level, relative to what's historically seen out of you guys. So is that kind of the right run rate that we should be thinking about, the investments that you're -- that the business kind of needs at this point, or a lot of those one-time in nature? And then kind of same question on R&D, which is expecting to pick up, and especially in light of concerns about decrementals next year. Are there any buckets in R&D, that potentially could be [Indecipherable]? -- Sure. For both of them as far as -- whether they're one-time or continuous run rates, what we do is, we always look at the portfolio of projects and opportunities that are going to bring value, and we invest in those. We build the business for the long haul. Don't think about the quarterly cycle as much as we do, is making the right level of investments, and we have -- that's how we've arrived at the number, and the guidance number, at $625 million to $675 million in CapEx.And the same approach is on R&D, which is not a lot of really good projects out there right now, that have great ROIs for our customers. And so we're looking at those and always evaluating whether they should be done and whether you can bring the right value and the portfolio we have is, it's a fantastic portfolio, both for factory improvements, and one of the ones we mentioned, is the Chillicothe new paint facility, which will improve efficiencies and quality, just as an example. And as we look at the R&D spending kinds of projects on powertrains, and we mentioned electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles and more aerodynamic truck models, improvements, all of those are things that we look at and say, hey, if we can do this, and it's going to make our already best in class trucks even better, then we're going to do them. -- Got you. And then just lastly, I think last quarter you called out some customer mix headwinds. Obviously, we saw an improvement in margins this quarter, part of that was just stockings [Phonetic] from the headwinds from last quarter. But were there any customer mix changes this quarter that we should be thinking about, kind of for the remainder of the year? -- So I think we already kind of talked about North America being a positive for us in the quarter. And I think that's really the only minor thing that was -- I would say it was a contributor. But overall, good pricing, good cost control and a stronger North American mix. -- Okay. Thank you.Our next question comes from Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open. -- Hey, good morning guys. Good afternoon. -- Good morning. -- I wanted to start with a clarification of the fourth quarter production being down 6% to 8% sequentially. Could you break that out between your plans for North America and Europe? -- So I think they're fairly comparable without running exact numbers. They are both roughly in the same ranges in the quarterly, look at how they how they moved about high-single digits in North America, and it was a series of smaller steps through Europe, that did the same thing. -- Okay, got you. And then, I'm wondering what your view is on medium-duty truck markets next year in North America and then also your thoughts on Europe as well? -- So for the medium-duty market in North America, I think we're seeing, it's around 100,000 in North America and right around 50,000 in Europe for next year. So, comparable numbers for this year. -- Okay. Got you. And then just back to Europe. I'm wondering if you would be willing to share with us, the magnitude of the order declines that you did see in that region, and do you get the sense that order rates are bottoming out now, if we start to see a leveling out of that pace of decline, or is that maybe still too early? -- It what we're really trying to look at, is what's going on with the cycle and what's going on with the timing of the calendar year, and in fact of recent, we've seen an improving order intake in Europe, actually it's matching up to our build, so that's been a nice balancing point. And hopefully that will be what continues. -- Is there any particular region or part of the continent that saw a nice improvement? -- Got to believe it has something to do with providing great trucks to our customers, and I think that really is a big part of it at the end of the day, because I think that we've been able to get to our record market shares in Europe and hold on to that share because people are experiencing our fantastic trucks and want some more of those. -- Got you. Thank you.Our next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. -- Hi, thank you. I was impressed with the parts outlook for next year. Can you give us a little more comfort on your visibility to project that kind of parts growth for next year? I know you have some help from the aging of the engines, hitting a sweet spot. But can you help us get a little more comfort with that stronger growth? -- Yeah, sure. I think that strong growth is a result of, as you said the engines. It's also this investment in TRP that we're doing. Our team there does a fantastic job in e-commerce and in reaching out to our customers through new ways that are meeting their needs. So we're able to just kind of keep taking more and more of the market. These investments in our PDCs that we mentioned, both in Ponta Grossa in Brazil and in Las Vegas, allow us to get parts to the customers more quickly in those regions, which makes us a more desirable provider. And really frankly in partnership with our dealerships, who are fully committed to growing their parts business, because it's good for them, good for our customers and good for us, it's one of those real opportunities for win-win-win. -- Are there any metrics of any kind though that you for backlog of some kind or some parts -- percent of the parts business that has some sort of annual contract? -- Yeah. Parts don't really work out that kind of a long backlog, it's much more of a... -- I appreciate that. But just any anything you're looking at, that might give us some more comfort on the number? -- Well, I think the comfort should come from the historically strong performance and then the reasons that we just talked about, which are just a lot of great products, growing relation of PACCAR products in Europe and North America over the past several years and that has also contributed to that growth and will continue to contribute to that growth, and some strong markets that we have a large part of trucks out there. -- And last, the European business, the leasing of trucks, can you help us a little bit, well you said there was less of it in this quarter, sort of, what are you seeing on that front for the mix going into next year? -- Missed the first part of your question on this side, can you say it again David? -- For the European business, the mix of businesses where there are some buyback guarantees and the leasing of the business, how you represent to the revenues, it impacted the price per unit delivery this quarter. Can you just help us take us through your thoughts on '20, on the mix for that into next year? -- I think it's probably going to run a lot like this '19 has gone. Those adjustments were more '19 to '18 than they were looking forward. So we're at a pretty stable rate of optional and fixed rate GRVs [Phonetic]. -- Okay, thank you very much. I appreciate it.Our next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Loop Capital Markets. Your line is now open. -- Thank you very much. Good morning, everybody. A lot of my questions have been answered. I wanted to focus a little bit on tax rate, if that's OK. It looks like the tax rate outlook had come down a little bit, and maybe I'm not thinking about it right, I would have thought more North American exposure would have driven it higher? Am I wrong, does it drive it lower, and is that kind of a lower level of taxes that we should be thinking about for the rest of this year? -- The tax rate normally -- you should think about is a 23% level. We benefited in Q3 from higher R&D credits than originally anticipated. So those are our final returns. -- Okay. So should I carry that through to the end of the year, or is it more of a third quarter thing? -- Well, I think you should think in terms of 23% for Q4 and for 2020. -- Okay. And as I look to -- OK. You said for 2020. That's my question, all my others have been answered. Thank you. -- Great, thank you.Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research. Your line is now open. -- Hi. In U.S. and Canada, it looks like Class 6, 7 growth was pretty healthy in the quarter, and better than the market, and so curious, whether that's just sort of time... -- Joe, are you still there? -- Lindsay, are you there?Yes, I am showing that Joe is still connected. -- Well, I guess, we'll just -- we aren't hearing from you, we will just kind of try to extrapolate your question a little bit. -- Or we could move on and maybe Joe can rejoin.Okay, great. Our next question comes from Neil Frohnapple with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open. -- Hi, good morning. Thanks. I believe PACCAR's market share historically tends to be counter-cyclical. I mean is there any reason to think that your market share wouldn't be higher in 2020, and your production wouldn't outperform the industry? I guess I'm just asking the production question a little differently. -- Sure. I think, the trucks are performing exceptionally well in the field. I think our customers are experiencing that we're delivering the best fuel economy, and the lowest operating cost of any brand. So we do think that should drive our market share up, and looking forward to that happening, and working every day to make sure that does happen. -- Okay, great. And then just going back to the parts sales growth outlook for next year, 4% to 6%. I'm presuming that the lower outlook, I guess relative to the 8% part segment CAGR that you talked about at the Investor Day, is more due to just fleets pulling back on spending and purchasing obviously a lot less trucks next year. So I guess, at what point do you think that growth rate can start to reaccelerate, in order for you guys to hit those long-term targets? -- Yeah, I think that the 4% to 6% number is a nice steady growth rate in a market that's declining, as depending on what happens. And again, I think that there's a lot of things working right to it, as far as when it come back up. We'll keep our eyes on that, and watching for every opportunity to grow it. -- All right. Thanks so much. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from Robert Salmon with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. -- Hey -- and thanks for taking the question. Could you give a little clarification on the used truck outlook, it sounded like in the third quarter, it was down 10% to 15%, is that what you guys are contemplating looking out, or are you contemplating kind of a similar absolute level of used truck sales, from a price perspective? -- Yeah, I think that down amount that we've seen, maybe that will continue. It's obviously difficult to forecast entirely where it will stay settled out to. But... -- It could stay around for the next couple of quarters. -- And I think you know the thing we're looking at is just that there is -- there is still a really healthy demand out there for day cabs specifically, and although values are down, we have the advantage of PACCAR of having a mix of trucks. We are not very uniform in our truck distribution. A lot of day cabs, a lot of pickup and delivery, a lot of vocational trucks, and some sleeper trucks as well. So I think our ability to move those trucks should at least perform to the market and probably outperform, and again, we'll keep getting the premium for those trucks. -- That's helpful. And as I look at the gross margin outlook for the fourth quarter, can you give an update on what the price cost spread was in the third quarter? And then, looking out to the fourth quarter, if there are any any sort of different assumptions you have built in there, just to get a sense of what sort of decrementals you guys are kind of thinking about in production, versus a different price cost mix? -- And so, in the third quarter, we saw a price of roughly 3% and cost of 1.5%. And I think in the fourth quarter, I think there will be more pricing pressure, but there could be some opportunity on costs, that we're evaluating right now. -- And would you expect the cost opportunity to kind of continue, should it step up in 2020, relative to your experience in the fourth quarter? Or are you kind of thinking about something similar? -- I think it might be hard to guess out to what is going to be in 2020 right now. -- Okay. I appreciate the time guys. -- You bet.[Operator Instruction]. Our next question comes from Shawn Kim with Gabelli Funds. Your line is now open. -- Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking our question here. Just wanted to follow up on the parts business. I think at your Investor Day, you mentioned -- you guys expect to have 450,000 MX engines in service by 2024. But I guess, said another way, I mean is that the right way to look about your total addressable market for the parts business in the mid 2020s? So if -- I think the active U.S. Class 8 population is about 2.2 million trucks. I guess, out of that 2.2 million figure, what's the opportunity for you guys long-term regarding servicing those trucks on the road? -- So I think about it in a couple of different ways. One is, that you mentioned is, the growing MX park that's out there, we did add capacity to our Columbus engine plant, and increase our build rates of MX engines. In fact, in the second -- in the first half, I think we were 39% MX, and in the third quarter we were 45%, so we saw some growth there and do see some continued upside for MX engines, as people get to realize the benefits of that great engine. And then I think it's not just about our park of vehicles for Kenworth and Peterbilt and DAF for the engine. I think our team does a great job of also capturing into the all-mix business with the TRP brands, where 50% of those customers are new to PACCAR, which creates a great opportunity for growth for us as well. And I think we're always looking at opportunities to grow, not just the parts business itself, but provide increased levels of service for our customers, and that comes through higher degrees of connectivity of the trucks, where we understand better what's going on. So all of those point to opportunities to keep growing the parts business over time. -- Great. Thank you guys. -- You bet.There are no other questions in queue at this time. Are there any additional remarks from the company? -- Yes. We'd like to thank everyone for joining the call and thank you, operator.[Operator Closing Remarks]. --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- \n\nWhen investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That said, when buying into a cyclical stock, timing is obviously important -- no one wants to invest in a stock at a peak and this sector looks set to decline in 2020. In that context, let's take a look at what the latest set of earnings reports from major companies in the sector suggest about buying the stocks.The light at the end of the tunnel for trucking stock earnings could come in 2021, but investors are likely to buy in ahead of it. Image source Getty ImagesAs you can see in the chart below, the valuations of trucking stocks like Cummins and PACCAR tend to be far more volatile -- and usually lower -- than those of defensive stocks like \u00a0and . data by . EV = enterprise value (market cap + net debt). EBIT = earnings before interest and taxation.As the valuations fluctuate, so do the share prices, and as you can see in the next chart, the returns on investment one could get from Cummins, PACCAR and Navistar (excluded from these charts because it's had company-specific issues which added to its extreme volatility) were heavily dependent on when a shareholder bought in.It's easy to see in hindsight that if you had purchased shares of Cummins and PACCAR at the start of 2016, you would now be up by 95% and 59%, compared to the S&P 500's return of 48% over the period; interestingly Johnson & Johnson and Colgate-Palmolive are only up 28% and 3% over that time. data by Anyone who claims they can exactly predict the behavior of stock prices in the next cycle is a liar, but you can look at how stocks have traded during previous periods when conditions were similar to the current ones, and consider what followed them. One key variable in this sector is U.S. heavy truck sales, because they tend to correlate with trucking companies' revenue.There are two interesting takeaways from the chart below, specifically regarding the periods at the start of 2013 and 2016, when the share prices of Cummins and PACCAR rose significantly even as truck sales had peaked and trucking stocks' revenue and earnings were continuing to decline.Clearly, the market decided to buy in ahead of a bottoming in truck sales, and continued to buy the stocks even as their valuations rose for an extended period -- due to the combination of rising stock prices and deteriorating earnings. data by If history is a guide then the time to buy trucking stocks is when revenue and earnings start to turn down -- something that a lot of investors will find counter-intuitive.Let's take a look at the current situation. As you can see below, a strong truck market in 2019 means 12-month trailing revenue still grew for all three of these companies in their latest quarters. However, truck industry production is set for a sharp decline in 2020, and that's likely to reduce revenue and earnings. Indeed, PACCAR expects Class 8 heavy-duty truck retail sales in the U.S. and Canada to decline from a range of 310,000 to 320,000 this year to between 230,000 and 260,000 in 2020. Navistar also predicts a sharp decline in industry production. However, the big question is what will the industry look like in 2021? One forecast comes from\u00a0 from a leading trucking industry research company: \"With a major trade caveat, our underlying view is that the economy will have slower growth but not recession, so the heavy duty truck market rebounds and enjoys three years of growth from 2021 to 2023,\" wrote ACT Research senior analyst Tim Denoyer.That would be great news for trucking stocks, as it would indicate a return to revenue and earnings growth in 2021, and based on history, the market would start pricing in a recovery sometime in 2020.\u00a0However, as noted above, the difficult bit is predicting the timing of the recovery in stock prices. It's impossible to know this, but we  know the current value of what we are buying.\u00a0Data source: Company presentation. Analyst estimates.If Denoyer is right, and heavy-duty truck sales in the U.S. bounce in 2021 -- and the market starts to anticipate this -- then history suggests that trucking stock prices will rise. Moreover, the forecast 2020 valuations for Navistar, Cummins, and PACCAR make them look good values on a historical basis for companies that are set to enter up-cycles in 2021.In short, don't worry too much about falling truck sales, trucking stock earnings, or the probability of rising valuations in 2020 -- we know all that is coming. Provided the economy doesn't fall into recession, and 2021 delivers a bounce in demand, then history suggests trucking stocks are a good value right now -- and are probably better bets than some defensive stocks.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The stock surged following a well-received set of third-quarter earnings. And almost by stealth, all the leading trucking-sector stocks are now up in the double digits on a year-to-date basis as I write this. Of particular note, engine maker   and truck manufacturer   are now up nearly 25% on the year, and most of the gains were in the last week! What's going on? Were Navistar's results really that good?Image source: Getty Images.The , with Navistar reporting market share gains and growing sales and earnings in double digits during the quarter. In addition, management confirmed its full-year guidance on sales and adjusted earnings before interest, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). Moreover, there was even a slight upgrade to its forecast for full-year Class 8 (heavy duty) industrywide\u00a0truck production and its core market exposure. For reference, Navistars core markets are Class 8 (heavy trucks and severe service trucks), Class 6 & 7 (medium-duty trucks) and school buses.Data source: Navistar presentations.It all looks pretty good, but was it good? Does merely confirming full-year guidance justify a 30% upward move in the stock price in the five days after the results?Of course, these are rhetorical questions, as there's no rational reason for Navistar's market cap to rise nearly a third after these results. Although it reported market share gains -- its share of the combined Class 8 category (heavy duty and severe service trucks) was 13.9% in the third quarter versus 12.3% in the same period a year ago --  there were also some negatives in the report.The downside came from the fact that full-year revenue is expected to be \"toward the lower half of our guidance range of $11.25 billion to $11.75 billion for the year,\" according to CFO Walter Borst on the . Moreover, full-year gross margin expectations were nudged down slightly from a range of 18.25% to 18.75%, to 17.75% to 18%. Borst put this down to a combination of relatively higher truck sales (parts margin tends to be higher), higher commodity prices, and weakness in the used truck market. In addition, management gave industrywide\u00a0production-volume guidance for 2020 indicating that it would be a down year for the industry.Data source: Navistar presentations.Furthermore, a look across the industry -- at, say,\u00a0\u00a0-- suggests\u00a0the trucking market has peaked or is very close to it already. Investors can expect sales declines next year, and analysts already have an 8% sales decline penciled in for Navistar in 2020, with Cummins revenue expected to decline 3%. So if the earnings weren't that great and the outlook is for a down year in 2020, why did the stock and the sector soar?The answer probably lies in the familiar guessing game that the market plays with highly cyclical stocks like Navistar; a similar dynamic exists when .\u00a0Many investors shy away from buying into the trucking sector as it's approaching a peak in truck sales, but history suggests that after the peak has passed, and the bad news is baked into guidance, that it's usually a good time to buy into the sector in anticipation of a turn in the cycle in the future. Confused? I'll explain.The market has known for a while that 2020 was likely to be a down year, and Navistar CEO Troy Clarke provided plenty of evidence to confirm it: Class 8 truck orders declined 75% in the quarter, and backlogs are declining, while U.S. GDP growth is \"expected to be around 2% for the balance of the year,\" according to Clarke.In these situations, the market tends to price the upcoming decline in truck sales into the valuations of the stocks. As you can see below, the multiples of enterprise value (market cap plus net debt) to  for Cummins, Navistar, and PACCAR are comparable to what they traded on toward the end of 2016 -- when the trucking market last turned down. data by The question now turns to what's baked into guidance for next year. As the chart below indicates, forward valuations in the sector are low and imply notably lower multiples than when truck sales troughed in early 2017. All of which suggests that if you believe that the trucking market will start to stabilize next year, then it makes sense to hold the stocks. data by In the end, it's a classic case of selling the rumor and buying the news. In this case, the rumor is that truck sales will decline, and the news is that now, companies are explicitly coming out and saying it. Of course, there's no guarantee that the trucking market will trough in 2020, but the valuations of stocks like Cummins and Navistar make them look attractive on a risk/reward basis.When investing geniuses David and Tom\u00a0Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

For additional information, please see our SEC filings in the Investor Relations page of paccar.com. I would now like to introduce Preston Feight. -- Good morning. Harrie Schippers, Michael Barkley and I will update you on PACCAR's excellent second quarter results and business highlights. First and foremost, I'm very proud of our exceptional employees who are passionate about providing our customers the highest quality, highest performing trucks and services in the world. I also want to thank those analysts who participated in our Investor Conference in New York in May.The PACCAR team appreciated the opportunity to provide an update on our business. PACCAR achieved record quarterly sales and financial services revenues of $6.6 billion, and excellent net income of $620 million resulting in a 9.3% after-tax return on revenues. PACCAR parts generated record revenues of over $1 billion and record pre-tax profits of $211 million. Parts revenues increased 6% and profits grew 8% compared to the second quarter of last year. PACCAR achieved robust truck parts and other gross margins of 14.8%, driven by record truck deliveries, aftermarket parts demand and strong operational performance. PACCAR delivered a record 52,300 trucks during the second quarter, 13% higher than the second quarter of last year. This reflects increased build in North America, partially offset by lower build in Europe. The U.S. and Canadian Class 8 industry backlog remains high. Kenworth and Peterbilt's 2019 production schedules are substantially full with customers ordering trucks for delivery in the first half of next year. In Europe, DAF has achieved an excellent year-to-date market share of 16.7% and the DAF XF was honored as the Fleet Truck of the Year in the U.K.PACCAR continues to provide excellent annual operating margins, resulting in strong operating cash flow for distribution to shareholders and for reinvestment in future growth. PACCAR declared second quarter dividends of $0.32 per share and first half dividends of $0.64 per share. First half dividends were 21% higher than dividends declared in the same period last year. The Company has delivered annual dividends in the range of 45% to 55% of net income for many years and has paid a dividend every year since 1941. PACCAR has increased its quarterly dividend an average of 11% per year during the last 20 years. We repurchased 345,000 shares of stock during the second quarter with a $484 million remaining in the current Board of Directors authorization. PACCAR is investing in future growth with capital expenditures of $675 million to $725 million and R&D expenses of $320 million to $340 million this year. These investments will fund enhanced aerodynamic truck models, integrated powertrains, zero emissions electric and hydrogen fuel cell technologies, advanced driver assistance systems and truck connectivity.We're also enhancing our manufacturing and distribution facilities at the Kenworth Chillicothe, Ohio truck factory. We added a new robotic cab build cell and are constructing a new state-of-the-art paint facility, which will lower operating costs, enhance quality and increase capacity. To meet increased customer demand for the popular PACCAR MX engine, we are adding machining and assembly equipment in the Columbus, Mississippi engine plant. We recently opened two global software R&D centers, one in Kirkland, Washington and one in Eindhoven, The Netherlands. These centers will accelerate the development of embedded vehicle software and PACCAR connected vehicle solutions for our customers. In the third quarter, truck deliveries will be higher in North America due to higher build rates and lower in Europe reflecting the normal three weeks summer shutdown. Global deliveries will be 5% to 7% higher than the third quarter of last year. We forecast third quarter gross margins for truck, parts and other to remain strong and be in a range of 14.5% to 15%. 2019 will be another outstanding year for the Company. Harrie Schippers will now provide an update on truck markets, PACCAR Parts and PACCAR Financial Services. -- Thanks. Preston. The U.S. economy is in good shape, helped by a strong truck markets, growing wages and increased business investment. Freight tonnage has grown a healthy 4.4% year-to-date. We've raised our estimate of U.S. and Canadian Class 8 truck industry retail sales to a range of 300,000 to 320,000 vehicles this year. We're in a period of robust customer demand demonstrated by the historically high backlog, truck production levels and retail sales. The U.S. and Canada Class 8 backlog was 188,000 trucks at the end of June. Kenworth and Peterbilt's backlog represented 36% of the industry, we are raising our European above 16-ton market projection to a range of 300,000 to 320,000 vehicles this year. The European economies are growing at a lower rate than last year. PACCAR delivered record first half net income of $1.25 billion.PACCAR Parts achieved record first half revenues of $2.30 billion and record pre-tax profits of $418 million. PACCAR has steadily increased its truck and engine market share over the years, resulting in a greater number of PACCAR trucks and engines in operation. This large and growing Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF truck Park has driven 8% annual PACCAR parts revenue growth over the last 15 years.This generates consistent high margin profitability in all phases of the business cycle. We continue to invest in the parts business with new parts distribution centers under construction in Las Vegas, Nevada and Ponta Grossa, Brasil. We expect part sales to grow 5% to 7% for the full year 2019. PACCAR Financial Services earned second quarter pre-tax income of $18 million, 11% higher than the second quarter last year. The PACCAR Financial portfolio performed well. This year, PACCAR Financial will open used truck centers in Prague, Czech Republic, and Denton, Texas to support solid customer demand for DAF, Peterbilt, and Kenworth trucks.One of PACCAR's greatest assets does not appear on the balance sheet, I'm referring to the independent financially strong Kenworth, Peterbilt, and DAF dealers who operate more than 2,200 sales, service, and TRP store locations worldwide.

Your line is now open. -- Hi, good morning, everybody. -- Good morning. -- Harrie, I wonder if I could get you to make a few more comments about some of your kind of end market visibility and what I'm thinking about is obviously, you said, you're sort of taking orders for the first half of 2020. But of course, the overall order rate has come down quite a bit and I'm curious just kind of what you're hearing from customers and seeing in your order trends relative to demand in 2020. Do you think things tick up again as we get into the fall selling season, or are you hearing kind of caution because freight rates have come down, just kind of a, some thoughts about the quality of the 2020 order. -- So if you look at the backlog for North America, today, we're in really good shape and like Preston said, we're increasing build rates in North America. Europe, the backlog is very normal and our production levels are in line with the orders in the backlog in the market as we see it today. -- Okay, so do you have any kind of preliminary thoughts about what 2020 might look like. Obviously, the market is sort of primed for a big decline. -- We typically comment on 2020, once we get -- get closer to it so that's probably something for the next call. -- All right. I figured, it might be worth a try. Can I sneak one more in on just kind of what you're seeing relative to pricing in the new truck environment ? -- Yeah, we look at the pricing realization in trucks in the second quarter. We saw, I will say, couple of percent price realization largely offset by cost and so that's kind of imbalance with each other. -- Okay, great, thank you very much.Our next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. -- Thanks a lot, good morning as well. -- Good morning. -- I have a question on the shipments. It went up about 1.5% in Q2 from Q1. It's a little different than the outlook on the short-term that you gave last quarter 2% to 4% was the entire difference between actual and predicted driven by Europe. And if so, I guess to piggyback on Steve's question, can you describe what your European order intake may be was compared to last year. And then also some color around the overall market development. -- Yeah, so just look at the start of the highest level of it, we did see growth in North America this year and that was as we said offset a little bit by what we experienced in Europe. We have really good balance in Europe right now between our order intake and our build rate. So we've got that set up really well, and in fact if you look at the first half market share results, we had 16.7% which is above last year's record 16.6%, so that's set up very nicely for us right now and we kind of see that order intake is as I said, matching into what we are -- what we are doing with build right now. -- Okay, thank you and then on the, just specifically looking at the Truck segment margin and it pretty much seem to be in line with what you were looking for. But flattish, up -- maybe 10 basis points year-over-year and then down from Q1, despite higher revenue in both cases. Can you -- can you elaborate, now that the quarter is done in terms of what some of the headwinds might have been that limited the segment's ability to realize maybe some better margin leverage on that revenue growth. -- Sure, I think if you look at, if you start within say -- it was 14.8% in the overall, gross margin feels very strong. So when we look at it from a year-over-year standpoint, truck has been able to hold on to that. And I think, the reason it doesn't see significant movement up is because it's already operating in a very high level. So we're at a very efficient point in the -- in the gross margins and then, I think, if you just talked about it a little bit from a -- from a sequential standpoint, the only difference between Q1 and Q2 has to do with really the customer mix that's happened between quarter one and quarter two. -- Okay, thank you very much.Our next question comes from Joel Tiss with BMO. Your line is now open. -- Hey guys, how is it going? -- Really good. How is it going for you? -- All right, I wondered just to try to -- to be Steve for a second here. Can you talk about the second half production instead of just third quarter and the -- the production schedules and just sort of give us a little bit of an idea. So maybe, we can have a small window into the fourth quarter. -- Well, we, if I try to talk about in terms of second half. We have again North America going up in the second half and then Europe, we think is stable, where we've got it right now. So we feel like those are balanced for what we would expect to see through the second half. -- Okay, and then beyond the customer mix, it sounded like in North America, but maybe, I'm reading too much into that. Is there any -- any negative margin. The incremental margins at 10%. You've been kind of running 12% or 13%, is there any -- because Latin America was so strong, is that a factor in there or not at all? -- Latin America is a small percentage of the business still, so it really didn't have that much weighting factor to us. I mean, there's a little bit of benefit to it, but there's not a lot. -- Okay and then just last, the receivables, up 30%, is there any color you can add to that ? -- Actually about increasing in the [Phonetic] -- Why is that so high? -- Increasing in the build rates has been the primary driver of that. -- Okay, so it just seems like it's up a lot more than builds. Okay, thank you very much. -- You're welcome . -- You bet.Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. -- Yes, hi, good morning and good afternoon, everyone. -- Good morning, good afternoon. -- I'm wondering if you could expand on your comments on the European production adjustment that you took in the quarter to match incoming order rates, when was that production adjustment take place. And as we think about the third quarter, normal seasonality would have production down 5% to 10% sequentially for you in Europe, so are we on -- at the right production point entering the third quarter, where we should see that normal seasonality or is production coming down sequentially, more than that normal 5% to 10% rate? -- So the adjustments we made were just in the second quarter and again those -- they happen throughout the second quarter and they still delivered us this excellent market share that we saw. From the third quarter, looking forward, we do have a normal summer shutdown which is a two week summer shutdown so there is an overall effect in the market, but from a daily build rate standpoint, we're in a good position. -- Okay. And in North America, we obviously know that you folks are built to order in when marketing FLEX, we typically see production adjustments from you folks. First, so when you folks are raising build rates sequentially 3Q versus 2Q that implies that you've had a full backlog scrub and you're comfortable with the level of dealer inventories, can you just confirm that point and that the expected deliveries for 3Q have firm customer specification to them as opposed to what are some typical dealer specs? -- I think you did a a really nice job of characterizing it. Actually, we do to a backlog scrub and make sure that we have clean orders in there and we do build to order and as we've looked through that and we see that there is still very strong order backlog. Harrie said that we have 36% of the backlog for the industry is ours and so we want to make sure that we get the truck to the customers. They need the trucks to run their businesses and so we're in the manner of building as quickly as we can for them. -- And in terms of the level of dealer inventories, can you just calibrate us out of the industry statistics that we have, you mentioned a backlog worth 36% of the backlog. What about out of inventories? -- If you think of the inventory numbers against dealer [Phonetic] at 2.8 months and for a PACCAR in North America, it's 2.3 [Phonetic]. So we have our inventory in very good position with our dealers. -- Okay, all right, thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Ann Duignan with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. -- Hi, everybody. I'd like to circle back to Europe, I mean registrations year-to-date are up closer to 10% and your deliveries are basically flat, maybe up slightly year-to-date, can you talk about the discrepancy. Have we seen a pull forward of registrations ahead of the mid-year tachograph requirement or is there anything unusual going on in the marketplace versus -- what -- how you are choosing to deliver? -- I think, you actually nailed it, Ann. I think that remote tachograph is probably the biggest impact on what's pulled forward the -- pull forward the orders from -- in front of June 15 and so that's what we saw, we still expect the market in the 300,000 to 320,000 truck range and we should be able to have really excellent market share and with our build rates from the first half and second half for that. -- And just as a follow-up to that, again, on Europe, given the announcement today and the new leadership in the U.K. Does that phrase or reaccelerate the concerns around Brexit and the impact that that could have on freight and just the whole industry as we get closer to the end of the year or what -- what are you hearing over there in terms of now, it sounds like it's a little bit more definitive? -- Yeah, so one of the nice things for us is we are the market leader in the U.K. We do a great job all around Europe and our share is up in Europe and up in the U.K. also specifically. So as we look at what might happen with Brexit, we have a great advantage in that we do manufacturer all our truck models for the U.K., in the U.K. So I don't know, what the outcomes will be. But PACCAR is really well positioned with our manufacturing base in Europe to take advantage of it either way, it goes. -- I meant more broadly what impact it might have on just freight and the whole European economy. Any comments on that? -- Yeah, I don't think, we know that answer any better than anybody else. I would say that we've been pleasantly surprised with how the U.K. has performed in the first half of the year, there's been strong customer demand in the first half and that's been great. -- Okay, thank you. I'll get back in line. Appreciate it. -- Thanks, Ann.Our next question comes from David Leiker with Baird. Your line is now open. -- Good morning, everyone. -- Good morning. -- I wanted to talk about this kind of triangle effect between orders, backlog, inventories, you can throw cancels in there and what we're going through here in North America is while the order rates have fallen, the backlogs have remained elevated and I'm not sure, we've ever gone through a period of falling orders, where backlogs remain elevated and wondering if that might change a little bit of the economics of the earnings you might see as these lower order rates flow through the numbers? -- I think, you know, one of the things you have to keep in mind is the bigger, the bigger picture of what happened last year and we had 458,000 industry orders last year. So that's a big number, and it takes a while for that to normalize through things, but it's not going to have any effect on our financial performance. We've got great financial performance and our dealers are doing really well and our customers love the trucks and so those things continue to work well and the results will be solid. -- Okay. And then just, I'm going to pick on Europe also, any particular markets or areas over there that you feel more worried than others. I mean, a lot of those -- a lot of your customers from those markets are exporting out of Europe into other parts of the world as well? -- I think that Europe has done really well this year for us. I mean, obviously we have the market range of 300,000 to 320,000 trucks and us gaining share. So this would be the fourth year in a row above 300,000 if it stays like this and that's a fantastic market size and the DAF team, all the employees, the team, the dealers are doing a great job of growing the business. I think, the customers love the trucks and the fuel economy is outstanding and it's working really well. -- Okay, great. Thank you.Our next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is now open . -- Thanks, good afternoon and good morning. -- Afternoon and good morning. -- How do the orders that you guys have taken for 2020 compare to the level of what you typically take in at this time of the year for the following year, I assume, it's got to be much higher and if that's, so I guess why are our cust -- this is, I guess going back to Steve Volkmann's question, why are customers rushing to place orders if freight fundamentals are softening? -- Well, I would say, it this way. As I'd say, we -- we probably just get to the first part of your question. We do see order intake for 2020 higher, than we might typically see it that's in large part because in a different market, you might see that there is a lot more activities surrounded about filling 3Q and 4Q of the current year, year-end but since that's substantially full, there is interest in 2020. And so that's kind of just, I think where, people's energies go to. -- But with freight fundamentals softening, why wouldn't they just wait it out a little bit to see how the rest of the year is going to go? -- I think some people do but freight fundamentals are really mix, right, we have a great economy in North America. GDP growth is occurring, I think, through May, ATA truck tonnage was up 4.4% so there is not like things are going badly, and we spend a lot of time as our team with our employees and our dealers talking to customers and customers are doing a good job. You see the truck companies earnings reports and they're coming out really strong in a lot of cases. So there is -- there is lot of reason for optimism too. -- Got it and then you said that the cost to offset price in the quarter, it sounded like price, you said was up a couple of percent, which may be down 1% or so from the first quarter and I would have expected cost to be coming down. So I guess, why was the pricing growth moderating and should we be expecting that that costs are actually coming down going forward here? -- You wanted to offer any color. -- It's Mike. Preston just said, it's mostly customer mix that pricing was in line with the cost increases more or less. -- And what was that customer mix difference between Q2 and Q1? -- So the customer difference is in the first quarter, a lot of dealers will have stock trucks on their lots and those are -- in terms of small quantity buys and then we get to a more distributed look at customer mix in the second quarter. So there is still the stock orders but then there's just a low to large-sized customer orders come in. -- Terrific, thanks, guys. -- You bet.Our next question comes from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. -- Hey, good morning, everybody. I just wanted to go back, I think your guidance for the parts revenue growth for this year, you moderated the top end. I think, you're now seeing 5% to 7%. It was previously 5% to 8%. Is there anything you would call out there that is causing the -- just sort of the moderation. Thanks. -- Yeah, sure. The parts business is really doing fantastic. It continues to perform at a high level, take the opportunity to say this. We look at where our investments are going in that business in the new distribution centers in Ponta Grossa, Brasil and Las Vegas and the way the team is moving through their initiatives of things like e-commerce and TRP growth is really fantastic. The only reason for any adjustment is really a currency effect that we pushed into the 5% to 7%. -- Yeah, it's the revenues in Europe in euros that translates into a fewer dollars, when we do the translation. -- Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on. The FinCo margin actually came down sequentially. Is there anything that you would call out there and is that sort of the run rate we should think of going forward? Thank you. -- I don't think so -- I don't think, it's . When we look at new business generation, it's actually up quarter-over-quarter. So it's more about portfolio that I think you're talking about, and but the team is doing really good, if you looked at their earnings per quarter, it went up to $80 million and ended [Phonetic] at $164 million in the first half and it's just doing fantastic. -- Okay, thank you very much, guys.Our next question comes from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America. Your line is now open. -- Thanks guys. I was just wondering, what are you seeing in the Mexican truck market and what would you do if some of the trade tensions that that started to rematerialize a couple of months ago came back and do you think, your overall footprint in North America given your relative lack of exposure to Mexican production is behind any of the order share strength that you've seen.In other words, are customers, perhaps ordering more from PACCAR, just because there's greater surety -- surety supply given some of your competitors being relatively more exposed to Mexican production. Any thoughts there? -- Yeah, I think, the team in -- the team in Mexico is just doing a really good job down there. We have great trucks. Obviously, the newest trucks we've introduced, the latest generation are fantastically well received by the customers and so their share was exceptionally good and if you look at there was an emissions change that happened in the middle of the year, so there was a strong buy ahead of that. But even since then order intake is -- has been positive and doing quite well.So I don't -- I don't think, it's really affected by where people think, we're going to build the trucks and we obviously can build trucks in Mexico for Mexico. We can make our domestic U.S. and Canadian production in local markets. So I think, we just have a great manufacturing footprint that works well. And I don't -- I don't think there's anything about trade tensions affecting that. I think, it's more about great trucks and people. -- And I guess that's the point. Most of what you produce in Mexico is for the Mexican market, correct. And if you did see tariffs, all of a sudden actually come back and put into place. Do you feel like you have sufficient capacity in the U.S. market to just relocate some of that production in a very short-term basis. -- Yeah, we do have that capability. -- Okay and then I think you made a comment about adding engine capacity in Mississippi, if I heard it right. And I wonder, if you could talk a little bit more about that, are you seeing share shift more toward the MX engine with the trucks that you're selling ? -- The MX engine, MX- 11 and MX-13 engines are doing really well. They're providing. I think the -- just outstanding fuel economy in the market space. People had time to get used of them obviously now. And we are seeing strong demand from our customers for those engines for their lightweight and high performance. So we've increased our capacity in Columbus, and just recently finished that capacity increase at the end of the second quarter and going to be able to build some more engines for our customers in the second half. -- Can you say it, roughly, how much you've increased capacity in Columbus ? -- It's been meaningful, but it's, you know 10% to 20% kind of numbers. -- Got it, OK . Thank you and just lastly on Brasil, maybe you could comment there. I mean, you've had obviously a pretty explosive growth over the last couple of years, remind us where you are on market share and I think from the beginning, the target was to get to 10% in five years to six years. As you continue to get closer to that number, do you start to grow more in line with the Brasilian market in the next couple of years? -- Well, you know the trucks, the DAF trucks in Brasil are working very, very well for our customers. I was down there just couple of months ago and the dealers and customers are really excited with the performance they get, reliability and durability and fuel economy that they're providing in Brasil. So that's enabling our continued growth. The year-over-year standpoint, market share is up just a bit and it will continue to grow -- continue to make investments in Brasil. Parts business is doing really well down there, in the middle of building a new distribution center in Ponta Grossa, 160,000 square foot distribution center in Ponta Grossa which will support the business growth and the market overall is improving in Brasil. So really feeling good about the efforts our team has made down there. The results they are bringing, success with the dealers now and just how the business is going to continue forward. -- Thank you. -- You bet.Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. -- Hello. I guess just a question, specifically, what is your visibility in 2020 this quarter relative to last quarter? I'm just trying to understand if it's increased into what degree. And then my second quarter -- second question is, assuming industry forecasts are correct, next year. I'm just, if you can walk us through whether -- is there anything we should consider with regards to decrementals relative to previous cycles in the sense that one, I would assume the parts business obviously helps your, your margins. You have the content on the MX engine. At the same time, one could argue you're more vertically integrated in R&D, cost should be structurally higher. So if there is anything you could help us out with and then one, is the -- are the -- should decrementals be meaningfully different in Europe versus the U.S.? Thanks. -- Sure, there is a lot of questions in there. I'll make sure if I can get them right for you. From a 2020 order intake. I think that we're seeing, as I said earlier, a higher percentage than we do typically. We have great visibility that means comparatively to normal times for 2020, a decline to kind of really talk about a specific value there. But it feels positive compared to previous years. From a effect of what 2020's overall market is going to be, I think as Harrie said and we would all say, it's a little bit early to be talking about what the full market size is going to be in 2020 and from an effect on detrimental margin or margins or incremental margins as they may end up being, I'd say that we see that -- we keep our operating costs really low and I think that means there's relatively minor shifts in the decremental or incremental margins and continue to provide great value to our -- to the margin -- then the overall margin stays high. -- Okay. But no, no meaningful difference relative to previous downturns. I mean, is there any structural reason why decrementals would be better or just. I mean, if you're right on the top line in incrementals that's a different question but are decrementals... -- No I don't think so. No meaningful shift. -- Okay, thank you. -- You bet.Our next question comes from Courtney Yakavonis with Morgan Stanley, your line is now open. -- Hi, thanks. Thanks for the question. Just going back to Andy's question on your production this quarter, I think you had originally forecasted that all the increase would be from North America, kind of looks like it was pretty evenly split between North America and other. So was your North America production in line with your expectations and we discussed Europe, kind of that one -- but just wanted to confirm that. -- Yeah, our North American production was in line with expectations. I think the only place where there was any slight -- slight change was in Europe, where we just made sure, we got our build rates adjusted to the market, so that's the overall effect. -- Okay, got you. And then just on the CapEx raise, just wanted to make sure, is this similar to last quarter, where it's a lot of projects getting done faster, or moving more quickly than expected or are there any new projects that we should be thinking about ? -- Sure we -- it's really fun. I mean, we're making these great investments in the future for the Company and so that's why you're seeing the CapEx changes, but we have just some fantastic opportunities that are really in terms of our capacity and quality in our factories. Our distribution centers for parts and used trucks and then maybe most importantly for the long-term benefit is the investments in new products that we're creating and so we just have a lot of programs going on and they are successfully moving along and we think, it's really building a bright future for us. -- Okay, got you. And then just finally in South America , I think you slightly reduced your industry guidance. They are -- just wanted to confirm that and maybe how it compares, I think last quarter, you had guided to Brasil at 65,000 to 75,000, just want to understand those dynamics of play there. -- I think, the guidance for Brasil is the same as what we did last time , I think, for total South America, the range might have dropped 5,000 [Phonetic] so from a -- I think we are nowat... -- 100,000 to 110,000 for South America in total. -- Yeah. But it's outside Brasil. -- Brasil is still guiding at 70,000 as a midpoint, 65,000 to 75,000. South America at 100,000 to 110,000. -- Perfect, great, thank you. -- You bet.Our next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Loop Capital Markets, your line is now open. -- Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. -- Hey, good morning. -- Thank you. A lot of my questions have been answered at this point, just a couple of nits. You mentioned that you are seeing orders for 2020 at this point. Yet we do know there are some aspects of the trucking market see in pain, particularly on the pricing side, to your point not so much the volumes. Have you seen any change on the specs that customers are asking for 2020 versus 2019? -- No, it's a nice question. But I think that really the customers are always looking for the most fuel-efficient, lowest operating cost trucks that they can find. And that's the beauty about being PACCAR as we provide that to our customers. We have these passionate team of people, do a great job of making sure that the trucks we develop and sell, are really at the best and most efficient vehicles for our customers. And so I think that's what they're always looking at, we're always talking to the customers about to make sure the spec stayed lined up that way but there hasn't been any fundamental shift. -- Okay and then just one last nit. I did notice the tax rate was up a little bit sequentially from the first quarter, that could be just randomness. But I'm wondering, might that have to do with maybe more profitability being driven out of North America. What should I be thinking in terms of tax rate for the full year? -- Yeah, I think you hit it on the head there. It's a income mix of North America tax rates including states are a little bit higher than Europe and so that affected the quarter. -- Okay, all right, that's all I have. All the questions have been asked already, congratulations and thank you. -- Great, thank you. Right. -- Thanks a lot.Our next question comes from Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research. Your line is now open. -- Hi, with the North America build rate going up in 3Q, I think historically, it's not uncommon to then see it come down in 4Q, but that's usually with Europe going up and so I'm just curious with some of what's going on in Europe right now. Should we expect that -- that your current plans at this point or that -- that increase in the build rate in North America for 3Q is something that that you would maintain in 4Q? -- Yeah, we have a strong backlog. As we said is substantially full for the second half and so we don't see any reason not to think the build rate stays roughly where it is for the fourth quarter in the U.S. and Canada. -- But you're right that the fourth quarter in the U.S. and Canada will have more holidays than the third quarter, and Europe is just the opposite. Yeah. -- So daily build rates, it doesn't change necessarily -- but overall... -- Yes. Just a question on the daily build rate so. And then from your comments around months of inventory -- industry at 2.8 months, you are at 2.3, I think historically the industry average is in the low 2 [Phonetic]. So I'm just curious, historically, where you average as we think about sort of through cycle targets. -- This is within our normal band and it's kind of a healthy space to be. -- Perfect and then just one on the 2020 orders you're taking, how does that pricing compared to 2019? -- That just depends on the customer but the pricing is fairly consistent right now. -- Got it. Thanks very much. -- You bet.Our next question comes from Neil Frohnapple with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open. -- Hi, good morning. -- Hi, good morning. -- Is inventory at your used truck centers starting to rise at all and any thoughts on the used truck market in North America and Europe, both from a demand and pricing standpoint? -- Yeah, I think if you look at the used trucks, maybe the pricing has moderated a bit from where it was in Q1 but one of the nice things about being part of PACCAR is our trucks do command a 10% to 15% premium in the market and as we've watched our market share grow over the past several years, we've invested in creating a great used truck capability -- selling capability. So that's why we've got this new facility -- used truck facility we're building in Denton, Texas. A few years ago, we did one in Los Angeles. In Europe, we're creating one in Prague in the Czech Republic as well, and then adding on capacity, we have a fantastic dealer network that does a good job of managing used trucks and distributing used trucks to customers. So between our premium position and our capability, we feel like we're in a good space. -- Okay. And as a follow-up on that if used truck prices were to continue to moderate, what's the the time lag as far as when that will start impacting the FinCo profitability, I think, it usually runs through that interest in other line, is that a couple of quarter lag or any thoughts there? -- Yeah, I don't think we kind of recalibrated into which quarter it would have an impact on and obviously would depend on the amount of effect and it depends a lot on the percent of retail versus wholesale and our team is doing a really good job of selling a lot of used trucks in a retail position. So there's too many mix effects in there to really characterize it. -- Okay and then just one final one on the medium-duty market here in North America, any notable changes to the outlook we are seeing from customers, market share etc. Thank you. -- Yeah, sure. Thanks for the questions. Now, the market size seems consistent to what we've said previously, and 100,000 units plus or minus and then the business is doing really well. I think that our trucks are performing well in space and our market share will be roughly in the same range. -- Great, thanks so much. -- You bet.[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Robert Wertheimer with Melius. Your line is now open. -- Thank you and good morning, everybody. -- Good morning. -- My question is pretty simple. I wonder if you could just remind us of the mechanics on orders for next year. Is the order book open for all models and configuration and then is pricing established or people sort of just taken a bet on it and is that the same as every year, this year? -- So I would say that the order book is open for all trucks and all models and we love taking orders for trucks, it's something we enjoy a lot. And when I think about it in terms of the pricing being established, in the deals that we're discussing right now, those end up being with the customers and they end up being focused around what we've done previously and what their spec is and what we're doing. So those end up being worked through in almost individually. -- Okay, perfect, that's it, thanks. -- You bet.Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. -- Hey, good morning, guys. It's Rob on for Scott. -- Good morning, Rob. -- A quick clarification question with regard to the build rate, am I hearing you right that you guys are basically planning on maintaining the third quarter level of production in the fourth quarter or is there some increase you're implying there in the back half guidance? -- I think the firm space is the third quarter going up and then we watch with the fourth quarter as we substantially are full. We'll watch what the fourth quarter does, but I don't expect to see any significant shifts. -- That's helpful. In your preliminary comments about the order book and the strength looking out to next year, where you guys intimating that we could see revenue actually be up next year? -- I don't think, we intimated next year. -- Okay. And then a -- just a couple of quick questions with regard to the used truck market. You said, you saw it soften up a little bit, could you describe it if you're seeing that in one specific channel i.e. kind of small fleets or kind of the owner operator end of the marketplace and what sort of increase on a year-over-year basis, you're seeing from a price realization currently would be helpful as well. -- I think it's, we think about it in terms of the PACCAR products Kenworth and Peterbilt, North America DAF and where just they command a premium. So it's a relative positioning to the competition they are doing really well. And then I think from a -- as I said earlier, I think a lot of effect has to do with how many trucks are coming back in and what percent you retail those trucks at and we've been able to grow our retail percentage, especially in North America, which has brought us good results. So as far as the overall trends of the market. I think, those vagaries are difficult to plan forward too. But we'll watch them. We have a great team that's managing that business really well. -- That's helpful. Final one, which I guess kind of relates to the FinCo, is we saw a slight uptick in the provision for losses on receivables, obviously still at a low level, and that was a sequential uptick still nicely improved on a year-over-year basis. What's driving that, is that just some of the small carriers, you're seeing a little bit of softening in terms of their -- their receivables or is this ? -- Most of that is due to the larger portfolio. But past due remain -- past dues remain really low, credit losses remain low. The portfolio is managed really well. So we've got lot of good customers that make money with their trucks and pay their bills on time. -- Really helpful. I appreciate the time, guys. -- Yeah, you bet. Have a good day.Our next question comes from David Raso with Evercore. Your line is now open. -- Thank you. Quick question. North America, I know you slice at U.S., Canada, how you give deliveries. But in your commentary about your backlog. Can you just help us a bit with your U.S., Canada or you want to define it as North America. Your backlog year-over-year as we sit today. Just some sense of the year-over-year in that position? -- Well it's up substantially year-over-year from a normal cycle. Obviously, that's moderated from what happened in 2018's, 358,000 truck order intake or 458,000 truck order intake. So it's, if you look at it on a pure sequential year-over-year. It's probably down, but it's down from a level that was not sustainable. So high and so compared to normal levels, it's still very high and very strong -- 73,000 trucks in a backlog and doing really well. -- Yeah, I mean, look. I mean, clearly the industry is down, I mean the data we most all use, it's down about 17% year-over-year. I'm just trying to get a feel is your backlog down less than the industry [Speech Overlap]. -- Well I think, the best way to think about that David, is to think about that percentage of backlog that Harrie talked about earlier, the 36% of the industry backlog, which is, you know, if you call us a 30% market share and 36% of industry backlog, means we have very healthy backlog relative to our market share. -- Yeah, if we were just trying to figure out how much of that goes into 2020. How much is helping the fourth quarter? If the fourth quarter builds. Just have the normal seasonal less build days but the daily rate stays the same, I would argue that's probably a little better than people are thinking.

The earnings of stocks like truck makers \u00a0are highly volatile as they depend on the cyclicality of truck sales and production, and short-term investors will constantly fret about the near-term trends in truck sales data. A long-term investor, however, will understand the cyclicality and focus on the underlying development of the business. Let's take a look at what you need to know from both perspectives before deciding to buy PACCAR stock.As you can see in the following chart, U.S. heavy-truck sales are highly cyclical and so investing in the industry can be very tricky. Furthermore, in , it often happens that valuations are at the highest when truck sales are bottoming and at their lowest just as truck sales are peaking.\u00a0The trucking industry is highly cyclical. Image source: Getty Images.This is because investors are pricing in the dramatic improvement in earnings when the cycle turns upwards (they bid up the stock in anticipation) and sell off the stock when earnings are about to decline in line with falling truck sales. Truck engine maker a supplier to PACCAR and\u00a0is included in order to demonstrate industry fundamentals\u00a0. Data by .In this sense, it becomes very important to play a kind of guessing game over when truck sales hit a peak or a trough and every subtle adjustment in guidance is followed. Thus, the fact that all three trucking companies above have raised their forecast for industry sales and production through 2019 is a large part of the reason why the stocks are up around 22% (Cummins and PACCAR) and 32% (Navistar) so far this year.Class 8 trucks are defined by the Department of Transport as heavy duty single-trailer trucks with three or four axles.\u00a0Data source: Company presentations. That said, a peak will surely come and most investors have focused on the outlook for industrial production in the U.S. and internationally. With most market commentators expecting U.S. economic growth and industrial production growth to slow in the next couple of years, it's likely that truck sales/production will fall at some point. As we've seen above, short-term investors might want to anticipate the peak and then bail out, and that's their prerogative, but what about the long view over a stock like PACCAR?One way to do this would be to normalize PACCAR's growth rate on its long-term trend line -- this helps to avoid pricing the stock in during the peak or trough periods of sales, after which you might apply the average margin during the last cycle in order to calculate what the underlying trend-line sales and earnings actually are.. Data by .Based on previous calculations, the long-term revenue growth rate is 3.3% per annum -- this looks reasonable when compared with nominal US GDP growth in the last decade. Projecting forward and using the last trough in 2013 as a base means that trend line sales for PACCAR in 2019 are around $20.8 billion -- compare this with the market forecast for $23.6 billion and remember that we are not using this figure as it probably represents a peak.Applying the 11% earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin to the $20.8 billion figure gives a trend-line EBIT of $2.29 billion. With the current enterprise value (market cap plus net debt) at around $30.5 billion, it implies a theoretical EV/EBIT multiple of around 13.3 times.Putting all this together, the theoretical EV/EBIT multiple of 13.3 times -- recall that is an attempt to normalize its earnings across the cycle -- implies that PACCAR is a good value. The way to think about the 13.3 times multiple is that it's the valuation with the cyclical highs and lows stripped out of it. In other words, it's comparable to what a consumer staple or a defensive healthcare stock -- whose earnings are far less cyclical -- might trade at.\u00a0Given that some of those companies trade at high teens EV/EBIT multiples right now then PACCAR looks good value for investors who want to take a long-view and also believe in the future of the trucking industry.\u00a0When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(Symbol: PCAR) saw new options begin trading this week, for the February 2020 expiration.  One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 240 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.   At , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the PCAR options chain for the new February 2020 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $70.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.90.  If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $70.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $65.10 (before broker commissions).  To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of PCAR, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $71.57/share today.\n\nBecause the $70.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%.  Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the .  Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.00% return on the cash commitment, or 10.64% annualized \u2014 at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost.\n\n\nBelow is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for PACCAR Inc., and highlighting in green where the $70.00 strike is located relative to that history:\n\n\n   Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $72.50 strike price has a current bid of $5.30.  If an investor was to purchase shares of PCAR stock at the current price level of $71.57/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $72.50.  Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 8.70% if the stock gets called away at the February 2020 expiration (before broker commissions).  Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if PCAR shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for PACCAR Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important.   Below is a chart showing PCAR's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $72.50 strike highlighted in red:\n\n\n\n   \nConsidering the fact that the $72.50 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.  The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 49%.  On our website under the , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

Total segment profit climbed 21% to $716.1 million.Management noted that the Class 8 (the largest truck class by weight) market in the U.S. and Canada grew by 23% in the first quarter, indicating strong economic conditions and sustained demand.The company's DAF nameplate trucks continued to boost share in the 16-ton-plus market, capturing 17.1% market share in Europe, a sequential gain of 0.5% over the fourth quarter of 2018.The Brazilian 16-ton-plus market is expected to rebound by 30% in 2019, with vehicle deliveries estimated at 65,000-75,000 against 53,000 deliveries in 2018. PACCAR aims to benefit from this expansion by gaining new market share; the company is also building a new 160,000-square-foot parts distribution center in Ponta Grossa, Brazil, which it expects to complete in 2020.Parts revenue set a quarterly record of $1 billion in sales. The PACCAR parts business (which reports within the truck, parts, and other revenue segment) also achieved record quarterly pre-tax profits of $207.6 million. Sales and profits jumped 7% and 8% against the prior-year quarter, respectively.PACCAR Financial Services (PFS), the company's financing and truck leasing arm, notched a 24% increase in pre-tax profits, to $84 million.

After celebrating a year of record annual revenue and net income, can PACCAR continue to post heady results? Let's review key numbers and themes that investors should watch in the upcoming report to gauge the company's successAs is customary, shareholders should first review results against management's guidance for the quarter. PACCAR doesn't provide a detailed financial outlook, choosing instead to forecast a handful of benchmark numbers each quarter that are indicative of the company's overall health.During the company's fourth-quarter 2018  , CEO Ron Armstrong advised investors to expect truck deliveries to increase by 15% over the prior-year quarter's total of 44,500. This target, if met, will equal roughly 51,200 deliveries, for a sequential improvement of 1.5% against the fourth quarter of 2018.In addition, Armstrong forecast that PACCAR's  would advance sequentially from 14.2% in Q4 2018 to 14.5% in the first quarter of 2019. This will represent a slight year-over-year drop from the 14.8% gross margin achieved in the first quarter of 2018.Management also expects part sales to exceed the prior-year period's sales of $940 million by roughly 5%-8%.In 2018, PACCAR's pre-tax income surged 29% year over year, to $2.2 billion. This improvement was due largely to PACCAR's ability to ship a record number of trucks and parts with relative production ease.Image source: Getty Images.Continued efficient throughput will sustain PACCAR's profitability as it takes new orders and works off a record $14.7 billion backlog. The company is actively investing in additional capacity in its parts business by expanding its parts production prowess in Las Vegas and Brazil.PACCAR is expanding its truck-manufacturing capacity with new investments in machining equipment to produce the successful PACCAR MX engine. Current-year capital expenditures will also include additional square footage at plants worldwide and a new truck-painting facility in Chillicothe, Ohio.Expect management to discuss production-capacity investments on the company's upcoming  , in order to keep investors satisfied that PACCAR can keep up with surging orders without impairing margins in 2019.Part of PACCAR's recent success is due to its ability to offer Kenworth, Peterbilt, and DAF truck dealers and their customers financing on vehicles. The financing business is highly lucrative for PACCAR: Last quarter, the company generated $87 million in profit on $347 million in revenue, which equates to segment operating profit of 25%. The $87 million segment bottom line also represented a 21% increase in profit over the fourth quarter of 2017.Growth in this segment enables PACCAR to sell more vehicles, but the company has been careful to maintain a fairly solid balance sheet in enabling this relationship. At the end of last quarter, the financial-services segment held $14.4 billion of owned and leased assets against $11.2 billion in debt.Shareholders should watch for continued profitability in this segment, as it's both an important component of the company's bottom line and an indicator of the relative health of total truck sales.Over the last few quarters, PACCAR has enjoyed robust demand from tight capacity in the truck freight market, which has caused transportation companies and 3PL (third-party logistics) firms to add to their fleets.However,  in my earnings preview of 3PL carrier  , long-distance truck shipment rates fell in February by 1%, a significant one-month drop, and the second decrease in as many quarters. This freight pricing trend reversal is significant because it may confirm what some industry watchers suspect -- that a two-year trend of scarce capacity may be waning.If the freight industry has indeed begun to normalize its supply of available heavy trucks, this will have an impact on truck manufacturers like PACCAR at some point in 2019. Of course, it's doubtful that PACCAR will feel any immediate impact, given its current robust order book and massive backlog.Nonetheless, it will be interesting to see if management continues to exhibit as optimistic a view of the industry as it has over the past few quarters. For the first time in a while, investors could possibly hear a few notes of caution over PACCAR's future order flow this quarter.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Let's review key numbers and themes that investors should watch in the upcoming report to gauge the company's successAs is customary, shareholders should first review results against management's guidance for the quarter. PACCAR doesn't provide a detailed financial outlook, choosing instead to forecast a handful of benchmark numbers each quarter that are indicative of the company's overall health.During the company's fourth-quarter 2018 , CEO Ron Armstrong advised investors to expect truck deliveries to increase by 15% over the prior-year quarter's total of 44,500. This target, if met, will equal roughly 51,200 deliveries, for a sequential improvement of 1.5% against the fourth quarter of 2018.\u00a0In addition, Armstrong forecast that PACCAR's  would advance sequentially from 14.2% in Q4 2018 to 14.5% in the first quarter of 2019. This will represent a slight year-over-year drop from the 14.8% gross margin achieved in the first quarter of 2018.Management also expects part sales to exceed the prior-year period's sales of $940 million by roughly 5%-8%.In 2018, PACCAR's pre-tax income surged 29% year over year, to $2.2 billion. This improvement was due largely to PACCAR's ability to ship a record number of trucks and parts with relative production ease.Image source: Getty Images.Continued efficient throughput will sustain PACCAR's profitability as it takes new orders and works off a record $14.7 billion backlog. The company is actively investing in additional capacity in its parts business by expanding its parts production prowess in Las Vegas and Brazil.PACCAR is expanding its truck-manufacturing capacity with new investments in machining equipment to produce the successful PACCAR MX engine. Current-year capital expenditures will also include additional square footage at plants worldwide and a new truck-painting facility in\u00a0Chillicothe, Ohio.Expect management to discuss production-capacity investments on the company's upcoming , in order to keep investors satisfied that PACCAR can keep up with surging orders without impairing margins in 2019.Part of PACCAR's recent success is due to its ability to offer Kenworth, Peterbilt, and DAF truck dealers and their customers financing on vehicles. The financing business is highly lucrative for PACCAR: Last quarter, the company generated $87 million in profit on $347 million in revenue, which equates to segment operating profit of 25%. The $87 million segment bottom line also represented a 21% increase in profit over the fourth quarter of 2017.Growth in this segment enables PACCAR to sell more vehicles, but the company has been careful to maintain a fairly solid balance sheet in enabling this relationship. At the end of last quarter, the financial-services segment held $14.4 billion of owned and leased assets against $11.2 billion in debt.\u00a0Shareholders should watch for continued profitability in this segment, as it's both an important component of the company's bottom line and an indicator of the relative health of total truck sales.Over the last few quarters, PACCAR has enjoyed robust demand from tight capacity in the truck freight market, which has caused transportation companies and 3PL (third-party logistics) firms to add to their fleets.\u00a0However,  in my earnings preview of 3PL carrier , long-distance truck shipment rates fell in February by 1%, a significant one-month drop, and the second decrease in as many quarters. This freight pricing trend reversal is significant because it may confirm what some industry watchers suspect -- that a two-year trend of scarce capacity may be waning.If the freight industry has indeed begun to normalize its supply of available heavy trucks, this will have an impact on truck manufacturers like PACCAR at some point in 2019. Of course, it's doubtful that PACCAR will feel any immediate impact, given its current robust order book and massive backlog.Nonetheless, it will be interesting to see if management continues to exhibit as optimistic a view of the industry as it has over the past few quarters. For the first time in a while, investors could possibly hear a few notes of caution over PACCAR's future order flow this quarter.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

With a strategy to cut costs and improve market share in not so profitable markets, Ford is partnering with Volkswagen AG for commercial vans and pickups, and explore electric and autonomous technological developments.Apart from technical developments for gasoline vehicles, the company is working on autonomous and electric cars. For self-driving vehicles, Ford will invest $4 billion by 2023. It expects to commercially deploy the autonomous vehicle business by 2021. Further, it plans to launch 40 electric vehicles by 2022, which will consist of 16 fully-electric vehicles and the rest will be plug-in hybrids. | Rising demand for spacious and comfortable SUVs, trucks, and vans increased Ford's SUV and trucks sales. In 2018, its major sales driver was the F-Series truck range, which achieved the set target of selling 1 million vehicles globally. Among the new launches that partly contributed to the company's growth in the market were Expedition, Edge and Navigator. Robust F-series sales along with favorable product mix and market factors aided the automaker's North America operations to generate an EBIT of $2 billion in fourth-quarter 2018.However, soaring commodity prices and currency fluctuations hampered Ford's performance in fourth-quarter 2018. Further, softening demand in China and declining market share in Europe affected performance in 2018. In fourth-quarter 2018, the company generated automotive revenues of $38.7 billion while adjusted earnings per share were 30 cents. The figures missed their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.Further, frequent vehicle recall due to safety issues is another concern for Ford. Recalls not only elevate the company's expenses but also reduce consumers' confidence in a brand. Last month, it issued a recall for roughly 1.5 million Ford and Lincoln vehicles, owing to flawed downshift to first gear. In January 2019, it issued two recalls for roughly 1 million vehicles worldwide.Over the past three months, shares of Ford have outperformed the  it belongs to.

All lines will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded and if anyone has an objection, they should disconnect at this time.I would now like to introduce Mr. Ken Hastings, PACCAR's, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Hastings, please go ahead. -- Good morning. We would like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name is Ken Hastings, PACCAR's Director of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Ron Armstrong, Chief Executive Officer; Preston Feight, Executive Vice President; Harrie Schippers, President and Chief Financial Officer; and Michael Barkley, Senior Vice President and Controller.As with prior conference calls, we ask that any members of the media on the line participate in a listen-only mode. Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including general, economic and competitive conditions that may affect expected results. A summary of risks and uncertainties is described in more detail in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. For additional information, please see our SEC filings and the Investor Relations page of paccar.com.I would now like to introduce Ron Armstrong. -- Good morning. Preston Feight, Harrie Schippers and I will update you on PACCAR's excellent first quarter results and business highlights. PACCAR reported record revenues and net income for the first quarter of 2019. PACCAR's first quarter sales and financial services revenues were $6.5 billion and first quarter net income was $629 million, an excellent 9.7% after-tax return on revenues.Revenues were 15% higher and net income was 23% higher compared to the first quarter last year. PACCAR delivered a record 51,500 trucks during the first quarter. PACCAR Parts achieved record quarterly revenues of $1 billion, an increase of 7% compared to the first quarter last year. Parts pre-tax profits were also a record of $208 million. I'm very proud of our 28,000 employees, who are passionate about delivering the industry's best products and services to our customers and achieving strong results for our shareholders. PACCAR continues to outperform its peers and provide strong operating cash flow for reinvestment in future growth and distributions to stockholders.One key measure where PACCAR sales return on invested capital. In the first quarter, PACCAR achieved a return on invested capital of 25%. And over the last five years, achieved an annual average return of 22%. PACCAR's delivered annual dividends of approximately 50% of net income for many years and has paid a dividend every year since 1941. PACCAR has increased its quarterly dividend, an average of 11% per year during the last 20 years and raised another 14% in the first quarter to $0.32 per share. PACCAR repurchased 491,000 of its outstanding shares during the first quarter. The increase in truck production in the first quarter was primarily due to more build days in North America compared to the fourth quarter and good supplier performance.Truck and parts gross margins were 15% in the first quarter. Truck pricing was good with price realization of 3%. Our Peterbilt, Kenworth and DAF factories, and purchasing and supplier management teams did a fantastic job of managing production, delivering a record number of trucks, and achieving the highest operating margins in the industry. In the second quarter, we're expecting deliveries to be 2% to 4% higher than the first quarter, due to increased production in North America. Truck, Parts and Other gross margins in the second quarter are estimated to be in a range of 14.5% to 15%.Preston Feight, will now provide an update on DAF and PACCAR parts. -- Thanks, Ron. DAF achieved record market share of 17.1% in the first quarter. European economies and freight transport activity are projected to grow at a moderate pace in 2019. This year should be another good year in the European heavy truck market with registrations in a range of 290,000 to 320,000 trucks.Turning to PACCAR Parts global results. Parts first quarter revenues were a record and for the first time reached the $1 billion level. As Ron mentioned, Parts quarterly pre-tax profit was a record $208 million. PACCAR has steadily increased its truck and engine market share over the years, resulting in a greater number of PACCAR trucks and engines in operation. This combined with consistent investments in parts distribution capacity and customer-focused technologies has created a very strong foundation for growth in PACCAR Parts. To support this growth, PACCAR Parts has begun construction of two new parts distribution centers. One at Ponta Grossa, Brazil and the other one is in Las Vegas, Nevada. We expect part sales to grow 5% to 8% for the full year 2019.Harrie Schippers will now provide an update on Kenworth, Peterbilt and PACCAR Financial Services. -- Thanks, Preston. The U.S. economy and freight tonnage continue to grow this year. A consensus of economists predicts 2.2% (ph) GDP and 2.6% industrial production growth for the full year 2019. First quarter GDP growth was a strong 3.2%. Freight tonnage increased 3.8% in the first quarter compared to a year earlier. This provides a healthy backdrop for the 2019 truck market. First quarter 2019, U.S. and Canada Class 8 truck industry retail sales increased 23% compared to the same period last year.We have increased the midpoint of the U.S. and Canada Class 8 truck market projection to over 300,000 units due to the strong industry backlog. PACCAR Financial Services pre-tax income was $84 million in the first quarter, an increase of 24% compared to a year earlier. First quarter revenues were $350 million. PACCAR Financial Services assets increased to a record $14.9 billion, with the portfolio performing well. Kenworth and Peterbilt Class 8 used truck values increased again in the first quarter compared to the same period last year.Kenworth and Peterbilt truck resale values commanded 10% to 20% premium over competitor's vehicles. In 2019, we are increasing capital investments to $625 million to $675 million and R&D expenses to $320 million to $340 million. We're investing in new products and expand its facilities, while increasing our funding for alternative powertrain development.As we mentioned in the press release, DAF has recently introduced electric and hybrid vehicles that are undergoing field testing throughout Europe. Peterbilt and Kenworth have also working on hydrogen fuel cell, hybrid and electric power trains, as well as autonomous vehicle technology, in collaboration with our Silicon Valley Innovation Center.Thank you. We'd be pleased to answer your questions.(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. -- Yes. Hi, good morning, everyone. -- Good morning, Jerry. -- I wondering if you could talk about what booking trends you're seeing in your European business? How long are the lead times? Nice to hear about the share gain opportunity set. Maybe just flush that out in terms of where book-to-bill is -- has tracked year-to-date and any more color there would be helpful. -- Yeah, the backlog is -- I'd say normal, in terms of visibility that we have for our factory operations. And as we saw in the first quarter, registrations in the European market were up over last year and you'll just continue to see a good market for this year and for the full year as our forecast indicates. -- And so your orders then are up year-over-year to support the comment about share gains of the markets at healthy levels and you folks are picking up share that's in the order book, Ron? -- Yeah, the actual order intake is down a bit over last year was a very strong first quarter. So, order intake is down similar to levels we've seen with our other European competitors. -- Okay. And then in the U.S. business, can you talk about whether you've seen any shifts in the production request from your customers? Are you seeing any folks looking to get earlier in the queue or later in the queue, relative to the production plan. I guess how fluid is the backlog situation in North America and how firm is the production plan for the third quarter as you see it? -- I think it's all very firm. So, I think all the movement of trucks in and out is just very normal and the backlog is very firm. -- Okay. And then from an SG&A standpoint, you folks were able to keep SG&A flat and really strong sales growth, I'm wondering is there any comp dynamic going on in the year ago period? Or if -- you folks as you continue to raise production year-over-year can maintain flat SG&A? Any moving pieces for us to think about? -- Well, as you know, Jerry, rigorous cost management is something that we're very focused on in managing that over the cycle. There was some benefit in the quarter from some currency movement. But for the most part, it's just our ongoing focus on managing our cost for the entire cycle. -- Okay. Strong performance. Thank you. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss with BMO. Your line is now open. -- How is it going guys? -- Good, Joel. You? -- Hanging in there. So I keep here and you guys are gaining market share in the Parts and some of your dealers are gaining market share in Parts. And I just wonder if you can kind of illuminate for us a little bit. You know who is losing share or is there just such a big opportunity out there for everybody that there is a lot more room to keep going? -- I think a lot of that share gain comes from our engines. We've been in the engine business in North America, this is our ninth year. And so, the -- as a percent of the total population of engines, the PACCAR MX engine is just becoming a bigger portion. And so, that engine business is a nice add-on. Plus, we now have a 175 or so TRP Stores around the globe. And so, that enables the Parts group to get more penetration with all mix customers, trailers, buses, et cetera. So I think those are probably the two key drivers of share -- share growth in the Parts arena. -- So, the more the pirates I guess, we are losing out? -- Excuse me? -- The pirates like the third-party, like non-OEM guys are the ones who are losing out? -- On the TRP side, that would -- it could be the WDs, it could be other OEs, I don't know. -- Okay. And also can you talk a little bit about what you guys have been working on for the last couple years to handle? We've been hearing about a potential slowdown in fourth quarter production levels. And can you just give us a little sense of how you guys can work your detrimental margins in your cost structure to balance that out? -- Yeah, I mean we're full ahead on our production. We're going to put -- continue to produce trucks as I said the backlog is firm, the demand we're quoting business into 2020. So full ahead for us and where we've because we -- as we mentioned earlier we manage that cost structure prudently during all times -- all phases of the cycle. We've proven historically that we can manage our cost structure quite efficiently, and this will be no exception. We'll be able to, to manage that quite effectively with our factories and with our other operations. -- Thanks. And just one last one, sorry to hog up all the time. Can you talk a little bit about Brazil, I see you highlighted that and where your market share is and what the market looks like for the next year or two there. Thank you. And then, I'm done. -- Yeah. So we are at 6.7% share last year similar in the first quarter. We are continuing to increase our production. We produced over 1,000 trucks in the first quarter. In 2018, we basically doubled production from the prior year and will be in a similar kind of scale this year for 2019. So we -- the product has just been very well received by all of our customers and the industry as a whole. And we've been recognized as the brand of the year for the last three years.So, we have great dealership representatives. We've got a good, good network to support the trucks and so we're continuing to improve our positioning there and we're also expanding our parts and service presence. So we're going to add a 160,000 square foot PDC that will be opening probably in the early first half of 2020. We've been using part of our truck factory as a Parts warehouse, so we need to grow that and support that. So the future is very bright for our Brazilian operations. -- That's awesome. Thank you. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. -- Hi, good morning. A quick question, the second quarter you have deliveries, up 4% but you're implying gross margins flat to down. Can you help explain that? -- Yeah, so the truck margins are in the 12%, 12.5% range, first quarter the truck margins were 12.5%. So a lot of the incremental revenue will come from the truck side and so that's -- that waiting affect of trucks versus parts will sort of keep us in a similar range as to the first quarter. -- Okay. Thank you. And then also I noticed the CapEx increase, but you hold the R&D are actually even tweeted a little lower. And I'm just trying to say -- this might be a question more for the meeting coming up in May, but just trying to understand, with all the new Drivetrain technology and so forth. And for a long time people voice wondered how the R&D as a percent of sales is so low for PACCAR. Can you help explain, is there some capitalization of some of these dollars that maybe some people might think would be expenses, R&D, can you just help us a little bit with the divergence between the CapEx increase and the R&D? -- Yeah, the CapEx -- CapEx increase is purely just as we have gotten into the year. The ability of our teams to move things forward has gone quicker than what we anticipated. Our plans are still pretty much the same, but we're actually going to be able to get things done quicker than what we had originally anticipated. So that's the capital increase, the R&D is just part of how we prudently manage our product development efforts and have for years. We're probably going to spend a record amount of R&D for our company this year but it's well thought out, well positioned and we feel good about, we're doing everything we need to do, to support the future needs for greenhouse gas changes, future products and also the advanced powertrain arena.So, I think we feel really good about what we're doing and the things that we're investing in both on the capital and R&D side. -- Well, I was, I think this is an important issue because people are trying to figure out the cost pressures on the company, with potentially some volume declines coming in the next year or two. So the divergence of, we were able to pull things forward, and thus the CapEx goes up but not the R&D. Can you help us understand the R&D a little better (multiple speakers) no, no but the change. The change from the start of the year that caused the CapEx to go up, hasn't had a commensurate increase in the R&D. -- Yeah, because the plans in the projects that we're working on hasn't changed, it's just the pace at which those capital projects are being executed and the ability to get those done quicker than what we had originally anticipated. So there was no change in the projects, it's just, it's just recognition of the timing of incurring those capital-related costs. -- I guess we can dive into this more in the May meeting. But I think the idea is sure, if there's CapEx related cost for the new introductions, the R&D as stated are relatively low level. And I think the ability to continue to do that the next couple of years or lack thereof is a big discussion around the earnings resiliency. So I look forward to go into a little more detail, in May. -- Sure. -- Thank you very much. Appreciate it. -- Okay. Thanks David.Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is now open. -- Thanks. Good morning. -- Good morning. -- Good morning. Harrie mentioned that used truck values are up year-over-year. I'm curious on used truck inventories. How does the levels in Q1 compared to Q4 2018 both on your own lots and on dealer lots and what you're expecting for the used truck market later this year as trade-ins likely coming in? -- Well, used truck inventories are I think almost the same level as they were at the end of last year. Demand for used trucks and especially in North America has been really good, we see good pricing, good demand for premium trucks. -- And we're continuing to fill out our used truck locations. We're going to be adding a new location on the property where our (inaudible) factory is located to further supplement our ability to sell used trucks, where the biggest used truck seller for Peterbilt and Kenworth vehicles and we continue to support those excellent residual values. -- Okay, and then I know you guys generally frame oil and gas as being really only a very modest contributor to earnings, but curious just on order trends in oil and gas for trucks, and how the capacity expansion of pipeline later this year might affect some of the market assumptions you might have? -- Yeah, if there are is pipeline capacity expansion and more importantly if there is infrastructure program that gets -- that gets approved that will be where the vocational truck leader in North America in both, both of those things would be big pluses for our business. But as we said the backlog for this year is very firm. -- Okay, great. Thanks very much. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. -- Hi, good morning. I know you're talking about price --. Good morning. Our price realization in the quarter of 3%. I think you said, which was pretty good. Can you just, was that better than your expectations and sort of what are your assumptions for the remainder of the year? And then my second question, understanding you have very good visibility into 2019, just based on the conversations you're having with your customers, what are they saying about 2020 is it in line with industry forecasts? And then I guess last, congratulations, Ron and Preston, any initial views on as you take over any top priorities? Thank you. -- Hello, Preston go first or I will start with the back then. -- I think the PACCAR has been performing exceptionally well. We have a long history. We're great team in place, bringing great results and good strategy and we plan to continue with that. -- So back on the truck pricing, I think on a year-over-year basis, I think we'll see similar comparison when you look back to the same quarter of the prior year. Similar performance, that offset some increases in costs. But, well, I think we'll see similar performance of what we saw in the first quarter. -- And then just color on what are your customers are saying about 2020 relative to industry forecasts are saying? -- Well, I mean we're having negotiations with customers on an ongoing basis about 2020 delivery. So, I think there is still recognition that the economy is good, the demand for freight is good, discussions with customers, people that need all freight, it's -- there still a pretty tight market to be able to get things delivered on a timely basis. So, we're preparing for a continuation of the good market conditions into 2020. -- And with all the improvements in greenhouse gas emissions, our customers keep seeing that the trucks we're building today deliver up to 15% better fuel economy than the trucks they booked four years ago, and that really helps them when they have to decide and replacing their equipment. -- Okay. Thank you. I'll get back in queue. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research. Your line is now open. -- Hi, good morning. You continue to post share gains in Europe this quarter. Can you just give a little bit of detail within the region where you're seeing some of that progress? And then, if there is any mix effect in that as well, are you seeing a little bit better traction with some of the larger fleets in Europe? -- Yeah, I'll take that one. Really having excellent broad performance across Europe, but it's exceptionally strong in Poland and the U.K. has produced nice results this year. I think that we, as DAF have the best trucks, operating the best life cycle cost for our customers and that's being born out with the performance of them in the market, and we're seeing the fleets recognize that now. So we're gaining share with some of the larger fleets in Europe and growing broadly throughout Europe. That's what's leading to the strong performance. -- And then on the CapEx front and the investment in the engine plants, is that tied it all to things you see on the horizon as an opportunity to really catalyze the next stage of engine penetration for you? I don't know whether that's related to the Phase II or anything else, but as we saw the initial progress and share gains since the launch in 2010, that plateaued a bit kind of wondering what you see on the horizon both contributing toward making the investment now and kind of triggering some potential share gains? -- Yeah. Basically we're selling every engine that we can produce and so we need the additional capacity in our factories and we need the additional capacity with our suppliers. So, that's where the investment is focused. So we can go to those next plateaus and deliver great engines to our customers. -- Got it. Thank you. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from Neil Frohnapple with Buckingham Research. Your line is now open. -- Hi, thanks. Just a couple of follow-ups from earlier question. So, if I recall, PACCAR was the first in the industry to cut production in the fourth quarter of 2015, ahead of the 2016 decline in Class 8 production. You guys obviously still saw pretty positive on the fundamentals, but the industry is chewing through backlog at a quick pace. So, curious on what you're looking at and whether you will start to take down the daily build rate later this year? Do you need Class 8 orders to rise in the summer early fall time frame? Just any more thoughts there would be helpful. -- The back -- as I said, the backlog is firm, we are more moving full ahead. So... -- Okay. You guys are continuing to build momentum in Brazil, what are the plans on launching more products in the region for some of the lower weight classes of vehicles? -- Yeah, that's certainly on the drawing board in part of our process we've obviously been balancing our entry into the market, and as we continue to grow and expand our business we will be introducing new products just like we do in all markets around the world to continue to enhance our position in that market as well. So, yeah, that's definitely on our roadmap. -- Okay. And then one last one, Ron. So it sounds like the supplier constraints are largely improved. I mean are they completely behind at this point or is there still an opportunity to benefit the margins as we move through the year? -- No, we're going to continue to work very closely with our suppliers to continue to move up or build rates in the second quarter and third quarters in North America. And so, it's always an orchestrated effort with our suppliers. We feel good about that obviously the performance in the first quarter was much better than what we saw in the second half of the year and we expect that to continue for the rest of this year. -- Okay. Thank you. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi with Bank of America. Your line is now open. -- Thanks guys. -- Good morning. -- Good morning. I was just wondering if I could get some of your thoughts on how they're evolving in alternative powertrain. What are you insourcing versus outsourcing? And as things develop, are you leaning more toward doing more in-house versus outsourcing and why? -- I think it's a real exploratory time with respect to a lot of the new technologies and we are taking multiple paths in terms of developing our own internal capabilities, working closely with a variety of suppliers who are developing their capabilities. And as we progress over the next 12 to 24 months, we will be sort of figuring out what the best path is for us for the long term and there is still quite a bit of challenge with respect to the economic viability of some of these powertrain choices and -- can they survive without high degree of subsidization.So in our mind, it's still early days and we have a lot of customers who want to have some initial trucks to have in their fleet. So, they can understand the capability and we're supporting those, and so we'll continue to explore our avenues. And as I say, the next 12 to 24 months are very critical for us to sort of define our way forward. -- What about, Ron, your Silicon Valley office? What are you learning out there, particularly on the autonomous development? -- A lot. When we first made the decision to open that office that was -- it was clear there was a lot of research that was being done on that area. And so, our team in Silicon Valley, that's where we're really developing our internal capabilities for autonomy. We have great team there and they're really working closely with some third-party suppliers to develop our own packages, and then as I said, we're working with others who have their packages and want to incorporate those into our vehicles. And so we have multiple paths that we're working on there, but the Silicon Valley office and Silicon Valley team has been very helpful, as well as our technical teams and our tech center appear in Mount Vernon and Washington and in Eindhoven. They're all working together quite well to help further our efforts and be smarter about what's possible, all the things you have to think about to accomplish successful implementation. -- And then just lastly, geographically, I mean now that you've had the real success with Brazil and got that off the ground, and I think when you originally launched that investment the idea was you get to a 10% market share, first five years or so. And you seem like you're well on the path to doing that. Might we hear something relatively soon about other geographies, be it China and India, which you've talked about on and off for years? Are you getting any closer to making investment in one of those regions? -- Well, the way I think about every day that goes by where a day closer. But there is nothing on the horizon. We continue to -- we have offices in Beijing, we have offices in Shanghai, we have an office in Pune, India, with hundreds of employees working in those areas and they're providing valuable support for sourcing from suppliers, for engineering technology, embedded software. So, we get a lot of support from those teams and we make a lot of trips and have a lot of discussions with potential partners both on the OEM side, the component side, to evaluate -- where is that opportunity, that's going to provide us a good return for our shareholders. And so we will continue to evaluate, because it is -- they are large markets and there is opportunity there. It just has to be a situation that's going to make sense for us as a company and provides kind of reasonable return. -- Okay, great. Look forward to seeing you guys in a couple of weeks. Thanks. -- Okay. Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is now open. -- Hi. Good morning to you. -- Good morning, Rob. -- And just, just a quick follow-up, you've discussed the parts business where you had a long-run of success in both improving revenues and margins. Has the mix of those more proprietary engine parts been a material contributor to your margin gain? Or has that then more operational? Is the mix on the come still. I don't know if you're willing to segment that margin gain but that's the question. -- Yeah, I think there has been a positive impact on the margin performance of our operations in North America. Europe, we've always had our own engine and so we've enjoyed those margins for quite some time and we've seen margin enhancement in North America, as a result of selling, -- the engine parts sales have sort of outsized the total growth in North America and so that's a contributor. -- And then, have we seen that, that gain flow-through from the market share gain, you have on your engine in North America or I don't know the full lag of when Part sales comp versus the engine? I hope there is still some maturity come in that margin mix. Thank you. -- Yeah. So, I mean as the engines matured and you get to -- we're getting to the point now where you're starting to get into more replacement and overhaul kinds of activities for our engines. And so we're just starting to see the benefits of that phase of the aftermarket opportunity. -- Alright. That's helpful. Thank you. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open. -- Hey, good morning, everybody, and congrats on all the records and congrats on the retirement Ron and Preston. First, to start with the step up in CapEx for the year, I might have missed it earlier in the call, but what exact projects were pulled forward, is this the peak facility or some of the distribution centers are landing in this year, or could you expand on that a bit, please? -- Yeah, there is really nothing, I guess, I would say no projects pulled forward. It's just the execution of the projects that we have been planning all along. We have -- we have new PDC's, we have factory expansions. We had a nice groundbreaking for the Chillicothe paint shop. And those things are just that we're going to be able to get those projects done faster, and moving quicker than what we had originally anticipated, so our spending is just purely just a matter of the timing of the span, those have always been part of our plan. -- Got you. Thank you. And then with the build rates expected to be up 2% to 4% sequentially in the second quarter. Could you help us understand how that plays out between North America and Europe? And then I guess, I think you had mentioned a minute ago that builds would be increasing again in the third quarter for North America. Did I hear that right and by how much? Thanks. -- Yeah, I think what we'll see is the production that 2% to 4% is pretty much all North America driven. And I think in the third quarter, we'd probably see a similar level of production. We have the two week summer shutdown at DAF in the third quarter. So that we'll see a reduction in production in Europe, but it should be for the most part, offset by production levels in North America. -- Okay. Got you. Thanks. And then, just a clarification, I think you mentioned that the orders were down in Europe, could you tell us about how much and what their orders in North America been looking like year-over-year? -- Yeah, the orders in North America are -- given because of the strength of the backlog, they're reflective of just the customers that are really filling in, the few open slots that exists for 2019, but mostly it's for 2020 build. And again in Europe we saw a reduction in orders from last year's first quarter was when the backlog really got built up for DAF. And so we saw a reduction in the first quarter, I guess, (inaudible) more normal levels of order intake. -- Okay. Thanks.(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. -- Hey, good morning, guys. It's Rob on for Scott. -- Hi, Rob. -- With a quick follow-up in terms of the North America production outlook that you guys are expecting to ramp up, you guys generated some very good incremental margins and I'm backing into on the truck in the first quarter. Should we be thinking about similar incremental margins, as we look out in the second quarter, based on the roughly 3% pricing you guys were talking to, as the production ramps as well. -- Yeah, I'd say, similar. I mean it depends a little bit on the customer mix, the model mix, the geography mix. So there is lot of factors that weigh into that, so something in a similar range would be. -- And the past couple of quarters on the finance side, you guys have had very low provisions for losses on receivables is this good run rate looking forward based on your outlook of the market at around 0.6% of revenue or should we be expecting that to kind of move, as we look forward ? -- Well, I mean, because of the strength of the freight markets, our customers have enjoyed excellent performance. Our credit teams and our finance teams have done a lot of work to really apply lot of intelligent data analytics to our credit underwriting. We feel really good about the capabilities there. And so, as long as the economy is good, the freight markets are good, the portfolio will continue to perform very well. And we've seen improvement in used trucks and the portfolio is growing, our team has some great technology, that they have made available to our customers. And so I think all of that is playing to our finance companies capabilities and performance. -- That makes sense. And can you remind me -- your used truck pricing was up in the quarter, and the type of volumes that you guys saw. -- Yeah, it was up 2% to 3% compared to the first quarter of last year. I don't have the used truck volumes last -- last year for 2018, we sold about 15,000 Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF used trucks, and so that's 3,000 to 4,000 a quarter. So I would guess that we -- probably somewhere in the 3,000, 3,500 range for used truck sales in the first quarter. -- Thank you, appreciate the time. -- You bet.Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weber with RBC Capital. Your line is now open. -- Hey, good morning, guys. -- Good morning. -- Just a quick -- couple of quick follow-ups. I guess just thinking about the Parts business again. I mean, would you, do you think it's fair to -- fair to think about that business being -- that business could be up next year, even if new truck demand is lower, that's my first question. -- That surely would be for our aim. Again, we're continuing to add additional TRP Stores, we're continuing to add additional Peterbilt and Kenworth dealer locations, adding locations and markets like Brazil and other areas. And so our goal is to continue to have the new programs in place, additional technology to continue to build that business throughout all cycles. -- Okay. So you think like a low-to-mid single digit kind of number for next year is reasonable? -- Yes, probably a little bit early to commit to something. -- Okay, fair enough. And then just going back to the pricing and the incremental margin questions, I mean are you, are you assuming that, that input costs kind of stay where they are for the rest of the year? I mean, I guess some companies are talking about input cost coming down for the balance of the year. So just trying to kind of frame where operating leverage coming from (multiple speakers) -- Yeah, I think that's our assumption is probably a pretty steady input cost. We have most of our components are purchased under long-term agreements, so it takes a little while to blend cost movements into the cost of the vehicles, et cetera. So, I think that's pretty much, our assumption is a pretty stable cost environment. -- Okay, that's all I had. Thank you very much. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Faheem Sabeiha with Longbow Research. Your line is now open. -- Hi, good morning and congrats on a great quarter. Just a question on the MX production. Is there maybe some plans or an ability to accelerate that production capacity coming online sooner? It just seems like with your share remaining in the -- where it's at now exiting the cycle, could maybe stall engine parts growth opportunity that you laid out in your Investor Day last year? -- Yeah, as a company, we produced last year 97,500 engines, which is the highest that we've ever produced. And obviously that every one of those, DAF had record production. And so every DAF truck has a PACCAR engine. And so, as time goes on, we'll have to see more penetration of those engines into Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks and we are -- we've committed the money to get the capacity in place, as quickly as we can. I think most of that will be being implemented in the 2019, 2020 time frame for having full availability into 2021-ish time frame. -- Okay. And kind of adding to Seth's question, I guess with looming decline in Class 8 production, do you think, say a more favorable price cost environment, lower-premium freight costs and lower over-time to the extent you're at that level today will maybe offset the decline in volumes when you look at your gross margin next year? -- Yeah, -- the demand for trucks is there, and we're all ahead as I mentioned before. When things do adjust downward, we've proven over many, many cycles that we're very adept at managing through them. So, we will continue to execute that very well at whatever point that may happen. -- Okay. Thanks. -- Thank you.There are no other questions in queue at this time. Are there any additional remarks from the Company? -- Yes. We'd like to thank everyone for joining the call, and thank you, operator.Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes PACCAR's earnings call.

With a strategy to cut costs and improve market share in not so profitable markets, Ford is partnering with Volkswagen AG for commercial vans and pickups, and explore electric and autonomous technological developments.Apart from technical developments for gasoline vehicles, the company is working on autonomous and electric cars. For self-driving vehicles, Ford will invest $4 billion by 2023. It expects to commercially deploy the autonomous vehicle business by 2021. Further, it plans to launch 40 electric vehicles by 2022, which will consist of 16 fully-electric vehicles and the rest will be plug-in hybrids. | Rising demand for spacious and comfortable SUVs, trucks, and vans increased Ford's SUV and trucks sales. In 2018, its major sales driver was the F-Series truck range, which achieved the set target of selling 1 million vehicles globally. Among the new launches that partly contributed to the company's growth in the market were Expedition, Edge and Navigator. Robust F-series sales along with favorable product mix and market factors aided the automaker's North America operations to generate an EBIT of $2 billion in fourth-quarter 2018.However, soaring commodity prices and currency fluctuations hampered Ford's performance in fourth-quarter 2018. Further, softening demand in China and declining market share in Europe affected performance in 2018. In fourth-quarter 2018, the company generated automotive revenues of $38.7 billion while adjusted earnings per share were 30 cents. The figures missed their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.Further, frequent vehicle recall due to safety issues is another concern for Ford. Recalls not only elevate the company's expenses but also reduce consumers' confidence in a brand. Last month, it issued a recall for roughly 1.5 million Ford and Lincoln vehicles, owing to flawed downshift to first gear. In January 2019, it issued two recalls for roughly 1 million vehicles worldwide.Over the past three months, shares of Ford have outperformed the  it belongs to. Shares of the company have gained 1.3% compared with its industry's growth of 0.2% during that period.Ford currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader auto sector are Ferrari N.V.  , Oshkosh Corporation  and PACCAR Inc.  . Ferrari currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while Oshkosh and PACCAR carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .Ferrari has an expected long-term growth rate of 18.5%. Over the past three months, shares of the company have gained 28.7%.Oshkosh has an expected long-term growth rate of 11.3%. Shares of the company have gained 21.3% over the past three months.PACCAR has an expected long-term growth rate of 10.8%.

Further, this Japanese automaker reported that it will exceed its investment pledge for the country to reach nearly $13 billion by 2021. In 2017, the company pledged to invest $10 billion over a period of five years. Apart from increasing the company's manufacturing strength, this $749-million investment will create 600 jobs at its plants in the United States.The funding amount will be distributed among plants in Kentucky, Alabama, Missouri, Tennessee and West Virginia. The Georgetown, KY-based hub will receive $238 million from the current investment to improve production line. This hub will manufacture Toyota's best-selling SUVs, Toyota RAV4 hybrid and Lexus ES 300 hybrid. In order to expand its engine production by 2021, the company will invest $288 million at its Huntsville, AL-based plant. Also, for doubling hybrid transaxle capacity and expanding castings at the Jackson, TN-based hub, it will invest $50 million while Troy, MO-based facility will get funding of $62 million for additional castings. In 2021, the West Virginia facility's investment share of $111 million will be used to double its capacity of hybrid transaxles to 240,000 units per year.The investment to develop plants in the United States displays Toyota's commitment to the second-largest vehicle market. The company has been investing to widen presence in the country. Last year, it announced its decision to form a $1.6-billion joint venture with Mazda Motor Corporation to build additional plants in the United States. | Per Moody's, Toyota's industry-leading position along with its focus to improve products and strengthen operating performance will aid growth. Further, strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity support the company's financial flexibility. However, increasing expenses to support research and development of vehicle technology, and foreign currency fluctuations are headwinds for Toyota.Latest and innovative launches are expected to drive the company's growth in fiscal 2019. However, softening demand in North America and growing raw material expenses might hamper its performance.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Both Paccar and Fox Factory Holding have a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.PCAR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 10.61, while FOXF has a forward P/E of 26.72. We also note that PCAR has a PEG ratio of 0.98. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. FOXF currently has a PEG ratio of 1.77.Another notable valuation metric for PCAR is its P/B ratio of 2.78. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, FOXF has a P/B of 7.97.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to PCAR's Value grade of A and FOXF's Value grade of F.Both PCAR and FOXF are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that PCAR is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The flawed vehicles are from the United States and Canada that will require catalytic converter replacements.In-use emissions investigation conducted by Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") and in-use testing led by Fiat Chrysler, per the U.S. regulations, have impelled the company to issue the recall. The faulty vehicles include 2011-2016 Dodge Journeys, 2011-2014 Chrysler 200s and Dodge Avengers, 2011-2012 Dodge Calibers, and 2011-2016 Jeep Compass/Patriots. Out of the total, 863,000 cars are from the United States, while the rest are from Canada.The issue has been observed by the EPA during a routine in-use emissions testing, which showed deteriorating performance of catalytic converters in vehicles. The faulty catalytic converters produce nitrogen oxide pollution that is above regulatory limits. Fiat Chrysler has commenced the recall procedure that will be undertaken in phases this year. | EPA announced that the flawed vehicles have no safety concerns and the company will not be charged any associated fines for not complying with the emission standards. Additionally, the agency announced that it will conduct the testing of other Fiat Chrysler models that are possibly noncompliant, which may lead to future recalls.The automaker did not mention the cost involved with the recall. That said, i  ed that related costs had been accounted in fourth-quarter 2018.Prior to this, EPA sued Fiat Chrysler for using illegal engine-control software in diesel vehicles to pass emissions tests in 2017. Later in January 2019, the parties agreed on a settlement that costed the company roughly $800 million.In fourth-quarter 2018, the automaker recorded robus  growth in North America, which is its largest and most profitable market. However, high costs in the region, and stiff competition in the SUV and truck market acted as major headwinds for the company.Lowering demand in China, projection of higher costs and other concerns across the industry impelled Fiat Chrysler to project 2019 earnings per share at 2.70 euros. In 2018, the company's earnings were 3 euros per share.Over the past three months, shares of Fiat Chrysler have underperformed the  it belongs to. During the said period, shares of the company have lost 7.2% compared with its industry's decline of 0.6%.Fiat Chrysler currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including IBM (IBM), Duke Energy (DUK) and General Dynamics (GD). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see  's shares have outperformed the broader market on a year-to-date basis, increasing 22.7% vs the S&P 500's 11.5% gain. IBM provides advanced information technology solutions, including computer systems, software, storage systems and microelectronics.The Zacks analyst thinks IBM's improving position in the hosted cloud, security and analytics bodes well for investors. RedHat acquisition aimed at enhancing hybrid cloud platform is likely to pave the way for IBM's growth prospects. However, softness in Systems revenues and technology & cloud platforms remain a concern.Stiff competition does not bode well for Storage hardware segment. Strategic imperatives will take some more time to report meaningful growth and offset weakness in the traditional business. IBM's ongoing heavily time-consuming business model transition to cloud is a headwind. Additionally, ballooning debt levels have been troubling IBM over time.(You can  ).Shares of  have outperformed the S&P 500 in the past six months, gaining 11% vs -3.5%. Duke Energy ended the fourth quarter of 2018 on a mixed note. While the company's earnings missed expectations, revenues surpassed the same.The company invests heavily in infrastructure and expansion projects. It expects to invest about $37 billion in its overall growth projects in the 2019-2023 time frame. The Zacks analyst thinks this investment plan will drive earnings base growth in the company's combined electric and gas businesses by approximately 6%, over the next five years.However, the company faces challenges from severe weather conditions and natural calamities, which may result in breakdowns and damage to its infrastructure. Potential volatility in market prices of fuel, electricity and other renewable energy commodities could create operational risks.(You can  ).

The budgetary amendments, which were made last year, have been in favor of the company's business line.The Zacks analyst thinks that apart from solid demand for its varied defense products leading to organic growth, a notable acquisition strategy also adds significant value to General Dynamics' inorganic growth.

Most of them suffered heavy declines in 2018 even as they were upgrading their estimates for heavy-truck production in 2018 and 2019. Things have become even more curious in 2019 as stocks in the sector have risen sharply, but without a lot of fundamental change in their outlooks. What's going on and how should investors think about this sector and stocks in it like  (NASDAQ: PCAR) ?Truck sales and production are highly cyclical and they always have been. This means that revenue, margin, and profit tend to oscillate wildly with the business cycle. Of course, this is where it gets tricky for investors. After all, who would want to buy a stock on a seemingly cheap earnings valuation if those earnings are going to collapse in a year or two?Image source: Getty Images.That's exactly the quandary facing investors in stocks like truck makers  and  (NYSE: NAV) and axle and other drivetrain component manufacturers like  (NYSE: DAN) and  (NYSE: MTOR) . They all had good years from an operational perspective in 2018, and PACCAR, Meritor, and Navistar are all expected to generate mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2019 alongside  heavy-duty truck production. However, the problem is that sales are expected to drop in 2020 as the truck market starts to fall after a few years of strong growth. For example, analysts expect fiscal 2020 sales to dip 6% for Meritor, 6.2% for Navistar, and 10% for PACCAR.The shape of things to come was described by Meritor's management during the company's analyst day in December. As you can see below, the key North American and Western Europe markets are expected to decline from 2020 to 2022 and reach levels equivalent to those in 2016.Data source: Company presentations. Chart by author.In other words, revenue is expected to fall after 2020 -- this usually means earnings will as well.So even as all these stocks appear cheap on, say, the basis of trailing enterprise value (market cap plus net debt) to earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), in the years ahead, their EBIT is likely to decline and this could make their future EV/EBIT valuations seem expensive. In a nutshell, it's a classic investment conundrum for cyclical stocks. . Data by  .A closer look at PACCAR helps to clarify matters. The company's revenue tends to track the cycle of U.S. heavy-truck sales (which in turn guides production), so the task is to try to find a way to calculate PACCAR's current valuation if it were on the trend line through the cycle rather than at the peak or the trough.Let's start by estimating the long-term growth in the industry. As you can see below, 2013 and 2017 can be used as a rough proxy for the midpoints of the cycle. Calculating the annualized growth rate for PACCAR's revenue between these periods gives a growth rate of 3.3% -- this is a useful estimate for long-term growth. . Data by  .Meanwhile, the average operating income (or EBIT) margin during the period was 11%, and this can be used to obtain a rough EBIT trend line.Going back to PACCAR's 2013 revenue figure of $17.1 billion and applying a growth rate of 3.3% per year gives an estimated revenue of $20.1 billion for 2018 -- this is compared to PACCAR's actual revenue of $23.5 billion. Now, applying the 11% EBIT margin estimate to estimated revenue of $20.1 billion gives EBIT of $2.21 billion.Applying the current EV of $19.07 billion and the EBIT trend line estimate of $2.21 billion produces a trend line EV/EBIT multiple of 8.6 times -- note this is above the 6.6 times multiple that PACCAR actually trades at.Using that trend line EV/EBIT multiple of 8.6 times as a baseline suggests that PACCAR is a good value -- for example, the multiples of \"safe\" noncyclical but low-single-digit growth companies like  ,  , or  are all in the teens.For sure, highly cyclical stocks should trade at a discount to reflect the extra uncertainty inherent in their revenue streams. After all, who truly knows the length and severity of the likely downturn in the trucking industry?That said, PACCAR's current EV/EBIT multiple is similar to where it was trading before the economy entered a recession, and as we've seen, its trend line EV/EBIT multiple looks attractive. All told, provided the global economy avoids a recession in the next few years, then PACCAR looks like a good buy for investors with a tolerance for risk.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It was a strong month for the trucking sector overall, with  (NYSE: NAV) ,  (NYSE: MTOR) , and  (NYSE: DAN) all rising more than 20%. The move in January represented another turn in the bear-and-bull debate that's raged over the trucking sector in the past year.The key battleground is the outlook for heavy-duty truck orders. Trucking is a highly cyclical industry. Earnings soar when orders turn upward and collapse when the market turns down. Of course, investors always try to anticipate the cycle, and even though Meritor, PACCAR, and Navistar raised their 2018 forecasts for heavy-duty truck sales through the year, it hasn't stopped the market speculating that 2019 will mark a peak in the cycle.Image source: Getty Images.PACCAR's fourth-quarter earnings in January showed the company delivering a record number of trucks, and expectations are for even higher deliveries in the first quarter of 2019, compared with the last quarter of 2018.Regarding the general outlook for 2019, Meritor, Navistar, and PACCAR have all given guidance implying moderate growth in North American heavy-duty production, but  has been indicating  steep declines from previous years. data by Welcome to the wonderful world of investing in the highly cyclical world of investing. In theory, shares should be priced on long-term earnings and cash flow generation while ignoring the cyclical ups and downs. In practice, stock prices tend to violently overshoot in both directions, and trying to guess the peaks and troughs in the cycle is almost impossible for most investors.For example, look at what happened in 2016. As soon as truck sales peaked at the end of 2015 and then declined sharply in 2016, the stocks in the sector started to appreciate significantly. data by PACCAR is down only 1.5% year over year, compared with more than 20% declines for the others mentioned here. The question is what to do with that information. After it's clear that peak production has passed, history suggests that investors will start buying. But long-term investors who believe in the future of trucking won't be troubled by the violent upswings and downswings, or by the game of trying to pick the cyclical peak and buying in after the fact, in anticipation of a new upcycle in a year or two.For other investors, given the year-over-year declines in the stocks discussed here, don't be surprised if these stocks continue to decline even as PACCAR and others give guidance calling for moderate production growth in 2019.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Yesterday, the news promised to get worse before it gets better -- January orders for Class 8 trucks declined 68% year over year, and orders for smaller Class 5-7 trucks were down 24%, according to  (citing a  report).Here's what you need to know.Commercial truck sales are sliding downhill -- but will have to resume driving higher eventually. Image source: Getty Images.WABCO, the smallest of these three companies, makes pneumatic anti-lock brakes, electronic stability control systems, and other crucial parts for commercial trucks. Larger Cummins specializes in manufacturing diesel engines. PACCAR builds entire trucks under its Kenworth, Peterbilt, and DAF brand names.All three companies' fortunes are therefore tied to the health of the North American truck market -- and judging from recent statistics, that market is not healthy at all. Class 8 truck orders fell 43% year over year in December, and 15% in November, according to JPMorgan -- so not only are orders declining, but the  at which they decline is accelerating.And yet, bad as all this news seems, investment banker  comes away from this data with a surprising conclusion: It's often darkest before the dawn, and rapidly collapsing orders for new trucks tells Baird that there's a \"bottom\" forming in the trucking cycle -- a bottom off of which PACCAR, Cummins, and WABCO stocks might very well bounce.This morning, Baird announced it's upgrading shares of all three of these trucking stocks to outperform. Baird set an $80 price target on PACCAR (up from $62 previously), priced WABCO shares at $150, and pegged Cummins as worth $195.And to an extent, that makes sense. After all, while declining orders sound scary, the lack of orders of today is likely to create pent-up demand that must be fulfilled...sometime. It makes sense then, that in a cyclical industry like truck manufacturing, a bottom will at some point be reached, and order flow will tick back up. (And even if that day turns out to be some time away, fellow analyst Piper Jaffray noted that for PACCAR at least, the company's large quantity of backlogged orders should support the company's revenue for the near term.)At the very least, it can't hurt to begin valuing the prospects so that once orders  pick up again, investors will know which of these stocks they might like to add to their portfolios. So let's do that.Let's begin with Cummins -- probably the highest-profile name of the three stocks Baird is recommending. Valued at $23.9 billion in market cap, and with less than $1 billion in net debt, Cummins' balance sheet looks rock-solid. Cummins sells for a modest 11.2 times its $2.1 billion in net income, is pegged for 10% long-term earnings growth by most analysts who follow it (according to  ), and pays a generous 3.1% dividend yield -- about 1 percentage point more than the avera  on the  , according to Morningstar.That's a valuation that's hard to beat -- and I have to say, with regret, that I don't think PACCAR  beat it. Although Piper Jaffray likes the stock, most analysts agree PACCAR will be growing slower than Cummins over the next five years, with earnings rising just 8% per annum. PACCAR mostly makes up for this with a beefier dividend yield -- 5% -- but its balance sheet is weaker: $22.7 billion in market cap, but with $6.9 billion in net debt. Although PACCAR stock is the cheapest of the three Baird reviewed at 10.4 times earnings, I think I still prefer Cummins over it.And WABCO looks even weaker as an investment prospect. Although it doesn't carry as much debt as either Cummins or PACCAR (just $168 million), that debt looms larger relative to the company's smaller market cap of just $6.1 billion. WABCO is also both the priciest stock of the three (P/E ratio: 13.7), and the slowest grower. S&P Global estimates show WABCO unlikely to grow earnings even 6% annually over the next five years -- and WABCO pays no dividend at all.Long story short, while all three stocks are worth a look if you are looking forward to the day when trucking stocks rebound, WABCO appears to be the worst prospect -- and Cummins, the best.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(Symbol: PCAR) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $69.86, changing hands for $69.89/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 14 different analyst targets contributing to that average for PACCAR Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $54.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $85.00. The standard deviation is $8.856.But the whole reason to look at the  PCAR price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.

In earnings released on Jan. 29, the Fortune 500 manufacturer -- based in Bellevue, Washington -- notched double-digit revenue growth due to momentum in both its heavy truck and parts businesses. Note that in the discussion that follows, all comparative numbers are presented against the prior-year quarter (the fourth quarter of 2017):Data source: PACCAR. YOY = year over year.The company set a quarterly record for net sales on the back of a record delivery of 50,400 trucks worldwide.Truck, parts, and other revenue increased 15.8% to $5.9 billion. Management was particularly pleased with parts performance, with revenue improving 10.6% to $970.9 million.

In addition, high fleet utilization by freight shippers (a consequence of tight capacity in the truck transportation market) bodes well for both truck and parts sales.Management expects that truck and parts gross margin will increase to roughly 14.5% in the first quarter of 2019. Executives also anticipate truck deliveries to improve by 15% in the first quarter against the first three months of 2018.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Right now, Paccar is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Fox Factory Holding has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that PCAR likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than FOXF has recently. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.PCAR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 10.34, while FOXF has a forward P/E of 24.22. We also note that PCAR has a PEG ratio of 0.96. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. FOXF currently has a PEG ratio of 1.35.Another notable valuation metric for PCAR is its P/B ratio of 2.65. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, FOXF has a P/B of 7.55.These metrics, and several others, help PCAR earn a Value grade of A, while FOXF has been given a Value grade of D.PCAR stands above FOXF thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that PCAR is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's \"Value\" category. Stocks with both \"A\" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One company to watch right now is Paccar (PCAR). PCAR is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as an A grade for Value. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 9.93 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 9.94. Over the past 52 weeks, PCAR's Forward P/E has been as high as 16.43 and as low as 8.60, with a median of 11.17.PCAR is also sporting a PEG ratio of 0.92. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. PCAR's industry currently sports an average PEG of 1.35. Over the last 12 months, PCAR's PEG has been as high as 1.64 and as low as 0.80, with a median of 1.07.We should also highlight that PCAR has a P/B ratio of 2.34. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 2.39. Within the past 52 weeks, PCAR's P/B has been as high as 3.45 and as low as 2.05, with a median of 2.62.These are only a few of the key metrics included in Paccar's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now.

(Symbol: PCAR) were yielding above the 2% mark based on its quarterly dividend (annualized to $1.28), with the stock changing hands as low as $63.63 on the day. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider, because historically speaking dividends have provided a considerable share of the stock market's total return. To illustrate, suppose for example you purchased shares of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) back on 12/31/1999 - you would have paid $146.88 per share. Fast forward to 12/31/2012 and each share was worth $142.41 on that date, a decrease of $4.67/share over all those years. But now consider that you collected a whopping $25.98 per share in dividends over the same period, for a positive total return of 23.36%. Even with dividends reinvested, that only amounts to an average annual total return of about 1.6%; so by comparison collecting a yield above 2% would appear considerably attractive if that yield is sustainable. PACCAR Inc. (Symbol: PCAR) is an S&P 500 company, giving it special status as one of the large-cap companies making up the S&P 500 Index.In general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of PACCAR Inc., looking at the history chart for PCAR below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 2% annual yield.

Harrie Schippers, Preston Feight and I will update you on our excellent fourth-quarter and full-year results for 2018, important business highlights and PACCAR's focus on innovation. Since the PACCAR's 28,000 outstanding employees around the world, 2018 was a record-setting year for the company. PACCAR achieved record revenues of $23.5 billion and record net income of $2.2 billion, a 9.3% after-tax return on revenues.PACCAR parts set annual revenue and profit records, and PACCAR financial achieved record new business volume and a 17% improvement in pre-tax income. PACCAR celebrating 80 consecutive years of net income. We celebrated many other 2018 accomplishments. PACCAR delivered a record 189,000 trucks worldwide.DAF earned the prestigious International Truck of the Year 2018 award. Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF introduced a broad range of battery-electric, hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell truck models, which are currently in field testing with customers. DAF Brasil earned the Truck Brand of the Year honor for the third consecutive year, and increased its market share in just five years of operation to 6.7%. PACCAR's focus on sustainable business practices were recognized by the environmental reporting firm, CDP.PACCAR achieved an A rating, which puts us in the top 2% of the over 6,000 companies, which report to CDP. And we're especially proud that Peterbilt and Kenworth were recognized as top workplaces for woman by the organization Woman In Trucking. PACCAR has a strong record of shareholder returns. PACCAR's paid a dividend every year since 1941, and has delivered annual dividends of approximately 50% of net income for many years.In 2018, PACCAR declared dividends of $3.09 per share, which was a 41% increase over 2017. Total dividends declared exceeded $1 billion for the first time. PACCAR's increased its regular quarterly dividend an average of 11% per year during the last 20 years and raised the quarterly dividend another 14%, beginning in 2019. PACCAR's total dividends declared for 2018 result in a robust yield of 5.4% at year-end.PACCAR repurchased 5.8 million shares for $354 million in 2018, which was the most since 2007. The board of directors authorized additional share repurchases last year with $540 million remaining at year-end. PACCAR's fourth-quarter revenues were a record $6.3 billion, and fourth-quarter net income was $578 million. Revenues were 15% higher than the fourth quarter last year, and net income was 39% greater compared to the adjusted net income of $416 million earned in the fourth quarter last year.PACCAR delivered a record 50,400 trucks during the fourth quarter, 6% more than the third quarter. The increase in production resulted for more build days in Europe compared to the third quarter and better supply and performance. Truck and parts gross margins were 14.2% in the fourth quarter. Truck pricing was good with price realization comparable to the second and third quarter at about 2%.During the quarter, we incur some additional material labor cost due to supplier constraints, but conditions improved compared to the third quarter. By the end of the fourth quarter, supplier deliveries to the factories were in good shape. Our Peterbilt, Kenworth and DAF factories and purchasing and supplier management teams again, did a fantastic job of managing production, delivering a record number of trucks and achieving the highest operating margins in the industry. In the first quarter, we're expecting slightly higher deliveries compared to the fourth quarter.Deliveries are projected to be up over 15% when compared to last year's first quarter. Truck and parts gross margins are estimated to increase in the first quarter to around 14.5%. Now Preston Feight will provide an update on DAF, PACCAR parts and PACCAR financial services. -- Thanks, Ron. Both had an outstanding 2018. DAF achieved record year being above 16-tonne market share of 16.6% compared to 15.3% in 2017. DAF was the market leader in European tractor registrations, and is making great progress toward its goal of 20% market share.Europe's greater than 16-tonne truck market was a robust 319,000 registrations, reflecting continued strong demand and growing European economies. European economies and freight transport activity are projected to grow again in 2019. We expect 2019 to be another excellent year with the market in the range of 290,000 to 320,000 trucks. In 2018, PACCAR's parts business generated record annual revenues of $3.8 billion, and record annual pre-tax profit of $769 million.Annual revenue grew 15% and annual profit grew 26% compared to 2017. Parts' fourth-quarter revenue were a record $971 million, and quarterly pre-tax profit was a strong $194 million. PACCAR has steadily increased its truck and engine market share over the years, resulting in greater number of PACCAR trucks and engines in operation. This, combined with consistent investments in parts distribution capacity and customer focus technologies, has created a very strong growth environment for PACCAR parts.We expect parts sales to grow by 5% to 8% this year. PACCAR financial services annual pre-tax income increased 17% in 2018 to $306 million. 2018 revenues were $1.36 billion. Fourth-quarter pre-tax income increased 21% to $87 million.The portfolio increased to record size and continues to perform well. Kenworth and Peterbilt class 8 used truck values increased over 10% in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year. Kenworth and Peterbilt truck resale values commanded 10% to 20% premium over competitor's vehicles. We expect 2019 to be another good year for used trucks volumes and prices.PACCAR parts and PACCAR financial services profit contributions are much larger than they were 20 years ago. These businesses are inherently less cyclical than the sale of new trucks, and their consistent profitability enhances PACCAR's financial results throughout all phases of the business cycle. Harrie Schippers will now provide an update on Kenworth and Peterbilt and PACCAR innovation. -- Thanks, Preston. In 2018, U.S. and Canadian class 8 truck retail sales were 285,000 units. Kenworth and Peterbilt had a record production and achieved strong 29.4% market share.In 2019, we expect U.S. and Canada class 8 truck market to expand further to a range of 285,000 to 315,000 vehicles. Kenworth and Peterbilt have a records backlog with production visibility into late 2019. U.S.economic and freight indicators were strong in 2018, with nearly 3% GDP growth, 3.8% industrial production growth and 6.6% freight tonnage growth. Fleet utilization levels are very high at 97% in the fourth quarter of 2018. In 2019, U.S. GDP and industrial production are expected to grow another 2% to 3%, which bodes well for freight volumes and the amount for trucks.In the past, a surge in orders was often driven by a prebuy related to an emissions change, that is not the case in this cycle, which has been driven by economic and freight growth. Kenworth and Peterbilt customers are benefiting from the industry-leading operating efficiency provided by our trucks, as well as superior aftermarket support from PACCAR parts and PACCAR financial services. PACCAR showcase many innovative products and technologies last year. DAF introduced the CF electric, LF electric, XF hybrid and CF hybrid trucks.Peterbilt introduced Model 579, Model 520 and Model 220 electric trucks. Kenworth introduced a T680 hybrid truck and two T680 hydrogen fuel cell models. Earlier this month, several of these trucks were on display at the CES technology show in Las Vegas. We had a terrific turnout of people interested in PACCAR technology and the opportunity to see the trucks and technology firsthand.We were the only OEM displaying trucks at the show. Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF's alternative powertrain products are in field trials with customers, focusing on regional distribution, refuse, urban delivery and port applications. These applications will be the most economically feasible for customers in the medium term. Longer-term, alternative powertrain vehicles will likely be competitive in more applications.While we are preparing for the long-term by making investments in alternative powertrain technologies, we do expect diesel to remain the most efficient and cost-effective powertrain technology in heavy-truck applications for the foreseeable future. The PACCAR Innovation Center in Silicon Valley completed its first full year of operations in 2018. The Innovation Center of team complements PACCAR's extensive R&D efforts and is focused on developing a production-ready level for autonomous PACCAR truck. The team has developed an excellent reputation with the entrepreneurial community of start-up companies, venture capital firms and academia.PACCAR was recognized in 2018 for its innovations in software and manufacturing. DAF has won it with a computable award 2018 in the Netherlands for its 3D truck configurator web application. Peterbilt in Denton, Texas, the PACCAR engines factory in Columbus, Mississippi and a PACCAR truck factory in Sainte-Therese, Canada, each earned a prestigious manufacturing leadership award from Frost & Sullivan. These manufacturing innovations and arms factory capacity, efficiency and safety exemplify PACCAR's operational excellence.We invested $437 million in capital and $306 million in R&D expenses in 2018. In 2019, we're planning to increase capital investments to $525 million to $575 million, and increased R&D expenses to $320 million to $350 million. These investments will develop the next generation of Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF trucks, enhance PACCAR's diesel and alternative powertrain technologies and add additional capacity and efficiency to the company's manufacturing and parts distribution facilities. Thank you.We'd be pleased to answer your questions.[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ross Gilardi with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. -- Hey. Good morning, good afternoon, everybody. Just got a couple of questions. First of all, maybe you could talk a little bit more about the parts business.Where do you think we are in the cycle? You'll be factoring in some deceleration this year. But I remember an interesting chart you had at your Investor Day showing that we're in somewhat of a sweet spot for parts, given the age class of the active fleet. So why would that actually even slow down this year? -- Well, I'll just say last year was an extraordinary year for PACCAR parts. They put a lot of things in place which -- we reaped the benefits of those last year. We continue to invest in additional capacity this year, so we've got two pretty major projects, one in Las Vegas and one in Brazil for next year. So the programs that have been put in place will continue to generate positive returns, and so we think -- or at this point, somewhere in the 5% to 8% range.But we'll see how the year progresses and we'll have better insight in that as we have this discussion three months from now. -- Yes, got it. Thanks, Ron. And then maybe you could just talk about class 8 order trends a bit, I mean, obviously, they were at supernormal levels throughout the year, and they've started to slow, just back toward smart, more normal levels. What you've seen there? Is it the big fleets, the smaller fleets? Is it really just everybody there? I mean, you sound like you're still quite positive this year.But any color on order trends would be great. -- Yes. Over 450,000 orders last year was -- I would sort of call it supernormal, I would call it abnormal, which was, yes, great for the backlog. I was just at the ATD meeting last week, meeting with several of our dealers, the dealers are very confident about the ability to deliver the trucks that are in the backlog and very confident about orders that will continue to fill in the openings that are there. And we've already taken some orders for 2020.I'd say industry conditions are very positive from our perspective. -- Thank you. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from Joel Tiss with BMO. Your line is now open. -- Two things. Can you give us a sense, maybe, this is more of a Harrie question. Why the inventories are running up kind of 27.5% at the end of the year? Usually you normalize them toward the end of the year and I just wondered if there's something unusual in there or you just gearing up for a strong 2019? -- Are you talking about by looking at the balance sheet, the... -- Yes. -- Carrying value from year to year? I'd say, it's -- I mean, Harrie can have this one. But I think it's mostly just reflecting higher production levels. -- Exactly right, Ron. Reflecting the higher build rates. -- Yes. -- And then can you give us a little background? Can you tell us what your penetration rate is on your parts? Out of your total installed base, what do you guess your market share is on the parts penetration? Is it 15% or 40%, or just an idea so we can also gauge how much growth potential there is longer term? -- Yes. That's a very -- unfortunately, there was not a real strong gauge of the parts market like there is on trucks. But I would say, based on seeing our parts revenue growth relative to the competition, what we can glean from that is that our share position improved really in all of our markets last year. And again, kudos to the parts team for the great things and investments they've made in warehousing, in programs.And I think we'll continue to grow our share without -- again, without knowing precise numbers. -- All right. Thank you. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. Your line is now open. -- Hi. Good morning, guys. -- Hi, Steve. -- Ron, I was going to see if I could push you a little bit for a little bit more color on your pricing commentary. I think you said, the prices were up about 2% in the second, third and it sounds like also the fourth quarter. And I'm curious about two things. One, is how does that sort of compare with the increases that you saw in things like parts' costs and labor inflation and so forth? In other words, price, cost, neutral, negative or positive, I'd just be curious on how that trended? And then, as we look into 2019, are there some opportunities to maybe get a little bit more price with the backlog being as long as it is? And how does the price cost kind of balance look to you guys going forward? -- We'll let Michael talk a little bit about the details of the cost side, and then I'll talk about 2019. Michael? -- Yes, the cost side for the fourth quarter, they were up about 1.6% or -- which was less than our revenue side, which is up by over 2%. So we had some positive price realization during the quarter. -- So but as you look next year, Stephen, I think, the orders are pretty well in the house for North America, and so we know what that pricing is. And we commented on what we think the first-quarter margins, a little bit enhancement up to around 14.5% in the first quarter. And we'd say, if you look at the full year, probably in the 14% to 15% range for the year. -- OK. Thanks, that's helpful. -- Yes, sir.Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. -- Hi, good morning and good afternoon everyone. -- Good morning, Jerry. -- I wonder if you can talk about the new products that you were stepping through at the beginning of the call, the battery-power products are in various stages of customer testing. Can you talk about what are the most successful variant so far? And when do you think we'll see them in commercial production and in your facilities? I appreciate that it's early, but maybe could you share with us the early results? -- Yes. I think we sort of think about in three different layers. I think where we're at today in sort of the demonstration phase where we're learning about new technologies and how they work, next step, would probably be some level of low-volume production, which would probably be starting next year. And then at some point, once the commercial viability of these technologies are good and the customers -- the customer demand is there, I mean, ultimately for us, it's all about the customer demand.And I think the economic feasibility will dictate a lot of that as time goes on. And so we're doing everything we can to be prepared and be ready and be as smart as we can be about those technologies. And we'll be ready to start production when the customers' demand is there for those products. -- OK. And then the low-volume production that's expected next year, can you talk about what the powertrain looks like in terms of is it a PACCAR-supplied powertrain? Is it third party? I guess, what we've seen from you folks in the past from that diesel side is lower volume products you've attempted to use third-party powertrains and where you have more scale you've done in-house, and I'm wondering is that the framework we should be thinking about at least in the early stages of EV? -- Yes. I think in the early stages, we're working with a variety of partners to identify what technologies work best. But also getting smarter about what role we want to play and what position we want to have in these alternative powertrain components. So that's still being studied and evaluated for the long-term. -- And in PACCAR financial, you folks had really strong margins this quarter, sounds like used truck values were a contributor to that? Can you just flesh that out, was that a mark-to-market or is that sustained benefit now that values have moved higher? Can you just give us a bit more context behind the strong parts or -- excuse me, FinCo margin improvement? -- Yes. There's no mark-to-market. We adjust, we look at valuations of our used truck inventories every quarter and once we adjust, typically, if there is a writedown needed, we take the writedown and then that becomes the basis going forward. So no mark-to-market enhancements.It's all about just the market pricing is better, and we're getting a better result from our used truck activities, particularly in North America. -- OK, thank you. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. -- Hi. Thank you very much. Regarding the first quarter delivery comment, if I heard correctly, up 15% year over year. Can you help us geographically, how we're thinking about deliveries sequentially? -- I think the lion's share of that will probably be in North America was some improvement in Europe as well compared to last year's first quarter. And we'll see -- yes, we're seeing -- we'll see some improvement in South America as well. So I think most of the regions will be up and Mexico, I think, will be up as well. -- Yes, I'm just trying to look at normal sequentials. Usually Europe and rest of world are down 4Q to 1Q. So most of the sequential growth is North America. And I guess what was driving it, you haven't found this constructive on the supply chain for a little while, sounds like that's improving? -- It is... -- So while I appreciate the price cost, I have to believe the inefficiencies in the supply chain have been rather notable the last couple of quarters. So with that starting in the past, I guess, maybe I'm just pushing a little bit on the gross margin, to have the gross margin in the first quarter still down year over year? I'm just trying to get a sense of do we see at some point, the gross margins can grow on that stronger delivery growth especially if North America sort of driving the growth? I would have thought the supply chain improvements may be able to bump up the gross margin thoughts? -- Yes, I -- so if you look at the truck margins, truck margins in the fourth quarter, I think, were about 11.9% -- 11.8%, 11.9%. And so because the revenue growth in the first quarter will be more related to trucks than parts, you get a bit of a mix effect that has a margin impact. So that's sort of what we're seeing. And if -- we're seeing good, really good performance by our suppliers in the month of January and should that continue that there could be some upside.But right now, we're making our best call based on how we see it currently. -- No. I appreciate that. Yes, we have -- on a pre-tax level, margin truck was still down year over year in the fourth quarter. But are you saying that at least there's a chance, say, the pre-tax truck margins should have a chance to start growing year over year with the deliveries? That answer or we're looking for that extra little pop to earnings power can we start to assume some improving year-over-year margin? -- It could. And so we'll -- again, I think we'll see how things progress here as we work through the first quarter. -- OK. And quick follow-up on Europe. I appreciate the derisking, the guide down a little bit, but can you help us with how the orders were in the fourth quarter year over year? -- Let me just see if we can -- well, the orders were strong while we look for the numbers. We had a really strong December in Europe. And... -- Yes, fourth-quarter orders were up 8%, and for the full year, orders were up 17% in Europe. -- OK. Well, so it's up 8% going into the year. And lastly, the repo. The repo was a nice step-up in the fourth quarter.Maybe if you can just help us how you think about the cycle and how it maybe influences at your thoughts on the share repo. -- Yes. I mean, we -- when the evaluation is attractive as it is currently, we step up our efforts on the repurchase activity. And so that's been the approach we've taken for years, and we'll continue to apply that. We still have $540 million of authorization that we'll continue to manage through 2019. -- OK. I appreciate it. Thank you so much. -- Thank you, David.Our next question comes from the Seth Weber with RBC. Your line is now open. -- Hey, good morning, good afternoon everybody. Just kind of going back to David's question on the gross margin, is there any way to quantify how much the supply chain disruption or some hiccups cost you in margin in the fourth quarter? I think you said it was maybe 50 basis points in the third quarter. Did it get less onerous in the fourth quarter? -- Yes, that's a tough one, you know. There's just -- there's so many inputs that go with that. So I don't recall that being that specific. So it is an impact in -- it's tens of millions, but it's hard to quantify. -- OK, fair enough. And then I wanted to ask about the higher CAPEX that you're looking for in 2019. You did mention some incremental spend on manufacturing facilities. I'm wondering, is that -- are you adding brick-and-mortar or is it just sort of adding incremental machine tools, or what? Can you just give us any color on that specific part of the higher CAPEX on the manufacturing side? And also, are you ramping up spending on any suppliers? Thanks. -- So I'd say it's a combination of all those things. There will be some additional bricks and mortar added to some of our facilities to really increase the efficiency. One of the things that we're going to be doing, we're going to be investing in a new paint shop in Chillicothe, Ohio. So that'll be a pretty sizable addition, and we'll redirect the current paint shop to be more involved with assembling capacity.We're also looking at machining investments to support the success of the PACCAR MX engine and just to continue to increase the efficiency of all of our factories around the world. And we'll be preparing for new product launches and the facility requirements to go with that. -- OK. And are you investing in suppliers to help -- kind of help them along a little bit these days? Or... -- We definitely are. Where there's -- supplier is -- you can't get it done fast enough to support what we want to do, then yes, definitely, we're providing suppliers with a capital investment and it's going to benefit PACCAR. -- Great. OK. Thank you very much, guys. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Andy Casey with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. -- Good morning out there. How's everybody doing? -- Great Andy. And you? -- Doing fine. Thanks. -- Staying warm? -- Trying. The worst is coming. Your welcome to come out and join us. -- Sunny here in Seattle today. -- Oh, that's great. Hey, in your European outlook, I mean, some of the questions have already been asked, but you're expecting the industry sales down around 4% at the midpoint. You had 8% organic growth -- or sorry, order growth in the fourth quarter. Should we read that to mean that you expect industry trends, not necessarily PACCAR but industry trends, to kind of deteriorate through the year? -- You know, the European market has been above 300,000 for three straight years. We -- based on how we see things, we think 2019 could be the fourth. And so we're starting the year in a real positive vein with where we're at. But it's four years, and it's -- we'll see how long it runs, but we do have some conservatism baked into our thinking as we progress through the year.But hopefully, that doesn't turn out to be the case. -- OK. Thanks for that, Ron. And then just a little bit further on that topic, have you started to see any weakness in any of those select countries that create the Europe region? -- You could say that Germany is the place where, if there's anything, there's a little bit of noise and, obviously, the U.K. But in general, as Ron just said, we see strong performance in order intake and how the trucks are certainly being received with the customers. So with order intake up and market share growth that we've achieved, feels pretty good for 2019. -- Yes, we're pretty fortunate in the U.K. We have -- we're the only OEM in Europe that has a plant manufacturing products in the U.K., and that provides us a bit of a competitive advantage, depending on how things play out with Brexit. And I think everybody believes that there won't be a hard Brexit. But in the event there is, it actually -- from a competitive situation, it actually plays into our favor.So we'll how it all develops, but we're hopeful that's there's a nice, smooth approach to the transition there. -- OK. Thank you. And then if we can flip over to parts, if I look at it on an annual basis, you had around 150 basis points of operating margin improvement year over year. Clearly, a very strong performance.When you look back on the entire year, could you kind of review of what the main factors driving that improvement were? And then kind of reflect on whether you expect further upside to the margin during 2019? -- So the big thing is just the operating leverage on the warehouse and sales and marketing spend, and so you get the benefit of that. You get to -- we continue to see growth in our engine park and engine parts sales, which typically have a little bit higher-than-average margin, and I don't think that's going to change. I think we'll continue to see engines -- engine parts growth probably still be a leading product line that will help us develop the parts business into 2019. So offsetting that, we -- last year, we constructed the Toronto PDC, which is now up and running and doing great.And so you have some project costs that we continue to incur just to support the growth of the business going forward. So that tends to offset a little bit, but that'll be pretty -- all pretty normal. And so we'd see some -- probably some leverage from that 5% to 8% revenue growth. -- OK. Thank you very much. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from Ann Duignan with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. -- Good morning, Ann. -- Sorry, I had you on mute. Sorry. Good morning. I guess, a lot of my questions have been answered, but if we could take a step back and look at your backlog again, strictly in North America, can you talk a little bit about the mix in there of sleeper versus Class 8? And also maybe large fleet versus smaller owner-operator? Or any other color you can give us on the mix of that backlog, it would be great. -- Ann, if I look at the backlog for 2019, it's pretty normal. We got a very normal mix of fleet business, bigger fleets and smaller fleets retail business by our dealers. And we try to manage that backlog also that in a year where our lead times extend, that we're able to supply all our loyal customers with the trucks that they need. -- So nothing unusual, sleeper versus class 8 straight? I'm thinking more oil and gas kind of related infrastructure? -- No, that's very normal. -- OK, that's good to hear. Thank you. And then in that context also, perhaps we could talk about used values and also the cancellations that escalated for the industry over the last couple of months? Can you talk about what you've seen in cancellation rates? Or were you're dealers not ordering for stock to begin with, so there have not been the same level of cancellations? If you could talk little bit about that that'll be good. -- Yes. Used truck prices have improved nicely as we mentioned. And if we look at cancellations, we don't see a lot of real cancellations. If we see cancellations, it's cancellations for reorders.So a dealer changes the type or a customer for a truck, but not any significant cancellations so far. -- And is that your assessment of the industry cancellation rates? That it is more canceling and resetting of delivery train trucks that... -- We just -- don't know what the other -- we know what our situation is, but we don't really have any read into what the competitor numbers look like. -- OK. And one quick follow-up on your European outlook. What exactly do you have baked in the outlook for Brexit? You're assuming it's a normal or that it doesn't happen? Or what's the downside risk if we do not get order past the expiration date? -- You know, I think there's bound to be some -- if there is a hard Brexit, it's -- there's bound to be some temporary disruption. But that's, again, that's temporary. And again, because we are the sole producer in the U.K., from a competitive standpoint, it's actually a bit of an advantage for us. -- No. But in the long-term, post any disruption, obviously? -- Yes. I think long-term, it all sorts itself out. Yes. But short-term, challenges. -- Yes. OK. I'll leave it there and get back in line. Thank you.Appreciate it. -- OK. Thanks, Ann.Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. -- Hi. Good morning. -- Good morning, Jamie. -- I guess, first question, I was sort of surprised when you talked about customers already starting to talk about 2020. And obviously, when we look at your stock price and the multiple the world assumes in 2020, the truck market, obviously, rolls over. So can you just talk, understanding it's far out, but sort of what your customers are talking about in terms of how they're thinking about 2020 and sort of how far out you are? And then my second question, I'm sorry, I just wanted to push again on the margins for 2019. I know you said -- I think you said 14% to 15%.But like, how is not the midpoint to the high end 14.5% to five more realistic, just given price? I mean, material costs are going down. The supplier constraints and inefficiencies should be going away. I just -- I don't understand how we get to the low end? -- So the backlog -- the customers are engaging in discussions about 2020. They've got their build slots outlined for 2019, and so some of those discussions are occurring and... -- But it's still very limited for 2020. The big fleets plan their requirements into 2020. In general, we haven't issued our pricing for 2020 yet, so that's still to come. So once we launch or issue our pricing for 2020, we'll see more orders for 2020. -- Yes, and as far as margins... -- I'm just wondering if you have a strong view on whatever the industry forecasts are out there for 2020 of down 25% based on what you're hearing. If you think the market is too pessimistic or you don't forecast you'll run the business no matter what's... -- Yes, I mean, what will actually be 2020, that's to be determined. But as we see it right now, there's -- people still need and want trucks, and we're trying to figure out how to build more trucks. Not -- that's -- and that's what you see a little bit in our first-quarter delivery plan. As far as margins, we're just starting the year, given a pretty broad range.And we'll have better feel for how suppliers are going to perform over the year and how cost movements will be, what's the impact of commodities and tariffs, etc. So that's still -- we think we have all that pretty well dialed in, but we'll see how it progresses as we go through the first quarter. -- OK. Thanks. I'll get back in queue. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is now open. -- Hey, guys. -- Hey, Steven. -- I wanted to follow up on the supply chain topic. And I think, Ron, you said that the suppliers reached a good shape by the end of the fourth quarter. But I guess I'm curious, you're confident that they'll be able to seamlessly ramp up further to meet a still higher rate of production in 2019. -- Yes. Our teams are -- our materials teams, our purchasing teams, our quality teams, they're working closely with our suppliers. And they had some -- our suppliers had some difficult hands they got dealt with a few hurricanes and a few things like that in the second half of last year, which -- that's sort of behind us. And so they've gotten their legs under them, and so we're working closely with them to be able to support the progression of build that we want to achieve during 2019. -- So is it smooth so far in, say, the month of January? -- Yes. January has been the best we've seen in -- through a couple of quarters. -- OK, terrific. And then just on Financial Services, just curious how much visibility you have at this point for 2019. I mean, the current quarter of profit was a nice run rate at $87-or-so million. Is that something you expect to build on in 2019? Or might it kind of sustain here and then moderate after a couple of quarters? -- Well, we've grown the portfolio with the additional truck deliveries, record truck deliveries and the ability that we've -- we financed about 24% of those globally last year, and we expect that will continue next year. So I think we'll continue to see some modest portfolio growth, and right now, the portfolio is performing excellently. Our past dues are really at historically low levels. And so we entered 2019 in good shape, and so we feel good about where we're at for 2019 with our financial services business, for sure. -- Very good. Thanks a lot. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research. Your line is now open. -- Thanks for taking my questions. First, just wanted to understand gross margin potential. And when you talk about another strong year in 2019 and a 14% to 15% range. And you go back to the middle part of last decade in a strong market conditions when you're doing 15% to 16% range, a host of things on the emissions front, obviously, price cost considerations, but just wanted to understand the major kind of structural swings that appear to mark step down in the structural sort of gross margin potential. -- You know, 14% to 15% margins are excellent. There could have been some unusual circumstances 10 years ago, 15 years ago, but I think we're in great shape. The cost and the revenue side of trucks these days are much higher, given all the emissions add-ons that have occurred over time, so that probably could have some impact on the percentage realization over time. But whether it's 14% or 15%, 15% to 16%, it's pretty strong. -- OK. And then on the share repo front, stepping it up in 2018, but vis-\u00e0-vis, the cash that's on the balance sheet, the potential to do something much larger than, and I guess, maybe just why not step it up and be a little bit more active on the share repo front? -- Yes. We just -- we feel really good. If you look at our cash over time, it's plus or minus 15% of our balance sheet, and we're basically sitting about that point. And so we're quite comfortable with where we're at and continuing to opportunistically buy shares as work for us, and we will continue to apply that approach in 2019. -- And then just one on DAF and the share gains in 2018. I think some nice progress toward the 20% target. When you think about the momentum you have there, the good orders that you have in 4Q, I mean, do you have any kind of sense on short of hitting that 20% target? Does that time line look more in view today than it has over the past couple of years, I imagine? And just trying to think about the -- what you see out there as a reasonable time line to get there? -- Yes. So if you look at 20 years' history, we were at 10% 20 years ago, and now we've progressed to 16.6%. So is 20 in our sights? Absolutely. And a key reason for the success this year was the -- that model your '17 truck that was an excellent investment, both from a performance standpoint, a apparent standpoint, a fit-and-finish standpoint.So it's -- the truck has just gotten better and better, and we're continuing to make investments for the future. And I think as -- just as we've seen in North America, we've grown -- in that 20-year period, we've grown basically 9 share points in North America from 21 to 30. And so yes, 20% is definitely in our sights. -- Great. Thanks very much. -- Thank you.Our next question comes from the line of Neil Frohnapple with the Buckingham Research. Your line is now open. -- Hi, guys. -- Good morning, Neil. -- Good morning. At the Investor Day, Ron, you guys talked about the potential down the road of expanding further into China. Can you provide any commentary here? Has the vision changed at all with all the cross-currents? -- It hasn't changed. We continue to look for a window of opportunity that can provide a return, and that's the challenge in China is finding the right combination where you can get a reasonable return. Harrie, Preston and I, we've all traveled there in the last several months. And so we continue to be there, evaluate it.And the window will open, but it's just -- it's an area of future opportunity, and we'll continue to evaluate just there as we do other parts of Asia. -- All right. And then can you provide an outlook for the North American medium-duty market. It seemed show more signs of life and exhibit faster growth in 2018. So yes, just curious on what your thoughts are for that market in 2019. -- Yes, the class 6 and 7 market, which is where we play, is roughly up 100,000 trucks in 2018, and Peterbilt and Kenworth achieved record deliveries, record market share, 17.5%. So the products that we have are doing great. And just like everything else, we'll continue to make investments into product enhancements as we go forward. And as time goes on, more and more and more of our dealers get more engaged in that business.And so as we look at 2019, we think 100,000 trucks is probably a pretty reasonable approximation of that market for this year. -- OK. Thanks, Ron. I'll pass it on. -- Sure.Our next question comes from the line of Adam Uhlman with's Cleveland Research. Your line is now open. -- Hi. Good morning, everyone. -- Good morning. -- I was wondering if you could chat about the MX engine. I think I heard earlier, Ron, you mentioned adding some more machining capacity. I assume you're kind of maxed out on production today, but correct me if I'm wrong. And what type of growth should we expect in that business, either in terms of penetration or production rates in 2019 as that investment comes online? -- Yes, so the -- we'll start making those investments in 2019. The coming online is probably 2020 and will -- that'll be able to support the increased penetration. As we said before, the MX engine, basically, will support 80% of customer applications, and it just takes time to increase that penetration. We could put more in today if we had the capacity.And so that's why we're making the additional investments, and we'll continue to see that penetration grow to 50%, 60% over the coming near-term period, I think. -- And where did we end in 2018? -- Yes, just over 40% in North America. And of course, it's 100% for all the DAF products that get sold in Brazil and Europe. And so I think, overall for PACCAR, it's about 60% penetration for all of PACCAR. -- Got you. And then can we switch back to Europe? And could you talk about what you're seeing in the used truck pricing there? And then is there any difference between Western Europe or Eastern Europe? Any kind of changes would be helpful. -- Yes. Pricing is pretty steady. Not seeing any appreciation, but just pretty steady. And demand, more of the used trucks tend to go toward Central and Eastern Europe.There's -- that's also a big growth area for DAF for new trucks. DAF is the -- a leader in the Central European markets. And so that's steady as she goes is how I would think about it. That's what we saw in 2018 is how we're thinking about 2019 at this point. -- Great, thanks.Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. -- Hey, good morning, good afternoon. It's Rob Salmon on for Scott. -- Good morning, Rob. -- Good morning, guys. In the guidance that you provided, at the midpoint, it's implying roughly a little under 10% growth in the R&D budget. Could you talk about how we should be thinking about the R&D as we look out a few years in light of some of the emission standards changes, as well as the investments that you guys are making into some kind of new trucking products? And what the flexibility you guys have on that line item if we do kind of encounter an industry downturn in 2020? -- Well, the flexibility of managing cost structure is a real strength of PACCAR, and we can manage that quite well. But also, we're making some great investments, as we always do, in the products for the future. I would say, incrementally, we're going to -- we're seeing more investments in R&D on the alternative powertrain and software development side. That's where the intellectual property is being created, and we're making those investments there.And we continue to make good, strong investments in diesel powertrains. We've got emissions requirements being enhanced in really all of our markets. And so we continue to invest in those arenas and in the new products of the features that are going to get us to those market share goals that we talked about earlier. -- OK. That makes sense. With the record backlog, has that given you any ability to kind of make the pricing, as well as the orders be much more firm throughout kind of 2019, just given that we're looking at roughly a 12-month delay in terms of when a truck is ordered to when it gets produced today? -- The pricing has been negotiated, agreed, and it's representative of our market price and the great value that our products bring to our customers. So it's pretty well set. -- That makes sense. So that's what we're hearing from your end customers as well. So I appreciate the time, guys. -- Sure.Our next question comes from the line of Joel Tiss with BMO.

For example, the table below shows some of the leading companies' full-year outlooks for the North American truck market. As you can see, production forecasts were raised across the board.\n  \nData source: company presentations. *Figures are actual fiscal year numbers.What's more, the outlook for 2019 is positive. For example, Meritor, Navistar, and Cummins have all given estimates for 2019 that imply growth. So why were stocks in the sector sold off so heavily last year?The answer probably lies in two factors. First, there is the market's propensity to sell off the sector as peak truck production approaches and then promptly start buying it after the peak has passed. In other words, the more truck-related companies start talking about a little bit better near-term growth, the more analysts start worrying about the peak.Second, there were fears of a cyclical slowdown in the economy and Rational long-term investors will just ignore these price movements because they are in the stocks for the long haul. However, that's not to say the outlook for trucking stocks isn't questionable in the mid-term. For example, axle manufacturer Meritor sees North American heavy-duty truck production falling to 250,000 units in 2022 from 320,000 in 2019 as the market normalizes in North America and Europe. So the outlook for the next few years is for growth to turn negative, but as we've already seen in 2018, the price performance of trucking sector stocks doesn't always correlate with the near-term outlook.Image source: Getty Images.Investors in PACCAR, and the trucking sector in general, will be keenly looking out for indicators on the economy -- the last thing transportation stocks need is a slowing global economy. Meanwhile, the usual market preoccupation with peak trucking production is likely to go on in 2019. History suggests that selling out as peak production passes is a bad idea, so let's see if history is on the sector's side again this year.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $55.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $54.45 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of PCAR, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $61.82/share today.Because the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 11% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless.

This marks the fourth year of auto sales exceeding 17 million, the longest such streak the industry has ever recorded (read:  ).Sales got one-time boost from Trump administration's tax overhaul, which gave consumers extra amount to spend on new cars. Additionally, higher rental sales, fuel-efficient and technologically enriched vehicles, cheaper gas prices, high consumer confidence, and 50-year low unemployment led to resiliency in the industry. While sales of small sport utility vehicles rose strongly last year, sales of most other types of vehicles were either down or up only slightly.Of the six major American and Japanese automakers, Fiat Chrysler  is the only company that posted the sales increase of 9% last year. Other automakers recorded declines of 6.6% for Nissan Motor  , 3.5% for Ford Motor  , 2.2% for Honda  , 1.6% for General Motors  , and 0.3% for Toyota  .This year is expected to be more challenging given the lingering U.S.-China trade woes and signs of global slowdown, which will continue weighing on demand.

In the las  ed quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.3%. Per its earnings trend, PACCAR surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 7.6%.Over the past year, shares of PACCAR have underperformed the  y it belongs to. The stock decreased 21.5% compared with the industry's 18.9% decline.Let's see, how things shaped up for the upcoming announcement. | Despite witnessing a great year, the demand for heavy (Class 8) and medium-duty (Class 5-7) trucks fell in the last few months of 2018. Per ACT Research, orders for Class 8 trucks declined to roughly 43% in December compared with the same period of 2017. Further, Class 5-7 truck orders fell 4.6% compared with December 2017. The slump in orders can be partly contributed to seasonality factors along with record-breaking orders in June and July. The decline in truck orders is likely to hamper PACCAR that specializes in delivering well-known trucks. The declining truck order growth might put pressure on the company's financials in fourth-quarter 2018.For the soon-to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for truck deliveries in the United States and Canada is pegged at 27,411 while for Europe the figure is 17,242. For 2018, PACCAR projects retail sales of 280,000-290,000 units for the Class 8 truck industry in the United States and Canada, and 310,000-320,000 units for Europe's more than 16-tonne market.In the last reported quarter, this truck manufacturer struggled with mounting costs. Inaccessibility of adequate auto parts from suppliers, who were impacted by the hurricane, negatively impacted the company's profit margin. During the quarter, part shortages pushed the company to invest materials and labors additionally. The lingering effect may also be observed in the fourth quarter.However, the growing number of trucks and engines in the portfolio, along with consistent investment to develop technology and improve distribution capacity, places PACCAR in a strong position within the industry.Our proven model does not conclusively predic  beat for PACCAR this quarter.

PCAR's PEG has been as high as 1.79 and as low as 0.81, with a median of 1.13, all within the past year.We should also highlight that PCAR has a P/B ratio of 2.12. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 2.26. Within the past 52 weeks, PCAR's P/B has been as high as 3.45 and as low as 2.10, with a median of 2.67.Finally, our model also underscores that PCAR has a P/CF ratio of 5.91. This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook. PCAR's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 5.96. Within the past 12 months, PCAR's P/CF has been as high as 11.81 and as low as 5.86, with a median of 7.57.These are just a handful of the figures considered in Paccar's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that PCAR is an impressive value stock right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

(Symbol: PCAR) saw new options become available this week, for the August 16th expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 225 days until expiration the newly available contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the PCAR options chain for the new August 16th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $55.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.40. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $55.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $50.60 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of PCAR, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $56.57/share today.Because the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 61%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 8.00% return on the cash commitment, or 12.98% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for PACCAR Inc., and highlighting in green where the $55.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $57.50 strike price has a current bid of $4.80. If an investor was to purchase shares of PCAR stock at the current price level of $56.57/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $57.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 10.13% if the stock gets called away at the August 16th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if PCAR shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for PACCAR Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing PCAR's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $57.50 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $57.50 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 49%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted). Should the covered call contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 8.49% boost of extra return to the investor, or 13.77% annualized, which we refer to as the  .The implied volatility in the put contract example is 35%, while the implied volatility in the call contract example is 31%.Meanwhile, we calculate the actual trailing twelve month volatility (considering the last 251 trading day closing values as well as today's price of $56.57) to be 26%.

After plunging in October like most industrial stocks, Cummins stock shot up 10.5% in November, according to data provided by  . It seemed like a blink-and-miss moment, though, what with shares of the engine manufacturing giant already giving up all those gains so far in December.Looking at the timeline of events, it's evident that enthusiasm about Cummins' third-quarter earnings report that was released on Oct. 30 spilled over to November.The  lately, and impressive numbers from Cummins' key customer  in late October raised hopes among investors in Cummins as well. Cummins didn't disappoint: It  by 12% and 45%, respectively, year over year. North America was its strongest market, with sales jumping 17% year over year. International revenue climbed 6% during the quarter, led by robust demand from India, China, Latin America, and Europe.It was, in fact, a  quarter for Cummins in terms of profits. The market, unsurprisingly, welcomed the news as it felt like a much-needed breather given the pessimism surrounding cyclical, specifically industrial, stocks amid geopolitical concerns. Ironically, those exact concerns are now putting pressure on Cummins shares, though there's another bit of news that appears to be spooking investors this month.The volatility in Cummins stock has left investors scratching their heads. Image source: Getty Images.You see, while the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China and mixed signals about potential negotiations between the two nations after the G-20 summit has had its repercussions on industrial stocks, Cummins shares took another hit after Class 8 truck order numbers for November were surprisingly weak. November marked the first month so far this year when orders for heavy-duty trucks from the  declined year over year.Industry experts aren't reading much into the November drop in Class 8 orders, though, as they believe it was the result of exceptionally strong backlogs, because of which leading truck manufacturers already have their order books full through the better part of 2019 and are going easy with fresh orders. 2019, in fact, is projected to be an even stronger year in terms of deliveries for the North American trucking market.Cummins, for its part, expects to grow full-year revenue by 15%-17%.

After all, who wouldn't want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let's put  stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock's current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, PACCAR Inc has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9.7, as you can see in the chart below:Further, the stock's PE also compares favorably with the industry's trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 10.9. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 16.9. If we focus on the stock's long-term PE trend, the current level puts PACCAR Inc's current PE ratio somewhat below its midpoint (which is 16.1) over the past five years.We should also point out that PACCAR Inc has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year's earnings) of just 9.2, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for PACCAR Inc's stock in the near term too.An often overlooked ratio that can still be a great indicator of value is the price/cash flow metric. This ratio doesn't take amortization and depreciation into account, so can give a more accurate picture of the financial health in a business. This is a preferred metric to some valuation investors because cash flows are (a) generally less prone to manipulation by the company's management and (b) are less affected by variation in accounting policies between different companies.The ratio is generally applied to find out whether a company's stock is overpriced or underpriced with reference to its cash flows generation potential compared with its competitors. However, it is not commonly used for cross-industry comparison, as the average price to cash flow ratio varies from industry to industry.In this case, PACCAR Inc's P/CF ratio of 5.99 is lower than the industry average of 6.48, which indicates that the stock is somewhat undervalued in this respect.In aggregate, PACCAR Inc currently has a Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes PCAR a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for PACCAR Inc is just 0.9, a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1.2. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock's earnings growth rate. Clearly, PCAR is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.Though PACCAR Inc might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of C. This gives PCAR a VGM score-or its overarching fundamental grade-of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  )Meanwhile, the company's recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current quarter has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days and one lower, while the full year estimate has seen nine upward and one downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen about 4% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has nudged up 1.8%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below: | Even though PACCAR Inc has a better estimates trend, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). That is why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.PACCAR Inc is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (top 7% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for industry trends to turn favorable in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.The greatest discovery in this century of biology is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

Ford currently yields 6.5%, while GM's lower 4.1% yield is still impressive.But what if there was an automotive stock that didn't rely on light-vehicle sales, was also available at a cheap valuation, and had a dividend with an upside that most investors don't know about? Here's why  (NASDAQ: PCAR) is an intriguing business and might be the best automotive dividend stock -- provided you act by Dec. 12 (more on this in a moment).Before we get to PACCAR's unique dividend and how investors can benefit, here's the core of the company's business and why investors can feel comfortable owning this automotive stock. If you have never heard of PACCAR, the company designs, manufactures, and sells light-, medium-, and heavy-duty trucks under its Peterbilt, Kenworth, and DAF brands. It also manufactures diesel engines and provides financial services. These aren't trucks subject to the plateauing light-vehicle market in North America, as Ford and GM trucks are. PACCAR's trucks are massive machines built for the construction industry and for hauling goods across the country, among other uses.Image source: PACCAR.PACCAR offers investors a premium list of global brands, and it has consistently ranked as one of the largest builders of 18-wheelers. The company has also carved out a healthy niche with independent truck drivers, who are estimated to represent more than half the overall North American fleet. That matters because while some of PACCAR's competitors have sought out agreements with large fleet operators, those agreements come with lower margins since large fleets have more bargaining power. PACCAR has chosen to cater to the individual truckers, and also offers them financing help to purchase the big-ticket trucks.One reason PACCAR has successfully developed consumer loyalty with independent truck drivers is its reputation for vehicles with a longer life span. According to Morningstar.com, PACCAR's trucks have a life cycle of nine years, roughly two years longer than its peers. That justifies its pricing premium and strong brand power, and explains its relationship with independent drivers, who value those extra years of product life.PACCAR's third quarter emphasized just how good business is: The company reported a 14% increase in net sales and financial services revenue, a 35% increase in net income versus the prior year, record truck production, and record market share in Europe.But perhaps the most intriguing reason to take a deeper look at PACCAR stock this month is its dividend.What's interesting about PACCAR is its hefty extra cash dividend. Let's take last year as an example: On Dec. 5, 2017, the company declared a $1.20-per-share extra cash dividend payable to stockholders of record as of Dec. 14, 2017 -- that compared with its $0.25 quarterly dividend during 2017.And this year will bring a similar payout, with PACCAR announcing on Tuesday it would increase its current $0.28 quarterly dividend by 14% to $0.32. In addition, there will be a cash dividend of $2 per share payable on Jan. 4, 2019, to shareholders of record at the close of business on Dec. 14, 2018. That means that in order to receive the dividend, you need to have purchased the stock early enough to be treated as a shareholder of record on Dec. 14. Based on current exchange rules, the ex-dividend date for the special dividend should be Dec. 13, meaning that you need to buy the stock by the previous trading day -- Dec. 12 -- in order to get paid.PACCAR's $0.32 regular quarterly dividend, a yield of 2.1% currently, isn't going to jump off the page if you are an investor searching for larger yields. But when you add in the $2 extra cash dividend to its $1.28 regular dividend, it essentially provides investors a 5.5% yield at current prices, and most investors remain unaware of this sleeping dividend giant!In a press release, executive chairman Mark Pigott said:Business is good, as shown by its strong third-quarter, and its special dividend provides incentive for investors to scoop up shares while they trade at a modest 9.6 P/E. To continue rewarding investors, the company will focus on using its strong balance sheet and profits to not only pay a special dividend, but to also invest in new and expanded facilities and innovative technologies in electric, hybrid, and other alternative-power trucks. And as e-commerce continues to boost the demand for shipping goods across the country, trucks will continue to haul much of the load.Image source: PACCAR's October third-quarter presentation.If the company can continue to develop products that last longer than its competitors, and build on its premium-brand image, it will thrive. And thanks to its overlooked extra cash dividend, PACCAR might just be the automotive industry's best dividend stock.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Add in one of the biggest intraday turnarounds in years, and we're left with the first positive week in the month of December.Who would've thought that on Monday!The NASDAQ jumped approximately 4% over these three-and-a-half days, while the S&P and Dow each gained more than 2.5%. These performances didn't make up for last week's sharp declines of more than 7% across the major indices, but perhaps more importantly it provided a break from the dreary sentiment that has permeated the month.Speaking of December, it's still going to be horrible with the major indices each off by approximately 10% with one more day to go on New Year's Eve.This week centered on the Wednesday rally that had the Dow surge more than 1000 points. The following day's epic, late-day rebound added another 200 points and increased hopes that the bottom of this sharp correction was finally reached. It'll be a while before we can say that for certain, but fortunately there were no humongous selloffs on Friday to deter our newfound yet cautious optimism.It was another crazy session today as the Dow dipped more than 150 points at its worst and rose over 200 at its best. The index settled with a loss of 0.33% (or about 76 points) to 23,062.4. The S&P took the same bumpy ride and finished with a slide of 0.12% to 2485.74. The NASDAQ actually finished with a slight gain of 0.08% to 6584.52.Phew! The indices held onto most of the gains from Wednesday and Thursday, which feels like it would have been an impossible feat in the middle of the month given the market's unbelievably sour mood.Fortunately, we're quickly coming to the end of this month and year. December was just a catastrophe, but 2018 will prove to be more interesting yet ultimately disappointing. We started with more new highs for stocks and seemed to be on track for a decent performance after an amazing 2017. But these last three months were more difficult than anyone could imagine.As you can see, the editors were very busy on Friday with a heavy degree of tax loss harvesting in this penultimate session of 2018. A New Year means new strategies for the portfolios, so be prepared for a lot of fresh positions as we move past the correction and onto new opportunities.What's in store for 2019? If economic data continues to be strong and we can resolve at least a few of the market's uncertainties, then stocks should be able to get back on track in the New Year. Despite this positive week, stocks are still super cheap after the correction and provide fertile ground for value investors. On Friday, Tracey picked up truck manufacturer PACCAR (PCAR), which now enjoys all the classic value fundamentals after sliding 21% year-to-date. The company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate for seven straight quarters and earnings are expected to rise 44% this year. Therefore, PCAR is one of those companies with the desirable combination of growth AND value. It also has a history of returning money to shareholders. The great cash flow and experienced management team has the editor thinking that PCAR will be a great position in the current environment. Read the full write-up for a lot more on this new pick. The portfolio is getting back into a couple of names that got wrecked during the correction, and are now even more attractive. Shares of AxoGen (AXGN) plunged 45% after Kevin sold this nerve repair solutions developer in October for a tax-loss. Analysts expect growth of more than 40% in Q4 and 35% in 2019, and one bank just reiterated their $55 price target. A recent short-seller attack has pulled this innovative name under $20\u2026 and the editor pounced.Longer-term subscribers know how much Kevin appreciates Align Technology (ALGN), the maker of Invisalign teeth straighteners. He was certainly disappointed when having to sell the name this month for a 35% loss - after a 148% gain earlier in the year -- but several positive catalysts have lined up now, including a potential double-bottom on the chart. Plus, it is no longer a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and is still expected to grow sales by 25%-30% in 2019 and EPS by 20-25%. Time to get back in! Read a lot more about these moves in the full write-up. Has the market reached bottom or not? No one knows for sure, but Brian Bolan is making a bet that it has. The editor added a lot of leverage on Friday by picking up FANG+ Index 3X Leveraged ETN (FNGU). This note gives the portfolio exposure to some of the biggest names in technology. How big? It holds positions in all FAANGs (for course), as well as Baidu, NVIDIA, Alibaba, Tesla and Twitter. Each have a 10% position. If the bottom is in, then Brian sees this as being a huge winner for the service. However, he suggests starting with a smaller position since it will plummet if there's more downside. You could always add more later. Read the full write-up for more. Cloud-based Attunity (ATTU) jumped to nearly $24 earlier this month from $9 in April, but has since dipped under its 50-day moving average. Last time this company moved below that MA, it jumped sharply higher afterward. Dave thinks it's worth a shot to see if history repeats itself. It's also worth noting that ATTU is part of a space in the top 12% of the Zacks Industry Rank. The editor put the portfolio's remaining cash position into the name.

Shares have added about 9.1% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Paccar due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.PACCAR's third-quarter 2018 earnings were $1.55 per share, up from $1.14 recorded in the year-ago quarter. Earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.50. Results were aided by robust global truck deliveries and aftermarket sales.PACCAR posted quarterly consolidated net sales and revenues of $5.76 billion. Its adjusted revenues were $5.42 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of revenues was $5.5 billion.Revenues from the Truck, Parts and Other segment increased to $5.42 billion in third-quarter 2018 from $4.73 billion in third-quarter 2017. The segment's pre-tax income increased to $573.6 million from $502.2 million recorded a year ago.Revenues from the Financial Services segment rose to $339.9 million from $328.2 million a year ago. Pre-tax income increased to $78.8 million from $70.6 million in the year-ago quarter.PACCAR's cash and marketable debt securities amounted to $3.79 billion as of Sep 30, 2018, compared with $3.62 billion as of Dec 31, 2017.In the United States and Canada, Class 8 truck industry retail sales are anticipated to be 280,000-290,000 vehicles in 2018, up 31% from the 2017 figure. For 2019, this is anticipated to be 280,000-310,000 vehicles.In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.At this time, Paccar has a nice Growth Score of B, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Estimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Paccar has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Nevertheless, we know that our readers all have their own perspectives, so we are always looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong picks.Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Zacks has developed the innovative Style Scores system to highlight stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will be interested in stocks with great grades in the \"Value\" category. When paired with a high Zacks Rank, \"A\" grades in the Value category are among the strongest value stocks on the market today.One stock to keep an eye on is Paccar (PCAR). PCAR is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 9.84, which compares to its industry's average of 11.06. Over the past year, PCAR's Forward P/E has been as high as 17.87 and as low as 8.90, with a median of 11.43.We also note that PCAR holds a PEG ratio of 0.91. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. PCAR's industry currently sports an average PEG of 1.51. Over the past 52 weeks, PCAR's PEG has been as high as 1.79 and as low as 0.82, with a median of 1.15.We should also highlight that PCAR has a P/B ratio of 2.34. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks solid versus its industry's average P/B of 2.56. Within the past 52 weeks, PCAR's P/B has been as high as 3.45 and as low as 2.10, with a median of 2.70.Finally, we should also recognize that PCAR has a P/CF ratio of 6.54. This metric focuses on a firm's operating cash flow and is often used to find stocks that are undervalued based on the strength of their cash outlook. PCAR's current P/CF looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 6.82. Over the past year, PCAR's P/CF has been as high as 11.90 and as low as 5.86, with a median of 7.64.These are only a few of the key metrics included in Paccar's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now. When factoring in the strength of its earnings outlook, PCAR looks like an impressive value stock at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's \"Value\" category. Stocks with both \"A\" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One company to watch right now is Paccar (PCAR). PCAR is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 9.84. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 11.06. Over the past year, PCAR's Forward P/E has been as high as 17.87 and as low as 8.90, with a median of 11.43.Investors will also notice that PCAR has a PEG ratio of 0.91. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. PCAR's industry currently sports an average PEG of 1.51. Over the past 52 weeks, PCAR's PEG has been as high as 1.79 and as low as 0.82, with a median of 1.15.Another valuation metric that we should highlight is PCAR's P/B ratio of 2.34. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This company's current P/B looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/B of 2.56. Over the past year, PCAR's P/B has been as high as 3.45 and as low as 2.10, with a median of 2.70.Finally, we should also recognize that PCAR has a P/CF ratio of 6.54. This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 6.82. PCAR's P/CF has been as high as 11.90 and as low as 5.86, with a median of 7.64, all within the past year.These are just a handful of the figures considered in Paccar's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that PCAR is an impressive value stock right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

With transaction prices rising, as are interest rates and tariffs, there could be more pressure on sales. The good news? Despite a slowing sales market and potential headwinds, there are still buys in the auto sector for savvy investors. For different reasons, which we'll cover below,  . (NASDAQ: PCAR) ,  (NYSE: RACE) , and  (NYSE: APTV) are all intriguing stocks.Paccar might not be a company you've heard of. It manufactures and sells light, medium, and heavy-duty trucks and related parts -- think massive commercial semi-trucks -- under brands you have a better chance of recognizing: Kenworth, Peterbilt, and DAF.Image source: PACCAR.Even if those brands don't ring a bell, they definitely do in the heavy-equipment industry, and Paccar has built a strong brand image based on the high quality of its products. And don't let the company's  fool you; it was hurt by the automotive and broader industrials sell-off. In fact, the company posted a solid third quarter with revenues moving 14% higher compared to the prior year, and earnings per share checking in at $1.55 compared to the prior year's $1.14 -- also higher than analysts' estimates calling for $1.50 per share.Beyond its strong revenue and earnings driven by strong global truck demand, the company had record truck production, record market share in Europe, and excellent aftermarket parts performance. Essentially, while the stock might hurt from a broader auto and industrial sell-off, its commercial truck business is thriving. The good news is that trucking is already a dominant mode of transporting goods, responsible for moving 71% of total U.S. freight tonnage hauled, compared to 13% by rail, 10% by pipeline, and 6% by water, according to the company's third-quarter presentation. And its trucking dominance should continue as the  requires more goods to be shipped around the globe.A slowing light-vehicle automotive market shouldn't concern long-term Aptiv investors too much. That's because Aptiv is focusing on developing and producing technology for the future of active safety, autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and connectivity. In other words, the future is driving toward driverless cars. Aptiv will develop technology to make that happen sooner, and also develop technology for the opportunities surrounding driverless vehicles.While Aptiv's stock might get pulled down with a broader automotive decline as it's currently tied to selling products to major OEMs, investors should focus on its future addressable market. In 2017, Aptiv estimated its addressable market to be roughly $15 billion. Through advancements in automated driving, connected services, and adjacent markets, Aptiv should unlock an additional $35 billion in incremental addressable market opportunities, to a total of $50 billion, by 2025.Image source: Getty Images.In addition to the technology Aptiv develops, investors should be intrigued by the partnerships it's fostering. Take for example Aptiv's partnership with ride-hailing company Lyft in Las Vegas. The pilot program launched a fleet of 30 BMW sedans with Aptiv's self-driving prototype system and connected the dots with consumers through Lyft's ride-hailing platform. The partnership celebrated its 5,000th public ride in August and proved that consumers were indeed  . The good news is that the average passenger rating was 4.96 out of 5 stars, and 96% of passengers say they would use the self-driving ride again.The road to driverless vehicles will be a bumpy ride, but investors willing to hold on for the long haul should be well positioned, as Aptiv's future will be more based on driverless technology than the cyclical light-vehicle sales market.Are you tired of auto stocks trading in the dumps with paltry valuations and attached too heavily to cyclical sales? Are you tired of auto manufacturers that are forced to do anything, including mounting incentives that can erode profits, to sell vehicles and protect market share? If you answered yes, then Ferrari is absolutely a stock to check out as it often trades at premium, luxury-good valuation multiples, and has only methodically allowed its sales to increase at rates that will protect the exclusivity of its brand image and pricing premium. That pricing power, ultra-premium brand image, and exclusivity can be seen in its extraordinary operating margins, compared to automakers more tied to the cyclical mainstream sales market. data by You might be asking yourself, if Ferrari limits the sales of its premium vehicles, what growth story can it offer investors? Management is glad you asked, and it has two distinct opportunities to fuel growth. First, we have to remember Ferrari is a global luxury automaker, and that the number of wealthy consumers in China literally gives the automaker a once-in-a-generation chance to boost sales dramatically without any concern of erasing its exclusivity, simply due to the booming number of wealthy Chinese consumers.Ferrari also recognizes there's a unique opportunity to sell more limited-edition vehicles exclusively to its best customers that likely already own a handful of its vehicles. Of course, these will likely sell in minuscule numbers, but because the price tags are so outrageous -- think to the tune of seven figures -- they can still boost bottom-line profits.To take advantage of those two opportunities for growth, Ferrari plans to launch 15 new products between now and 2022,  . The automaker boasts incredible margins, is less tied to the cyclical light-vehicle sales markets with its wealthy consumers being less impacted by downturns, has a brand image few companies can compare to, and can increase its top and bottom lines significantly without damaging its exclusivity and pricing power -- a pretty compelling growth story not impacted by the current sales plateau.Ultimately, a vast majority of the automotive sector will get pulled down with North America's sales market topping out, including Detroit automakers and a plethora of suppliers and other businesses. Since Paccar has set itself above the competition with quality and isn't concerned about selling passenger cars, Aptiv is focused on driverless vehicle technology for decades to come, and Ferrari's brand is so exclusive without negatively impacting its business, these three stocks remain buys regardless of a plateauing North American market.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has quadrupled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Ferrari wasn't one of them!

Per the earnings record, it beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 12.1%.In the past three months, shares of Copart have underperformed the  it belongs to. The stock has moved down 17.3% compared with 15.5% decline recorded by the industry during the period. | Let's see, how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement.Copart has been growing its network of facilities to manage increasing volume. Apart from North America, the company has been expanding its footprint in Germany and western Europe. During the to-be-reported quarter, it planned to open numerous locations, both in the domestic and international markets. Further, strong used-car price environment will help Copart drive its revenues.However, continuous rise in general and administrative (G&A) expenses is hampering the company's margin. This rise is primarily due to the acquisition of National Powersport Auctions and the buyout of AVK - a Finland-based salvage auto auction company - in March 2018. A similar trend is expected to continue in the coming quarters, owing to inflation and increase in Copart's business complexity.Additionally, the company's exposure to international markets makes it vulnerable to currency fluctuations and country-specific policy threats.Our proven model does not conclusively predict earnings beat for Copart this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

If that's the case, here are three Motley Fool contributors with stocks you should consider in November:  (NASDAQ: PCAR) ,  (NYSE: GM) , and  (NYSE: SYY) . If you're looking for top dividend stocks to buy this month, PACCAR is an intriguing -- and often overlooked -- option for investors to check out. If the name doesn't ring a bell, PACCAR is a global leader in the design, manufacture, and consumer support of light-, medium-, and heavy-duty trucks under its Kenworth, Peterbilt, and DAF names.One reason PACCAR is an intriguing dividend option during November is the timing of its special dividend. PACCAR is often overlooked as a dividend stock because its regular dividend yield is only 1.92%, too small for many investors screening for stock ideas. But the company also adds a special annual dividend that rewards in-the-know investors.Using the  , the company announced on Dec. 5, 2017, that it would pay investors on record at the close of business on Dec. 14, 2017, a special dividend of $1.20. That move more than doubled the dividend investors received over the full year from its regular dividend alone, which at the time was a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share. Investors who buy shares in November should again be rewarded with a hefty special dividend in early January 2019.Beyond its special dividend, the company is coming off a strong third quarter. Even with driver shortages and supplier constraints, the company delivered a record number of trucks during the third quarter, just topping the previous record set during the second quarter of 2018 -- business is good right now. Management also expects margins to improve during the fourth quarter as supplier constraints ease in the near term. All in all, if investors are looking for a company with strong business results and a special dividend on the way, take a look at PACCAR. If you're looking for a dividend stock that's in a great position to reap further gains, look no further than General Motors. The legacy automaker offers a well-funded dividend yield at 4.2% and is dirt cheap at a P/E of just 5.3.Right now looks like a great time to buy GM stock. In addition to its valuation and yield, there are a number of catalysts that should provide tailwinds for the company in the coming years, and its low price and stable profits make it an excellent stock to ride out the current market volatility as rising interest rates squeeze higher-priced growth stocks.General Motors is also fresh off a  , as the Chevy maker delivered an adjusted per-share profit of $1.87, up 42% from a year ago, and crushing estimates at $1.25.

As a distributor to the food service industry, Sysco is effectively a royalty on restaurant sales. The company offers a one-stop shop for restaurateurs, delivering regular shipments of foods, napkins, straws, and more that restaurants need on a recurring basis to stay in business.Food service distribution is a tough business, as prices for key inputs -- raw foods, diesel fuel, and so on -- can change meaningfully from day to day. As a result, quarterly profits can vary wildly, but over long time horizons, the business is remarkably profitable. Sysco's scale (annual revenue of approximately $60 billion) enables it to spread costs better than its smaller competitors, and extract better terms from its suppliers.Sysco has an impressive record as a dividend payer as a member of the exclusive list of  , companies that have consistently paid and increased their dividends for 25 consecutive years.

With the latest additions, the company will now offer services to nine boroughs along with a widened total fleet of 720 BMW and Mini cars. The newly added expansions are in Westminster, Barnet, Tower Hamlets, Southwark and Brent.Further, this German automaker had to reach agreements with separate local authorities in order to add five boroughs under its operations. Per management, the expansion in new boroughs is in sync with DriveNow's vision. It also emphasizes the company's optimism regarding London's potential.Formed through a joint venture in 2011, DriveNow is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of BMW. With over one million users, it offers car-sharing service through a fleet of 6,000 vehicles. In London, BMW's DriveNow service was launched in 2014. Apart from London, this car-sharing service is offered by the company in many European cities, consisting Vienna, Copenhagen, Brussels, Milan, Helsinki and Lisbon.However, BMW is not the first company to offer such services in London. In 2012, Daimler AG  launched its car2go business in the city. Nonetheless, it became difficult to coordinate with separate authorities across different boroughs and encourage customers to opt for car sharing services within the city. This forced Daimler to withdraw its car-sharing service car2go from London in 2014.Apart from BMW and Daimler, a few other stocks in the auto space are PACCAR Inc.  and Fox Factory Holding Corporation  .

If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 3.61% for HanesBrands Inc, 1.89% for PACCAR Inc., and 2.28% for ONE Gas, Inc..In Wednesday trading, HanesBrands Inc shares are currently up about 0.6%, PACCAR Inc. shares are up about 0.1%, and ONE Gas, Inc. shares are up about 0.3% on the day.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Chicago, IL - November 16, 2018 - Zacks Value Trader is a podcast hosted weekly by Zacks Stock Strategist Tracey Ryniec. Every week, Tracey will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life. To listen to the podcast, click here:(  )Welcome to Episode #117 of the Value Investor PodcastEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks  , shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.The stock market volatility of October has continued into November. But don't let a pullback scare you out of stocks. Value investors rush in looking for deals.But if the small caps are too volatile for you, what about the large caps?They've outperformed the last few years and some have seen a big sell off.To find the best big cap deals, Tracey created a basic screen with just three components.She looked for stocks that were Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buys), which usually means they have rising earnings estimates. And coming on the heals of earnings season, the great Rank usually means these companies have reported solid quarters. Analysts are raising estimates, either because the company raised guidance or the quarter was just that good.To find the big caps, the screen looked for stocks with market caps over $10 billion.For value, a forward P/E under 10 was initially used but only 25 stocks came through the screen. That was a little too narrow, so a P/E of 13 and under was tried.That yielded 49 stocks, with some intriguing names.1.  is a large integrated oil company. An oil stock? Right now? It's certainly cheap. It has a forward P/E of just 11.5 but earnings are expected to be up 89% in 2018 and another 9.4% in 2019. It also pays a really juicy dividend, yielding 6%.2.  is the global drugstore chain. It's one of the few stocks on this list that is actually up over the last few months and is trading near its 52-week high. But it's still got an attractive valuation with a forward P/E of 12.5.3.  has transformed itself from a products company into a gaming and content company as its PlayStation heats up heading into the holidays. Shares are off their earlier highs and the stock is still cheap, with a forward P/E of just 11.4.4.  is a financial services giant operating in 40 countries in insurance, annuities, employee benefits and asset management. Shares are down over 9% year-to-date. It's dirt cheap with a forward P/E of 8.4. It even has an attractive PEG ratio of just 0.7. A PEG under 1.0 usually means a company has both growth and value, a rare combination.5.  makes trucks, truck engines and the aftermarket parts and services. In the third quarter it saw record truck production and record market share in Europe. But did Wall Street like it? No. Shares are down 20% year-to-date on worries of a global recession. Shares are cheap with a forward P/E of just 9.5 and a PEG ratio of 0.9.Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's \"Value\" category. Stocks with both \"A\" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.One company to watch right now is Paccar (PCAR). PCAR is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock is trading with a P/E ratio of 9.41, which compares to its industry's average of 10.18. Over the past 52 weeks, PCAR's Forward P/E has been as high as 17.87 and as low as 9.41, with a median of 11.89.Investors will also notice that PCAR has a PEG ratio of 0.87. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. PCAR's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 1.40. PCAR's PEG has been as high as 1.79 and as low as 0.87, with a median of 1.22, all within the past year.Finally, we should also recognize that PCAR has a P/CF ratio of 6.35. This figure highlights a company's operating cash flow and can be used to find firms that are undervalued when considering their impressive cash outlook. This company's current P/CF looks solid when compared to its industry's average P/CF of 6.37. Over the past 52 weeks, PCAR's P/CF has been as high as 12.39 and as low as 6.35, with a median of 7.87.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that Paccar is likely undervalued currently. And when considering the strength of its earnings outlook, PCAR sticks out at as one of the market's strongest value stocks.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

But taking investment decisions solely based on quarterly performance is not wise. Though earnings performance is a good enough indicator of a stock's prospects, identifying future growth drivers is not always an easy task.Therefore, this is where expert advice comes in handy. One way to do this is to follow broker recommendations.Since brokers are in direct communication with companies, they have deeper understanding into what's happening in it. Also, they analyze fundamentals of the company and place them against the present economic backdrop to figure out how the stock will fare as an investment. Further, brokers have more insight of the overall industry and economy.Brokers analyze a company's publicly available financial statements, attend conference calls and communicate directly with top management. Additionally, they even talk to customers to understand what they like or dislike about the products and services offered by the company.So, there's all-inclusive research behind the rating of a broker on a company's stock. So, following what the majority of brokers are saying about a stock can help investors understand its potential easily. Naturally, when an analyst upgrades a stock, one can easily rely on it.Nevertheless, it's not right to depend only on brokers' upgrades to build your investment portfolio. One must take into consideration certain other factors to ensure strong returns.We have a screening strategy that will help in your search for potential winners: The screen selects stocks that have witnessed broker rating upgrades of 1% or more over the last four weeks. The stocks must be trading above $5. A large trading volume guarantees that the stock is easily tradable. No matter whether market conditions are good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) have a proven record of success. You can see  . of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are five out of 15 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Bellevue, WA,  designs, manufactures and distributes light, medium and heavy-duty commercial trucks.

For the WisdomTree U.S. LargeCap Dividend Fund ETF (Symbol: DLN), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $105.13 per unit.With DLN trading at a recent price near $93.08 per unit, that means that analysts see 12.95% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of DLN's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Mondelez International Inc (Symbol: MDLZ), PACCAR Inc. (Symbol: PCAR), and Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. (Symbol: COG). Although MDLZ has traded at a recent price of $41.16/share, the average analyst target is 19.32% higher at $49.11/share. Similarly, PCAR has 15.34% upside from the recent share price of $61.74 if the average analyst target price of $71.21/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting COG to reach a target price of $27.15/share, which is 14.09% above the recent price of $23.80.

Do the analysts have a valid justification for their targets, or are they behind the curve on recent company and industry developments? A high price target relative to a stock's trading price can reflect optimism about the future, but can also be a precursor to target price downgrades if the targets were a relic of the past.

(Symbol: PCAR) saw new options become available this week, for the December 21st expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the PCAR options chain for the new December 21st contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $55.00 strike price has a current bid of $1.95. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $55.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $53.05 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of PCAR, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $56.20/share today.Because the $55.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 61%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of PCAR stock at the current price level of $56.20/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $57.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 5.52% if the stock gets called away at the December 21st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if PCAR shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for PACCAR Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing PCAR's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $57.50 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $57.50 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Paccar was mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of PACCAR Inc., the RSI reading has hit 27.8 - by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by  currently has an average RSI of 40.7. A falling stock price - all else being equal - creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield.

(NASDAQ: PCAR)Q3 2018 Oct. 23, 2018 , Good morning, and welcome to PACCAR's Third Quarter 2018 .(Operator Instructions)I would now like to introduce Mr. Ken Hastings, PACCAR's Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Hastings, please go ahead. -- Good morning. We'd like to welcome those listening by phone and those on the webcast. My name is Ken Hastings, PACCAR's Director of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Ron Armstrong, Chief Executive Officer; Harrie Schippers, President and Chief Financial Officer; Preston Feight, Executive Vice President, and Michael Barkley, Senior Vice President and Controller.As with prior conference calls, we ask that any members of the media on the line participate in a listen-only mode. Certain information presented today will be forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties, including general economic and competitive conditions that may affect expected results. A summary of risks and uncertainties is described in more detail in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. For additional information, please see our SEC filings in the Investor Relations at paccar.com.I would now like to introduce Ron Armstrong. -- Good morning. Harrie Schippers, Preston Feight and I will update you on our excellent third quarter results. PACCAR's third quarter sales and Financial Services revenues were $5.8 billion, and third quarter net income was $545 million, a strong 9.5% after-tax return on revenue. Revenues were 14% higher and net income was 35% higher than the third quarter last year. PACCAR's Truck Division's produced a record number of trucks in the third quarter and PACCAR Parts achieved 14% revenue growth compared to the third quarter last year. I am extremely proud of our 28,000 employees that have delivered the world's highest quality trucks, parts and financial services to our customers worldwide.PACCAR delivered 47,800 trucks during the third quarter, 3% higher than the second quarter. Increased build rates in North America were partially offset by fewer build days in Europe due to DAF's regular summer shutdown.Truck and Parts' gross margins were 14.1% in the third quarter. Truck pricing was good with price realization comparable to the second quarter at about 3%. Costs were impacted by parts shortages from a small number of North American suppliers, including a few affected by Hurricane Florence. As a result of these part shortages, we incurred additional material and labor costs. Our Tier 1 suppliers are investing in additional capacity and working closely with Tier 2 suppliers to meet PACCAR factory delivery requirements. We expect the situation to normalize in the near term.Our Peterbilt and Kenworth teams in the US, Canada and Mexico did a fantastic job of managing record third quarter production and achieving the highest operating margins in the industry. In the fourth quarter, we're expecting 4% to 8% higher deliveries compared to the third quarter, primarily due to an increase in the number of production days in Europe and higher daily build rates. Truck and Parts gross margins are estimated to be higher in the fourth quarter at around 14.5%.Preston Feight will now provide an update on DAF, PACCAR Parts and PACCAR Financial Services. -- Thanks, Ron. Our 2018 forecast is for Europe's greater than 16-tonne market to be in the range of 310,000 to 320,000 units, reflecting continued strong demand and growing European economies. We expect 2019 to be another excellent year, with the market in the range of 290,000 to 320,000 trucks. The eurozone's GDP growth expectation for this year is 2%, with 2019 projected at a similar level. Freight transport activity on German highways is at record levels, up 3.5% this year. DAF has had an incredible year in 2018. DAF XF and CF trucks, which were honored as International Truck of the Year 2018, achieved European above 16-tonne market share of 16.6% year-to-date compared to 15.1% in the same period last year. DAF is making great progress toward its goal of 20% share.PACCAR's Parts business generated strong quarterly revenues of $960 million, 14% higher than the same period last year. Parts' quarterly pre-tax income was $189 million, 24% higher than last year. The growing number of PACCAR trucks and engines in operation and consistent investments in parts distribution capacity and customer focus technologies drove these results. We are pleased to have opened our new 160,000 square-foot parts distribution center in Toronto this month. We expect part sales to grow an additional 5% to 8% next year.PACCAR Financial Services' third quarter pre-tax income increased 12% to $79 million compared to $71 million a year ago. The portfolio, which was a record $14.1 billion this quarter, continued to perform well. Kenworth and Peterbilt Class 8 used truck values increased more than 10% compared to the third quarter of last year. Kenworth and Peterbilt truck resale values commanded 10% to 20% premium over competitors' vehicles. PACCAR Parts and PACCAR Financial Services profit contributions are much larger than they were 15 years ago. These businesses are inherently less cyclical than the sale of new trucks, and their consistent profitability enhances PACCAR's financial results throughout the business cycle.Harrie Schippers will now provide an update on Kenworth, and Peterbilt, and PACCAR investments. -- Thanks, Preston. We have raised our estimate of retail sales for this year's US and Canadian Class 8 truck market to a range of 280,000 to 290,000 units. In 2019, we expect the US and Canada Class 8 truck market to expand further, to a range of 280,000 to 310,000 vehicles. US economic and freight indicators are very strong, with 3% GDP growth, and nearly 4% industrial production growth expected this year. Freight tonnage growth has been a robust 7.5% year-to-date. We head into 2019 with great momentum, including the industry's best products and factory visibility that extends into the second half of next year.The record truck orders this year are driven by a strong economy. In the past, the surge in orders was often driven by a prebuy related to an emissions change. Customers across all segments are experiencing strong demand from growing freight volume, very high fleet utilization and strong pricing. Customers are also benefiting from the industry-leading operating efficiency provided by DAF, Peterbilt and Kenworthtrucks, as well as superior aftermarket support from PACCAR Parts and PACCAR Financial Services.PACCAR is creating innovative products and technologies for the future. DAF showcased several advanced powertrain vehicles at the IAA Truck Show last month. The DAF CF Electric, LF Electric and CF hybrid trucks are entering field testing with customers. We look forward to customer demands for electric and hybrid powertrains in certain applications such as refuse, urban delivery and forward operations. Longer term, electric vehicles will be competitive in more applications. While we are preparing for the long-term by making investments in alternative powertrain technologies, we do expect diesel to remain the most efficient powertrain technology in heavy truck applications for the foreseeable future. We estimate capital spending of $425 million to $475 million, and R&D expenses of $300 million to $310 million this year. In 2019, we are planning for increased capital investments of $525 million to $575 million, and increased R&D expenses of $300 million to $330 million. These investments will develop the next generation of Kenworth, Peterbilt, and DAF trucks, enhance PACCAR's diesel and alternative powertrain technologies, and add additional capacity and efficiency to the company's manufacturing and parts distribution facilities.During the third quarter, we repurchased $59 million of PACCAR stock. With $241 million remaining of the $300 million authorization approved by the PACCAR board in July.Thank you. We'd be pleased to answer your questions.(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Joel Tiss with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. -- Wow, I'm a little shocked here. I usually don't even get on. How are you? -- We love you. -- Yes. Anyway, So can you just explain, maybe philosophically, the gap between very strong truck shipments and the driver shortages? And is that kind of setting up cancellations in the future? Or how are all these fleets absorbing all these new trucks? -- I think they're -- the number of trucks is -- it's not at sort of the historical peak levels, but it's strong and they're getting the increased operating efficiency. And we've seen -- there's additional demand. We've seen more used trucks also being sold, and the utilization of the fleets now are at record levels, so they really show no issues of being able to absorb the trucks. And I think what we hear is that there would be even more trucks purchased if there were drivers to put in the seats. -- And then, can you just, like, help us maybe look forward a little bit? And there's some new emissions standards coming, and then, there's a particle emission standard coming in 2023. Is there enough sort of advancements and changes that are likely to come, say, over the next 5 years, to kind of keep the run rate of truck demand at a higher level? Or do you think the normal cyclicality that we see, especially in North America, is going to be more the way that the next 5 years look? -- I think the capability of engines for the last couple of iterations has been to improve fuel efficiency, which translates into lower total operating costs for our customers, and that won't change. As we look forward, we have greenhouse gas reductions in 2021, 2024, and 2027, in North America. Europe is close to proposing some limitations beginning in 2025 and 2030. So we're going to continue to innovate and improve the efficiency of the diesel engines for the foreseeable future. In addition, obviously, we're working on alternative powertrains and those will be attractive for certain applications, which I think, Harrie mentioned those in his comments, that applications like refuse, port, et cetera, there could be a reasonable business case for those particular applications. -- And then, sorry, just last one. So do you think that those forces are strong enough to be able to change the shape of the historic cycle? Or it's not a fair question? -- I think, in the past, the cycles, we're very much focused on soot and NOx emissions with no benefits for our customers. So future cycles or future emission legislation is all about greenhouse gas reduction. So yes, there will be cost increases for a new technology to be added, but it brings a benefit for our customers to enjoy. -- Okay. All right, thank you very much. -- Thanks, Joel.Your next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. -- Can you folks talk about where the supply base stands today in terms of catching up with the really robust order cycle we've had? And at which point do you expect industry lead times to try to stabilize and maybe start to come down toward your historical target, 10 to 12-week lead times? -- I think, from my perspective, the supply base is making progress. As I mentioned, they're making some investments, working with all levels of the supply base Tier 1, Tier 2. The Hurricane Florence, we have a couple of suppliers who are located in the Carolinas. And unfortunately, due to the time they had to take to shut down, and some of the impacts of floods, et cetera, that had an impact. And so we're working through each one of those, and we're, as I said, we expect in the near term, we'll work through those. I had a discussion with one of our suppliers yesterday. A good discussion, good healthy discussion, and so everybody's got the same interest at heart. And so we'll work through it, probably, during this quarter. -- And so from a margin standpoint, you folks had margin in the high 14% range at the gross margin line and the first half of '18. Once you work through those supply chain issues, can you get back toward that level of gross margin performance that we saw in the first half of this year, before the supply chain issues started to play out? -- Yes, I think with -- certainly, the possibility is there Jerry. -- Okay. And then, your retail market share is up significantly in Europe. Can you just give us a sense for where your order market share is tracking? Is that retail momentum set to continue based on how the orders look heading into the fourth quarter? -- We don't get order market data. We only know what we have done. The DAF order percentage has been strong this year with year-over-year increases. And so we had ended next year with a good solid backlog and expect to be able to continue at our current pace for the -- at least for the near term. -- And lastly, can you talk about how -- if a significant known input supply basis from China for your sourcing strategy. And whether we should expect a pickup in inflation in early '19 as the tariffs move to 25% from 10%? -- Yes. Our team has done a good job of evaluating the impacts of tariffs and other trade arrangements. And I would tell you the effect is hundreds of dollars per truck, and so it's not a major item, but it's something, obviously, that just like other cost increases that -- where we manage that into our costing and pricing projections, and work with that with our customers on quotes for future deliveries. -- Okay. I appreciate the discussion. Thank you. -- Absolutely.Your next question comes from Ann Duignan with JP Morgan. -- Hi. Good morning. -- Good morning. -- I have to dig in, find a few questions remaining. Can you talk a little bit about, we had heard during the quarter that a lot of dealers were ordering for inventory because lead times were extending, not necessarily PACCAR's dealers, although one of them was a PACCAR -- a Kenworth dealer. Can you talk a little bit about where your dealer inventories are versus, maybe, historical norm? And is there any risk they are ordering to inventory, and that, that could cause a significant downturn when the market rolls over? -- No. We're really in good shape dealer inventory-wise. We -- I think, we comment, historically, that if we're in the 60-day range in terms of inventory, plus or minus, and that's right where we're at in North America as well as in Europe. So the dealer inventories are in excellent shape as we sit here today. -- Okay. That's good to hear. I appreciate that. And then, specifically, on the margin -- gross margin for Q4. I know once you get all these supply chain issue is resolved, that the probability is that as long as volumes are, gross margins will go back to the 14.5% to 15%, but specifically, for Q4, should we anticipate that supply chain issues will still weigh on gross margins? -- Yes. We, at this point, we think something around 14.5% is probably a reasonable expectation for the fourth quarter. -- Okay, I'll leave it there and get back in queue. Thank you. -- Okay. Thanks, Ann.Your next question comes from Alex Potter with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. -- Hi, guys. Thanks. I was wondering if you could comment, there's been a couple of announcements recently, I'm sure you're aware of FDR catalyst and things of this nature degrading over time. Just wanted to see what your confidence is that there won't be any charges coming from PACCAR projecting similar issues? -- Yes. We're not aware of a similar deterioration effect in our aftertreatment, but that's subject to ongoing testing, and there's no assurance, but at this point, we're -- we feel good about our approach and our -- the chemistry that we've used in our aftertreatment system. -- Okay. It's good to hear. Tax rate was a bit low in the quarter, just wondering if you could provide any guidance regarding what we should be modeling for the next quarter and year, I guess? -- I think Michael can address that. Yes. -- Yes, we have a couple of positive onetime items in the quarter that we don't expect to repeat. So you should expect a range of 22% to 23% going forward. -- Okay. That's very helpful. And then, last one, I guess, if you could just comment on -- you mentioned that the portfolio is still doing really well with the FinCo. Used vehicle pricing is doing OK, it looks like. If you could just provide, maybe, a quick overhaul over the next year, we've got a changing interest rate environment, any commentary you might give around those likely performance of that segment would be helpful. -- Yes. As long as the freight demand is there, and we're at record levels of freight activity in both North America and Europe, that, obviously, provides a great opportunity for our customers to earn a profit. And we're seeing that, the past dues continue to be at about 50 basis points, really historical low levels. So there's nothing that we see in the near term that is going to impact the performance of the portfolio. We've -- our teams continue to exercise very prudent credit underwriting and taking advantage of data analytics tools to continue to enhance that capability on the way forward.Your next question comes from Seth Weber with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. -- Hi, thanks. This is Brendan on for Seth. Just going back to your dealer inventories. Are you doing anything, extra vetting or anything like that, to discourage any double ordering there? -- No. We monitor the level of order intake for customer orders or stock orders. And so our divisions are very adept at sort of managing that and ensuring that what we have in the backlog is buildable to the best extent that we can. -- And the other thing we're doing is we're making sure that the customers are putting deposits down on vehicles so that we understand the relationship to the customers well enough to know when it's a serious order or not a serious order. So we're carefully managing the firmness of the backlog. -- Okay. And I apologize if I missed this, but could you give a color on your outlook for the Brazilian market? And what's happening with your market share there? -- Yes. The market share continues to tick up. We've progressively increased build rates throughout this year. We have one more increase coming in the month of December. And so we're going to deliver about 2,300 trucks this year, and that the build rate that we'll end this year, there's no reason at this point to say that, that won't progress. We'll probably deliver over 3,000 trucks. Next year, and so from a market perspective, Ken, you have some thoughts? -- Yes, I do. So for 2018, the above 16-tonne truck market, we expect to be 45,000 to 55,000 vehicles. And next year we're expecting 60,000 to 70,000 vehicles. -- Okay, great. Thank you. -- Thanks you.Your next question comes from Andy Casey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. -- Thanks a lot. Good morning out there. -- Good morning, Andy. -- Just wanted to take your temperature, the really strong order intake that we've seen, how far into 2019 are your lead times? We're hearing some of the products are quite extended. And if we assume supply chain normalization occurs, how quickly do you think some of those lead times can be reduced? -- The backlog is extended. It's longer than it has been for some time. And as we always do, we work closely with our suppliers to manage their capabilities, our capabilities, so that we get the right support of our customers and we can meet their delivery needs. So it's the clarity of sort of how that progresses is a little bit fuzzy at this point, but I suspect supply base will continue to improve its capability to deliver in the coming months, for sure. -- Okay. Thanks, Ron. And I think it may have been Preston talking about deposits for orders to manage the firmness of the backlog. Is that something PACCAR has done in the past? -- Yes. We do some of that. And then, we also -- there's a cancellation policy that we put into effect, that cancellation fee that is there to require that the orders are buildable and more firm. -- Okay. And then, just on pricing, first, on Truck and then on Parts. Are the orders, given that you've taken deposits and you have that cancellation fee, are the orders in backlog price protected? Or for some of these orders that are way out, can you actually increase prices? -- We typically -- we've got a commitment at a price. We've factored in our best estimate of what we think future costs are going to look like when we deliver those trucks and so we have a pretty good feel about what we think the realization will be when we deliver those trucks. -- We have the pricing in place for the first half of next year, for North America. And like we said, the backlog is already extending into the second half of next year. So with debt pricing, cancellation fees, we feel clearly confident that dealers will only put in those orders that they really need. -- Okay. Thank you, Harrie. And then, skipping over to Parts. I mean, the tariff impact, if it's going to impact anything, maybe it's there, but should we think about any increases that you may see within the Parts' portfolio? Should we expect that just to be offset by pricing? And if so, how much of the, I believe, I heard 5% to 8% growth in 2019, is unit volume? -- Yes. I'd say most of that is unit volume growth, and our teams -- I'd look very closely at the components that are affected by tariffs and manage that. And our expectation is, generally, that will be passed on to the market. -- Okay. Thank you very much. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. -- Hi, good morning.I guess, a couple of questions. One, obviously, the market is very concerned that Truck is peaking, the stocks are pricing that in, and then, you made the comment earlier, people probably underappreciate your Parts contribution, et cetera. So is there any way you can help us frame as you're thinking about sort of potentially the next downturn in earnings? What are the factors that would allow PACCAR to contribute -- I'm sorry, to earn up higher trough relative to where we were? And how you think about share repurchase in that context, just given where your stock is today versus your view on the market? -- Yes. I think our factories, we continue to make investments in our facilities to improve efficiency. You've been to our factories. You know the efficiency that we have in our factories and we continue to try and move the needle to manage our cost is the -- the lowest cost manufacturer during all phases of the cycle. So that doesn't change, and then, we'll continue to make those investments. Obviously, the lower tax rate has a significant incremental effect on earnings versus a 31% rate historically versus a 22% to 23% rate. Currently, that changes a little bit depending on where the earnings come from, but that's a significant enhancement from what we've seen historically. Parts and finance are making sizable contributions to the profitability of our operations. So we excel during the cycles, and we will continue to excel. We can manage our cost structure better than anybody in the industry. -- Okay. And then, just when you talk about, I know you have fairly good visibility extending into beyond the second half of 2019 or whatever. I mean, is that fairly broad-based, small versus large fleets or occasional? Can you just talk about if it's broad-based or specific to sort of one type of customer? -- Yes. It is broad based. I mean, obviously, the fleets are probably better at getting their orders in earlier, and there's probably some smaller guys that will come. And so -- but our teams are closely managing backlog to make sure that we meet the needs of all of our customers from small to -- sort of smallest to the biggest. -- Okay. Thank you. I'll get back in queue. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. Your line is open. -- Hi. Good morning, guys. -- Hi, Steve. -- Most of my questions have been answered, but I wonder if you have a sense of the supplier issues that you saw in the quarter? Any broad sense of what that might have impacted your gross margin? -- It's one of those deals that it's really tough to -- there are some things you can quantify specifically, others, are a little bit vague. But I have a guess, probably, 50 basis points would be the effect of -- on overall margin for the third quarter. And so yes, it was significant. Our teams did a great job, sort of managing the schedule and managing the offline flow in our factories. And we're still managing through that, but I think we're seeing our way to the end of the tunnel. -- Okay. Super. And then as we look out into 2019, and even though maybe people are starting to think about what a downturn would look like, it seems like the 2019 outlook is actually up a bit. And I'm curious how you think we should think about profitability. Can you grow gross margin with a little more volume? And maybe a little last supplier issues and so forth? Or should we think more in the sense of gross margins being kind of flat, and then, you'll lever on SG&A? -- I think all those things are possible, and so as we think about next year, something probably in the 14% to 15% range for overall total gross margin is sort of where our heads are at currently. -- Okay. Thank you. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is open. -- Thanks. Good Afternoon. Just a couple of questions on Europe. Can you give us a little more color on the European region? Curious what your order trends are looking like if we segment the Europe into Eastern Europe, Continental, Western and then UK? -- Sure. Just talking about Europe for a second, the 16.6% share is, again, a record. Where we're seeing growth is pretty uniform. We're seeing growth throughout. We've -- a couple of points, we've become the leading import brand in Germany, which is roughly 20% of the European markets. So that's a nice accomplishment by the team in Europe. We're also seeing Eastern Europe grow as an even more important part of the sector and DAF is very strong there. We're a market leader in several countries in Eastern Europe, with growing share year-over-year, sometimes 2%, 3%, and 4%. So as the total of Europe evolves and matures, DAF is really well positioned for strong growth in the future. -- And UK, If you could comment on that? -- Well, the UK, We're the market leader in the UK. We'll continue to be the market leader. Obviously, there's some dynamics in UK with general economy, but we continue to be strong in the UK as well, which is down as a percentage of the total market. -- Okay. And then, related to Brexit, how much of your European production would you say is in the UK, maybe on a year-to-date basis? And how much is exported to Continental Europe? And if we ended up with a hard break scenario, what would you do to manage that? I mean, would you consider relocating any production? -- We have great flexibility, is one of our real strengths, is that we're able to produce a full range of products that we make in our factory in the UK at Leyland, which is something that was a unique advantage for us. So we can make those medium duties as well as all the heavy duties in the UK. So we're well positioned for any kind of scenarios that would happen, hard or soft. And then, we have great, obviously, manufacturing capacities in our main plants at Eindhoven. So we're watching what's happening there, but we feel very well positioned. -- Yes. We -- when I was over there several weeks ago, Preston and I met with the team, and really a good discussion about what the range of outcomes could be. And so we're prepared to manage that, whatever the outcome might be. -- Okay. I'll follow up there. Then, just one last clarification on the emissions degradation. Are you guys using the same suppliers that your European peer is -- that announced their issues? -- No, no. -- Okay. Thank you. -- Yes.Your next question comes from Ross Gilardi with Bank of America. Your line is open. -- Good morning. Hi guys. -- Hi Ross. -- Ron, just had kind of a philosophical question. I mean, most of my questions have been answered. But -- look, I mean, PACCAR has been an outstanding stock over the long term, but in the last 5 years, you've got earnings double. You continue to establish all sorts of internal records. You've got an extremely robust cycle right now, and the stock is essentially flat, even if we ignored today's move. So what is the market missing about PACCAR? And does the stock performance influence how you look at the business or your strategy? More importantly, how do you drive value on the stock from here? -- Well, I think we just continue to -- we're record truck deliveries, record truck revenues, record Parts revenues, record financial Services portfolio. Our focus is to continue to grow the company and grow the earnings over the long term. And that will pay off eventually. You probably know more about why today is what it is in the market. It doesn't make any sense to us, but we're going to continue to focus on what we do, how we do it, and execute better than anybody in the industry. -- Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then, just curious, anything in your North American business? I mean, you never seen the oil service companies talk about at least a temporary slowdown in the Permian. Are you seeing any slowdown at your Gulf Coast dealers at all, due to what's going on down there? Any granularity in order trends in that region? -- Ross, we've not seen anything like that. I mean, again, oil affects a small percentage of our total truck production and overall business. So it's not something that we monitor that closely, but I think the Peterbilt and Kenworth trucks, we have great customers in the oilfield, and we're continuing to see steady -- pretty steady demand, I think, from those customers, so not much impact. Oil prices have rebounded nicely, and so I think that bodes well for the midterm for that segment. And it also has a nice benefit for our winch business. -- Got it. Thanks, Ron. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from Courtney Yakavonis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. -- Thanks, guys. Just curious, obviously, you're working through some of these part shortages currently. But if we think about your guidance for next year or the industry guidance for North America, truck retail sales kind of coming in at the high end. What are the other bottlenecks we need to be thinking about in terms of getting your build rates higher to meet that increased level in demand that we should potentially see next year? -- I think, right now, the suppliers are the pacing item. And we're -- again, we're working closely on additional investments, and that is the item that will make the difference for us. -- Okay. And just to make sure that I fully understand, the view is that is a near-term issue that will be fixed by the end of the fourth quarter. -- Yes, that's our goal, for sure. And our suppliers -- we have great suppliers. And again, some were dealt some pretty difficult hands, with the hurricane affecting their operations. And so that's -- again, that's all temporary and can be worked through. -- Okay, great. Thanks. And then, also just thinking about the pricing environment heading into next year, I believe you said this quarter was pretty similar to last quarter. Can you just give us any sense of kind of how you guys are thinking about -- about the pricing environment? -- I would say steady. A lot of orders taken and negotiated with many of our customers. And so I think we feel good about the direction of pricing. It's very reasonable for the current market circumstances, so. -- Okay, great. Thank you. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. -- Hi. Thank you. Just a quick question, really more for my modeling. I'm trying to understand why the deliveries were up 19%, but the Truck revenues were only up 14.5%? It's been a little while since the truck revenues were below the deliveries. So first of all, you'd say, well maybe it's the mix geographically, but really, your best growth rates were in some of the higher price point trucks, right, North America, Europe. Is there something within the mix of the size of the trucks, type of trucks that went out that would have the deliveries up that much more than the revenue growth you booked? -- Yes. Michael has some thoughts that he can share on that. -- Well, you'll probably notice that in Europe, our deliveries were up 14%, 15%, and truck revenues were down, and that's mostly due to we had more truck sales that were deferred because they're associated with guaranteed residual value contracts, which resulted in us deferring the sales and revenues over the term of the residual value guarantee. And so that just worked out this quarter to be in effect that was noticeable. -- And there was -- was there a reason why it was greater? And maybe if you could help frame it for us a little bit, how much greater than normal the percent of trucks that went out in Europe with the deferred? -- Yes. I think -- typically, David, that's just really a function of the particular customers that you're doing business with at any particular quarter. Preston, do you have anything? -- Yes. I would just say it's a timing. And we've grown in the large fleets. We talked earlier in the call about fleet growth, Eastern Europe and DAF is doing a good job of making penetrations, and some of those large fleets come with GRBs. But largely, it's timing. -- Okay. So yes, so when we were in Germany right, the idea of your market share higher in some of the Eastern European countries, some of the bigger logistic truck companies are the ones gaining share out of that region. This is reflective of that essentially? -- Yes, I think you're starting to see that the DAF trucks in Europe had the best fuel economy, the lowest operating costs, and that's having the biggest fleets to take a really good look at us, we're winning share there. -- And one other element, currency and I apologize I jumped on late. Have you given the exact currency impact for the quarter? -- Yes, the currency impact for the quarter with respect to revenues is about $50 million or so of a reduction in revenues. Due to currency movements, dollar was strong during the quarter compared to last year, and the impact on income this quarter was pretty minimal. -- And that was 5-0 or 1-5? -- 5-0. -- 5-0. Okay, I appreciate it. Thank you. -- Thanks, David.Your next question comes from David Leiker with Baird. Your line is open. -- Hi. This is Joe Vruwink for David. -- Hi, Joe. -- Just one question for me. Everything on the call has sounded really positive and the industry is doing well. So what if anything are you worried about as you look into 2019? -- The backlogs and the business conditions are very good, and so we feel really good about. Like I said, we're at record levels in all of our segments and our focus is to continue to grow, take advantage of the current market opportunity. So I'd say there's not any major concerns on our horizon. -- Trucks are performing great, and all our customers are very happy with the trucks that they're buying. Pretty good position to be in. -- When you, maybe I'll throw one idea out there. When you look at pricing trends and the spot market and how that ultimately flows into your customers core rates, there has definitely some moderation there. So when you think about orders that have been in place Q3, Q4 of this year and you think about your customers pricing may be moderating from the high levels that's been out. Does that give you cause for concern? Or if there is any headwind from that dynamic, maybe it's more of a late 2019 phenomenon ultimately? -- So the financial services portfolio has been at less than 1% past dues for about six consecutive years, and that was during periods of really strong freight markets down to maybe not so strong freight markets. So I don't see that the customers ability to meet their obligations is going to be significantly affected by some moderate reduction in pricing in the freight market, it's just been extraordinarily good in the last 6 months. And so I don't see that being a factor in our customers' decisions to buy trucks or being able to meet their commitment. -- Okay. Great. Thank you very much. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from Sameer Rathod with Macquarie. Your line is open. -- Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just one quick question on wages and wage pressure. Are you guys seeing any lack of availability in terms of hiring people, or seeing any increase in wages that you have to pay in the tight market? Thank you. -- We just have -- we have great facilities, we have great reputations in the communities in which our factories and warehouses are located. We probably have some of the longest tenured employees in the industry that work in our operations. And so when we have a need for employees we probably get 10 apps for every job that we post. So it's -- we're viewed as a as a premium employer in the markets that we're in. And so we're able to find the people we need to do our staffing. That being said, there are some pockets where that's part of -- the suppliers challenge is getting employees in some of the areas in which they're in. And so, again, they're working through that to try and solve those challenges. -- Thank you. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from Joe O'Dea with Vertical Research. Your line is open. -- Hi. Thanks. Good morning. -- Good morning. -- First just talking about gross margins next year in the 14% to 15% range in kind of in line with where you are this year and then thinking about what looks like a set up for some tailwinds on price supply chain issues abating mix that looks like if anything it's a bit of a benefit on stronger North America. And so what some of the kind of offsets to that might be such that we don't see year-over-year margin expansion? -- You know if all those things you said occur there's no offset, but it's a dynamic world and you've got to manage the best you can in the circumstances. So -- and that's what we do every day. -- Okay, appreciate it. And then just on the cash side of things ending the quarter with $3.8 billion of cash and marketable securities and trying to think about deployment options. And just any context around how much cash you feel you need to have on the balance sheet for the credit rating and for other operational uses? And whether you think about stepping above the typical payout range target or whether you think about other deployment options, just given we continue to see the cash balance move higher and presumably it's set to go even higher next year? -- Yes, we think about all of those things. But if you look at historically about our cash balance, you go back 10 years, it's in the mid to high-teens as a percent of our total assets and that's where it sets currently. But it's an ongoing discussion and review with the Board about payouts and buybacks et cetera and that will continue. -- Okay. Thanks a lot. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Loop Capital Markets. Your line is open. -- Thank you very much. I guess the new guy gets back in the pack here. I got to be honest. Thank you very much. More -- my question has really been answered and David Raso, I think asked the question I had on mix. So let me just dive a little deeper into it. I understand what you're saying about the residual value contracts in Europe. I was little surprised the impact was as big as it was. So if I look at your forecast fourth quarter 4% to 8% deliveries, I assume you're still getting 3% price and facing kind of a 1% currency headwind. Do these residual value guarantees? Is it more related to you just traded a particular cohort of trucks and with low residuals during 3Q? Is it more of that -- we're just trying to clear some inventory out of the market, when I think about revenues relative to deliveries. Because as David said, that was kind of the part that surprised me, was the difference here. Should I be thinking about kind of more 1:1 ratio as we head into 4Q? Or do these residual value deals continue to drag a little bit more heavily for the next quarter or two? -- I don't think we have the visibility to necessarily what the specifics of -- but I think fourth quarter revenues, I think -- thinking about it on a 1:1 basis is probably the way to think about it. -- Okay, fair enough. Well, congratulations and thank you. -- Thank you, Jeff.Your next question comes from Neil Frohnapple with Buckingham Research. Your line is open. -- Hi, thanks. One more follow-up on the gross margin performance in 3Q. Ron, you indicated 3% new truck price realization in the quarter, but can you say if this more than offset higher average per truck material and labor cost? I know we typically have to wait for the 10-Q to get those specific numbers, but can you at least say whether the relationship was still positive in the third quarter? -- Yes, it was roughly offset. I mean when you see the 10-Q as we've drafted it now looks like it's pretty much an offset from material and labor. -- Okay, thanks. And then Ron, just going back to the heavy-duty share gains in Europe, due in part to the new product introductions, I believe. You said that heavy duty orders were up 26% in the first half of the year. Are you able to say what DAF's order rate -- order growth rate was in the third quarter? -- We don't -- I don't have that detail handy here, but that's something that we can grab. -- So if you compare the third quarter of this year to the third quarter of last year, total European orders are up 4% for the quarter in Europe and 17% year-to-date. -- Okay, there we go. -- Great, thanks. I'll pass it on. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from Faheem Sabeiha with Longbow Research. Your line is open. -- Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you guys can provide a little more color on the parts outlook for next year. Just wondering how much of that growth is expected to come from freight activity versus higher engine sales and higher TRP parts sales? -- I think it comes from a lot of different avenues. We continue to increase the level of MX engines in the truck park on an ongoing basis. I think we're -- since we started production, I think we're at about 200,000 and so with engine production next year, that probably goes up another 15% or 20%. The engines are getting -- the engines that we produced 3 or 4, 5, 6, 7 years ago are getting more into their maintenance period, and so that's going to be a positive effect. So I think engine parts has been, and probably will continue to be, the highest percentage growth driver for PACCAR Parts. But then you look at the increased level of TRP stores, the fleet services initiatives that our team is championing, the e-commerce initiatives to really make it easier to interface with PACCAR Parts, the team has done a great job and really superb performance this year. -- Sounds good. And in regards to the gross margin outlook for next year, what does that assume as far as the parts margin, are you guys expecting the parts margin to be relatively flat versus 2018? Or are you expecting continued growth there? -- No, I think that 27%, 27.5% range is probably a reasonable way to think about it. -- Okay. Thank you. -- Thank you.Your next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. -- Hi, good morning, guys. It's Rob on for Scott. -- Hi, Rob. -- Looking out to next year, with regard to kind of the gross margins. Are you expecting any sort of drag in the first half associated with the hundreds of dollars of impact that you called out on the tariffs? Or should we be thinking about kind of price like this quarter offsetting any sort of that cost inflation? -- I think we should think about it offsetting. -- All right. That's helpful. And then, I think I had missed it if provided some color in terms of the used truck pricing trends that you guys are seeing from your models. I know you're continuing to generate a premium to the overall market, but can you give a sense of what you guys saw from that used price realization? -- Yes. I think if you compare the third quarter this year to a year ago, it's up about 10% overall. So it's been good. And we see that in the results in our Financial Services business in North America. In Europe, pricing is a little bit flat compared to where it was a year ago. -- Got it. Helpful. Final one, and in terms of the mix, was the revenue per unit in the US and Canada, how much was that down year-over-year? And I realized that the price realization is up 3%, but I'm assuming there was some mix within that segment as well. Am I thinking about that right for the third quarter? -- Yes. I don't think there's any dramatic puts and takes in terms of price per unit. I mean it gets impacted by a little bit -- by the mix of medium versus heavy-duty. But again, I don't think there's anything there that's different than what we would normally expect. -- Okay. Really helpful guys, appreciate the time. -- You bet.Your next question comes from Ann Duignan with JP Morgan. Your line is open. -- Yes, hi guys.I just had a follow-up. Soon as we just came back from IAA a couple of weeks ago, whenever it was. One of the things that I find most interesting was walking IVECO's exhibit, and all the signage they had around their booth for no diesel, no diesel, no diesel. Can you just talk about your outlook longer-term for the growth of electric vehicles in Europe in particular, just given the 2025 regulations that are going to come in place. And do you think that, in Europe specifically, there'll always be the need for diesel also? -- I think in the economics of diesel just makes sense and they're going to continue to make sense for a long time, so it's going to be the dominant power source for long-haul trucking, certainly. There's obviously going to be opportunities that will develop in urban areas that may bring about hybrids for electric vehicles, and so we're prepared for those. You, obviously, saw at the IAA show and drove our CF Electric, we have a full suite of vehicles, in terms of all electric, heavy, light-duty, and we do that both in North America and Europe. So we're well prepared for the places where it makes sense. We think there will be local geographies more than there will generally widespread displacement of diesel for the foreseeable future. -- Yes. I think there's a growing sentiment that maybe the diesel with a 0-emission hybrid capability may be the best economic solution for those inner-city applications where you need that 0 emission requirement as opposed to a full electric option, which is just the batteries and the weight are still present, and absent a break to that -- the economic case is a bit challenging. -- Yes. Maybe I misinterpreted the IVECO's intent, but maybe it was more their approach to meeting these new non-diesel catchments as opposed to there won't be any diesel trucks left. So I appreciate your color on that, that's helpful. -- Yes, thank you.There are no other questions in the queue at this time. Are there any additional remarks from the Company? -- We'd like to thank everyone for their participation, and thank you, operator.Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes PACCAR's earnings call.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 12 major stocks, including United Parcel Service (UPS), Merck (MRK) and BHP Billiton (BHP). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see  's shares have outperformed the Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry in the last three months, gaining +4.2% vs. +0.2%. Solid e-commerce growth is a huge positive for the company and should aid its third-quarter results, scheduled to be disclosed on Oct 24.Additionally, the company's transformation plan, unveiled in September 2018, is aimed at boosting its bottom line. The Zacks analyst is also impressed by UPS' efforts to reward shareholders. To this end, in February 2018, UPS hiked quarterly dividends by 10%. The company's bullish full-year forecast on free cash flow supports the possibility of a dividend hike in the near future.Moreover, UPS is leaving no stone unturned to perform well in the upcoming holiday season. It intends to hire roughly 100,000 seasonal workers during the season.(You can  ).Shares of  have gained +11.1% in the last three months, outperforming the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which gained 3.9% over the same period. Merck's new products like Keytruda, Lynparza, and Bridion should continue to drive sales.Keytruda sales are gaining strong momentum with approval for additional indications especially in the first-line lung cancer setting as it is the only anti-PD-1 approved in this setting. Animal Health unit is also strong and remains a core growth driver for Merck. Meanwhile, Merck will continue to focus on cost-cutting initiatives to drive the bottom line.However, generic competition for several drugs and pricing pressure will continue to be overhangs on the top line. Estimates have gone up ahead of the company's Q3 earnings release. Merck has a positive record of earnings surprises in the recent quarters.(You can  ). 's shares have outperformed the Zacks Mining - Miscellaneous industry over the past six months (3.1% vs. -7.3%). Recently, BHP Billiton entered an agreement to acquire 6.1% interest in SolGold, with which it will gain shares of the Cascabel copper-gold project in Ecuador. The company is also trying to make its operations more efficient on the back of smarter technology adoption across the entire value chain.BHP has entered agreements for the sale of its onshore U.S. assets for $10.8 billion, to simplify and strengthen its portfolio and generate shareholder returns. Moreover, strong cash flow position, lower debt levels and higher operational efficacy will likely strengthen BHP Billiton's competency in the near term.(You can  ).Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), PACCAR (PCAR) and Parker-Hannifin (PH).Mark VickerySenior EditorIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.The Zacks analyst expects Essex Property to gain from strong West Coast portfolio and solid balance sheet.Bio-Rad's solid growth in North America, China and Asia Pacific buoys optimism. The Zacks analyst is worried about adverse product mix and rising logistics costs.Per the Zacks analyst, robust backlog, continuous acquisitions and the strength of its Government Services segment are driving factors.Per the Zacks analyst, Energy Transfer's acquisition deals with Sunoco and Penn Tex are likely to boost growth momentum.The Zacks analyst is impressed by the growth in Ryder's lease fleet.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 23, 2018, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the , it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.This truck maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.50 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +31.6%.Revenues are expected to be $5.49 billion, up 16% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.06% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks  (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is subject to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce  , and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).For Paccar, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.62%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Paccar will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Paccar would post earnings of $1.43 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.59, delivering a surprise of +11.19%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our  to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Paccar appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Currently, Paccar has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Fox Factory Holding has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that PCAR's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.PCAR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 10.27, while FOXF has a forward P/E of 28.50. We also note that PCAR has a PEG ratio of 0.95. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. FOXF currently has a PEG ratio of 1.70.Another notable valuation metric for PCAR is its P/B ratio of 2.49. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, FOXF has a P/B of 8.28.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to PCAR's Value grade of A and FOXF's Value grade of D.PCAR sticks out from FOXF in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that PCAR is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The stock has lost 4.7% compared with the industry's 15.7% decline.Let's see, how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement. | For third-quarter 2018, Harley-Davidson anticipates total motorcycle shipments of 45,500-50,500 units compared with 39,000-44,000 expected in the year-ago period. For the to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total motorcycle shipments is 48,044 units.For the soon-to-be-released quarterly results, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of Motorcycles and Related Products segment is pegged at $1.1 billion, down from the second quarter's total revenues of $1.53 billion.Similarly, the consensus estimate for total revenues of the company's Financial Services segment stands at $191 million, declining from the second quarter's total revenues of $188 million.To avoid increased tariffs, Harley-Davidson decided to shift manufacturing location of its motorcycles sold in Europe from the United States to international facilities. Ramping up production at these international hubs will require investments, which will lead to rise in costs for the company.Further, before international hubs get upgraded, Harley-Davidson has to keep paying high tariffs for motorcycles imported from the United States to Europe. As of June, the company estimated tariff-related costs of roughly $30-$45 million for the rest of 2018.However, Harley-Davidson has been focusing on offering innovative products to remain at par with changing consumer demands. In July, it shared growth plan through 2022. Per the plan, the company aims to revive its U.S. business through investments, while accelerating pace of international growth.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Harley-Davidson is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

The Federal Reserve has placed rates on an upward trajectory and is widely slated to announce another hike later this week. Strategists at JPMorgan (JPM) think that this is an encouraging sign for stocks.Currently, the U.S. economy is in robust shape, as is evident from multiple gauges. The financial major's strategists think that this will push investors to rotate out of defensive holdings into cyclical sectors.This is why they think that the financials, automotive semiconductor and capital goods sectors are good investments at this point. Adding these stocks to your portfolio would enable you to benefit from the strength of the U.S. economy.On Sep 14, 10-year U.S. Treasury Note yield hit 3% for the first time since Aug 2. The spike in the yield came immediately after the Commerce Department revised U.S. retail sales data for July from the initial increase of 0.5% to 0.7%. Moreover, the hourly wage rate surged strongly in August. (Read:  )Thereafter, the 10-year Treasury note yield jumped 3.3 basis points to 3.081% on Sep 19, the highest since May 17 and close to its seven-year high of 3.109%. The 10-year note yield had crossed the coveted 3% mark on Sep 18, the first time since late May. (Read:  )Strategists at JPMorgan think that a robust U.S. economy is boosting bond yields. The strength in the economy is more than evident from the bullish nature of several economic indicators.Readings of gauges for manufacturing, wage growth, inflation and consumer confidence have all been encouraging recently. This is likely to make investors rotate out of defensive holdings into more cyclical stocks.JPMorgan's strategists think that financial, automotive, capital goods and semiconductor stocks are good bets in such a situation. Up to now, automotive and capital goods' stocks have been largely unaffected by trade-related concerns. Investors have chosen to focus on the economy and robust earnings numbers.Financials are likely to gain as the yield spread widens, in turn boosting their margins. The slump in chip stocks is also likely to be temporary, unless the economy undergoes a significant downturn. Some analysts are already projecting an increase in spending on wafer equipment next year.Strategists at JPMorgan are confident that the recent spurt in yields is an encouraging signal for stocks. As investors gather confidence in the economy, they are likely to switch from defensive sectors to cyclical options.Investing in capital goods, auto, financial and chip stocks would make for a profitable option.

(Symbol: PCAR) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $71.57, changing hands for $72.41/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 14 different analyst targets contributing to that average for PACCAR Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $59.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $90.00. The standard deviation is $7.602.But the whole reason to look at the  PCAR price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.

In a sense, it's perfectly understandable -- no one likes buying into a cyclical stock that looks cheap just before its earnings fall and then suddenly its valuation starts to look high. It's equally unpalatable to sell out of a cyclical stock just as sentiment is about to turn.With that in mind, I happen to think it's not the time to be dumping trucking stocks. Here's why.Don't write off the trucking industry just yet. Image source: Getty Images.It's been a good year operationally for trucking companies, but it's been a bad year for trucking company stock prices. As you can see below, a basket of stocks with significant trucking exposure shows dramatic underperformance in the last year relative to the 16% gain in the  index. data by  .However, if you thought that was a consequence of weakening end markets in 2018, then you would be wrong. All of these companies have actually reported strengthening conditions this year. In fact, the last company to give results,  , beat analyst estimates in its fiscal third quarter and  . Moreover, Navistar raised its estimate for North America heavy-duty truck sales in 2018 to 260,000-280,000 units from a previous estimate of 250,000-280,000 units.In fact, a look at guidance trends from the leading truck companies shows a progressive increase in estimates -- definitely not something you would expect from an industry in decline. Estimates for truck sales in Europe and Asia (including the important China market) have remained broadly in line throughout 2018, but it's notable that all the companies discussed have increased industry sales estimates for the all-important domestic market.\n  \nData source: Company presentations. Figures in bold represent guidance increases. *Fiscal full-year guidance to Sept. 30.So if end markets are improving in 2018, why has stock performance been so weak?Trucking is an industry seen at risk from any potential escalation in so-called tariff and trade wars, but I suspect the real issue overhanging trucking stocks is the fear that sales are about peak. It's not uncommon for increases in current-year sales guidance to be met with the bearish riposte that this only means that sales are going to peak sooner.As you can see below, truck sales are highly cyclical and investors may be worrying about avoiding the significant slump that occurred in 2016. data by  .Moreover, the midpoint of Navistar's forecast for 2019 North America Class 8 industry sales implies a 10,000-unit reduction from the 270,000 forecast for 2018.Before siding with the bears on the matter, you might want to consider the following three arguments.First, if you look at the chart above, it's clear that the slowdown in the heavy-truck industry coincided with a recession in U.S. industrial production, but there's no reason to expect industrial conditions to mirror what happened in 2015-2016.Upon  , it's clear that the slowdown in 2015-2016 was exacerbated, or perhaps created, by declining energy and mining commodity prices, which had an outsize impact on heavy industries in the U.S. However, oil, metals, and minerals prices have generally been on the uptrend in the last couple of years.Second, there's evidence to suggest that trucking stocks tend to sell off in anticipation of a peak, and then turn up when it becomes clear that the peak has passed and investors have a better outlook one year out.Here's how these stocks performed in the year running up to the point when U.S. heavy-truck sales turned down near the beginning of 2016. Does this look similar to what's going on 2018? data by  .And here's how they performed even as truck sales were in a year-over-year decline throughout 2016. As you can see, it definitely wasn't a good idea to sell out of the stock just before the peak last time around. data by  .Finally, conditions are now different. During the 2015-2016 slowdown, earnings actually fell for trucking stocks. However, this time around, even as analysts are penciling a slowdown in truck sales and companies like Navistar are predicting it, the consensus is for more earnings growth in the next year -- making valuations look attractive.To demonstrate this, here's a chart of enterprise value (market cap plus net debt) to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) -- a  . As you can see below, the forecasts put all of these companies on forward valuations lower than they were going into 2016 when peak sales occurred (you can see how well these stocks performed during 2016 in the chart above). data by  .Don't be surprised if trucking stocks come under more pressure in the near term as the debate around peak sales goes on. However, long-term investors should ignore the noise and focus on the long-term prospects of the industry.The fear of holding stocks in an industry whose sales are about to peak appears to be leading trucking stocks into valuations that seem to be pricing in some sort of multiyear slowdown. If you can ride out the volatility, then, as counterintuitive as it sounds, history suggests holding or even buying the sector when peak sales have clearly passed is a good idea.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Owing to the rising economic and environmental concerns, the paradigm shift in 3D printing technology, particularly over the past decade, has seen a phenomenal rise in popularity and adoption especially among capital-intensive industries.For easier understanding, we can look at the automotive industry which is a good example of how AM helps drive efficiency and productivity, starting from design to manufacturing floor. For automakers, this ground-breaking technology has witnessed unprecedented adoption due to its capacity to foster innovation, creativity and limitless possibilities.While automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and suppliers primarily use AM for rapid prototyping, the technical trajectory of AM makes a strong case for use in product innovation and direct manufacturing. Of late, leading global companies have begun to realize the commercial benefits of 3D printers in automotive manufacturing.Notably, the North American market for 3D printing is expected to register steady growth on early adoption. The Asia-Pacific and European markets are still in the initial stages of adopting 3D printing and are expected to grow at a relatively higher rate than the North American market. We believe that as 3D Printing begins to permeate across more sectors, the time is ripe for investors to enter the arena and ride the impending wave of growth. Moreover, the entry of new players will act as a catalyst for the industry and has the potential to redefine market dynamics.Investors should watch out for the 3D Printing space, as the industry seems to be on the brink of a major transformation, with expanding end markets, burgeoning applications for the technology and rising new players.Let us examine how four leading automobile manufacturers are using this technology to gain leverage in a cut-throat competitive market. : This Rueil-Malmaison, France-based automobile manufacturer currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a  of A. The company closed a strategic partnership with Divergent 3D, which focuses on the utilization of 3D printing in automotive manufacturing and introduced the world's first 3D printed supercar, Blade. The stock has gained 22.2% over the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year EPS has been revised 17.3% upward over the last 90 days. You can see  . : In an effort to remain at the forefront of product innovation, this London-based automaker is currently evaluating the potential benefits that could result from the adoption of AM. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a VGM Score of A. Shares of the company have rallied 1.4% in a year's time. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year EPS has been revised 4.3% upward over the last 90 days. CNH Industrial surpassed earnings estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters, the average positive surprise being 38.1%. : This Tokyo, Japan-based automaker currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of A. Honda collaborated with 3D-printing specialist, Kabuku, to build a custom delivery vehicle for a confectionery business using 3D printing technology. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year EPS has been revised 2.3% upward over the last 90 days. The company beat earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 39.7%. The stock has outperformed the industry over the past year. : This Bellevue, WA-based automobile manufacturer currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 and has a VGM Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year EPS has been revised 6.2% upward over the last 90 days. The company beat earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 8%. The company's technical Centers in Europe and North America are equipped with state-of-the-art product development and validation capabilities. The new 3D printing technology accelerates the design process from concept to production. The stock has made nominal returns in the past year.However, it is worth mentioning that the success of AM future applications in the automotive industry will largely depend on how it evolves over the coming years.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

The success of billionaire value investors like Warren Buffett further underscores the fact. Over the past five years, his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway's book value has grown at a compound annual rate of 11% (  ). Per a July Motley Fool article last year, over the past 50 years, the stock has yielded a compound annual return of 20.8%. This indicates that an investment of $10,000 in 1965 would be worth $88 million today.However, apparently simple to understand, this investing discipline has its own share of pitfalls. A value investor mostly misses the chance of betting on stocks that have bright long-term prospects and in their quest of cheaper stocks, they often end up picking stocks that have weak prospects.Buffett believes that proper understanding of the \"intrinsic value\" of a stock may ease out many problems with regard to value investment. According to him, going by the fundamentals of value investing while picking undervalued stocks, investors need to focus on their earnings growth potential.While yardsticks such as dividend yield, the ratio of price to earnings, sales or book value are the most common value investing metrics that can single out stocks trading at a discount, these ratios fail to consider the potential of a stock. PEG is the ratio with the earnings growth component in it.The PEG ratio is defined as: (Price/Earnings)/Earnings Growth RateA lower PEG ratio is always better for value investors.While P/E alone fails to identify a true value stock, PEG helps find the intrinsic value of a stock.Unfortunately, this ratio is often neglected due to investors' limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though. It doesn't consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at very high growth, followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are taken into consideration.Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy: (for more accurate valuation purpose) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.)

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:  ,  ,  and  .In the recent past, major developments in additive manufacturing (AM) technology, better known as 3D printing, have transformed the ways in which products are designed and manufactured. Owing to the rising economic and environmental concerns, the paradigm shift in 3D printing technology, particularly over the past decade, has seen a phenomenal rise in popularity and adoption especially among capital-intensive industries.For easier understanding, we can look at the automotive industry which is a good example of how AM helps drive efficiency and productivity, starting from design to manufacturing floor. For automakers, this ground-breaking technology has witnessed unprecedented adoption due to its capacity to foster innovation, creativity and limitless possibilities.While automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and suppliers primarily use AM for rapid prototyping, the technical trajectory of AM makes a strong case for use in product innovation and direct manufacturing. Of late, leading global companies have begun to realize the commercial benefits of 3D printers in automotive manufacturing.Notably, the North American market for 3D printing is expected to register steady growth on early adoption. The Asia-Pacific and European markets are still in the initial stages of adopting 3D printing and are expected to grow at a relatively higher rate than the North American market. We believe that as 3D Printing begins to permeate across more sectors, the time is ripe for investors to enter the arena and ride the impending wave of growth. Moreover, the entry of new players will act as a catalyst for the industry and has the potential to redefine market dynamics.Investors should watch out for the 3D Printing space, as the industry seems to be on the brink of a major transformation, with expanding end markets, burgeoning applications for the technology and rising new players.Let us examine how four leading automobile manufacturers are using this technology to gain leverage in a cut-throat competitive market. : This Rueil-Malmaison, France-based automobile manufacturer currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a  of A. The company closed a strategic partnership with Divergent 3D, which focuses on the utilization of 3D printing in automotive manufacturing and introduced the world's first 3D printed supercar, Blade. The stock has gained 22.2% over the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year EPS has been revised 17.3% upward over the last 90 days. You can see  . : In an effort to remain at the forefront of product innovation, this London-based automaker is currently evaluating the potential benefits that could result from the adoption of AM. It currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a VGM Score of A. Shares of the company have rallied 1.4% in a year's time. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year EPS has been revised 4.3% upward over the last 90 days. CNH Industrial surpassed earnings estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters, the average positive surprise being 38.1%. : This Tokyo, Japan-based automaker currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a VGM Score of A. Honda collaborated with 3D-printing specialist, Kabuku, to build a custom delivery vehicle for a confectionery business using 3D printing technology. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year EPS has been revised 2.3% upward over the last 90 days. The company beat earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 39.7%. The stock has outperformed the industry over the past year. : This Bellevue, WA-based automobile manufacturer currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 and has a VGM Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year EPS has been revised 6.2% upward over the last 90 days. The company beat earnings estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 8%. The company's technical Centers in Europe and North America are equipped with state-of-the-art product development and validation capabilities. The new 3D printing technology accelerates the design process from concept to production. The stock has made nominal returns in the past year.However, it is worth mentioning that the success of AM future applications in the automotive industry will largely depend on how it evolves over the coming years.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

Both  (NYSE:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) reported year-over-year increases. Also, sales of  (NYSE:  ) and  (OTCMKTS:  ) rose in August.The overall jump in auto sales is an indication of a booming economy that follows a rise in consumer confidence, which is near an 18-year high. This indicates that President Donald Trump's protectionist trade policies too haven't dented investor confidence much. Given this scenario, it makes good sense to indulge in stocks gaining from the jump in sales.Major automakers reported a jump in August auto sales. Ford reported a nearly 4.1% rise in auto sales. The company sold 218,504 vehicles in August compared with 209,897 vehicles in the year-ago period. Fiat Chrysler's sales jumped 10%. The automaker reported sales of 193,718 vehicles, driven by high demand for Jeep and Ram.Honda and Nissan also reported an increase in vehicle sales in August. Honda's U.S. sales rose 1.3% in August to 147,903 vehicles, while Nissan's sales jumped 4% to 112,376 vehicles. The U.S. car industry has been suffering for a while. In 2017, auto sales declined 2% after hitting a record high of 17.55 million units in 2016. Moreover, the auto industry has had a roller coaster ride this year too, with automakers reeling under trade war fears. However, the jump in August auto sales is definitely going to bring a smile on the faces of carmakers.All major automakers reported a decline in sales of passenger cars. The rise in August auto sales can be primarily attributed to robust demand for SUVs, crossovers and trucks, which accounted for 68% of new-vehicle retail sales in August, according to J.D. Power. Sales of Ford's SUV brands jumped 20.1%, while pickups grew 5.7% in August. Ford's passenger car sales declined 21.3% in August.Fiat's Ram sales surged 55% in August to 36,798 vehicles, while Jeep sales went up to 87,502 units. At the same time, Fiat's Dodge and Chrysler brands declined 18% and 3%, respectively, over the same time period. Toyota Motor Corporation's (TM) SUV sales jumped 11.7% through August. Understandably, sedans are fast losing their appeal to American customers, which have made automakers like Ford announce that it would gradually stop production of passenger cars in the United States.The jump in August auto sales follows a rise in consumer confidence, which is near an 18-year high. Moreover, higher wages, stable jobs, unemployment level at a 19-year low all pointy all hint at a booming economy. This definitely has given a boost to consumers' confidence, resulting in higher spending.At the same time, trade war fears too don't seem to have affected investors' sentiment much. Moreover, last week United States and Mexico entered into a new agreement to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The new pact will bring a sigh of relief to domestic automakers, which have been reeling under trade war fears, as a number of U.S. automakers have their production units in Mexico.The jump in August auto sales will definitely boost automakers' confidence. A near 18-year-high consumer confidence is an indicator of customers' willingness to spend more. Moreover, higher wages and unemployment level at a 19-year low is sign of a booming economy. Given this scenario, it makes good sense to invest in stocks benefiting from the spike in auto sales.However, picking winning stocks may be difficult. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and other relevant metrics. (NASDAQ:  ) is a designer, manufacturer and marketer of suspension products used primarily on mountain bikes, side-by-side vehicles, on-road vehicles, off-road vehicles, all-terrain vehicles, snowmobiles, specialty vehicles and applications and motorcycles.The company has expected earnings growth of 31.5% for the current year.

(NASDAQ:  ) is a global technology company that designs and manufactures premium quality light, medium and heavy duty commercial vehicles sold worldwide under the Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF nameplates.PACCAR has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company has expected earnings growth of 41.6% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved by 6.2% over the last 60 days. (NASDAQ:  ) is one of the largest specialty retailers of automotive aftermarket parts, tools, supplies, equipment, and accessories in the United States, serving both professional service providers and do-it-yourself customers.O'Reilly Automotive has a Zacks Rank #2. The company has expected earnings growth of 34.3% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved by 2.4% over the last 60 days. (NYSE:  ) a leading automotive aftermarket parts provider in North America, serves both the professional installer and do-it-yourself customers.Advance Auto Parts carries a Zacks Rank #2.

But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Currently, both Paccar and Fox Factory Holding are holding a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.PCAR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.59, while FOXF has a forward P/E of 32.56. We also note that PCAR has a PEG ratio of 1.07. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. FOXF currently has a PEG ratio of 1.94.Another notable valuation metric for PCAR is its P/B ratio of 2.80. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, FOXF has a P/B of 9.46.These metrics, and several others, help PCAR earn a Value grade of A, while FOXF has been given a Value grade of F.Both PCAR and FOXF are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that PCAR is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

Ramping up production at these international hubs will require investments, which will lead to rise in costs for the company. Further, before the international hubs get upgraded, it has to keep paying high tariffs for the motorcycles imported to Europe.

The plan to not import Focus Active has been taken to safeguard the company from higher U.S. tariffs.The crossover, Focus Active was introduced in April for the global markets. Intended to launch the model as a niche product in the United States, Ford would have set the starting price at around $20,000. This pricing would have let the company witness a thin profit margin, making it difficult to absorb additional import duties. Per management, increased tariff rates would have led to augmented costs for Ford. However, its plan to introduce Focus Active in Europe and China will continue as planned.The decision by the company has been announced at a time when the trade war between the United States and China is escalating. The U.S. government has already imposed a tariff of 25% on China-manufactured vehicles. Further, based on national security grounds, the government is assessing a proposal to enforce tariffs on all imported vehicles. | Almost 95% of the Ford vehicles sold in the United States are manufactured in the country itself, along with Canada and Mexico. Except for this, its EcoSport small sport utility and Transit Connect small vans are manufactured in India and Spain, respectively. Currently, Ford is not extensively exposed to risks due to vehicles produced outside the United States.In the last month, General Motors Company  filed a tariff exemption request for its Buick Envision utility vehicle produced in China. Per the filing, importing the China-manufactured model in the United States enables the company to compete against its counterparts. In 2017, Buick Envision's U.S. sales were 42,000 units compared with China's number of 210,000 units. The minuscule U.S. sales will not support shifting the factory location to the United States.In the past three months, Ford's stock has lost 19.2%, underperforming 8.1% decline recorded by the  it belongs to.Ford currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

Rising demand for crossovers and sport utility vehicles, along with changing global emission standards, has forced many automakers to opt for such type of liftgates. Since the beginning of 2018, the company launched two thermoplastic liftgates on 2019 Jeep Cherokee and 2019 Acura RDX. Further, it plans to introduce two more in China in the second half of the year.Magna's recyclable liftgate modules offer up to 25% weight reduction and wider design flexibility compared with the steel versions. Its design flexibility enables clients to carry out regular and cost-effective mid-cycle refreshes. Additionally, these liftgate modules trim CO2 emissions, expand electric vehicle battery range and develop aerodynamics.In 1999, the company initiated manufacturing thermoplastic liftgates for a European automaker that followed several European launches. Much later, in 2014, Magna provided the first North American thermoplastic liftgate for 2014 Nissan Rogue. The company sold roughly 3 million thermoplastic liftgate modules, globally. Except for design liberty and mass savings, the key advantages of these modules also include increased throughput at the facility and lower tooling investment. | Per IHS Markit, the global sports utility vehicle (SUV) market is anticipated to grow by 43 million units by 2025 compared with 34 million in 2018.

The new sedan model, based on Nissan's Leaf, will be produced by the company and its Chinese partner DongFeng Motor Group Co., Ltd. (Dongfeng).Nissan assumes Sylphy is going to be a key player in the electric vehicle (EV) market. The model is priced at 166,000 yuan ($25,850) after considering the government subsidies. With a pricing just over half of the Chinese edition of Nissan's Leaf, it can run 210 miles (338 kilometers) on a single charge. Further, the company announced its target to launch a range of EVs that will attract customers from all the market segments.In order to curb air pollution that is worsening, China's government is encouraging customers to opt for EVs while making it tougher for the automakers by introducing stricter fuel efficiency standards and sales quotas. Per the sales quota regulation to be effective from 2019, every brand has to sell a minimum number of new-energy vehicles every year and has to attain a new-energy vehicle credit score. If an automaker fails to do so, it has to buy credits from its competitors. This has pressurized the vehicle manufacturers to produce models per the requirements of Chinese customers at an affordable price. | Except for Nissan, other automakers are also raising their vehicle production in China to grab a slice of the world's largest electric-vehicle market.In July, the sales of full-electric and gasoline-electric hybrids in China witnessed rise of 47.7% year over year to 84,000 units. This rise was driven by subsidies and other government support.In the past six months, Nissan's stock has lost 11.1%, outperforming 13.6% decline recorded by the  it belongs to.Nissan currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Currently, both Paccar and Fox Factory Holding are holding a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.PCAR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.12, while FOXF has a forward P/E of 30.65. We also note that PCAR has a PEG ratio of 1.03. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. FOXF currently has a PEG ratio of 1.83.Another notable valuation metric for PCAR is its P/B ratio of 2.67. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, FOXF has a P/B of 8.90.Based on these metrics and many more, PCAR holds a Value grade of A, while FOXF has a Value grade of F.Both PCAR and FOXF are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that PCAR is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

This news seemed to have overshadowed a strong set of second-quarter numbers that the company released around the same time, roughly three weeks ago, capping potential upside in the stock. Cummins shares still are down about 19% year to date, as of this writing.It has come to a point where, during  , CEO Tom Linebarger explicitly said he believes the stock is \"significantly undervalued\" -- so much so that the company now wants to return a whopping 75% of its operating cash flow, up from 50%, to shareholders this year and is accelerating share repurchases.Does that mean you should buy Cummins shares while they're still cheap? Here are some solid reasons why you might want to.To be fair, investors' apprehensions aren't entirely misplaced. Cummins has had its fair share of emission troubles lately, with another recall involving roughly 232,000 engines in  Dodge Ram trucks already underway.However, recalls aren't anything new in the transportation industry. Cummins' largest customer  (NASDAQ: PCAR) , for instance, is recalling more than 3,000 Peterbilt and Kenworth trucks to fix a brakes defect, after another 2,000 or so trucks earlier this year for a transmissions-display issue.Now is the time to act on Cummins stock. Image source: Getty Images.Of course, Cummins' recalls are huge, but note that the company decided to \"voluntarily\" recall all engines of a certain make after a sample tested negative. A voluntary recall of this size reflects Cummins' commitment to quality standards -- something the company has come to be known for over the decades of its existence.Moreover, the defect in the engines built between 2010 and 2015 are mechanical in nature and didn't pose a safety hazard (which would be a cause for concern). Cummins also already booked charges to the tune of $404 million toward replacement costs in its last two quarters. That's not a small price to pay, but it won't send the company's profits tumbling, either.In fact, Cummins' sales and market-share numbers prove that customers continue to trust the company with their engine and component requirements.Image source: Cummins Inc. Chart by author.As is evident, Cummins' sales from each of its four business segments are growing steadily. In fact, the company's  , with sales surging 21% year over year, to $6.1 billion, putting Cummins on track to a record year.On Cummins' latest conference call, management gave insight into its market-share projections for North America. Here's what it expects:Cummins will have cornered nearly one-third of the heavy-duty and three-quarters of the medium-duty North American trucking markets in 2018.Meanwhile, the trucking markets are firing on all cylinders, with orders for heavy-duty Class 8 trucks on pace to hit a record this year. PACCAR estimates North American Class 8 industry retail sales to range between 265,000 and 285,000 trucks compared to 244,000 trucks in 2017. Cummins has a more detailed break-up forecast to give.Image source: Cummins Inc.Not surprisingly, Cummins now sees its full-year sales growing 15%-17% compared with 10%-14%. That's not an upgrade you can ignore.Cummins' plan to return 75% of operating cash flow to shareholders has given critics a reason to slam the company for a possible lack of growth opportunities. Cummins may not see a big-ticket acquisition or partnership opportunity on the horizon, but that doesn't mean it isn't growing.The company outlined several growth goals during its Analyst Day presentation late last year, including becoming a leading powertrain supplier. Accordingly, Cummins will acquire California-based Efficient Drivetrains -- a manufacturer of electric and hybrid power solutions for commercial vehicles -- in coming weeks. This comes close on the heels of Cummins' joint venture with  , which contributed 10% to Cummins' components segment sales growth in Q2. data by Most importantly, Cummins' war chest is sufficient to fund intermediate growth moves, as well as dividends and buybacks, as the chart above shows.Cummins recently raised its dividend by 5.6% and just announced accelerated plans to buy shares worth $500 million from Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC as part of its aggressive buyback program. The company has a price-to-cash-flow of 12 times and a dividend yield of 3.2%, and the trucking markets are roaring.

Moreover, both earnings and sales outpaced the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. This increase in financials is primarily due to higher year-over-year sales across all of the four segments in all of the markets.In the last-reported quarter, Oshkosh's access equipment segment's sales rose 18.4% year over year to $1.16 billion. A recovering economy has led to a robust demand in North America and other international markets, which is expected to double segment sales in fiscal 2018. For fiscal 2018, Oshkosh anticipates the access equipment segment's sales to be $3.6-$3.7 billion. | Further, the company's strong cash flow enabled it to enhance shareholder value. It frequently engages in share buybacks and pays regular quarterly dividends. During third-quarter fiscal 2018, Oshkosh completed repurchasing 523,294 shares of common stock worth $38.1 million. Additionally, it announced a quarterly dividend payment of 24 cents per share.However, increasing raw material costs and freight rates might partly impact fiscal 2018 results. Supply chain challenges, leading to product disruptions, will also impact Oshkosh's product deliveries to customers at a time increased demand.In the past three months, Oshkosh's stock has lost 9.6%, outperforming 10.7% decline recorded by the  it belongs to.Oshkosh currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

This is the latest initiative taken by the company to regain its lost position from other automakers.Demand for small and compact vehicles in the country enforced Honda to stop selling Honda CR-V in 2016 and rather bet on its subcompact crossover SUV, Vezel. However, of late, a similar trend of rising fascination for SUVs in the United States and China has also been witnessed in Japan. This is evident as Japan's yearly SUV sales topped 500,000 units in 2017.Under CEO Takahiro Hachigo, Honda is launching global vehicle models in more markets rather than following its earlier strategy of offering country-specific models. In 2017, the company reintroduced its Civic model in Japan, after taking a six-year gap. | Further, this CR-V relaunch is targeted to compete with similar variants of other automakers, which include Subaru Forester, Nissan X-Trail and the upcoming Toyota RAV4. The company targets to sell 1,200 units each month, starting this week.In its home country, Honda is betting on three vehicle types - gasoline, hybrid and a three-row variant to restore the demand of its non-minicar models. From the beginning of the year to July, the company's domestic sales of such models fell 5%. Conversely, Honda's Japan-only segment, consisting of vehicles with engines of up to 0.66 liters, witnessed 9% rise during the same period.In the past three months, Honda's stock has lost 3.8%, outperforming 4.6% decline recorded by the  it belongs to.Honda currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $62.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $61.40 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of PCAR, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $64.10/share today.Because the $62.50 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 65%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of PCAR stock at the current price level of $64.10/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $65.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 3.74% if the stock gets called away at the September 21st expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if PCAR shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for PACCAR Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing PCAR's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $65.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $65.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

In the last reported quarter, it delivered a positive surprise of 15.7%. Of the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed estimates in three while meeting in one. The average positive surprise was 10.3%.In the past six months, shares of Harley-Davidson have underperformed the  it belongs to. The stock has lost 21.7% compared with the industry's 9.8% decline.Let's see, how things have shaped up for the upcoming announcement. | Tough competition and softness in the market have guided Harley-Davidson to lower its shipment expectation for second-quarter 2018. For the quarter under review, the company expects motorcycle shipments to be 67,500-72,500 units compared with 81,807 shipped in the year-ago period. For the to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total motorcycle shipments is 71,668 units.In June, Harley-Davidson announced its plan to shift production of motorcycles that are sold in European Union (EU) countries from the United States to international facilities. The plan was considered after the EU hiked import tariffs to 31% for products manufactured in the United States, effective Jun 22, 2018.New tariffs will increase costs to approximately $2,200 per average motorcycle for the company if it continues to ship motorcycles from the United States. Per Harley-Davidson, this will roughly increase costs to $30-$45 million for the rest of 2018. The mentioned figures suggest the shifting of production to be a better option. However, in order to make the international facilities eligible for ramped up production, Harley-Davidson has to make investments in those facilities. Additionally, the upgradation will require at least 9-18 months to be fully ready.Harley-Davidson is already experiencing rising costs related to manufacturing processing optimization. This, along with increased tariffs and production shifting will put more strain on the company's margin.However, the company pays a regular dividend to its shareholders. For second-quarter 2018, it announced a cash dividend of 37 cents per share paid on Jun 15. Earlier, in the first quarter, the cash dividend was hiked 1.4% from 36.5 cents paid in the prior-year quarter.Over a month, Harley-Davidson's stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter and annual earnings being revised 0.7% and 0.3% downward, respectively.For the soon-to-be-released quarterly results, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of Motorcycles and Related Products segment is pegged at $1.4 billion, up from the first quarter's total revenues of $1.12 billion.Similarly, the consensus estimate for total revenues of the company's Financial Services segment stand at $192 million, rising from the first quarter's total revenues of $178 million.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Harley-Davidson is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because, a stock needs to have both a positive  and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below. : Harley-Davidson has an Earnings ESP of -1.48% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.33 and $1.35, respectively. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . : Harley-Davidson currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Here are a few stocks worth considering from the same space, with the right combination of elements to outpace earnings estimates this time around:PACCAR Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +1.31% and is a #2 Ranked player. Its second-quarter 2018 results are slated to be announced on Jul 24.You can see  .LKQ Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +2.43% and a Zacks Rank #1. Its second-quarter 2018 results are expected to be released on Jul 26.Oshkosh Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +3.09% and has a Zacks Rank of 2. The company is scheduled to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jul 31.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6% and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

In fact, there are significant opportunities for the firm in the Eagle Ford where it owns about 3,400 undrilled locations.

After all, who wouldn't want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let's put  stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock's current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, PACCAR has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12.7, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.6. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, PACCAR's current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years. Moreover, the current level is fairly below the highs for this stock, suggesting it might be a good entry point.However, the stock's PE compares slightly unfavorably with the industry's trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 11.6. This indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now, compared to its peers.Nonetheless, we should point out that PACCAR has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year's earnings) of just 11.0, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for PACCAR stock in the near term too.Another key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock's price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, PACCAR has a P/S ratio of about 1.0. This is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, PCAR is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading-at least compared to historical norms.In aggregate, PACCAR currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes PACCAR a solid choice for value investors.Though PACCAR might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of D. This gives PCAR a Zacks VGM score-or its overarching fundamental grade-of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  )Meanwhile, the company's recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen no estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to one lower, while the full year estimate has seen three upward and one downward revision in the same time period.As a result, the current quarter consensus estimate has remained unchanged in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched up by 0.9%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below: | This somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.PACCAR is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Moreover, a strong industry rank (Top 42% out of more than 250 industries) further supports the growth potential of the stock.However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the industry has underperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick. Moreover, broader factors at the industry level support the growth potential of the company as well.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

On Jun 22, the American President threatened to levy a tariff of 20% on cars and other automobiles imported from EU countries.With the President giving warnings of raising import tariffs on foreign-made cars, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group of mostly U.S. automobile manufacturers, shared its concerns. Auto Alliance warned that such high auto tariffs may eventually raise production costs, reduce car demand and result in high job loss.In a letter to the U.S. Department of Commerce, Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, also known as Auto Alliance said that a tariff of 20% will lead to \"increased producer costs,\" which in turn will raise overall car costs. Additionally, the trade group estimated that after new tariffs are placed, the average price of a car will increase to $5,800. It also anticipated that the auto industry may have to bear a total tax of $45 billion after tariff raise, following this development.In fact, the trade group in its letter cautioned that higher auto tariffs will be a drag for car sales and lead to \"less tax receipts.\" Auto Alliance added that a low level of car sales \"will lead to fewer jobs,\" which will affect numerous families and ultimately the entire economy.Meanwhile, the U.S. Commerce Department is investigating whether auto-imports are actually a big threat to the country's security. If Commerce Department's probe findings reveal that they are a national threat, Trump's auto-tariff initiative will gain ground and will create tension for the U.S. automakers.It has been months now that auto manufacturers have begun discussions with the Trump administration in an attempt to prevent a full-on trade war. Several major automakers of the U.S., in their letter to the U.S. Department of Commerce, showed their concerns of a possible decline in car sales and job losses following high tariffs. Further, they have used a report by the Peterson Institute for International Economics to highlight their worries.As per the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a private, non-profit research institution devoted to international economics, a 25% auto tariff will lead to \"a 1.5 percent decline in production.\" Additionally, the institution expects that around 195,000 domestic workers may lose their job for a period of one to three years or even higher. They added that in case other such countries retaliate with similar tariffs, about 624,000 U.S. workers will be rendered jobless.Given this scenario, companies related to the domestic auto industry will definitely suffer. Market leaders of the  , General Motors Company  and Ford Motor Company  are visibly at the receiving end. While General Motors holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Ford Motor has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see  .Other companies that could be affected by the new auto tariffs are PACCAR Inc  , Tesla, Inc.  and Harley-Davidson, Inc.  .Undoubtedly, the auto industry is going through a bad phase, following President Trump's decision to impose a tariff of 20% on cars and other automobiles imported from other countries. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers clearly showed its concern over higher auto tariffs and expects a dip in auto sales and witness steep job loss. So, it can be concluded that Trump-imposed new auto tariffs are expected to dampen investor sentiment for auto stocks in the days to come.Zacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

Every week, Tracey will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life. To listen to the podcast, click here:(  )Welcome to Episode #98 of the Value Investor Podcast.Every week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks  , shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.For the last couple of years, the large-cap stocks dominated the headlines. The S&P 500, the Dow and the NASDAQ outperformed the small cap indexes.But in 2018, the tide has recently turned.The small cap index, the Russell 2000, is easily outperforming the large caps which have weakened on trade and tariff worries.But you know what that means. There's value in some of those large caps now.Where are the buying opportunities?Tracey did a basic screen to find cheap large cap stocks.She screened for stocks with a market cap above $10 billion and a forward P/E below 15. P/E is not always the best metric for finding value, but in this screen, it will be a good enough basic indicator to get the cheap stocks.She then added on the Zacks Rank, screening only for Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) stocks. By having those Ranks, it should mean that earnings estimates are on the rise.It's one thing to buy a cheap stock, but it's a whole new ballgame to get a cheap stock that is also growing its earnings.The screen returned 62 stocks, which isn't too shabby.Tracey narrowed it down to her 5 favorite names.1.  is one of the mega-cap biotechnology companies. These have been out of favor for a while now. It has a forward P/E of 13.6 and rewards investors' patience with a 2.9% dividend yield. Analysts are bullish with earnings on the rise for both 2018 and 2019.2.  is a Texas-based regional bank with a market cap of $16 billion. In April, it raised its dividend 13%. It now yields 1.5%. Earnings are expected to pop 42% in 2018 and with a low P/E, it has a PEG ratio of 0.7. That means it is both a value and growth stock. That's a rare combination.3.  is one of the largest oil companies in the United States with a market cap of $234 billion. Earnings are expected to jump 130% thanks to the increase in the price of oil yet the shares trade with a forward P/E of just 14.4. You also get a juicy dividend, which was not cut during the oil price plunge years.4.  is one of the \"boring\" technology companies as it makes notebooks, desktops and printers. But one look at its fundamentals and you can see why its attractive. Earnings are expected to rise 21% in fiscal 2018 and analyst estimates are on the rise for both F2018 and F2019. It's also really cheap, with a forward P/E of just 11.5.5.  is a global manufacturer of light, medium and heavy-duty trucks under the brands of Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF. It has a market cap of $21.9 billion and reported a record quarter in the first quarter. Orders for US & Canada Class 8 trucks were more than double a year ago, prompting PACCAR to raise its full year industry sales range. It's trading at just 11x and earnings are expected to jump 32% in 2018.Wall Street has been ignoring value stocks for a couple of years.But the tide might be turning in 2018.Suddenly, the cheap large cap stocks are holding their own and, in some cases, even beating the returns of the major indexes.Should you be buying the big caps on this weakness?Find out the answer to this, and more, in this week's podcast.Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It's a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Media ContactZacks 800-767-3771 ext. 9339Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Among the largest underlying components of ONEY, in trading today Target Corp (Symbol: TGT) is up about 1.9%, Cummins, Inc. (Symbol: CMI) is up about 0.1%, and PACCAR Inc. (Symbol: PCAR) is lower by about 0.1%.  The chart below shows the one year price performance of ONEY, versus its 200 day moving average:Looking at the chart above, ONEY's low point in its 52 week range is $65.47 per share, with $75.25 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $69.95. Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique --  . Exchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Chicago, IL - June 27, 2018 - Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses the Industry: Domestic Autos, including Fox Factory Holding Corp.  , Tesla, Inc.  and PACCAR Inc.  .Industry: Domestic AutosLink: The strong sales momentum witnessed by the U.S. auto industry in 2015 and 2016 did not continue in 2017. However, in 2018, industry sales have been trending higher, helped in no small measure by a positive economic backdrop and dealer discounts. The strong job market and favorable tax measures have boosted consumer demand, which in turn is driving sales.In the year so far, concerns about high interest rates and growing  have not stopped Americans from splurging on sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and pickup trucks. This has led to strong unit sales of SUVs, crossovers and pickup trucks. In fact, this changing preference, from conventional passenger cars towards spacious vehicles, has prompted automakers to reorient their business strategies. In the changing situation, big discounts are playing a huge role in helping automakers grab a higher share of the market or at least retain their share. However, these discounts are putting pressure on their margins.Industry players also have to contend with the need to invest in all-electric vehicle (EVs) and autonomous driving technology. In between all these developments, recalls remain an overhang.Broader economic growth has not been enough to give market participants confidence in the industry's outlook. With sales already at or near record levels, many in the market suspect that the direction of change in sales will be to the downside going forward. Importantly, the need to maintain sales levels is forcing industry players to offer incentives that eat into margins. The rising interest rate environment is an issue as well.The  , which is an eight-stock group within the broader  that includes companies like Ford and GM, has underperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector over the past year.While the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 2%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Auto, Tires And Trucks Sector have rallied 13.5% and 9.2%, respectively (the blue line in the chart below represents the industry).We can look at a variety of valuation metrics to evaluate the industry's valuation picture and all of those will likely help us reach the same conclusion. But given the high capital intensity of the space, the appropriate metric is the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio or multiple. This metric takes into consideration equity as well as the level of debt. Also, this metric is not impacted by differing capital structures and does not take into account the effect of non-cash expenses.Owing to the industry underperformance over the past year, the valuation picture appears attractive, in comparison to the S&P 500. The industry currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 8.6X, at a discount to the S&P 500's EV/EBITDA ratio 11.5X. As the chart below shows, the industry has traded as high as 12.7X and as low as 10.7X, with a 12-month median of 11.4X.Looking at industry's valuation history relative to the broader market, we find out that the industry traded at a premium to the S&P 500 index from January 2012 through January 2015 and has been trading at a discount since mid-2015.The chart below compares the industry's valuation picture with its sector. As would be expected, the two track each other fairly closely, though the industry is currently trading at a modest premium to the sector. As the chart shows, the industry traded at a premium to the sector through year-end 2017 and has been trading at a discount this year.This valuation discussion shows that the group's valuation is attractive. But offsetting this seemingly favorable valuation picture is the long list of issues plaguing the space, ranging from trade issues (the future of Nafta) to the negative earnings impact of discounts.The positive macroeconomic drivers are likely to be offset by operating challenges encountered by the industry, keeping a lid on shareholders' returns.The industry's recent stock market underperformance notwithstanding, the more relevant question for investors pertains to handicapping how the industry will perform over the coming weeks and months.A good handle on the industry's, and companies', evolving earnings outlook can help answer that question for us. Empirical research shows that earnings outlook for the industry, a reflection of the earnings revisions trend for the constituent companies, has a direct bearing on its stock market performance.The Price & Consensus chart for the industry below shows the market's evolving bottom-up earnings expectations for the industry and the industry's aggregate stock market performance. The red line in the chart represents the Zacks measure of consensus earnings expectations for 2019, while the light blue line represents the same for 2018.This becomes even clearer by focusing on the aggregate bottom-up EPS revisions trend. The chart below shows the evolution of aggregate consensus expectations for 2018.Please note that the -$2.61 EPS estimate for the industry for 2018 is not the actual bottom-up dollar EPS estimate for every company in the Zacks Domestic Auto industry, but rather an illustrative aggregate number created by our proprietary analytics model. The key factor to keep in mind is not the loss of -$2.61 per share of the industry for 2018, but how this estimate has evolved recently.While the consensus loss estimate for the Zacks Domestic Auto industry of $2.61 per share implies mostly a decent year-over-year improvement, the trend in earnings estimate revisions has not been favorable lately.Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group's earnings potential.The consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year has been revised 8.8% downward since Mar 31, 2018.However, the group's  , which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates the possibility of outperformance in the near term.The Zacks Computer Software industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #101, which places it at the top 39% of more than 256 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Since the past month, the group's mean estimate of long-term EPS growth rate has been decreasing to reach the current level of 8.5%. This compares to 9.8% for the Zacks S&P 500 composite. However, before that, the long-term EPS growth prospects for the industry were better than the Zacks S&P 500 composite index.Revenue growth figure for the industry shows that since the end of 2015, revenues for the group have been increasing. However, gross profit has witnessed a declining trend since the end of 2016.A closer look at the domestic auto industry brings some interesting facts. Cheap valuation and improving industry rank are some bright spots. Moreover, these two fundamental factors are further bolstered by solid macro economy.However, several changes and challenges put a huge strain on the profitability of the industry as a whole. The fat discount to sell vehicles corroborates the phenomenon of a recent rise in revenues with strained profits. Added to this, the bleak earnings outlook does not brighten the prospects for shareholders' returns. Trade uncertainty, particularly the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) also has a direct bearing on the industry's fture.While none of the stocks in our domestic auto universe currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), below are three stocks that have been witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions and carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).(You can see  .) : The stock of this Scotts Valley, CA-based automobile company has gained 18% over the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year EPS was revised 2.8% upward over the last 60 days. : The stock of this Palo Alto, CA-based auto company has gained 6.8% over the past six months. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-quarter loss narrowed down from $2.63 per share to $2.59 per share over the last 30 days. : The stock of this Bellevue, WA-based manufacturer of heavy-duty trucks has lost 12.3% over the past six months. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year EPS was revised 0.4% upward over the last 30 days.It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

For the WisdomTree U.S. Earnings 500 Fund ETF (Symbol: EPS), we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $35.11 per unit.With EPS trading at a recent price near $30.43 per unit, that means that analysts see 15.38% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings. Three of EPS's underlying holdings with notable upside to their analyst target prices are Owens Corning (Symbol: OC),  Holding Corp (Symbol: AMTD), and PACCAR Inc. (Symbol: PCAR). Although OC has traded at a recent price of $64.17/share, the average analyst target is 35.34% higher at $86.85/share. Similarly, AMTD has 25.29% upside from the recent share price of $55.29 if the average analyst target price of $69.27/share is reached, and analysts on average are expecting PCAR to reach a target price of $74.38/share, which is 20.44% above the recent price of $61.76.

In between all these developments, recalls remain an overhang.Broader economic growth has not been enough to give market participants confidence in the industry's outlook. With sales already at or near record levels, many in the market suspect that the direction of change in sales will be to the downside going forward. Importantly, the need to maintain sales levels is forcing industry players to offer incentives that eat into margins. The rising interest rate environment is an issue as well.The  , which is an eight-stock group within the broader  that includes companies like Ford and GM, has underperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector over the past year.While the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 2%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Auto, Tires And Trucks Sector have rallied 13.5% and 9.2%, respectively (the blue line in the chart below represents the industry).We can look at a variety of valuation metrics to evaluate the industry's valuation picture and all of those will likely help us reach the same conclusion. But given the high capital intensity of the space, the appropriate metric is the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio or multiple. This metric takes into consideration equity as well as the level of debt. Also, this metric is not impacted by differing capital structures and does not take into account the effect of non-cash expenses.Owing to the industry underperformance over the past year, the valuation picture appears attractive, in comparison to the S&P 500. The industry currently has a trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 8.6X, at a discount to the S&P 500's EV/EBITDA ratio 11.5X. As the chart below shows, the industry has traded as high as 12.7X and as low as 10.7X, with a 12-month median of 11.4X.Looking at industry's valuation history relative to the broader market, we find out that the industry traded at a premium to the S&P 500 index from January 2012 through January 2015 and has been trading at a discount since mid-2015.The chart below compares the industry's valuation picture with its sector. As would be expected, the two track each other fairly closely, though the industry is currently trading at a modest premium to the sector. As the chart shows, the industry traded at a premium to the sector through year-end 2017 and has been trading at a discount this year.This valuation discussion shows that the group's valuation is attractive. But offsetting this seemingly favorable valuation picture is the long list of issues plaguing the space, ranging from trade issues (the future of Nafta) to the negative earnings impact of discounts.The positive macroeconomic drivers are likely to be offset by operating challenges encountered by the industry, keeping a lid on shareholders' returns.The industry's recent stock market underperformance notwithstanding, the more relevant question for investors pertains to handicapping how the industry will perform over the coming weeks and months.A good handle on the industry's, and companies', evolving earnings outlook can help answer that question for us. Empirical research shows that earnings outlook for the industry, a reflection of the earnings revisions trend for the constituent companies, has a direct bearing on its stock market performance.The Price & Consensus chart for the industry below shows the market's evolving bottom-up earnings expectations for the industry and the industry's aggregate stock market performance. The red line in the chart represents the Zacks measure of consensus earnings expectations for 2019, while the light blue line represents the same for 2018.This becomes even clearer by focusing on the aggregate bottom-up EPS revisions trend. The chart below shows the evolution of aggregate consensus expectations for 2018.Please note that the -$2.61 EPS estimate for the industry for 2018 is not the actual bottom-up dollar EPS estimate for every company in the Zacks Domestic Auto industry, but rather an illustrative aggregate number created by our proprietary analytics model. The key factor to keep in mind is not the loss of -$2.61 per share of the industry for 2018, but how this estimate has evolved recently.While the consensus loss estimate for the Zacks Domestic Auto industry of $2.61 per share implies mostly a decent year-over-year improvement, the trend in earnings estimate revisions has not been favorable lately.Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are losing confidence in this group's earnings potential.The consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year has been revised 8.8% downward since Mar 31, 2018.However, the group's  , which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates the possibility of outperformance in the near term.The Zacks Computer Software industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #101, which places it at the top 39% of more than 256 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry's rank has continuously improved over the past five weeks.Since the past month, the group's mean estimate of long-term EPS growth rate has been decreasing to reach the current level of 8.5%. This compares to 9.8% for the Zacks S&P 500 composite. However, before that, the long-term EPS growth prospects for the industry were better than the Zacks S&P 500 composite index.Revenue growth figure for the industry shows that since the end of 2015, revenues for the group have been increasing. However, gross profit has witnessed a declining trend since the end of 2016.A closer look at the domestic auto industry brings some interesting facts. Cheap valuation and improving industry rank are some bright spots. Moreover, these two fundamental factors are further bolstered by solid macro economy.However, several changes and challenges put a huge strain on the profitability of the industry as a whole. The fat discount to sell vehicles corroborates the phenomenon of a recent rise in revenues with strained profits. Added to this, the bleak earnings outlook does not brighten the prospects for shareholders' returns. Trade uncertainty, particularly the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) also has a direct bearing on the industry's fture.While none of the stocks in our domestic auto universe currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), below are three stocks that have been witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions and carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).(You can see  .) (FOXF): The stock of this Scotts Valley, CA-based automobile company has gained 18% over the past year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year EPS was revised 2.8% upward over the last 60 days.(TSLA): The stock of this Palo Alto, CA-based auto company has gained 6.8% over the past six months. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-quarter loss narrowed down from $2.63 per share to $2.59 per share over the last 30 days. (PCAR): The stock of this Bellevue, WA-based manufacturer of heavy-duty trucks has lost 12.3% over the past six months.

(Symbol: PCAR) saw new options begin trading this week, for the February 2019 expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 239 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the PCAR options chain for the new February 2019 contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $60.00 strike price has a current bid of $4.30. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $60.00, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $55.70 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of PCAR, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $61.23/share today.Because the $60.00 strike represents an approximate 2% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 59%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  . Should the contract expire worthless, the premium would represent a 7.17% return on the cash commitment, or 10.94% annualized - at Stock Options Channel we call this the  .Below is a chart showing the trailing twelve month trading history for PACCAR Inc., and highlighting in green where the $60.00 strike is located relative to that history:Turning to the calls side of the option chain, the call contract at the $62.50 strike price has a current bid of $4.80. If an investor was to purchase shares of PCAR stock at the current price level of $61.23/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $62.50. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 9.91% if the stock gets called away at the February 2019 expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if PCAR shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for PACCAR Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing PCAR's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $62.50 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $62.50 strike represents an approximate 2% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 50%. On our website under the  , Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change and publish a chart of those numbers (the trading history of the option contract will also be charted).

Earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.31. Results were aided by record quarterly truck deliveries, robust Parts revenues and pretax profits.During the quarter, PACCAR posted quarterly consolidated net sales and revenues of $5.65 billion. Its revenues from the Truck, Parts and Other segment were $5.32 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of revenues was $5.03 billion.Revenues from the Truck, Parts and Other segment increased to $5.32 billion in first-quarter 2018 from $3.94 billion in first-quarter 2017. The segment's pre-tax income increased to $591.9 million from $383.3 million, recorded a year ago.Revenues from the Financial Services segment (comprising a portfolio of 187,000 trucks and trailers with total assets of $13.59 billion) rose to $332.2 million from $302.2 million a year ago.

This indicates a robust economy and strong freight demand. The company raised estimates of 2018 Class 8 truck industry retail sales for the U.S. and Canada to 265,000-285,000 vehicles, up from the previous range of 235,000-265,000 trucks.In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been five revisions higher for the current quarter compared to three lower. | At this time, PCAR has a nice Growth Score of B and a grade with the same score on the momentum front. The stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is more suitable for value investors than those looking for growth and momentum.Estimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising.

Moreover, the newly estimated range is much higher than 218,000 units of retail sales generated in 2017.In first-quarter 2018, this leading truck manufacturer saw a year-over-year increase in revenues and adjusted earnings. Moreover, both earnings and sales surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. Furthermore, a strong balance sheet and outstanding long-term earnings are enabling PACCAR to invest in innovative products and new technologies. In 2018, the company aims to invest $300-$320 million under research and development expenses, to develop new truck models and powertrains, enabled with electric, hybrid and hydrogen fuel-cell technologies. | Further, PACCAR has been paying regular dividends to its shareholders since 1941. Recently, in May, PACCAR's board approved 12% increase in the quarterly dividend on common stock to 27 cents. The revised dividend was paid on Jun 5 to shareholders of record as of May 15, 2018. Earlier, in March, the company paid a quarterly dividend of 25 cents.However, PACCAR faces fierce competition from its peers at the commercial truck market in the United States and Canada. This might hamper the company's sales and pricing. Also, an increase in the supply of used trucks has led to declining prices, which might be a headwind for PACCAR.In the past three months, PACCAR's stock has moved down 3.3%, underperforming 11.2% increase of the  it belongs to.Currently, PACCAR has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The recent demand for trucks and sports utility vehicles (SUVs) among the customers forced Ford to take this decision.Per data, compiled by a trade group of automakers, the company's production at its Mexican facilities declined 31% in April, marking the lowest April production since 2009. Further, exports from Mexico witnessed a decrease, including a slump of 36% in units exported to the United States.The slump in output from Mexican facilities is due to Ford's strategic shift in its U.S. market. The company has been focusing more on SUVs and trucks, and is disposing of its less-selling sedan models. Out of the sedans manufactured in Mexico, Fiesta subcompact, Ford Fusion and Lincoln MKZ are already losing popularity in the United States.Ford is frequently adjusting its production, depending on demands in the North American market, in sync with its goal to reduce inventory.

Honda  , Ford Motors  and Toyota  saw declines of 9%, 4.7% and 4.7%, respectively, while Fiat Chrysler  auto sales rose 5%. Notably, General Motors  will no longer provide monthly sales data (read:  ).The dismal performance came on the heels of waning consumer demand after a long boom and intensified competition, which has led to more car production, resulting in increased inventory.Consumers have long been shifting from traditional passenger cars in favor of larger and more comfortable pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers. But the number of new models is now growing faster than demand, threatening the fat profits that automakers have enjoyed over the past several years. Additionally, higher rates have made financing of new vehicles expensive.Further, Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs may deal a big blow to the industry as these would increase the cost of auto production. Notably, the auto sector accounted for 26% of demand for steel in the United States in 2017, lagging the construction industry, which accounted for 40%, according to data provider Statista (read:  ).Weak earnings expectation is an added challenge as the sector is expected to post earnings decline of  for this year, following earnings growth of 2.9% last year.A strong economy, low unemployment, increasing consumer confidence, higher spending, fuel-efficient and technologically enriched vehicles, and still-low financing rates and gasoline prices will fuel the industry.

According to media reports, Matthew Schwall is now a part of Alphabet  company Waymo's safety team led by former National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Deputy Administrator Ron Medford.Tesla should feel the pinch here as Schwall was its director of field-performance engineering and the main technical contact on safety matters, dealing with regulatory bodies like the NHTSA and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).The departure follows that of Jim Kellar, Tesla's Autopilot head in charge of building an AI chip, who moved to Intel  in April. Its corporate treasurer and chief accounting officer also jumped ship recently.It's almost as if leading executives at the company are losing confidence in its ability to deliver self-driving technology, especially as the number of accidents involving Teslas continues to increase.To be fair, Tesla has the maximum number of vehicles with some form of self-driving technology out there, so it makes sense that Teslas would also meet with the maximum number of accidents. Also, not every accident can be attributed to the self-driving tech because Autopilot may not have been in operation in all cases, or may have alerted the driver who didn't for some reason take back control. So it would have been fooled only in some of the cases.But each time there's an accident, we go back to arguing about whether semi-autonomous is more dangerous than fully autonomous and essentially, whether AI can really ever be as good as a human being.This WSJ article by Christopher Mims hits the nail on the head: \"Deep learning - the \"intelligent\" component of these systems - is \"brittle, opaque and shallow,\" says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology and neural science at New York University and the former head of Uber's AI lab.AI is brittle because it can't carry over insights from one context to another, opaque because humans can't evaluate its neuron-like tangle of connections, and shallow because it's easy to fool. You can't just throw more deep learning at a problem and expect it to be as good as a human, says Dr. Marcus.\"In short, the technology just isn't there yet. Doesn't mean it never will be. But it does mean that it will take time, and we don't yet know how much more time. Waymo's fully autonomous taxi service is already operational on a tiny scale, so maybe we'll know soon.Meanwhile, Musk has other things on his mind, such as Model 3 production volumes. Aside from the negative press and slumping share prices that's doing the company no good reputation-wise and also in terms of its capital raising prospects, the company really does need to do more volumes if it wants to be profitable this year.That's probably why SVP of engineering, Doug Field is taking a sabbatical while Musk has a go at production responsibilities himself. Field has been overseeing both engineering and production over the past year to better align the two departments (another Musk experiment). A Tesla spokesperson told CNBC: \"Doug is just taking some time off to recharge and spend time with his family. He has not left Tesla.\"Analysts still expect Tesla to generate a 61% revenue increase this year as well as a 75 cent reduction in the loss per share. In 2019, revenue growth is expected to slow down to about 38% with the company finally generating a $2.46 per share profit.Tesla's revenue topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last-reported quarter by 7.5% although the loss per share was just a couple of cents lower than expected.What's more, the primary driver of auto revenue growth of 19% from the year-ago quarter was the jump in Model 3 deliveries. Management said that first quarter 2018 orders were even higher than the strong orders in the third and fourth quarters of 2017, so buyer interest in the cars continues to increase.The company delivered a total of 29,997 cars, of which 9,766 were Model 3s.While gross margin improvements continue, there will be further improvements once the new automated production line in Germany is operational. So figuring out the battery module line and getting Germany online will help Tesla get to the magic 5,000 number and also help it generate stronger gross margins.Tesla is currently the most-shorted stock, so there are a lot of bears out there. But for those willing to take a look at the numbers and consider that the shares are down 2.7% year to date, this may be just the time to accumulate the shares.

(Symbol: PCAR) saw new options begin trading this week, for the June 15th expiration. At  , our YieldBoost formula has looked up and down the PCAR options chain for the new June 15th contracts and identified one put and one call contract of particular interest.The put contract at the $62.50 strike price has a current bid of $1.50. If an investor was to sell-to-open that put contract, they are committing to purchase the stock at $62.50, but will also collect the premium, putting the cost basis of the shares at $61.00 (before broker commissions). To an investor already interested in purchasing shares of PCAR, that could represent an attractive alternative to paying $64.18/share today.Because the $62.50 strike represents an approximate 3% discount to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the put contract would expire worthless. The current analytical data (including greeks and implied greeks) suggest the current odds of that happening are 64%. Stock Options Channel will track those odds over time to see how they change, publishing a chart of those numbers on our website under the  .

If an investor was to purchase shares of PCAR stock at the current price level of $64.18/share, and then sell-to-open that call contract as a \"covered call,\" they are committing to sell the stock at $65.00. Considering the call seller will also collect the premium, that would drive a total return (excluding dividends, if any) of 4.16% if the stock gets called away at the June 15th expiration (before broker commissions). Of course, a lot of upside could potentially be left on the table if PCAR shares really soar, which is why looking at the trailing twelve month trading history for PACCAR Inc., as well as studying the business fundamentals becomes important. Below is a chart showing PCAR's trailing twelve month trading history, with the $65.00 strike highlighted in red:Considering the fact that the $65.00 strike represents an approximate 1% premium to the current trading price of the stock (in other words it is out-of-the-money by that percentage), there is also the possibility that the covered call contract would expire worthless, in which case the investor would keep both their shares of stock and the premium collected.

Some experts look at technical analysis patterns, others look at valuation metrics, others apply a broad macro view of the economy. In this article, we present another forecasting approach that investors may find interesting. The S&P 500 is really a collection of five hundred individual stocks, each with specified weighting applied towards the total. For each of those individual stocks, all of the major brokerage houses out there ask their best analysts to thoroughly study the company and then come up with a 12-month price target. Taking all of the different price targets from all of the major analysts, we can then compute an average target for that stock. In a sense this average target represents a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, because so many individual minds contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.But we can take it a step further, comparing the current stock price against that average analyst target, to calculate how much upside exists if the average target price is reached, and we can do that same exercise for each and every component. Here at  , we have done this exercise for all of the individual components of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (Symbol: SPY), and then weighted the results together to determine the implied average analyst target for the ETF itself. For the SPDR S&P 500 ETF, we found that the implied analyst target price for the ETF based upon its underlying holdings is $301.58 per unit.With SPY trading at a recent price near $272.21 per unit, that means that analysts see 10.79% upside for this ETF looking through to the average analyst targets of the underlying holdings.

A strong jobs market and favorable tax measures spurred consumer demand, which in turn pushed up sales. The March sales upsurge is in contrast to what the auto industry witnessed in the past year.In fact, in 2017, U.S. vehicle sales declined for the first time since the financial crisis. It slipped to 17.2 million from 17.55 million in 2016. Last year's decline notwithstanding, the overall level of sales aren't that far from all-time record levels.Elevated consumer confidence, a strong job market, big discount and a growing U.S. economy have aided this rise. Even concerns over high interest rates and growing  could not stop Americans from splurging on sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and pickup trucks. This has led to strong unit sales of SUVs, crossovers and pickup trucks.Per Autodata, auto industry sales rose 2.5% to 1,653,529 while new vehicle sales gained 6% in March. Moreover, seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) was 17.5 million in comparison to 16.8 million, a year ago. General Motors Company posted a sales increase of 15.7% year over year to 296,341 vehicles.This upside was attributable to the Chevrolet, GMC, Buick and Cadillac brands. Ford Motor Company announced a 3.5% rise in year-over-year sales to 244,306 vehicles, boosted by crossover and truck sales. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. reported 13.6% growth in year-over-year sales to 216,063 vehicles in the United States.There are also other reasons to be optimistic about the broader auto industry for both the short and the long run. Below, we highlight those that should drive the sector's performance in the near to medium term.According to a recent report by the Federal Reserve, unemployment has dropped from 10% in October 2009 to 4.1%. This is the lowest level in about 20 years. About 17 million jobs have been added through this expansion. The labor market has remained robust and is likely to also remain strong in the future.Additionally, growing household wealth, stable income gains and elevated consumer confidence continue to support consumer spending. Also, fiscal sops and accommodative financial measures are aiding both household spending and business environments. These positive macroeconomic factors are likely to aid the U.S. auto sector at least in the near term.Leading rating agency Moody's has upgraded its outlook for the global auto industry from negative to stable. Improving business conditions have partly led to this rating upgrade. The rating agency has further added that it anticipates sales of cars, SUVs and light trucks to be higher this year than the previous projection.In fact, prospects for growth are improving for the majority of the auto markets in the world. Moody's anticipates 1.5% rise in sales for 2018, unchanged from its previous projection. In addition, the rating agency expects U.S. auto sales to shrink less in 2018 than its previous forecast.The increasing average age of vehicles on U.S. roads is adding to the replacement demand for cars as well as car parts. The steadily improving quality of vehicles is mainly behind this rise in average age of vehicles over time. According to IHS Automotive, as of 2016, the average age of light vehicles was 11.6 years, whereas it was 9.9 years a decade ago. Moreover, by 2021, around 81 million vehicles are expected to be over 16 years old compared with 62 million vehicles today. This will benefit replacement part manufacturers and retailers, apart from new vehicle manufacturers.Of late, the self-driving industry has been growing by leaps and bounds. In fact, a few cases of accidents have not deterred the confidence of the auto giants to enter into this field in a big way. Several leading automobile and technology companies have been pouring in a huge amount of money to develop the niche technology and raise their market share. Huge prospects of self-deriving vehicles to transform the auto industry and the transportation landscape have mainly resulted in this lofty investment.In order to stay in competition, automakers have to constantly strive toward introducing new and attractive, technologically advanced vehicles. A majority of automakers are revamping their popular vehicles with new technologies and visual appeal. Features such as backup cameras, automatic emergency braking and in-car connectivity are common in most vehicle segments.The solid outlook for the economy is certainly a blessing for the auto sector, which is facing a myriad challenges. Moreover, given the rising thrust on the self-driving industry, the auto space is gradually moving toward a seismic shift.At this juncture, we recommend stocks such as PACCAR Inc. and Honda Motor Co., Ltd., each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see  .PACCAR has an expected long-term growth rate of 9.8%. In the past year, shares of the company have gained 2.1%.Allison Transmission has an expected long-term growth rate of 10%. In a year, shares of the company have returned 12.7%.Honda has an expected long-term growth rate of 4.8%. In a year's time, shares of the company have returned 18.6%.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because PACCAR is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings - with the most up-to-date information possible - is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for PCAR in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.33 per share for PCAR, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.31 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for PCAR, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.23% heading into earnings season. | A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that PCAR has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings.

The first two months of 2018 were also unimpressive for the auto sector, but the growth trend came back in March, with the major automakers registering strong sales. A robust job market and favorable tax laws have worked in favor of sales. Moreover, rising demand for profitable crossovers, sports utility vehicles (SUVs) and pickups are also aiding the auto industry.However, the auto space has also grappled with several challenges. Trade tensions between China and the United States, the compulsion to embrace various changes, and safety recall issues are some of the challenges faced by the automakers.Also, the industry is going through a transition. The necessity of manufacturing electric vehicles in a profitable way is fast becoming a big challenge for automakers. In recent times, General Motors Company and Ford Motor Company have added some new EVs to their individual lineup. German auto major, Volkswagen AG is also committed to introduce new energy vehicles. Other automakers are also following suit.These challenges are showing up in the sector's stock market performance. Stocks in the Zacks Auto sector are down -2.6% in the year-to-date period, lagging the S&P 500 index's +0.4% gain. On a trailing 12-month basis, the sector's performance is roughly in-line with the S&P 500 index.The typical characteristics of the auto industry prompted us to have a dedicated sector for the industry in our database. The automobile sector is one of the 16 Zacks sectors, unlike the S&P classification, wherein autos is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector. The S&P has 10 sectors compared with the 16 sectors for Zacks.At the expanded classification level, the Zacks Auto sector is divided into six industries: Auto-Domestic, Auto-Foreign, Auto-Original Equipment, Auto-Replacement Parts, Auto-Internal Combustion Engines and Rubber-Tires. The level of sensitivity and exposure to the different stages of the economic cycle vary for each industry.We rank over 250 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors, based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. We put our industries into two groups - the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank). Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1. (To learn more visit:  .)The current Zacks Industry Rank is 116 for Automotive-Domestic (placing it at the top 45% of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries), 83 for Automotive-Foreign (placing it at the top 32% of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries), 88 for Automotive-Original Equipment (placing it at the top 34% of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries), 63 for Automotive-Replacement Parts (placing it at the top 25% of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries), 4 for Automotive-Internal Combustion Engines (placing it at the top 2% of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries), 116 for Rubber-Tires (placing it at the top 45% of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries).Looking at the exact location of these industries, one could say that the general outlook for the auto industry is Positive.The auto sector contributed 1.6% to the total S&P 500 earnings in 2017. This is nearly double its 0.8% market-cap weight in the index.Looking at the fourth-quarter 2017 results of the auto sector, earnings advanced 20.3%. Auto sector earnings are expected to rise 4.3% in the first quarter of 2018 and 19.4% in second-quarter 2018.Total revenues rose 30.2% year over year in fourth-quarter 2017. Revenues are expected to rise 24.3% in the first quarter of 2018 and 7% in second-quarter 2018.Earnings for 2018 are expected to decline 3.7% from 2017. Also, revenues for the year are expected to decrease 0.9%. Again, earnings for 2019 are expected to rise 0.2%, and revenues are projected to rise 0.5%.For more information on earnings for this sector and others, please read our latest  report.The auto sector currently has ample opportunities amid serious challenges. While a strong economy, robust demand for SUVs, attractive financing options and impressive vehicle launches are driving sales, rising auto loan defaults and high levels of safety recalls are acting as dampeners.At this juncture, we recommend stocks such as PACCAR Inc. and Honda Motor Co., Ltd., each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see  .PACCAR has an expected long-term growth rate of 9.8%. In the past year, shares of the company have gained 2.1%.Allison Transmission has an expected long-term growth rate of 10%.

Many of the bigwigs are slated to release results for the quarter ending Mar 31, 2018, by the end of this week. On Apr 19, Genuine Parts Company  and WABCO Holdings Inc.  reported first-quarter earnings. WABCO reported earnings beat for the quarter, while Genuine Parts missed the estimate.Per the latest  , 87 companies under the S&P 500 category have reported results. These companies' beat ratios were 82.8% and 67.8% for earnings and revenues, respectively.For first-quarter 2018, earnings for auto companies are expected to decline 9.6% on a year-over-year basis and revenues are likely to fall 3.4%. However, the S&P 500 companies are likely to see 18.3% and 7.7% year-over-year growth in earnings and revenues, respectively, in the quarter.In March, the automakers made a comeback after seeing declining U.S. sales in February 2018. An improved economy, product launches and customer discounts have helped auto companies witness a year-over-year rise in new vehicle sales. This uptick has encouraged automakers to introduce improved SUV and pick-up truck models under various brands, each catering to specific customer requirements. Further, a number of major auto companies have announced newer models which are expected to hit the showrooms in 2019.Meanwhile, in the world's largest automotive market China, auto sales rose 4.7% year over year to 2.66 million units in March after an 11% drop in February 2018. Per the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, first-quarter vehicles sales rose 2.8% on a year-over-year basis to around 7.2 million units.Now, let's take a closer look at two big names in the auto industry -  and  - which are set to announce results on Apr 24.We relied on the proven Zacks quantitative model, combining a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) with a positive  , to predict the chances of earnings beat this quarter.

Trade tensions between China and the United States, shifting preference pattern of the consumers, the compulsion to embrace various changes, and safety recall issues are some of the challenges faced by automakers.In fact, the industry is going through a transition. The necessity of manufacturing electric vehicles in a profitable way is fast becoming a big challenge for automakers.In fact, there are a number of factors that raise concerns for the auto sector in both the short and the long run. Below we discuss a few key challenges that the auto sector might face in the coming months.One serious problem automakers across the globe are facing is huge expenses pertaining to safety recalls. According to the data provided by the U.S. Transportation Department, automakers recalled 53.2 million vehicles in the United States in 2016, setting a new record. According to a report by Center for Auto Safety, there about 60 million vehicles on the road that are open to recalls and in need of repairs.Many auto giants such as Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), Ford Motor Company (F), Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC) and Volkswagen AG (VLKAY) have been facing recall issues in recent times and incurring huge expenses in this regard. strict emission standards and the proposals made by some Asian and European countries to restrict internal combustion engines driven by fossil fuels, many traditional automakers across the globe have geared up for electric vehicles. However, the new technology has yet to yield profits, which holds the key to the survival of any business entity.Presently, EVs account for less than 1% of U.S. vehicles sales and a small part of total vehicles sold across the globe. EV pioneer Tesla is losing money persistently.Despite these odds, conventional automakers are pouring in a huge amount of money to brace for an all-electric future. These companies are diverting profits generated from the sale of gasoline-fueled trucks and SUVs to invest in the expensive EV technology.A lucratively priced, high-quality used vehicles inventory has prompted consumers to think over the alternatives to buying new cars. This resulted in higher demand for used vehicles. In fact, a leading rating agency Moody's has projected that the used car and truck Consumer Price Index will suffer a year-over-year decline of 1.07% in 2019, whereas the decline was 3.63% in 2017. The rating agency further anticipates prices to stabilize in 2020.The price stability of used cars is not bad news for customers but definitely not good news for automakers and dealers. In fact, low prices of used vehicles compel automakers to offer higher discounts to customers on new vehicles, which in turn strain their margins.Moreover, per a research report by Technavio, the increased use of dedicated online sites to sell used cars is having a positive impact on the used-car market. The presence of several online car sales sites has enabled buyers to pick a used car through online sites.President Trump has imposed tariffs on two key commodities: steel and aluminum. However, any increase - tariff induced or otherwise - in the prices of these two important metals that the automobile space is crucially dependent on, will leave an adverse impact. In other words, U.S. automotive companies would lose their competitive capabilities to global rivals if tariffs are imposed on steel and aluminum.According to Moody's, huge competition in banks, finance companies and credit unions have resulted in loosening of the underwriting conditions. Presently, loan terms in the United States are longer than they were in 2010. Also, lenders are being allowed the facility to roll a significant part of the unpaid balance into new loans. This is leading to rising delinquency and its long-term effect can be serious.The majority share of the automobile market is held only by a few leading automakers. Moreover, high dependence on these automakers makes auto parts' suppliers vulnerable to pricing pressure and production cut. Pricing pressure from automakers constricts margins of parts suppliers. Simultaneously, frequent production cuts by automakers in order to cope with market adjustments affect suppliers' operations.Some auto industry suppliers that are dependent on a few major automakers are Meritor Inc. (MTOR), Tenneco Inc. (TEN) and Magna International Inc. (MGA).One distinctive feature of vehicles sales is that the sales of vehicles with lower efficiency have been strong in recent times. This indicates lack of demand for greener cars which is actually favored by policymakers across the globe. In fact, in recent times, sales of trucks and SUV, which are usually less fuel-efficient than passenger cars, have been on the rise.The auto industry continues to face a number of challenges. As a result, we would advise investors to dump stocks with a Zacks Rank # 4 or 5 such as Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG) and Autobytel Inc. (AUTO). Meanwhile, investors who continue to be optimistic about the sector can check out companies such as PACCAR Inc. (PCAR), Allison Transmission Holdings, Inc. (ALSN) and Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see  .PACCAR has an expected long-term growth rate of 9.8%. In the past year, shares of the company have gained 2.1%.Allison Transmission has an expected long-term growth rate of 10%. In a year, shares of the company have returned 12.7%.Honda has an expected long-term growth rate of 4.8%.

Image source: The Motley Fool.It's been an interesting start to the year for the stock market writ large and for our Motley Fool 100 Index specifically. A market-cap-weighted index that tracks the performance of The Motley Fool's 100 largest investing ideas, the Fool 100 was up 2.04% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to a 1.58% decline for the S&P 500. That's good, but we strive for better. The Fool 100's outperformance narrowed toward the end of the quarter due to declines in the value of big technology company stocks such as Facebook and Alphabet, which represent a hefty percentage of the Fool 100's composition.Having said that, we'd like to think this recent performance lends credibility to the simple idea that powers the Fool 100: We'd rather own all high-quality businesses than any low-quality businesses.To that end, we reconstitute the Fool 100 quarterly to make sure the index reflects our company's latest and greatest thinking on the stocks our analysts follow.

Red Hat, Discover, and Spectra entered the Fool 100 thanks to new buy recommendations from our analysts, while IDEXX, Palto Alto, and WestRock grew large enough to qualify for inclusion in our top 100 ideas.Those changes, though, were mostly on the margin, and the Fool 100 remained substantially the same, with low turnover, relatively more exposure to the technology and consumer discretionary sectors than the broader market, and recognizable names making up its top 10 constituents.\n  \nAs of April 2, 2018.To learn more about the Motley Fool 100 index, including all of the Fool picks that make up its 100 constituents, visit the Fool 100 website at  .When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Rising interest rates increase the cost to the consumer of financing an automobile. Rising commodity prices increase the cost of producing automobiles, which can either be borne by the automaker as an expense or passed along to the consumer, making cars more expensive to buy.The interest rate component is likely overblown. Rates are still historically low, especially for automobile loans, which are still around 4%. Every 25 basis point increase in that rate adds about $8 - $20 to the payment on a new car. That's hardly significant enough to deter almost anyone from purchasing a new car. The strength of the economy as a whole and record low levels of unemployment will have a much bigger impact.General Motors has been undeservedly battered in the recent selloff of auto stocks. Its price is off 15% YTD even as its Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimate has been revised upward. It currently trades at a forward P/E of 5.6X, versus the 7X of its closest competitor Ford Motors and an industry average of 9.9X. It earns a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and a Zacks Value Score of A. It also pays a 4.4% dividend, so a savvy investor is rewarded for waiting for the market to recognize the value in the stock.Toyota Motor Corporation also has a Zack's Rank #1 (Strong Buy). At a forward P/E of 8.4X, it's currently trading closer to the industry average than General Motors, but the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimate for 2018 has been revised upward several times already this year from $11.97/share to $15.16 - an increase of 26%.Additionally, though it manufactures automobiles globally, Toyota buys the vast majority of the steel and aluminum for the cars it produces in the U.S. from domestic suppliers, so it is not likely to suffer from the tariffs.Paccar, maker of Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF medium and heavy duty trucks, has had 2018 earning estimates revised upward by 9 of the 11 analysts included in the Zacks Consensus in the past 60 days. A year ago, Paccar was expected to earn $4.26/share, but that has been revised all the way up to $5.33.Paccar is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). The strong economy should keep demand firm for heavy equipment (regardless of the rise in interest rates), and the tariffs shouldn't affect this U.S. manufacturer.Follow us on Twitter: Join us on Facebook: Zacks  is under common control with affiliated entities (including a broker-dealer and an investment adviser), which may engage in transactions involving the foregoing securities for the clients of such affiliates.Media ContactZacks 800-767-3771 ext. 9339Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

After all, who wouldn't want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let's put  stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock's current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, PACCAR has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 15.5, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.4x. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, PACCAR's current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.However, the stock's PE also compares favorably with the broader industry's trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 10.3. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that PACCAR has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year's earnings) of just 12.4, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for PACCAR stock in the near term too.Another key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock's price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, PACCAR has a P/S ratio of about 2.5. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.In aggregate, PACCAR currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes PACCAR a solid choice for value investors.Though PACCAR might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of C and a Momentum Score of F. This gives PCAR a Zacks VGM score - or its overarching fundamental grade - of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  )Meanwhile, the company's recent earnings estimates have been upbeat. The current quarter has seen seven estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to no lower, while the full year estimate has seen nine up in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 11.1% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has increased 10.4%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:This positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiment, and its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates robust fundamentals and expectations of outperformance in the near term.PACCAR is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Further, a strong industry rank (among Bottom Top 37% of more than 250 industries) instills our confidence.However, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large, as you can see below:We believe, despite an unsatisfactory past industry performance, a good industry and Zacks rank signal that the stock is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future. Add to this robust value metrics, and we believe that we have a strong value contender in PACCAR.Earlier this year, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

The first two months of 2018 were also unimpressive for the auto sector, but the growth trend came back in March, with the major automakers registering strong sales. A robust job market and favorable tax laws have worked in favor of sales. Moreover, rising demand for profitable crossovers, sports utility vehicles (SUVs) and pickups are also aiding the auto industry.However, the auto space has also grappled with several challenges. Trade tensions between China and the United States, the compulsion to embrace various changes, and safety recall issues are some of the challenges faced by the automakers.Also, the industry is going through a transition. The necessity of manufacturing electric vehicles in a profitable way is fast becoming a big challenge for automakers. In recent times, General Motors Company (GM) and Ford Motor Company (F) have added some new EVs to their individual lineup. German auto major, Volkswagen AG (VLKAY) is also committed to introduce new energy vehicles. Other automakers are also following suit.These challenges are showing up in the sector's stock market performance. Stocks in the Zacks Auto sector are down -2.6% in the year-to-date period, lagging the S&P 500 index's +0.4% gain. On a trailing 12-month basis, the sector's performance is roughly in-line with the S&P 500 index.The typical characteristics of the auto industry prompted us to have a dedicated sector for the industry in our database. The automobile sector is one of the 16 Zacks sectors, unlike the S&P classification, wherein autos is part of the Consumer Discretionary sector. The S&P has 10 sectors compared with the 16 sectors for Zacks.At the expanded classification level, the Zacks Auto sector is divided into six industries: Auto-Domestic, Auto-Foreign, Auto-Original Equipment, Auto-Replacement Parts, Auto-Internal Combustion Engines and Rubber-Tires. The level of sensitivity and exposure to the different stages of the economic cycle vary for each industry.We rank over 250 industries in the 16 Zacks sectors, based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. We put our industries into two groups - the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank). Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1. (To learn more visit:  .)The current Zacks Industry Rank is 116 for Automotive-Domestic (placing it at the top 45% of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries), 83 for Automotive-Foreign (placing it at the top 32% of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries), 88 for Automotive-Original Equipment (placing it at the top 34% of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries), 63 for Automotive-Replacement Parts (placing it at the top 25% of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries), 4 for Automotive-Internal Combustion Engines (placing it at the top 2% of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries), 116 for Rubber-Tires (placing it at the top 45% of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries).Looking at the exact location of these industries, one could say that the general outlook for the auto industry is Positive.The auto sector contributed 1.6% to the total S&P 500 earnings in 2017. This is nearly double its 0.8% market-cap weight in the index.Looking at the fourth-quarter 2017 results of the auto sector, earnings advanced 20.3%. Auto sector earnings are expected to rise 4.3% in the first quarter of 2018 and 19.4% in second-quarter 2018.Total revenues rose 30.2% year over year in fourth-quarter 2017. Revenues are expected to rise 24.3% in the first quarter of 2018 and 7% in second-quarter 2018.Earnings for 2018 are expected to decline 3.7% from 2017. Also, revenues for the year are expected to decrease 0.9%. Again, earnings for 2019 are expected to rise 0.2%, and revenues are projected to rise 0.5%.For more information on earnings for this sector and others, please read our latest  report.The auto sector currently has ample opportunities amid serious challenges. While a strong economy, robust demand for SUVs, attractive financing options and impressive vehicle launches are driving sales, rising auto loan defaults and high levels of safety recalls are acting as dampeners.At this juncture, we recommend stocks such as PACCAR Inc. (PCAR), Allison Transmission Holdings, Inc. (ALSN) and Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (HMC), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see  .PACCAR has an expected long-term growth rate of 9.8%. In the past year, shares of the company have gained 2.1%.Allison Transmission has an expected long-term growth rate of 10%. In a year, shares of the company have returned 12.7%.Honda has an expected long-term growth rate of 4.8%. In a year's time, shares of the company have returned 18.6%.It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

But if you're just changing names to try and shake an image and don't make the changes to support it, then a rose by any other name\u2026well you know how it goes. Now that I've managed to squeeze a Shakespearean reference in here, lets talk about this star-crossed Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). The company formerly known as Autobytel, AutoWeb, Inc. operates as an automotive marketing services company in the United States. It assists automotive retail dealers and manufacturers to market and sell new and used vehicles to consumers through its programs. The company's products include new vehicle lead program, which allows consumers to submit requests for pricing and availability of specific makes and models; and used vehicle lead program, as well as finance leads program, which provides vehicle financing and other services from dealers or financial institutions. It owns and operates an automotive Website, Autobytel.com that offers consumers the information and tools to aid them with their automotive purchase decisions; and an automotive search engine that enables manufactures and dealers to optimize advertising campaigns.The reason for the harsh Zacks Rank is the recent string of bearish estimate revisions following the last earnings reports. For the current year, two analysts have cut their earnings estimates. The bearish moves have dropped our Zacks Consensus Estimate from 95 cents down to 25 cents. The current quarter number has come down from 17 cents to zero. That sort of contraction is not what you want to see when you're investing for the long run.Investors looking for other stocks within the auto industry should check out Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks  or Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

The company specializes in making  and the parts that go into them, with well-known brands including Peterbilt and Kenworth seen running on highways around the world.Over time, PACCAR has enjoyed substantial success, and shareholders have gotten the reward of stock splits over the company's history. Yet more recently, those stock splits have come to a halt, raising questions about whether something's fundamentally changed with the company's prospects. Let's look more closely at PACCAR's history of splitting its stock to see if another such move could be right around the corner.Here are the dates and split ratios for the stock splits PACCAR has done in the past:\n  \nData source: PACCAR investor relations.As you can see, the 2000s were a period of strong growth for PACCAR. The company made four stock splits in a period of just over five years, experiencing a huge growth spurt that vaulted it to the top of the truck manufacturing industry.PACCAR has generally followed a fairly predictable strategy in deciding when to do stock splits. The share price had risen above $70 when the truck manufacturer decided to do a three-for-two split in 2002. By 2004, PACCAR saw the share price get up into the $80s, when it decided to do another split, and just two years later, the stock price had climbed back above $80 per share, prompting another three-for-two move. Most recently, in 2007, the stock got up to about $90 per share immediately before the company did its final three-for-two split, bringing the share price back down into the upper $50s. That proved to be the high point for years, with the commodities bust and financial crisis combining to knock the truck maker for a loop.Image source: PACCAR.Since then, PACCAR has had to work hard to recover. A rebound took the stock to new highs in 2014, but the ensuing slowdown in the industrial economy dealt a blow to the truck maker. More recently, though, renewed demand for trucks in North America and Europe has helped to push PACCAR's fundamental growth prospects higher. Late last year, the company said  , especially among certain classes of heavy-duty commercial vehicles.That push higher appears to be sustainable. Economic conditions are picking up in many places around the world, and greater levels of commercial activity mean more need for commercial transportation. Investors in PACCAR have been nervous about pressure on margin figures, and competition from other quarters could pose a threat to growth. Yet PACCAR is committed to staying on the cutting edge of its industry through spending on research and development. That should foster growth opportunities in the coming years.Yet despite gains in its fundamental business, PACCAR still hasn't seen its share price climb back toward levels at which it would typically do a stock split. The stock currently fetches less than $70 per share, having fallen from nearly $80 just earlier this year.It's possible that PACCAR will consider a three-for-two split if the stock price climbs back toward the $80s. At this point, though, investors should focus more squarely on whether the truck manufacturer can make the most from a favorable industry environment and fend off of rising competition. If it can, then PACCAR should be a good investment regardless of whether it does a stock split.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Source: ShutterstockOf late, auto companies have been plagued with several challenges. The recent rise in interest rates and strict credit conditions resulted in declining sales for these companies in February. In fact, strong sales of crossovers and SUVs were inadequate to offset the decreasing sales from pickup trucks.Also, the decision to raise tariffs against the usage of imported steel and aluminum might hamper profit margins for the automakers, which are heavily dependent on these metals. This initiative might help the ailing steel and aluminum industries revive growth but the U.S. automotive companies will lose their competitive edge over foreign automakers.In the last three months, the  sector has underperformed the S&P 500 index. It has declined 1.4% against the S&P 500's rise of 3.2%.However, growth opportunities for the auto sector have been opening up with vehicle model launches by automakers and overall improvement in the economy. The recent growth in employment creation and rise in workforce across low, middle and high-wage industries will lead to a hike in the spending ability of consumers, thus strengthening the economy. Furthermore, tax cuts by the Trump government are expected to benefit the broader economy in the coming quarters.Moreover, per an updated outlook provided by the leading rating agency, Moody's, the U.S. auto sales are projected to decline lesser than expected in 2018, driven by improving the economy and rising demand.

However, the reported figure was higher than $188.3 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.Wheel unit shipments were 5.4 million compared with 3.1 million in the prior-year quarter. The rise is primarily due to the addition of its European operations, partly offset by a decline in the North American market compared with the prior-year quarter.Value-added sales, i.e., net sales minus pass-through charges for aluminum, increased to $203.5 million compared with $106.4 million in fourth-quarter 2016. | Gross profit rose to $39.7 million from $18 million in the year-ago quarter.

Having soared through 2017, stocks in the trucking sector have fallen off a cliff since the start of February. It's strange, because the declines come at precisely the point when orders have soared, and the industry is forecasting strong growth. Meanwhile, the leading companies have been upgrading guidance for their earnings and for the industry. What's going on, and is this a great buying opportunity in the sector? data by Trucking companies all reported strong quarters in their latest earnings reports, and as you can see below,  ,  and  raised their outlook on North America heavy-duty truck production/sales in 2018. Similarly, Navistar, Meritor and  raised their revenue guidance for 2018. From a bottom-up perspective, the trucking industry is set for a strong year, particularly in North America -- the last column shows how companies have raised guidance for the largest class of heavy truck, namely Class 8.\n  \nData source: Company presentations. Truck data in thousands. Meritor & Dana data is North America heavy-duty Class 8 production. PACCAR & Navistar data is North America Class 8 retail sales. Cummins is heavy-duty NAFTA Class 8 Group 2.The positive outlook is confirmed when looking at what leading commentators are saying about the market. For example, North American heavy-duty Class 8 orders were up 76% on a year-over-year basis, and there is a \"capacity crisis\" with freight companies \"scrambling to add trucks as fast as they can,\" according to Stocks in the trucking sector are starting to look attractive. Image source: Getty Images.Moreover, the  Truck Tonnage Index (an index based on surveys of its membership) has risen strongly, leading its Chief Economist Bob Costello to say, \"I expect freight tonnage to remain robust in the months ahead.\"There's little doubt that from a top-down perspective, too, the trucking market is looking strong in 2018.With all this good news, why has the market sold off the sector so aggressively? One answer is that the good news from the start of 2018 is actually a pull-forward of demand from 2019 and that this year will mark a peak in truck demand. That's not good news for truck manufacturers like PACCAR (Kenworth and Peterbilt) and Navistar (International Trucks), engine manufacturer Cummins or component manufacturers like Dana and Meritor.As you can see in the chart below, when heavy-truck sales last peaked, in the summer of 2015, the stocks in the sector had a very difficult year. data by  .Executives of leading companies in the industry were asked about the potential for a peak in demand in 2018 on their recent earnings calls, and the responses gave little confidence that this year won't see a peak.For example, Cummins COO Rich Freeland said it was \"too early to call\" 2019 yet, but suggested the underlying principles were \"pretty good.\"  PACCAR CEO Ronald Armstrong said he wasn't \"concerned about the peak,\" while Navistar CEO Troy Clarke merely said, \"We think 2019 will be another strong year\" when questioned on the matter.Frankly, I think the market is overreacting on the issue of peak demand for two reasons.First, there's no guarantee that 2018 will see the peak, and even if it does, there's no reason why truck sales will decline the way they did in the last trough. As you can see below, U.S. industrial production -- a key driver of truck demand -- actually fell in 2016 even as the overall economy held up. data by Second, although the U.S. is the home market for all these stocks, the U.S. isn't the key determinant of global trucking demand. To put this into context, the Asia/Pacific region (including China and India) produced double the amount of trucks than North America and Europe combined in 2017. Meanwhile, Europe's light truck market is currently double that of North America and its medium/heavy heavy market is comparable. Dana, Meritor, PACCAR and Cummins generate more than 40% of their sales internationally. Navistar is heavily dependent on North America.All told, there's no reason why the trucking industry can't have another strong year in 2019, and the recent dip in trucking-stock prices is providing a useful entry point.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Every week, Tracey will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life. To listen to the podcast, click here:(  )Welcome to Episode #82 of the Value Investor Podcast.Every week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks  , shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.She has covered many topics on the podcast including whether or not value investors can buy growth stocks or IPOs and how to figure out the difference between a value stock and a value trap.But there's another important category that value investors should be aware of. That's the stock that is stuck in no man's land.What does that mean?It's the stock that is neither a value stock nor is it a growth stock. Something is missing from the equation. It has no identity.As a result, these stocks tend to underperform as both value and growth investors shun them.What do these stocks look like?1.  , despite the shares tumbling from their post-IPO highs, still has a forward P/E of 69. It's clearly not a value stock. But is there growth? Sure, it's planning on opening another 35 domestic stores in 2018. But same-store-sales fell 1.2% in 2017 even as it raised menu prices. Additionally, it expects same-store-sales to be flat in 2018.  It's an expensive stock that doesn't have a strong enough growth story.2.  , is a stock that has gone nowhere for several years. Over the last 2 years, shares of this sandwich chain have fallen 3.2% while the S&P 500 was up about 40%. Earnings are expected to fall 33% in 2017. But is it cheap? Not even close. It has a forward P/E of 34.  Growth is lethargic, at best, and it's not a value stock.It's easy for value investors to get stuck in these stocks because they appear to have value characteristics, as often the shares have sold off big.But a stock plunge doesn't necessarily equal value.Tracey ran a screen looking for companies that had both value fundamentals AND double-digit earnings growth.In addition, she added the extra firepower of the Zacks Rank, screening only for Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks, which hopefully means rising earnings estimates.The screen gave her a list of 56 companies.Not too shabby.1.  , the property insurance giant, has a forward P/E of just 11.4 as the shares have fallen about 7% year-to-date. Earnings are expected to rise 25.2% in 2018.2.  , the commercial truck manufacturer, saw record annual revenue in 2017 thanks to a strong European truck market. It's cheap, with a forward P/E of 13.1, and earnings are expected to rise 23% this year. As an added bonus, it has paid a dividend every year since 1941.3.  , operates beauty stores worldwide. It's known for hair color. The company has been in a transition period as it expands its online capabilities. Same-store-sales are expected to be flat in fiscal 2018 while earnings are expected to rise 32%.

Not everyone believes this plan will come to pass -- indeed, two days ago,  after Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn demurred that Congress simply doesn't have time to address it this year.But what if the plan  come to pass? In a move that should make it easier to keep an eye on the industry, and that could set it up to pick winners and losers as the infrastructure bill's prospects firm up, investment banker Morgan Stanley announced a whole series of picks this morning in the heavy industry space -- everything from truck makers to earth movers.Here are two of the heavy industry stocks Morgan Stanley thinks you should buy, and one they'd suggest you sell.Image source: Getty Images.Beginning with the big name in the sector, Morgan Stanley rated shares of  (NYSE: CAT) overweight and assigned the stock a $185 price target, as reported today on  . If the analyst is right about that, investors in  could potentially earn a 23% profit off of today's prices, and collect a tidy 1.9%  on top of that -- making for a nearly 25% total return over the next 12 months.Most analysts who follow Caterpillar see the company posting strong, steady 10% annual earnings growth over the next five years, and Morgan Stanley appears to be broadly in agreement with that view. According to the analyst, the global economy is continuing to recover from its recent commodities slump, and key end markets are also recovering. Combined with channel checks that show inventories of heavy machinery are now \"right-sized,\" Caterpillar should be able to grow its revenue at the same time as it expands its profit margin -- a good recipe for earnings growth so long as the recovery continues.Morgan Stanley is also a fan of Caterpillar rival  (NYSE: DE) , albeit more for that company's flagship agricultural machinery business ($20.2 billion in annual sales) than for its much smaller construction and forestry unit ($5.7 billion).Most analysts on Wall Street see much more limited growth potential for Deere than for Caterpillar -- 5% projected long-term earnings growth, versus Caterpillar's 10%, according to analysts surveyed by  . But Morgan Stanley believes Deere's profits will be lifted by the North American agricultural machinery \"replacement cycle.\" The analyst is also hoping to see corn and  rebound, putting more money in farmers' pockets, and enabling them to spend more buying tractors and combines from Deere.The analyst rates Deere overweight as well, and assigns the stock a $195 price target -- 24% above current prices, albeit with a smaller dividend than Caterpillar pays (just 1.5%).Sadly for investors in truck maker  (NASDAQ: PCAR) , their stock gets no such love from Morgan Stanley. One of the few stocks the analyst rated underweight this morning, Morgan Stanley worries that Paccar's sales of Class 8 tractors (the truck part of a tractor-trailer) will peak this year within the NAFTA trade region, and could begin to slip as early as 2019.It's worth pointing out that this is most decidedly  the consensus view on Wall Street, where analyst estimates on average predict Paccar's profits will grow even faster than Caterpillar's, and much faster than Deere's -- 12% annually over the next five years, in fact. Nonetheless, Morgan Stanley highlights an emerging threat from electric trucks such as  that  unveiled late last year. That's a potential disruptor in the trucking business, and contributes to Morgan Stanley's pessimism about Paccar.The analyst is therefore counseling that investors sell Paccar, and sees little chance of share price appreciation this year, predicting Paccar's price will be about $69 a share a year from now.From a P/E investor's perspective, I have to say that Morgan Stanley's picks (and pan) this morning seem a bit curious. At 35 times earnings (and projected 5% growth), Deere stock hardly looks cheap enough to inspire a buy rating. Caterpillar stock, at more than  , appears to be wildly overpriced. In contrast, Paccar, at 14 times earnings, a 12% projected growth rate, and with a modest 1.4% dividend yield, appears at first glance the best bargain of the bunch.That being said, closer examination of the companies' financials reveal that with just $869 million in trailing free cash flow, Paccar is actually generating cash profit at barely half the rate the stock's $1.7 billion in reported earnings would suggest, and so is arguably more expensive than meets the eye.Deere, pricey from a P/E perspective, looks even more so when valued on its free cash flow -- of which it generated none in 2017, burning nearly $1 billion instead.In contrast, Caterpillar generated positive free cash flow of $3.4 billion last year -- several times its reported $754 million in net income. At a price-to-free-cash-flow ratio of 26, Caterpillar stock is arguably actually the cheapest of the lot, despite its frighteningly high P/E ratio. I don't know that I'd say Caterpillar is cheap  to buy based on growth expectations of only 10%, but I do know that it's the single Morgan Stanley recommendation today that I'm most inclined to agree with.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and Caterpillar wasn't one of them!

That's the stock that is stuck in no man's land.What does that mean?It's the stock that is neither a value stock nor is it a growth stock. Something is missing from the equation. It has no identity.As a result, these stocks tend to underperform as both value and growth investors shun them.What do these stocks look like?1.  , despite the shares tumbling from their post-IPO highs, still has a forward P/E of 69. It's clearly not a value stock. But is there growth? Sure, it's planning on opening another 35 domestic stores in 2018. But same-store-sales fell 1.2% in 2017 even as it raised menu prices. Additionally, it expects same-store-sales to be flat in 2018.  It's an expensive stock that doesn't have a strong enough growth story.2.  is a stock that has gone nowhere for several years. Over the last 2 years, shares of this sandwich chain have fallen 3.2% while the S&P 500 was up about 40%. Earnings are expected to fall 33% in 2017. But is it cheap? Not even close. It has a forward P/E of 34.  Growth is lethargic, at best, and it's not a value stock.It's easy for value investors to get stuck in these stocks because they appear to have value characteristics, as often the shares have sold off big.But a stock plunge doesn't necessarily equal value.Tracey ran a screen looking for companies that had both value fundamentals AND double-digit earnings growth.In addition, she added the extra firepower of the Zacks Rank, screening only for Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks, which hopefully means rising earnings estimates.The screen gave her a list of 56 companies.Not too shabby.1.  , the property insurance giant, has a forward P/E of just 11.4 as the shares have fallen about 7% year-to-date. Earnings are expected to rise 25.2% in 2018.2.  , the commercial truck manufacturer, saw record annual revenue in 2017 thanks to a strong European truck market. It's cheap, with a forward P/E of 13.1, and earnings are expected to rise 23% this year. As an added bonus, it has paid a dividend every year since 1941.3.  operates beauty stores worldwide. It's known for hair color. The company has been in a transition period as it expands its online capabilities. Same-store-sales are expected to be flat in fiscal 2018 while earnings are expected to rise 32%. It's dirt cheap as well, with a forward P/E of just 7.3.What else should you know about stocks in the No Man's Land and how to avoid them?Tune into this week's podcast to find out.Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

The stock has gained 9.9% compared with the industry's growth of 0.4% during the period. | Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.For 2017, the company raised the Class 8 industry retail sales estimates in the United States and Canada to the range of 210,000-220,000 compared with the previous expectation of 200,000-220,000 vehicles. This rise in prediction is on the back of economic growth, increased freight activity and low fuel prices.Further, for 2018, the company projects the Class 8 truck industry retail sales forecasts for the United States and Canada within the band of 220,000-250,000 vehicles.Also, the company is well-placed in its key markets owing to strategic investments and a strong balance sheet. For fiscal 2017, it expects capital investments of $400-$450 million and research and development expenses of $260-$270 million. Further, for fiscal 2018, it anticipates a capital investment of $425-$475 million while research and development expenses are estimated at $270-$300 million.PACCAR also follows active capital deployment strategies to enhance shareholder value. In December 2017, it had announced an extra cash dividend of $1.2 per share to its shareholders of record, paid on Jan 4, 2018. Besides, the company will be paying regular quarterly dividend of 25 cents on Mar 6, 2018.Our proven model does not conclusively show that PACCAR is likely to beat on earnings this quarter.

The company's fourth-quarter 2017 financial results are expected to be released on Feb 8. You can see Tenneco Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +7.03% and is a Zacks #3 Ranked player. The company will report fourth-quarter 2017 financial results on Feb 9.Genuine Parts Company  has an Earnings ESP of +4.83% and is a #3 Ranked player.

That's changed in recent years, though, as a growing number of big tech companies have matured to the point where more generous dividend payouts are justified. The 10 top-yielding stocks in the Nasdaq's most elite group all sport dividend yields well above the market average, but as savvy income investors know, a high yield doesn't necessarily make a stock worth buying. Let's take a closer look at this list to find the best stocks for the future.Below, you'll find the 10 highest-yielding stocks in the Nasdaq 100 as of Dec. 14:\n  \nData source: Yahoo! Finance. * Includes special dividend.The first thing one might notice about this list is that it's a fairluy diverse group of companies considering the index it's drawn from. On a market-capitalization weighted basis, the Nasdaq 100 gets about 60% of its value from technology stocks, with consumer discretionary and healthcare lagging far behind at 21% and 10% respectively. Yet we see above a telecom stock, a food giant, an industrial company, a biotech leader, and a payroll and business services specialist , in addition to representatives from the hardware, software, and services segments of the information technology sector.Another positive feature of this list of top-yielding Nasdaq dividend stocks is that it doesn't include many companies with substantial dividend risk. Seagate Technology has been making some income investors nervous for quite a while, but despite its ongoing financial challenges, the company has steadfastly maintained its payout. Bullish investors are hopeful that a transition from old-style hard disk drives to flash memory chips and solid state drives could help  , and for now, high demand for massive data-center storage has given new life to its old core product line.Image source: Nasdaq.Vodafone is the other true high-yield player on this list, and it's generally regarded as a global leader in wireless telecom.  , but that was largely the result of accounting-based moves to take advantage of tax benefits. With most of its revenue coming from Europe, but with meaningful exposure to emerging nations, Vodafone taps into the growth potential of telecom while still enjoying the stability of being a leader in some of the best-established markets in the world.Finally, dividend investors should remember that they can make money in multiple ways by owning the right stocks. A number of potential catalysts could benefit these particular companies.For instance, Qualcomm recently got a  from  , valuing the tech giant at more than $100 billion. Investors have already seen a big jump in the share price, and although Qualcomm rejected the initial bid, there's room for further gains in shares if Broadcom comes back with a higher number.Dividend growth is also an option. Amgen recently said it would boost its payout another 15% in 2018 -- unusual among biotechnology firms, which generally reinvest a greater portion of their earnings into further research and development. PACCAR, the truck specialist, traditionally declares a special dividend each year; the $1.20 per share payout it will make in early January boosts what would be a rather pedestrian 1.5% yield without it to the more than 3% yield it enjoys today.Growth opportunities also play a key role in fostering share-price gains. Although some of the names above aren't exactly growth engines, they each have opportunities to keep building on their success.The Nasdaq isn't well-known for its dividends, but even this tech-heavy index can produce some worthwhile buys for income investors.

(Symbol: PCAR) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $77.00, changing hands for $77.51/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 12 different analyst targets contributing to that average for PACCAR Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $69.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $90.00. The standard deviation is $5.846.But the whole reason to look at the  PCAR price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with PCAR crossing above that average target price of $77.00/share, investors in PCAR have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $77.00 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

Yet some stocks don't just give their shareholders money every few months, instead supplementing their payouts from time to time with additional special dividends.Special dividends can be extremely lucrative, but they're not always predictable. With that in mind, below you'll learn more about what  (NASDAQ: COST) ,  (NASDAQ: PCAR) , and  (NASDAQ: CME) have done for their shareholders lately in terms of paying special dividends -- and whether investors can expect a repeat performance in 2018.\n  \nData source: Yahoo! Finance. Date reflects ex-dividend date. Amounts are per share. that it would pay a special dividend of $7 per share to its investors. That amount represented about 4% of the stock's price when it was announced. Even though Costco raised its regular dividend at the same time, the $7 per share special payout provided a nice supplement to the $0.50 per share that it said it would pay out going forward, which worked out to a regular dividend yield of just over 1%.CFO Richard Galanti referred to the move as \"our latest step in returning capital to our shareholders,\" citing \"our strong balance sheet and favorable access to the credit markets\" in making the dividend possible. The special dividend wasn't Costco's first, having paid out dividends of $7 in late 2012 and $5 in mid-2015. By structuring the bulk of its payouts this way, Costco retains flexibility to deliver income back to shareholders without making implicit promises of sustaining regular payouts that a cyclical downturn could force it to break.More recently, PACCAR joined the crowd with a special dividend of $1.20 per share. Shareholders in the truck manufacturer received their payment in early January, with the amount working out to about 1.5% of its share price. That more than doubled the effective dividend yield, given the $0.25 per share quarterly payout that PACCAR makes on a regular basis.What makes PACCAR's special dividend a bit different is that the company quite reliably makes a special payment at the end of each year. Over the course of the past 20 years, the company paid 19 year-end special dividends, missing only 2009, before which it had cut its dividend in half in light of the aftermath of the financial crisis and 2008 recession. For PACCAR shareholders, the only question in their minds is how much the special dividend will be each year, and with a range of $0.60 to $1.40 per share since 2011, 2017's payout was at the upper end of the range, reflecting  .Image source: Getty Images.CME Group shares a similar practice as PACCAR, and it goes a step further in recognizing that the move no longer comes as a surprise to shareholders, calling it an \"annual variable dividend\" instead of a special dividend. The 2017 installment came to $3.50 per share, which was more than 2% of the company's share price at the time of the announcement and more than doubles the annual payout from its regular $0.66-per-share quarterly dividends. Shareholders received their latest special dividend in mid-January.CME started its practice of annual supplemental dividends back in early 2012, and the amounts have gone from the initial $0.60-per-share payment to the most recent amount of nearly six times that first annual special dividend. The exchange's intention is to base the dividend on the amount of excess cash available to the business each year, giving it the option to increase or decrease the amount based on capital needs and operating results. So far, that's worked out well for investors, and with many hoping for  , further dividend increases could follow.The nature of special dividends means that you can't count on them the same way that most dividend investors expect regular dividends to keep coming in quarter after quarter. Nevertheless, CME Group, PACCAR, and Costco Wholesale have all had a history of recurring special dividends. PACCAR and CME are likely to do additional year-end special dividends at the end of 2018, but for Costco, it would be unusual to do another special payout so soon after its most recent one.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

There's no financial justification for someone to purchase a $100,000 Model S over a less expensive gasoline powered vehicle or EV, but that's not the point -- Teslas are sold because they're desirable in a very intangible way.That intangible value is why Tesla will have a hard time moving into the semi truck market. Tesla Semi has to compete on a dollar for dollar basis with not only diesel trucks but all-electric semis from powerhouses like  's Freightliner,  (NASDAQOTH: VOLVY) , and  's (NASDAQ: PCAR) Peterbilt and Kenworth lines. That may be harder than Elon Musk thinks.Image source: Tesla.When buyers make the decision to purchase a new semi truck, they're making a decades-long investment that needs to generate predictable returns. Rig operators aren't in the business of risking their operations on new technology or an unproven vehicle. Tesla may be able to sell a number of semis to companies like  (NYSE: WMT) , which reserved 15 last week, and grocery chain  , which reserved 25 units, but it'll need a proven vehicle to be more than a niche product. Tesla has already claimed that it will save rig operators money, but they'll want Tesla to prove it.Evidence that it's difficult to get rig operators to make a switch to new technology, even when the investment makes sense, can be seen in the recent history of natural gas fuel.  (NASDAQ: CLNE) and  (NASDAQ: WPRT) built the technology and infrastructure to provide natural gas to semis at a price that would ultimately save operators money. But they  , because adoption was extremely low in comparison to the ~260,000 Class-8 semi trucks produced in North America each year.If Tesla makes an obviously superior product at a superior cost it may be able to get a significant share of the market. But it's not clear Tesla Semi is a no-brainer for those who actually drive trucks for a living. highlighted a number of the major flaws in the Tesla Semi, and there are a few that caught my eye.The first is that Tesla doesn't appear to have any mirrors on the semi, which would make driving on a highway, navigating traffic in a city, or backing into a dock bay difficult, if not impossible. Musk hasn't addressed this issue directly, but it's likely Tesla thinks sensors and cameras can replace mirrors. But do you really think a typical semi driver will trust sensors rather than their years of experience in these situations?Mirrors are an important consideration, because Musk highlights the 0.36 Cp drag coefficient as a major advantage of the rig. Without such a low drag, the semi would have a much shorter range than the currently advertised 500 miles, or would need to be heavier to achieve that kind of range.Speaking of range, a typical semi has about 1,000 miles of range, meaning a Tesla semi would likely be used for shorter trips or transport in a small area like a dock. Those are important markets, but they constrain the current Tesla semi to niche applications. Remember that shorter trips would also mean more time spent in confined parking lots or backing into dock bays, which will require mirrors that the Tesla Semi doesn't have. And all that stopping and starting will reduce range even further than 500 miles, especially if drivers ever want to experience that fully loaded 20 second 0-60 mph time.A truck that's being used every day and presumably charging multiple times per day would also run into battery life cycle issues. Tesla's auto warranty is now for unlimited miles in the  , but that would be less than 1,000 full cycles under normal driving conditions (~13,500 miles per year). Battery degradation data from Maarten Steinbuch indicates it's around that 1,000th cycle that Tesla's Model S loses 10% of its capacity. As another data point, the Powerwall has a warranty for about 3,200 cycles. If we ballpark 1.5 full charges per day and assume the rig could be charged 3,200 cycles, the Tesla Semi would need to have its battery replaced every 5.8 years. That's a big expense for an owner on top of the upfront cost of the semi. It could make the economics of a Tesla Semi harder to pencil.There are also infrastructure concerns like the lack of semi charging stations nationwide and the lack of a critical mass of knowledgable mechanics. For a risk-averse trucking industry, Tesla is going to need more than a sexy semi -- it's going to need hard data that it'll save companies money, and that'll take years to develop.I mentioned some of the early reservations for the semi, which sound impressive on paper.

On top of that, the  , so it's not binding in any way.The early reservations aren't really any indication of the level of interest in the Tesla Semi one way or another. Fleet operators will certainly \"kick the tires,\" but until they see a Tesla Semi on the road -- and what competition is making by that point -- I wouldn't expect a lot of concrete sales contracts.Even if Tesla can answer all of the questions above, Tesla has to actually make a semi to industry quality standards.

Tesla just showed its cards earlier than anyone else. Now they know where the bar is set, and what they need to do to beat Tesla to market.Until we see a Tesla Semi put hundreds of thousands of miles of testing on the tires, I'll have reservations about claims of efficiency, safety, and durability. Right now, Tesla doesn't know what it doesn't know in the large truck market, and it may find out that manufacturing semis is harder than it seems.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This morning, however, some good news arrived.So far since earnings, two analysts -- Evercore ISI and Seaport Global Securities -- have used PACCAR's earnings report as an excuse to downgrade the stock. But breaking with that sentiment, this morning  announced it is upgrading PACCAR stock and assigning it a price target of $82 per share.Here are three things you need to know about that.Truck sales are zooming, and one analyst thinks Paccar stock will zoom along with them. Image source: Getty Images.Despite what you might have heard (and despite Wall Street's reaction to it), PACCAR's Q3 earnings report was actually quite good. Management itself called the results \"excellent.\"Sales for the quarter rose 19% in comparison to Q3 last year, while PACCAR's profits were up 16%. Both numbers exceeded Wall Street's estimates. The company raised its forecast for Class 8 truck sales through the end of this year by about 10%, and said truck demand is accelerating, with the number of Class 8 trucks sold in Europe holding steady and growing in the U.S. and Canada.And yet, investors sold off the stock. Reviewing the news, my fellow Fool Jason Hall speculated that  by a comment from management that it didn't expect to grow profit margin much at all -- holding it steady at between 14% and 15% -- despite the additional sales.As Jason explained, capital-intensive industrial companies like PACCAR are supposed to enjoy \"leverage\" in their operations, such that when sales (and revenue) go up, fixed costs are supposed to be spread out across more production, enabling the company to earn higher profit margins on additional trucks sold.PACCAR is saying it doesn't expect that to happen next year. And Wall Street isn't happy to hear that.So why is Argus optimistic when the rest of its Wall Street kin are not? As explained in a write-up on  this morning, Argus believes that sales of heavy-duty trucks in the U.S. are \"at an inflection point,\" while the European market for heavy trucks is also \"showing strength.\" Argus sees PACCAR capitalizing on the strong demand for big trucks by grabbing market share from rivals such as  , and thus growing faster than the market at large.But here's the thing: Even if sales do grow, if PACCAR can't capitalize on them by expanding its profits dramatically, PACCAR stock could still be overvalued -- and unworthy of Argus's buy rating.Consider: The consensus among analysts following PACCAR stock is for earnings to nearly triple over 2016 levels this year, with PACCAR earning as much as $4.19 per share in 2017. But longer-term growth estimates (provided by  ) show PACCAR's profits expanding at only about a 6% annualized rate over the next three years.That growth rate doesn't compare well to PACCAR's trailing P/E ratio of 19.1. In fact, even crediting PACCAR with all $4.19 in profits that Wall Street expects it to earn this year (trailing earnings are still just $3.74), PACCAR stock would look pricey at a current-year P/E ratio of 16.9.And it gets even worse. PACCAR's P/E ratio doesn't take into account the company's hefty debt load, currently about $5.6 billion net of cash. Factor that into the valuation, and PACCAR's stock becomes about 20% more expensive than meets the eye. The company also isn't generating a whole lot of cash with which to pay down its debt. Trailing free cash flow at the company is only $769 million -- meaning PACCAR is really generating only about $0.56 in real cash profit for every $1 it claims to be earning under GAAP.PACCAR isn't as cheap as it seems -- and it didn't seem all that cheap to begin with. I know not all Fools will agree with me on this one, but personally, I think Argus is wrong to recommend PACCAR stock.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade,  , has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the  for investors to buy right now... and PACCAR wasn't one of them!

The company -- based, as its name implies, in Oshkosh, Wis. -- manufactures all kinds of specialty trucks, including garbage trucks, telehandlers (basically forklifts on steroids), and aerial work platforms. The company also has several major contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense to provide specialty military vehicles.Still not excited? How about if I tell you that the company's stock is up 70% in the past year, absolutely destroying the  's below-20% gains, and also trouncing other heavy-equipment manufacturers such as  (NYSE: CAT) ,  (NYSE: DE) , and  (NASDAQ: PCAR) ? In fact, the stock has hit a new all-time record high in five separate months this year, and it will probably do so again in November.But before you jump in with both feet, there are some things you should know.One of Oshkosh's major military products is the M-ATV. Image source: Getty Images.The biggest jump in Oshkosh's shares came immediately after President Trump's surprise win in the November election, and it's not hard to see why. Oshkosh is  . In 2016, it derived 21.5% of its revenue from its defense segment and 48% from its access-equipment segment, which consists largely of construction vehicles. Candidate Trump had promised to boost military spending and to implement a $1 trillion infrastructure spending package, both of which would have created positive business environments for Oshkosh. That's also one reason its stock has fared better than traditional truckmakers such as PACCAR.At the time, though, there was some doubt about whether Congress would derail Candidate Trump's plans. And while the promised infrastructure package seems to be stuck in limbo, the proposed $90 billion military spending increase just a green light on Capitol Hill as part of the 2018 budget.With the budget now passed, however, it looks as if the market's early moves to reward Oshkosh were justified. Of course, we don't know how much of that military spending will go to any specific defense contractor, but Oshkosh has been competitive in the past and has several existing long-term contracts with the military.If Oshkosh's entire stock rally were based solely on exuberance over Trump administration priorities, it probably wouldn't be worth the price at which it's trading. However, over the past year, Oshkosh has been radically improving its fundamentals.In the most recent third quarter, which ended June 30 (Oshkosh's fiscal year ends with September), the company improved by virtually every metric. Sales increased in all four of its business segments, and adjusted earnings per share were up an impressive 68% year over year. Margin and cash flow also improved. The company did so well, in fact, that it increased its adjusted EPS forecast to a midpoint of $3.85, up from Q2's projected midpoint of $3.35, which in turn was raised from Q1's projected midpoint of $3.20.If Oshkosh reports another fantastic quarter in Q4 2017, the company may actually be living up to its hype.While Oshkosh's fiscal 2017 is looking a lot better than its fiscal 2016, its revenue and earnings are still lagging behind its post-recession highs: data by Now, there was a good reason Oshkosh's revenue and earnings were high in 2010 and 2011: The U.S. had a major troop presence in Iraq and Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, for example, there were 100,000 U.S. troops in 2011, compared with less than 10,000 in 2016. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act had also funded numerous construction projects across the country. So, naturally, a company that specializes in light armored vehicles for troops and construction equipment is going to do well in those circumstances.However, the stock is now much higher than it was in 2010-11, on lower overall revenue and earnings. Its trailing-12-month P/E ratio, which had been lower than PACCAR's but comparable to Deere's for much of the past 10 years, is now higher than theirs at 27.1, compared with Deere's 22.3 and PACCAR's 18.4. It's much, much lower than Caterpillar's.Looking at forward P/E, though, Oshkosh's 21.9 -- while still on the high end of its peer group -- is far more in line with Caterpillar's 22, Deere's 20.5, and PACCAR's 17.3. While that seems to indicate that it may be fairly valued, investors should also consider that the massive stock price increase over the past year has knocked its dividend well below those of Caterpillar (2.3%), Deere (1.8%), and PACCAR (1.4%). Oshkosh currently yields a piddling 0.9%.With big share price gains already in the rearview mirror, and enthusiasm about potential military and infrastructure spending already priced into the stock, plus a reasonable valuation based on forward P/E, there may not be much more upside left for Oshkosh. That said, the company is continuing to perform well, so buying in now wouldn't be the worst choice you could make. I wish the dividend yield were a bit higher -- it would go a long way toward improving the case for buying in at this record-high price.One thing's for certain: Oshkosh doesn't look like the value it did a year ago. But there may still be gas left in the specialty-truck engine. If I owned Oshkosh today, I'd hold on and hope it keeps doing what it's doing.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Revenue increased 19% and net income was up 16%, with both numbers even coming in ahead of Wall Street analyst expectations. And as is typical of Mr. Market, PACCAR shares fell as much as 7.5% during afternoon trading and closed down almost 6% on the day.So what spooked investors following a solid quarter? There were a few comments from management on the  that could have played a role in sending the stock price down. Let's take a closer look at PACCAR's results, as well as what management had to say, and what the long-term implications are.Image source: PACCAR.After a few quarters of  resulting from a decline in North American truck orders, PACCAR has delivered revenue growth two quarters in a row and saw profits jump this quarter. The company reported $5.1 billion in revenue, $402.7 million in net income, and earnings per share of $1.14 in the quarter. For the first nine months of 2017, revenue was $14 billion, net income was $1.09 billion, and earnings per share came in at $3.09.The biggest reason for PACCAR's improved results is increased truck demand in North America and Europe, the company's two biggest markets. The company said it delivered 23,300 trucks in the U.S. and Canada last quarter, and 12,400 trucks in Europe, 24% and 7% higher versus last year's third quarter. The company is forecasting 210,000 to 220,000 Class 8 truck sales in 2017, up from its forecast of 190,000 to 220,000 in April. PACCAR is seeing a similar trend in Europe, increasing its full-year forecast from 270,000 to 300,000 trucks this spring to a range of 300,000 to 310,000.Looking at 2018, the company sees truck demand accelerating. PACCAR is forecasting demand for 220,000 to 250,000 Class 8 trucks in the U.S. and Canada and 300,000 to 310,000 in Europe next year.Management is optimistic wrapping up 2017 and heading into next year. On the , CEO Ron Armstrong said the company expects the U.S. economy to grow close to 2.5% this year, and between 2% and 3% in 2018, with strong demand for new housing and from the auto industry, as well as expanded industrial production. This growth is behind the company's expectations for increased demand for Class 8 trucks in North America. The expectations for Europe are similar to those for North America in terms of GDP growth and how this should drive increased truck demand.However, one analyst on the  raised a question about incremental margin -- the higher profits that additional units above this year's level should generate. Armstrong's response -- that gross margin percentage for 2018 would probably be in the same range as this year, between 14% and 15% -- didn't sit well. Here's what Armstrong said about incremental margin:In general terms, this is something investors should pay attention to. A business like PACCAR's is designed to benefit from increased volume, which  produce higher incremental margins, since fixed expenses get spread across more revenue. But at the same time, this isn't something investors should be panicking about. On one hand, Armstrong's response is best described as being conservative. The reality is, predicting economic activity and truck demand so far out is an inexact science at best.It's also possible investors weren't satisfied with Armstrong's statements about the future of trucking. Several analysts asked about electrification and driver automation in trucking, and Armstrong was steadfast that PACCAR expects it to take a number of years before those technologies are commercially viable and in high demand. With companies including  and privately held start-up Nikola Motors both talking publicly about introducing battery-powered and hydrogen-powered Class 8 trucks within a few years, management's far more conservative language around alternative technologies could have also concerned some investors.Yet at the same time, PACCAR has invested a significant amount of money into technology and innovation. The company opened an R&D facility in Silicon Valley this year and will spend more than $260 million on R&D this year. Next year, the company is beginning a truck platooning trial -- essentially using wireless communications and automation to \"link\" multiple trucks together -- in the U.K. in 2018. The company announced earlier this year that it was partnered with  to  , and chances are its platooning test in the U.K. will be powered by NVIDIA's DRIVE PX 2 platform.Management said on the  that it will increase R&D spending to as much as $300 million next year, and part of that increase will be tied to the company's SuperTruck II program, which it just launched.Whether it was something management said that spooked investors into selling PACCAR after earnings, or just a product of \"profit takers\" after a 20% run-up in the share price the past couple of months, long-term investors probably shouldn't be too worried. The company continues to dominate the truck market in North America and make solid gains in Europe, and if the economy in both areas remains steady in coming years, the company is likely to continue increasing its market share and becoming more profitable.And when it comes to the risk of disruption from new technologies, investors shouldn't dismiss it out of hand. But at the same time, PACCAR is well positioned as a technology leader and is likely to be one of the companies playing a role in disrupting the status quo. What management said this quarter, and how the company performed, didn't really change the likelihood that PACCAR will remain a technology leader and truckmaker for years to come -- no matter how much technology changes who drives the truck, or what powers it.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because PACCAR is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings - with the most up-to-date information possible - is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for PCAR in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.09 per share for PCAR, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.08 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for PCAR, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.82% heading into earnings season. | A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  (Nasdaq:  ),  (Nasdaq:  ),  (NYSE:  ),  (NYSE:  ) and  (BIT:  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. U.S. auto sales rebounded in September following a prolonged period of year-over-year declines. General Motors and Ford's pickups and popular crossovers along with Toyota's SUVs primarily boosted the sales figures.Americans bought cars and light trucks at the fastest rate in a dozen years in September as consumers in hurricane-hit areas of the country replaced flood-damaged cars. The momentum is expected to continue as many are still on the lookout for better bargains. Given the positive trends, investing in stocks related to the auto industry seems sensible.The auto industry reversed a year-long downward trend and posted solid uptick in car sales in September. According to Autodata Corp, the seasonally adjusted annual sales rate for all U.S. light vehicles touched 18.57 million units last month, up from 16.14 million in the prior month. It also marked the highest sales rate since July 2005.Auto sales increased as many drivers in hurricane-affected locations, in particular Texas, replaced damaged cars. Almost 500,000 cars were destroyed after hurricane Harvey, the first major hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland in almost 12 years, had put vast areas under water. As per industry estimates, around 200,000 cars were damaged during hurricane Irma that had hit the Sun Shine state of Florida.Several analysts predicted that such hurricanes would help automakers register their first monthly gain this year. Chief investment strategist at Cascend Securities, Eric Ross added that car sales may increase in the later part of 2017 and beginning of 2018. This is because many have been mulling over the purchase of new automobiles since May. Such online activities are primarily done three to four months before the real purchase takes place.The three largest sellers in the United States - General Motors, Ford Motor and Toyota - posted strong sales numbers in September following months of declines. Honda and Nissan also posted higher-than-expected sales. - The No. 1 U.S. automaker led the pack with 279,176 cars and trucks sold in the United States in September, up 11.9% on a year-over-year basis. This represented a nearly 12% jump in sales compared to the same period last year. Such a feat was possible owing to a 43% increase in sales of crossovers and 10% uptick in pickup trucks, which overshadowed an 11% decline in passenger cars. Kurt McNeil, U.S. vice president of GM's sales operations said that \"our new crossovers from Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac have been very well-received, and Chevrolet had an outstanding month with the Silverado and Colorado.\"General Motor's inventory level dropped to 76 days supply in September from 88 days in August. This is a positive, especially, when analysts criticized the automaker for having oversupply of new vehicles. In fact, General Motors claimed that it will reduce its inventory level further to 70 days by the end of the year. - The automaker sold 221,643 vehicles in total, gaining 8.9% on a year-over-year basis. Its F-Series pickup sales surged 21.4%, with 82,302 trucks sold. Demand for its Super Duty, with the premium Lariat, King Ranch and Platinum trim levels, remained strong.Ford added that sales of its Explorer, Sport and SportTrac SUVs totaled 21,207. Mark LaNeve, Ford vice president, U.S. marketing, sales and service added that their \"business was strong nationwide, with retail increases in 12 of our 21 sales regions, with particular strength in Houston.\" - The automaker sold 226,632 cars in total, up 14.9% on a year-over-year basis. The automaker's gains were broad based, with its RAV4 compact SUV climbing 44% after a new Canadian assembly plant gained momentum. Sales of its flagship product Camry also jumped after the Georgetown, KY, assembly plant switched to a new generation of vehicle manufacturing methods.Toyota's light trucks, including Tundra, Tacoma, Highlander and 4Runner, gained as well. Overall, the segment rose nearly 29%. David Christ, vice president of U.S. sales for the Toyota brand, said that last month sales had got a \"significant boost right away\" from post-hurricane recovery efforts, especially, in Texas.Here's a look at how other two major players performed in September:With U.S. car sales gaining momentum on post-hurricane vehicle demand, it would be prudent to invest in certain stocks related to the auto industry.

In the first half of fiscal 2017, the company made a total investment of $375-$425 million plus $250-$270 million for research and development of new technologies, better manufacturing facilities as well as after-market support services, which should positively impact the third-quarter results.Along with investments, PACCAR is also expanding its global network through parts distribution centers (PDC) and is optimistic about extending footprint in South America and Russia. In North America too, it is widening its presence. For research and development, the company is opening a center in Silicon Valley, CA for developing new technologies. In addition, PACCAR is unveiling a new distribution center in Toronto, Canada.For fiscal 2017, the company expects to achieve a total of 200,000-220,000 unit sales in Class 8 retail in the United States and Canada riding on strong economy and high levels of freight tonnage. For Europe, the company estimates about 290,000-310,000 unit sales.Here are a few other stocks worth considering from the same space as these have the right combination of elements to come up with an earnings beat this quarter:Autoliv, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +1.99% and a Zacks Rank #2.

(Symbol: PCAR) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $73.13, changing hands for $73.76/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 15 different analyst targets contributing to that average for PACCAR Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $50.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $85.00. The standard deviation is $8.5.But the whole reason to look at the  PCAR price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with PCAR crossing above that average target price of $73.13/share, investors in PCAR have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $73.13 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table?

However, there are a few challenges that are being faced by the auto sector. In fact, automakers are witnessing a revolutionary shift in their operations. The velocity at which consumers' preferences are changing, has promoted many automakers to reconsider their strategies. Added to this is the compulsion of manufacturing electric and \"green\" cars, which are likely to bring in several changes in the industry.There are a number of factors that raise concerns for the auto sector in both the short and the long run. Below, we discuss some of the key challenges that the auto sector might face in the coming months.Safety recalls and related costs have turned out to be a major issue for most automakers. Per the U.S. Transportation Department, automakers recalled 53.2 million vehicles in the United States in 2016, setting a new record. In total, automakers announced nearly 927 recalls for safety issues in 2016, which is another record high.The previous record for both the number of recalls and vehicles recalled was set in 2015, when automakers announced 900 recalls covering 51.1 million vehicles. Notably, these figures only cover the recalls in the United States; the global numbers are a lot higher.Auto recall figures for 2017 are also expected to be high as a result of the defective Takata airbag inflators, which resulted in significant recalls between 2014 and 2016. The U.S. regulators expect recalls to eventually affect roughly 42 million vehicles in the country, with nearly 70 million Takata airbags. This also marks the largest auto recall in the United States.Recently, General Motors Company (GM) recalled around 800,000 pickup trucks across the globe. The recall includes 2014 models of Chevrolet Silverado 1500, as well as GMC Sierra 1500, which could lead to loss of power steering. Per company reports, the 2014 model trucks can come across as a temporary loss of power steering, majorly during low-speed turning maneuvers. The recall includes approximately 690,000 vehicles from the United States, 80,000 from Canada and approximately, 25,000 from other markets, globally.Meanwhile, Volkswagen AG's (VLKAY) emission scandal is responsible for a significant number of recalls. Also, EPA accused Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) of using software to manipulate emissions in vehicles that would have otherwise violated the Clean Air Act. This may again lead to a large number of recalls.Strict regulatory implementation by the government and high fines imposed in recent years on many automakers for delay in reporting safety issues prompted a number of companies to proactively announce safety recalls. Recall-related repair costs increase the financial burden of auto manufacturers. A massive recall can also hurt sales as consumers start questioning the brand's safety.Following two years of record volumes, most analysts believe that U.S. auto sales are likely to plateau in 2017.Pent-up demand from the recession period, which drove sales in the last few years, seems to have been satisfied. Moreover, with several rate hikes planned by the Fed, interest rates on auto loans might rise.Vehicle sales in the United States have already been showing weakness throughout the year. Analysts are predicting sales to plateau at around 17 million annually for the foreseeable future after two consecutive years of record results. Sales have been falling as potential buyers have become more erratic despite generous incentives offered on vehicles. Those discounts, which erode profits of automakers, have recently spread to high-margin pickup trucks and SUVs that have garnered strong demand amid low gas prices.Although the European auto market is recovering, it is expected to witness slower growth this year. Per the IHS Markit report, light vehicle sales growth in 2017 is expected to slow down to 1% compared with growth of 6.2% in 2016. Uncertainty related to macro-economic conditions and political developments remain in the region.Used car prices have been declining in the United States. The NADA Used Car Guide's used car index has been falling consistently over the last few months, with an exception in March. In 2017, prices are expected to decline 6.5% year over year. This expected fall in price is 2.5%, worse than 2016's price fall of 4%.This has been supported by a large number of leased cars coming off of the lease, increasing the supply of used cars. A fall in price of used cars will lead to a decline in demand for new cars. Moreover, automakers may need to offer further incentives to boost new car sales.Alternately, for companies such as CarMax Inc. (KMX) -- dealing primarily in used cars -- a decline in average selling price is expected to affect revenues.Auto loans have been rising consistently over the last few years, touching a record $1.16 trillion in 2016, per the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. While this rise in loans has been driving auto sales, consumers with the riskiest credit profiles saw the highest growth. This has led to a significant rise in auto loan delinquencies. For loan providers, as bad debts increase, the loans provided will also decline, affecting demand for vehicles.The majority share of the automobile market is held only by a few leading automakers. The top 10 global automakers account for nearly 81% of the total vehicles sold, according to marketrealist.com.Moreover, high dependence on these automakers makes auto parts' suppliers vulnerable to pricing pressure and production cut. Pricing pressure from automakers constricts margins of parts suppliers. Simultaneously, frequent production cuts by automakers to cope with market adjustments affect suppliers' operations.Some auto industry suppliers that are dependent on a few major automakers are Meritor Inc. (MTOR), Tenneco Inc. (TEN) and Magna International Inc. (MGA).The auto industry continues to face a number of challenges. As a result, we would advise investors to dump stocks with a Zacks Rank # 4 or 5 such as Harley-Davidson, Inc. (HOG), Tata Motors Ltd. (TTM) and Gentherm Inc. (THRM).Meanwhile, investors who continue to be optimistic about the sector can check out companies like Continental AG (CTTAY), PACCAR Inc. (PCAR) and Fox Continental Holding Corp. (FOXF), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  .Continental has a long-term growth rate of 7.9%.PACCAR has a long-term growth rate of 10%.Fox Factory has a long-term growth rate of 14%.Check out our latest  for more on the current state of this market from an earnings perspective, and how the trend is looking for this important sector of the economy now.Tech stocks have been a major force behind the market's record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

General Motors Company  and Ford Motor Company's  pickups and popular crossovers along with Toyota Motor Corp's  SUVs primarily boosted the sales figures.Americans bought cars and light trucks at the fastest rate in a dozen years in September as consumers in hurricane-hit areas of the country replaced flood-damaged cars. The momentum is expected to continue as many are still on the lookout for better bargains. Given the positive trends, investing in stocks related to the auto industry seems sensible.The auto industry reversed a year-long downward trend and posted solid uptick in car sales in September. According to Autodata Corp, the seasonally adjusted annual sales rate for all U.S. light vehicles touched 18.57 million units last month, up from 16.14 million in the prior month. It also marked the highest sales rate since July 2005.Auto sales increased as many drivers in hurricane-affected locations, in particular Texas, replaced damaged cars. Almost 500,000 cars were destroyed after hurricane Harvey, the first major hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland in almost 12 years, had put vast areas under water. As per industry estimates, around 200,000 cars were damaged during hurricane Irma that had hit the Sun Shine state of Florida.Several analysts predicted that such hurricanes would help automakers register their first monthly gain this year. Chief investment strategist at Cascend Securities, Eric Ross added that car sales may increase in the later part of 2017 and beginning of 2018. This is because many have been mulling over the purchase of new automobiles since May. Such online activities are primarily done three to four months before the real purchase takes place.The three largest sellers in the United States - General Motors, Ford Motor and Toyota - posted strong sales numbers in September following months of declines. Honda Motor Co., Ltd.  and Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.  also posted higher-than-expected sales. - The No. 1 U.S. automaker led the pack with 279,176 cars and trucks sold in the United States in September, up 11.9% on a year-over-year basis. This represented a nearly 12% jump in sales compared to the same period last year. Such a feat was possible owing to a 43% increase in sales of crossovers and 10% uptick in pickup trucks, which overshadowed an 11% decline in passenger cars. Kurt McNeil, U.S. vice president of GM's sales operations said that \"our new crossovers from Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac have been very well-received, and Chevrolet had an outstanding month with the Silverado and Colorado.\"General Motor's inventory level dropped to 76 days supply in September from 88 days in August. This is a positive, especially, when analysts criticized the automaker for having oversupply of new vehicles. In fact, General Motors claimed that it will reduce its inventory level further to 70 days by the end of the year. - The automaker sold 221,643 vehicles in total, gaining 8.9% on a year-over-year basis. Its F-Series pickup sales surged 21.4%, with 82,302 trucks sold. Demand for its Super Duty, with the premium Lariat, King Ranch and Platinum trim levels, remained strong.Ford added that sales of its Explorer, Sport and SportTrac SUVs totaled 21,207. Mark LaNeve, Ford vice president, U.S. marketing, sales and service added that their \"business was strong nationwide, with retail increases in 12 of our 21 sales regions, with particular strength in Houston.\" - The automaker sold 226,632 cars in total, up 14.9% on a year-over-year basis. The automaker's gains were broad based, with its RAV4 compact SUV climbing 44% after a new Canadian assembly plant gained momentum. Sales of its flagship product Camry also jumped after the Georgetown, KY, assembly plant switched to a new generation of vehicle manufacturing methods.Toyota's light trucks, including Tundra, Tacoma, Highlander and 4Runner, gained as well. Overall, the segment rose nearly 29%. David Christ, vice president of U.S. sales for the Toyota brand, said that last month sales had got a \"significant boost right away\" from post-hurricane recovery efforts, especially, in Texas.Here's a look at how other two major players performed in September:\n  \n(Source:  )With U.S. car sales gaining momentum on post-hurricane vehicle demand, it would be prudent to invest in certain stocks related to the auto industry.

Sales of new vehicles reached an all-time high in the United States. Europe and China too came up with impressive sales figures. This also marked a wonderful recovery from the depths of the recession.However, the joy ride did not continue in 2017. Reports of glut in nearly-new used vehicles started pouring in. Auto giant General Motors Company (GM) lowered the outlook for new vehicles sales in the United States in 2017. Market reality has prompted a number of automakers to take a disciplined stance. Some of the companies are mulling over cutting production fleet.However, there are still a few reasons to be optimistic about the broader auto industry both in the short and long run. Below, we discuss a few key factors that should continue to drive the sector's performance in the near to medium term.Global Sales to Grow ModestlyAccording to IHS Markit forecast, total global light vehicle sales will reach 93.5 million units in 2017, up 1.5% from 2016. Majority of the global growth can be attributed to China. Chinese-targeted auto excise duty incentives are expected to continue through 2017.IHS Markit anticipates China to remain the world's largest car market for the foreseeable future. It has uplifted its 2017 light vehicles sales in China forecast to 28.5 million units (up 1.9%).Per the IHS Markit report, South Asian demand is likely to further recover in 2017. Light vehicle sales in the region are expected to grow 5.9% in 2017.Meanwhile, Association of Southeast Asian Nations (\"ASEAN\") car markets are anticipated to grow 4.6%, as recoveries continue in key markets.Further, the high average age of cars on U.S. roads should continue to boost replacement demand for cars as well as car parts. According to IHS Automotive, by 2021, around 81 million vehicles are expected to be over 16 years old compared with 62 million vehicles today. This will benefit replacement part manufacturers and retailers, apart from new vehicle manufacturers and retailers.A number of automakers, including the likes of Ford Motor Co. (F) and General Motors Company (GM), have been banking on strong sales growth in China to drive earnings over the next few years. Auto sales in the world's largest automobile market increased 14.5% year over year to a record 28,119,000 units in 2016. Sales of passenger cars increased 14.9% to almost 24.38 million units, hitting a new high. Moreover, sales of commercial vehicles improved 5.8% year over year.In the first seven months of 2017, both passenger cars and commercial vehicles registered robust sales in China. Sales of passenger cars increased 2% year over year to almost 12.93 million units in the first seven months of 2017, while sales of commercial vehicles rose 17.5% to 2.39 million units. Consequently, total automobile sales increased 4.1% year over year to over 15.33 million units.New passenger car registrations in the European Union increased 4.7% to more than 8 million units in the first half of 2017, per the European Automobile Manufacturer's Association. The rise can be attributed to higher demand in Italy (+8.9%), Spain (+7.1%), Germany (+3.1%) and France (+3%), partly offset by a fall in demand in the United Kingdom (-1.3%). Rising consumer confidence, solid incentives, strong replacement demand and product launches are driving sales.Rising sales and intense competition are encouraging automakers to come up with new and attractive, technologically advanced vehicles to gain market share. Most automakers are also revamping their popular vehicles by adding new technologies and enhancing their visual appeal to revive sales. Features such as backup cameras, automatic emergency braking and in-car connectivity are common in most vehicle segments.In fact, automakers are offering attractive optional features in vehicles to scoop up more profits. These features provide scope for surplus revenue generation from small cars, which have lower profit margins than large trucks.The auto industry is benefiting from a number of factors. According to IHS Automotive, total global light vehicle sales will reach 93.5 million units in 2017, increasing 1.5% from 2016. Moreover, IHS Markit anticipates China to remain the world's largest car market for the foreseeable future. It has uplifted its 2017 light vehicles sales in China forecast to 28.5 million units (up 1.9%).A few automobile stocks worth considering are Continental AG (CTTAY), PACCAR Inc (PCAR) and Fox Continental Holding Corp.

Not only that, the auto industry is undergoing a transition, courtesy of changing consumers' preference toward SUVs and crossovers, and the necessity for manufacturing electric vehicles.According to IHS Markit forecast, total global light vehicle sales will reach 93.5 million units in 2017, up 1.5% from 2016, with most of the global growth coming from China.In fact, automakers across the globe are partnering with local companies in China, the biggest car market in the world, where sales of electric vehicles are anticipated to increase.  (RNLSY) and  (NSANY) have partnered with Chinese automaker Dongfeng Motor Group Co to manufacture battery-powered automobiles in the Chinese market. Ford Motor Company (F) announced a joint venture to manufacture electric vehicles in China. Also, General Motors Co. (GM) and other automakers have shared their plans of manufacturing electric vehicles in China.On the other hand, automakers bore the brunt of expenses related to safety recalls and negative currency effects. Massive recalls related to Volkswagen AG's (VLKAY) emission scandal and Takata Corp's defective airbag inflators have been hurting the auto sector in recent times. Rising delinquency rates in auto loans are expected to hurt sales in the future.The distinctive attributes of the auto industry prompted us to have a dedicated sector for the industry in our database. The automobile sector is one of the 16 Zacks sectors, unlike the S&P classification, wherein autos are part of the Consumer Discretionary sector. The S&P has 11 sectors compared with the 16 sectors for Zacks.At the expanded classification level, the Zacks Auto sector is divided into six industries: Auto-Domestic, Auto-Foreign, Auto-Original Equipment, Auto-Replacement Parts, Auto-Internal Combustion Engines and Rubber - Tires. The level of sensitivity and exposure to the different stages of the economic cycle vary for each industry.We rank the 265 sub-industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. We put our industries into two groups - the top half (industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank). Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

This is more than double its 0.9% market cap weight in the index at present.Looking at the second-quarter 2017 results of the auto sector, earnings decreased 0.3%.

One way we can try to measure the level of fear in a given stock is through a technical analysis indicator called the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which measures momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30.In trading on Thursday, shares of PACCAR Inc. (Symbol: PCAR) entered into oversold territory, hitting an RSI reading of 28.7, after changing hands as low as $63.01 per share. By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (  ) is 42.6. A bullish investor could look at PCAR's 28.7 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.

(Nasdaq:  -  ).Industry: Autos, Part 2Link:  It was an exceptional 2016 for the auto sector. Sales of new vehicles reached an all-time high in the United States. Europe and China too came up with impressive sales figures. This also marked a wonderful recovery from the depths of the recession.However, the joy ride did not continue in 2017. Reports of glut in nearly-new used vehicles started pouring in. Auto giant General Motors Company (NYSE:  -  ) lowered the outlook for new vehicles sales in the United States in 2017. Market reality has prompted a number of automakers to take a disciplined stance. Some of the companies are mulling over cutting production fleet.However, there are still a few reasons to be optimistic about the broader auto industry both in the short and long run. Below, we discuss a few key factors that should continue to drive the sector's performance in the near to medium term.According to IHS Markit forecast, total global light vehicle sales will reach 93.5 million units in 2017, up 1.5% from 2016. Majority of the global growth can be attributed to China. Chinese-targeted auto excise duty incentives are expected to continue through 2017.IHS Markit anticipates China to remain the world's largest car market for the foreseeable future. It has uplifted its 2017 light vehicles sales in China forecast to 28.5 million units (up 1.9%).Per the IHS Markit report, South Asian demand is likely to further recover in 2017. Light vehicle sales in the region are expected to grow 5.9% in 2017.Meanwhile, Association of Southeast Asian Nations (\"ASEAN\") car markets are anticipated to grow 4.6%, as recoveries continue in key markets.Further, the high average age of cars on U.S. roads should continue to boost replacement demand for cars as well as car parts. According to IHS Automotive, by 2021, around 81 million vehicles are expected to be over 16 years old compared with 62 million vehicles today. This will benefit replacement part manufacturers and retailers, apart from new vehicle manufacturers and retailers.A number of automakers, including the likes of Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:  and General Motors Company, have been banking on strong sales growth in China to drive earnings over the next few years. Auto sales in the world's largest automobile market increased 14.5% year over year to a record 28,119,000 units in 2016. Sales of passenger cars increased 14.9% to almost 24.38 million units, hitting a new high. Moreover, sales of commercial vehicles improved 5.8% year over year.In the first seven months of 2017, both passenger cars and commercial vehicles registered robust sales in China. Sales of passenger cars increased 2% year over year to almost 12.93 million units in the first seven months of 2017, while sales of commercial vehicles rose 17.5% to 2.39 million units. Consequently, total automobile sales increased 4.1% year over year to over 15.33 million units.New passenger car registrations in the European Union increased 4.7% to more than 8 million units in the first half of 2017, per the European Automobile Manufacturer's Association. The rise can be attributed to higher demand in Italy (+8.9%), Spain (+7.1%), Germany (+3.1%) and France (+3%), partly offset by a fall in demand in the United Kingdom (-1.3%). Rising consumer confidence, solid incentives, strong replacement demand and product launches are driving sales.Rising sales and intense competition are encouraging automakers to come up with new and attractive, technologically advanced vehicles to gain market share. Most automakers are also revamping their popular vehicles by adding new technologies and enhancing their visual appeal to revive sales. Features such as backup cameras, automatic emergency braking and in-car connectivity are common in most vehicle segments.In fact, automakers are offering attractive optional features in vehicles to scoop up more profits. These features provide scope for surplus revenue generation from small cars, which have lower profit margins than large trucks.The auto industry is benefiting from a number of factors. According to IHS Automotive, total global light vehicle sales will reach 93.5 million units in 2017, increasing 1.5% from 2016. Moreover, IHS Markit anticipates China to remain the world's largest car market for the foreseeable future. It has uplifted its 2017 light vehicles sales in China forecast to 28.5 million units (up 1.9%).A few automobile stocks worth considering are Continental AG (OTCMKTS:  -  ), PACCAR Inc (Nasdaq:  -  ) and Fox Continental Holding Corp.

Like a nitwit, though, I didn't take the opportunity to load up on NVDA stock. Then, I saw it skyrocket through $100, up to nearly $170 and finally to its current $145. The question is, now what? Source: ShutterstockThere's no doubt that NVDA is one of the most attractive companies in the stock market, let alone in tech. Its stock, on the other hand, isn't quite as attractive.With its hands in self-driving cars, artificial intelligence, gaming, datacenter, cloud and other growth areas, what's not to like? NVDA has ridden these growth engines to serious gains, both in its financial results and its stock price.Nvidia stock shares are up a whopping 210% over the past 12 months and a near-stupid 607% over the last two years. The company beat EPS and revenue estimates for seven straight quarters.Q1 and Q2 of fiscal 2017 saw modest revenue growth of 13% and 24.3%, respectively. But, in Q3 and Q4 that growth rocketed to more than 50%. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, NVDA grew sales by more than 49% and the momentum looks set to continue.Last quarter, gaming revenue topped $1 billion, a near-50% increase year over year. Data center revenue of $409 billion grew 186%, nearly tripling \"as more of the world's computer scientists engage deep learning,\"  . \"The AI revolution is moving fast and continuing to accelerate,\" he added.The rest of the revenue breakdown can be found,  .Nvidia also announced various partnerships with leading companies like  ,  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NASDAQ:  ),  (NYSE:  ),  (NASDAQ:  , NASDAQ:  ) via its Google Cloud division, among others.Simply put, Nvidia's got its mojo and it's not going away anytime soon.Unfortunately, while Nvidia's business is super attractive, its stock is not. Trading at more than 12.5x times sales and more than 40x forward earnings estimates is expensive. Despite the monster revenue growth in recent quarters, analysts only expect overall sales to grow about 20% this year and next. On the earnings front, forecasts call for approximately 20% growth this year and 13% in fiscal 2019.Realistically, how much upside could be left, given the current valuation for NVDA?Nvidia has been blowing away analysts' expectations. Most recently, guidance for next quarter again came in above consensus. But, in order for Nvidia stock to continue its rally, these types of blowout results will be necessary.There's a lot going on in the chart. First, the recent pullback. We can see where NVDA stock blew-out near $170. Momentum was exhausted (noted by the MACD in the purple circle) as NVDA quickly embarked on a notable pullback.For super short-term traders, there's a level of support around $145 (green line). However, I wouldn't put a whole lot of faith into this level holding unless using a very tight stop-loss. On that note, a larger, tech-wide pullback would almost guarantee NVDA stock falls through this level. The  (  ) has been struggling and a larger pullback could develop.If so, hopeful bulls can pray for a pullback down to $120. This was previously a large level of resistance for NVDA.

In the last quarter, the company reported in-line earnings.The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in two of the trailing four quarters, with a negative average surprise of 0.96%.The company has a long-term growth rate of 10%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement. | Our proven model shows that PACCAR is likely to beat estimates this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. The  for PACCAR is +2.04% because the Most Accurate Estimate of $1 is pegged above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . PACCAR currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of an earnings beat. Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.PACCAR benefits from a sizeable market share in the U.S. and Canada. Also, the company undertakes active capital deployment. It has achieved Class 8 retail market share of 27.4% in the U.S. and Canada in 2015 and 28.5% in 2016. Additionally, the above 16-ton market share increased to 15.5% in 2016, from 14.6% in 2015.PACCAR is well-positioned in key markets due to its strategic investments. For 2017, the company targets capital investments in the range of $375-$425 million besides research and development expenses of $250-$280 million.The company continues to expand its global network of strategically located parts distribution centers (PDC). PACCAR is optimistic about its expansion plans in South America and Russia. The DAF factory in Ponta Grossa and the establishment of a subsidiary named DAF Trucks in Russia are expected to boost earnings.The company also opened a new distribution center in Renton, WA, in Apr 2016 to support the rising demand for its TRP branded parts. Further, it is expanding the 35-year old truck factory in Denton, TX and adding a new automated storage system for painted components. This will increase both productivity and capacity at the plant.PACCAR's shares have gained 9.2% in the last one month, substantially outperforming the 0.9% decline of the  it belongs to.Here are a few other top-ranked companies you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Cummins Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +3.1% and carries a Zacks Rank #2.

(Symbol: PCAR) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $68.14, changing hands for $68.48/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 14 different analyst targets contributing to that average for PACCAR Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $44.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $85.00. The standard deviation is $11.099.But the whole reason to look at the  PCAR price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes. And so with PCAR crossing above that average target price of $68.14/share, investors in PCAR have been given a good signal to spend fresh time assessing the company and deciding for themselves: is $68.14 just one stop on the way to an even  target, or has the valuation gotten stretched to the point where it is time to think about taking some chips off the table? Below is a table showing the current thinking of the analysts that cover PACCAR Inc.:\n  \nThe average rating presented in the last row of the above table above is from 1 to 5 where 1 is Strong Buy and 5 is Strong Sell.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because PACCAR is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings-with the most up-to-date information possible-is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for PCAR in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.05 per share for PCAR, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 99 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for PCAR, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +6.06% heading into earnings season. | A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that PCAR has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see  .Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for PACCAR, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

After all, who wouldn't want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let's put  stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:A key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock's current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, PACCAR has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 16.90, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.34. While PACCAR's current PE level puts it almost in line with its midpoint over the past five years, the current level stands below the highs for the stock, signaling scope for entry.However, the stock's PE also compares unfavorably with the Zacks classified Auto-Tires-Trucks sector's trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 11.21. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively overvalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that PACCAR's forward PE is roughly same as its trailing twelve months value, so we might say that the forward earnings estimates are incorporated in the company's share price as of now. We define forward PE as current price relative to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current fiscal year.Another key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock's price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, PACCAR has a P/S ratio of about 1.31. This is quite lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.16 right now, which indicates that the stock is undervalued from the P/S aspect too.In aggregate, PACCAR currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of 'B', putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes PACCAR a good choice for value investors.Though PACCAR might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of 'B' and a Momentum score of 'F'. This gives PCAR a Zacks VGM score-or its overarching fundamental grade-of 'C'. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores  )Meanwhile, the company's recent earnings estimates have been somewhat encouraging. The current quarter has seen six estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to two lower, while the full year estimate has seen four up and three down in the same time period.Notably, this has had a positive impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 2.1% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has climbed 0.8%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below: | However, industry challenges like stiff competition and higher supply of used trucks remain threats for the stock, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).PACCAR is an inspired choice for value investors, given its decent lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish industry rank (Bottom 18% out of over 250 Zacks industries) and a Zacks Rank #4, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. Further, the Zacks categorized Auto Manufacturers - Domestic industry has cleary underperformed the broader market in the last two years, as you can see below:So despite having good value metrics, we find that PACCAR is not a strong value contender at this point, especially in light of its poor Zacks Rank and industry weakness.Just released, today's 220 Zacks Rank #5 Strong Sells demand urgent attention. If any are lurking in your portfolio or Watch List, they should be removed immediately. These sinister companies because many appear to be sound investments.

Nearly 18 million vehicles were sold over both 2015 and 2016, a feat which is unlikely to be repeated in 2017.Previously, a combination of factors was driving the market higher. These include the likes of cheap fuel prices, easy credit, new models and an improving labor market. But the trend seems to be undergoing a reversal at the moment. As a whole, auto sales have declined on a year-over-year basis for five months in a row.The last such decline, in May, has heightened concerns that the first annual slide in terms of sales in eight years is in the offing. It is widely believed that the reason for this reversal of fortunes is automakers' unwillingness to pursue the approach they had adopted in the past. Instead of extending further incentives - a practice which was prevalent previously in order to hold up sales - automakers are focusing on profitability.In this context, it is important to determine which of the two traditional auto majors, Ford Motor Company  and General Motors Company  are better placed at the moment. Both stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see Other auto stocks from the Zacks  industry which also carry a Zacks Rank #3 include Harley-Davidson, Inc.  and PACCAR Inc.  .The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry has tasted success over the last one year, gaining 25.6% in the process. GM has underperformed the industry with a gain of 19.6% over this period. This is why it is stronger in terms of price performance since Ford has lost 13.4% over the same period.Since the auto sector is capital intensive, the most appropriate ratio to value companies is EV/EBITDA. Additionally, it is the ideal metric to compare two companies within the same industry. Further, it is not impacted by differing capital structures and excludes the impact of non-cash expenses.First, it is important to consider where the industry as a whole stands from a valuation perspective. Here, we can see that with an EV/EBITDA of 8.5, the entire domestic auto industry is marginally undervalued compared to the S&P 500, which has a value of 10.88.Coming to the two auto majors, both Ford and GM are undervalued relative to their broader industry. However, GM holds the edge here with an EV/EBITDA value of 5.27, lower than 6.56 for Ford.This is an important metric for the purpose of evaluating these two stocks since the industry is capital intensive in nature. The debt-to-equity ratio is a good indicator of the financial well-being of the company and its level is a good proxy for its debt servicing capacity. In this case, the industry as a whole has an alarmingly high debt-to-equity ratio of 243.23.However, Ford is saddled with an even poorer debt-to-equity metric of 476.41. This round easily goes to GM, which has a debt-to-equity ratio of 196.7, which is lower than GM's as well as that of the broader industry.This is a key metric of profitability and is utilized by investors to gauge the level of net profit returned relative to equity held by shareholders. Here, GM is clearly ahead with a return on equity level of 22.82%, which is higher than the industry's level of 20.49%. Ford is at a disadvantage here, since its level of 19.36% is lower than the levels being sported by the broader industry and GM.In the last one year period, Ford offered a higher-than-industry dividend yield. While the domestic auto industry offers a yield of 2.76%, Ford returned 5.32%. Since GM has a dividend yield of 4.38%, the marginally smaller auto stock wins this round fair and square.Considering a more comprehensive earnings history, Ford has delivered earnings surprises in two of the four preceding quarters. On the other hand, Ford has delivered earnings surprises in all of the four preceding quarters.While Ford has an average earnings surprise of 4.7%, GM stands out with an average earnings surprise of 17.8%. GM is also at an advantage when considering  , since it has an ESP value of 0, compared to Ford's value of -6.8%.Our comparative analysis shows that Ford holds an edge over GM only when considering dividend yield. However, on all other counts, including price performance, EV/EBITDA, debt-to-equity, return on equity and earnings history, GM is clearly a better stock. Moreover, it carries an ESP value of 0 compared to Ford's level of -6.8%, which is why it should be preferred over its prime competitor.Before looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

Elon Musk, with his clean energy goals and sky-high ambitions, charmed investors once again at the annual shareholder meeting.But before that, they cleared the way by ratifying regular board proposals and voting against the Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Fund's proposal to declassify the board, which would then necessitate an annual election of all directors.The proposer said that classified boards hampered the ability of shareholders to hold directors accountable since not all directors are elected every year. Tesla's (NASDAQ:  ) board said that a continuity factor in the board was essential to carry out long-term initiatives and create shareholder value.Musk took the stage thereafter answering Twitter (NYSE:  ) questions and in the process updating investors about Tesla's cars, truck, self-driving technology, manufacturing lines, etc.The electric cars were of course of greatest interest. In that respect, Musk said that Model 3 production was on track to start next month and that the configurator would go live about then for those who have already booked. There aren't too many options at the moment though (just color and wheel size) because the idea is to keep it simple so it's easier to do greater volumes. It isn't easy buying a Tesla and if you book one today, it won't be until the end of 2018 that it's delivered. Clearly, that isn't an ideal situation and something the company would like to change.As far as the crossover Model Y is concerned, Tesla did display a glimpse that was more of a tease than a revelation. The car, which will be somewhere between the Model X and the Model 3 in size, is expected to be available in 2019. Musk said it would be built on a new platform not only because the Fremont factory is running at full capacity but also because of the new architecture being employed. He admitted that it was a mistake to have built the high-end Model X on the more affordable Model S sedan design because it increased complexities and consumed more capital. The Y is expected to be twice as popular as the Model 3.The thus-far-unnamed heavy-duty, long-range, electric truck will be unveiled in September. Tesla has been collaborating with prospective trucking customers to make sure that it's built with their needs in mind. Because of the collaborations, the company wouldn't need to go hunting for customers when the product is ready to ship, roughly two years from now. It will instead focus on the number of trucks to be shipped. Musk also hinted that there would be other announcements at the truck launch event.Since the fallout with Mobileye over the driver who died at the wheel of its self-driving test car, the company has been working on its own Autopilot technology. Musk was optimistic that internal efforts (software and hardware) had yielded a product that was now set to eclipse the technology initially bought from Mobileye. Further development is expected to be smoother and quicker.Electric car adoption will depend on things like availability and choice, but charging stations are also a factor. Tesla said it will be increasing the number of supercharging locations. There will also be improvements to the car battery that may encourage people to upgrade. Since Teslas are said to be highly resilient to accidents, a customer will probably be able to turn over an older car for a newer iteration. The company intends to deal in used cars as well, so this may be how it will be building its stock/fleet.For now, the focus remains on chugging out the volumes.Tesla shares carry a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), with the main concern about them being the high valuation.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  (NYSE:  ),  (NYSE:  ),  (NYSE:  ) and  (NASDAQ:  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. After setting sales records for two consecutive years, the auto industry is looking at a relatively slower year. Nearly 18 million vehicles were sold over both 2015 and 2016, a feat which is unlikely to be repeated in 2017.Previously, a combination of factors was driving the market higher. These include the likes of cheap fuel prices, easy credit, new models and an improving labor market. But the trend seems to be undergoing a reversal at the moment. As a whole, auto sales have declined on a year-over-year basis for five months in a row.The last such decline, in May, has heightened concerns that the first annual slide in terms of sales in eight years is in the offing. It is widely believed that the reason for this reversal of fortunes is automakers' unwillingness to pursue the approach they had adopted in the past. Instead of extending further incentives - a practice which was prevalent previously in order to hold up sales - automakers are focusing on profitability.In this context, it is important to determine which of the two traditional auto majors, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:  ) and General Motors Company (NYSE:  ) are better placed at the moment. Both stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see Other auto stocks from the Zacks  industry which also carry a Zacks Rank #3 include Harley-Davidson, Inc. (NYSE:  ) and PACCAR Inc. (NASDAQ:  ).The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry has tasted success over the last one year, gaining 25.6% in the process. GM has underperformed the industry with a gain of 19.6% over this period. This is why it is stronger in terms of price performance since Ford has lost 13.4% over the same period.Since the auto sector is capital intensive, the most appropriate ratio to value companies is EV/EBITDA. Additionally, it is the ideal metric to compare two companies within the same industry. Further, it is not impacted by differing capital structures and excludes the impact of non-cash expenses.First, it is important to consider where the industry as a whole stands from a valuation perspective. Here, we can see that with an EV/EBITDA of 8.5, the entire domestic auto industry is marginally undervalued compared to the S&P 500, which has a value of 10.88.Coming to the two auto majors, both Ford and GM are undervalued relative to their broader industry. However, GM holds the edge here with an EV/EBITDA value of 5.27, lower than 6.56 for Ford.This is an important metric for the purpose of evaluating these two stocks since the industry is capital intensive in nature. The debt-to-equity ratio is a good indicator of the financial well-being of the company and its level is a good proxy for its debt servicing capacity. In this case, the industry as a whole has an alarmingly high debt-to-equity ratio of 243.23.However, Ford is saddled with an even poorer debt-to-equity metric of 476.41. This round easily goes to GM, which has a debt-to-equity ratio of 196.7, which is lower than GM's as well as that of the broader industry.This is a key metric of profitability and is utilized by investors to gauge the level of net profit returned relative to equity held by shareholders. Here, GM is clearly ahead with a return on equity level of 22.82%, which is higher than the industry's level of 20.49%. Ford is at a disadvantage here, since its level of 19.36% is lower than the levels being sported by the broader industry and GM.In the last one year period, Ford offered a higher-than-industry dividend yield. While the domestic auto industry offers a yield of 2.76%, Ford returned 5.32%. Since GM has a dividend yield of 4.38%, the marginally smaller auto stock wins this round fair and square.Considering a more comprehensive earnings history, Ford has delivered earnings surprises in two of the four preceding quarters. On the other hand, Ford has delivered earnings surprises in all of the four preceding quarters.While Ford has an average earnings surprise of 4.7%, GM stands out with an average earnings surprise of 17.8%. GM is also at an advantage when considering  , since it has an ESP value of 0, compared to Ford's value of -6.8%.Our comparative analysis shows that Ford holds an edge over GM only when considering dividend yield. However, on all other counts, including price performance, EV/EBITDA, debt-to-equity, return on equity and earnings history, GM is clearly a better stock. Moreover, it carries an ESP value of 0 compared to Ford's level of -6.8%, which is why it should be preferred over its prime competitor.Before looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

But don't lose heart: One analyst thinks PACCAR shares are due for a turnaround -- and could leave February's highs in the dust.Here are three things you should know about that.Image source: Getty Images.Over in Switzerland, analysts at megabank UBS have just upgraded PACCAR stock to buy and assigned a $75 price target. As explained in an update on  today (may require subscription), there's a shift happening in the truck market, the first signs of which should become evident later this year.Already, says UBS, PACCAR's \"Class 8 truck orders\" are up 36% year to date, and sales on the \"used truck market\" are also stabilizing. Freight activity is improving among trucking companies, and UBS says it expects to begin seeing PACCAR converting orders into production (sales and profits) over the course of this year.Data from freight industry tracker DAT supports this view. According to DAT, the average flatbed load-to-truck ratio (the amount of freight being transported, relative to the number of trucks available to transport it) in May more than doubled in comparison to May 2016, while flatbed rates rose 9.4%.What that means is more freight is being shipped, and at better prices -- a boon to trucking companies like  (NASDAQ: ODFL) -- and a boon to truck  like PACCAR, which sell the trucks that truckers need to carry their freight. (Not coincidentally, Old Dominion Freight Line itself won an upgrade from Merrill Lynch this morning, from underperform to neutral.)Further supporting this view, DAT data show that spot market loads were up 100% year over year in May, while capacity to carry those loads rose only 2.7% -- another tailwind for truck production.In UBS' view, this trend of rising demand for freight hauling and diminished supply of trucks to do it should produce 10% revenue growth for PACCAR this year. And with better utilization of its factories, production efficiency should improve, adding 110 basis points to the profit margins that PACCAR earns on its growing revenue.Nor is UBS the only one optimistic about PACCAR's prospects. According to data from  , the consensus on Wall Street is that PACCAR's earnings could more than double in comparison to 2016 earnings, rising to $3.72 per share this year, and continuing to grow as far out as 2020.Even assuming the analysts are right, though, does this mean you should buy PACCAR stock? Not necessarily.Let's assume for the moment that the estimates  right. At $3.72 per share this year, and a $62 stock price, PACCAR stock would be selling for about 16.6 times current-year earnings. That doesn't sound unreasonable, given that most analysts agree PACCAR will be able to grow earnings at about 14% annually over the next five years, and given that the stock pays a 2.6% dividend yield.Those numbers actually hit the  of 1.0 exactly on the nose -- a 16.6 P/E  divided by a \"total return\" of 16.6% from both earnings growth and dividends.What worries me, though, is the  of PACCAR's earnings. You see, while PACCAR's \"profits\" may look good this year, this company doesn't have a very good record of converting GAAP profits into actual free cash flow. Last year, for example, PACCAR reported \"earning\" $522 million -- but its free cash flow for the year was only $335 million. In fact, it's been nearly seven years since PACCAR last reported free cash flow in excess of GAAP net income, which tells me that the company's quality of earnings leaves something to be desired.Long story short? Despite UBS' endorsement, I won't be buying PACCAR stock today. While the low P/E and a decent growth rate are enticing, in the absence of strong free cash flow to back up the GAAP numbers, I just don't have faith that these earnings are all they're cracked up to be.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

By timing, we don't mean timing the market, but ensuring that you don't miss an opportunity in a high-potential stock that has either lost favor with the market because of short-term hiccups or unfounded fears, or has attracted critics' attention because the stock has run too far even though it may have just started on a long-term bull run.With the earnings season in full swing and stocks volatile, astute investors can dig up some great stocks today if they look around properly. Or simply look at these three stocks that our contributors believe are worth an astute investor's money right now:  (NASDAQ: TAST) ,  (NASDAQ: PCAR) , and A  (NASDAQ: ADBE) . The largest franchisee of Burger King restaurants, Carrols Restaurant Group gives investors a unique play on the burger wars that have been heating up again of late.Image source: Getty Images.Carrols operates 790 restaurants, or more than 10% of  's (NYSE: QSR) total number of Burger King restaurants in the U.S. and Canada. As the biggest franchisee, it has benefited from growth the burger brand has enjoyed from delivering a consistent balance between value-oriented menu offerings and premium ones. Where rival  (NYSE: MCD) wandered in the wilderness trying to emulate fast-casual restaurants with kale bowls and the like, Burger King largely hewed closely to its wheelhouse of burgers and chicken sandwiches.By spreading its costs over an ever-growing empire of restaurants, Carrols was able to leverage its size as a result. Since 2014, the franchisee has expanded its operations by more than 40% as it acquired some 234 restaurants. It can continue to grow even if times turn tough, as weaker franchisees might find themselves willing to sell to the heavyweight.And there may be some opportunity coming up. Restaurant Brands International reported its first-quarter earnings recently and said same-store sales fell 0.1% in the quarter for the first time in years. Even when McDonald's was running up several years' worth of negative comps, Burger King was still positive. While the year-ago quarter had an extra selling day in it that accounted for the decline, it still underscores the weakness present. Although systemwide sales grew 6.2% to $4.47 billion, U.S. comps were down 2.2%.That suggests Carrols could face some challenges. As the biggest franchisee in a virtually wholly franchised business, it's going to have a lot of say in the parent organization's operations. Yet that means any weakness exhibited in Carrols' stock should be considered an opportunity for investors.The restaurant operator is planning to close some 20 to 25 underperforming restaurants this year while opening 15 news ones, which ought to boost overall performance. And a one-quarter blip doesn't indicate a trend. The burger battle has left Burger King, McDonald's, and  (NASDAQ: WEN) all jockeying for position, one that's seen Burger King come out on top more often than not. With Carrols Restaurant Group's stock trading at less than 15 times earnings and just a fraction of growth estimates that are expected to expand at a 25% annual clip, this is a growth stock astute investors may want to chow down on. Activity in the North American trucking markets is picking up, improving the growth prospects for one of the world's leading truck makers PACCAR. The company, known for its Peterbilt, Kenworth, and DAF nameplates, confirmed the underlying strength in the market last month when it projected 10% higher truck deliveries for the second quarter, encouraged by the solid 40% jump in industry orders for heavy-duty Class 8 trucks in the U.S. during the first quarter. The European trucking market, where DAF has a strong foothold, also remains strong -- DAF cornered 15.7% of the market in the first quarter.Going forward, PACCAR is confident that Peterbilt and Kenworth can maintain or even better their combined 2016 North American market share of 28.5% this year. Meanwhile, PACCAR is rapidly extending its in-house MX engines to its fleet, targeting 50% of its Peterbilt and Kenworth trucks to run on its own engines by the end of this year. So, on the one hand,  in a cyclical industry, while on the other, it is reducing reliance on third-party suppliers like  for engines. I believe that's a win-win approach to growth and sustainable revenue in the future.Image source: Getty Images.PACCAR shares might have rallied 19% in the past six months, but at 16 times trailing earnings, the stock is not only substantially cheaper than the industry average but is also well below its five-year average P/E. When I'm looking at a stock for potential investment, I also pay close heed to its returns on invested capital and equity. PACCAR's five-year average ROIC of 13% and average ROE of 18% tell me that astute investors might be able to unlock good value from the stock in the long run. Shares of design software leader Adobe Systems have gained more than 40% over the last year and the company trades at roughly 34 times forward earnings estimates, but it's still a stock that has the ingredients to be a winner for growth-focused investors. Most known for its Photoshop software, Adobe is in the later stages of a successful transition to a subscription-based model, and growth for the company's recurring revenue streams looks poised to continue lifting profitability. Last quarter saw the company's subscription sales grow 29% year over year while operating income increased 52% and net income increased 57%.Its dominance in visual design software means that Adobe is in a position to continue benefiting from growth in mobile advertising, but it isn't resting on this tailwind or momentum created by its transition to a service-based model and is instead investing in innovation to stay at the forefront of its field.Adobe is making a push into artificial intelligence and analytics with the development of a virtual assistant for use with its suite of cloud software applications and recently partnered to make its Sensei assistant compatible with aspects of  's Cortana and  's Alexa platforms. Virtual reality and augmented reality present another big opportunity, with research firm DigiCapital estimating that the combined market for these emerging technologies will reach roughly $108 billion by 2021. Adobe's leading position in 3D design software means that the company is likely to play a big role in content creation for these emerging mediums.With its leading design, marketing, and product management software paving the way for continued recurring revenue gains and the potential to benefit from new technologies including AI, analytics, and VR and AR, Adobe looks like a good pick for investors on the hunt for growth.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Yet even with the results still slowing in a down part of the economic cycle for truck sales in North America, there were some bright spots, as well as some indication that business could start picking up as soon as the second quarter.Keep reading below for a closer look at PACCAR's financial and operating results, as well as what to expect going forward.Peterbilt factory. Image source: PACCAR.First-quarter revenue and earnings:\n  \nRevenue, net income, and adjusted earnings in millions. *Adjusted earnings excludes $942.6 million European Commission settlement charge in 2016.Total revenue came in nearly flat, but revenue from the sale of trucks was down 4% in the quarter, while parts sales were up 9% and financial services revenue was up 4.4%.Truck deliveries were nearly flat on a global basis, at 35,000 in the quarter versus 35,300 one year ago. Truck deliveries fell more than 8% in North America to 17,000, but were up 6% in Europe, as the North American market goes through a cycle of weak demand, while total truck sales in Europe are expected to be stronger this year than 2016.However, there are some signs that truck sales in North America may have bottomed out, at least in the near term. PACCAR said that North American orders of class 8 heavy-duty trucks were up 40% in the first quarter, and that the company's Peterbilt and Kenworth brands captured 32% of those orders. For comparison, the company reported it captured 28.5% of orders in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year, the company expects between 190,000-220,000 total class 8 trucks to be sold in North America in 2017.Image source: PACCAR.The European truck market continues to perform well, as it has in the past several years. DAF -- PACCAR's European brand -- saw truck orders increase 12% in the first quarter, capturing 15.7% of the market year to date. The company expects total European heavy-duty truck sales between 270,000-300,000 for the full year.So while the U.S. market is improving, it's still expected to be down from 2016, while sales in Europe continue to grow. In both markets, PACCAR continues expanding its share of the market with its trucks, which are renowned for their reliability, quality, and fuel efficiency.Despite reporting an increase in financial services revenue, that segment saw its earnings fall in the quarter but not because of its lease or loan portfolio. The financial services segment also handles sales of used trucks off lease, and used truck values across the industry are down recently, due to an oversupply of used truck inventory.PACCAR continues to report strong growth from its parts segment, which generated its highest-ever pre-tax profits in the quarter. Management is investing in expanding capacity there, adding more space in two facilities over the next year in order to support 3%-5% annual growth in this business.PACCAR management expects to deliver 10% more trucks in the second quarter, on higher build rates from strong North American order activity and new products in Australia. On the earnings call, CEO Ron Armstrong said that the increased build rate in North America should also increase gross margin slightly as well, as the company gains operating leverage from its higher build rate.PACCAR is also devoting substantial capital to enhancing its manufacturing and parts capabilities this year, with plans to spend $375 million to $425 million this year in capex, and $250 million to $280 million in operating expenses related to R&D.Add it all up, and PACCAR continues to gain market share, even as the cyclical nature of truck sales make for a mixed overall top- and bottom-line result. The company can't control the overall market, but management has made the company a market-beating investment for the long term, by focusing on building best-in-class trucks, leveraging its operating structure, and keeping a strong balance sheet.There will always be cyclical ups and downs, but PACCAR continues to be positioned as the best truckmaker for long-term investors.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Source: ShutterstockDemand for Tesla's cars continues to heat up and the company's plans to introduce new products has taken investor high to new levels. A tweet from Musk about the truck unveil in September got a lot of attention.After looking closer, Tesla stock may be a good buy here with plans to disrupt the trucking industry a number of ways.Tesla surpassed both  (NYSE:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) as the most valuable North American automotive company (by market capitalization) for a brief time.One of the reasons was a  on Apr. 13 from Musk to his more than eight million followers that simply read \"Tesla semi truck unveil set for September. Team has done an amazing job. Seriously next level\". That tweet got 56,000 likes, nearly 17,000 retweets and 2,000 replies, but more importantly, it gained the attention of analysts as they continue to decide how valuable TSLA stock truly is.Tesla has not yet unveiled its plans for the truck. But number crunching has begun and several analysts have  of what this means for the company and future competitors within the trucking market.Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jones said the move to have electric and/or autonomous Tesla trucks makes a lot of sense. He believes the company could be a manufacturer, service provider or operate as both.With only 10% of the U.S. new truck market, TSLA could get an additional $2.5 billion in revenue. By selling only 25,000 trucks a year, it would be the equivalent to Tesla selling around 70,000 Model 3 sedans. Those numbers seem great for investors, especially for a company that posted $7 billion in revenue in its last fiscal year. As a service provider, Jones says the company could sell trucks without batteries and then offer a battery swapping service. This service is estimated at $7.5 billion in potential revenue.Further details on a plan to make an autonomous TSLA truck could be worth even more. Trucking companies could save 60% to 70% with lower fuel, maintenance costs and insurance costs. Piper Jaffray downgraded truck manufacturers  (NASDAQ:  ) and  (NYSE:  ) due to the competition threat here. I'm surprised no one has come out positive on the trucking operators in the potential costs savings from electric trucks and autonomous ones.Tesla does not enter the trucking market without competition from both existing players and new electric truck ambitions from others.Mercedes Benz parent company  (OTCMKTS:  ) unveiled its  back in 2016 and is manufacturing a small run that will see some deliveries later this year. The company believes full production on the eTruck will happen in 2020. This will be the first fully electric truck and come with a 200km range. Keep in mind that Daimler also owns the Freightliner truck brand, which has strong market share.Perhaps the biggest competitor the Tesla truck could face is Nikola Motor, an upstart that has seen strong orders and good reviews of its truck development. However, Nikola made the  t it was switching from electric to hydrogen power. The new zero emission hydrogen powered Nikola One is estimated to have a range of 800 to 1200 miles. Nikola has over 7,000 deposits (of $1,500 each) for its trucks that have a cost of around $330,000. Plans call for Nikola to make as many as 50,000 trucks a year.There are several reasons why I believe that Tesla could be a major disruptor in the trucking market and why TSLA stock may not be done hitting highs and surpassing market caps of other automotive companies.As many investors argue, don't bet against Elon Musk. That Musk believes in the truck and sees the opportunity either as a manufacturer or service provider has to come into play here. Musk has disrupted the auto market, solar market and space exploration. I wouldn't bet against Musk or Tesla stock here either.TSLA's strong Supercharger network is another reason to like this move here. The company has led the way with electric cars by creating a huge network of Supercharger stations to recharge its cars.While it could be rather costly and overload the electric grid to add chargers for the Tesla truck at these stations, the infrastructure is there, giving it an advantage over other electric truck plans from competitors. Tesla had 790 Supercharger sites and 5,043 connections in North America at the end of the first quarter. That is increases of 36% and 46% from the prior year. New plans call to double the number of sites in North America in 2017.After a couple of years of sluggish sales, the trucking market in North America appears to be coming back. Paccar  a strong first quarter and was overly bullish on the market. Keep in mind that 69% of all U.S. freight tonnage is hauled by trucks, compared to next highest transport mode railroad at 15%.The other reason, which won't come into play until September are the intangibles, but based on Tesla's history, I believe it will come out ahead in several areas. Major concerns about the new truck are pricing, service/repair, charging stations, driving range and refueling time and cost. Without knowing all or any of these, its hard to get a great picture of how well the truck will be received.I find it hard to believe Musk would bring the truck to market if it didn't have these areas covered and can beat out competition. Keep in mind that during its Master Plan Part Deux  in July 2016, Musk said electric heavy-duty trucks were needed and in the early stage of development at Tesla. Musk said  \"substantial reduction in the cost of cargo transportation\".Tesla has a market capitalization of $50 billion with only $7 billion in revenue and an annual loss. TSLA stock continues to trade based on what's in the company's future: It is an innovator with electric cars, battery packs and charging stations. Tesla has an exciting future with a new, more affordable electric car, SUV, pickup truck and solar plans for residential houses. Add all this up and add in any future contribution from Tesla trucks and you have an investment that has to be made and left alone for years, rather than trading on news pieces and following the swings up and down.TSLA stock could be one of the best to invest in now for the next ten years as the company will innovate and disrupt wherever it can.More details on the truck will likely have to wait for investors until September. Other details on the company's products and sales figures will come throughout the year, giving Tesla stock more chances to run or correct. Important dates to watch are May 3 (first-quarter earnings) and June 6 (TSLA shareholder meeting).In September, Tesla stock could add $5 to $10 billion to its market capitalization if all the tangibles fall in line, with price, range and charging options being the big items to watch.

After  (NYSE: GE) set the pace with an earnings beat, behemoth  (NYSE: CAT) absolutely crushed Street estimates, sending the stock soaring to fresh 52-week highs.Expectations from industrial companies that are yet to announce earnings have now hit new levels. Three big industrial earnings are coming up this week:  (NYSE: CMI) ,  (NYSE: RBA) , and  (NYSE: TGH) . Here's what to expect.Cummins shares have been on a roll this year, piling on 11% year to date, as of this writing. Sales of Cummins' engines depend a great deal on the health of the trucking market, and recent industry updates have been very encouraging.Image source: Getty ImagesKey customer  (NASDAQ: PCAR) delivered strong Q1 numbers last week as it bumped up truck production to keep up with strong order rates. PACCAR pointed out how industry orders for heavy-duty Class 8 trucks in the U.S. jumped a whopping 40% year over year during the first quarter. The truck maker now projects its Q2 truck deliveries to grow 10% sequentially, which bodes well for Cummins.On another encouraging note, General Electric reported strong equipment orders from power and oil and gas industries in Q1, both of which are key end markets for Cummins' power systems and components segments.Given the backdrop, there's a chance Cummins could beat consensus estimates when it reports numbers on May 2 and even upgrade its full-year outlook. The engine leader last projected its FY 2017 revenues to be flat to down 5% and earnings before interest and tax to be 11%-11.5% of sales. Two key numbers to watch for are Cummins' market share and free cash flows to gauge whether the company can keep growing in an increasingly competitive market and maintain its dividends going forward.Ritchie Bros has gained nearly 7% in just one week, recovering much of its year-to-date losses. Part of the euphoria can be attributed to Caterpillar's earnings beat and guidance upgrade, simply because Ritchie shares a business relationship with Caterpillar. The two companies recently struck an alliance, under which Ritchie has started offering its live onsite and online auction platforms to Caterpillar and its dealers to sell used equipment. Not surprisingly, positive numbers from Caterpillar has fueled Ritchie investors' optimism.Image source: Getty ImagesInfact, Ritchie pulled off two mega auctions in the past couple of months, including record sales figures at Fort Worth, Texas where Caterpillar equipment, in particular, was in great demand. Ironically though, strong demand for used equipment bodes well for Ritchie but not as much for Caterpillar, as end users typically opt for used equipment in the initial stage of the recovery cycle before spending on new equipment. That explains why Ritchie reported record quarterly revenue rate (revenue divided by gross auction proceeds) of 14.1% in Q4 while Caterpillar continued to struggle.Given the backdrop, I expect Ritchie to deliver strong numbers when it reports May 5. Consensus estimates per Yahoo! Finance peg Ritchie's Q1 revenue and EPS to be 4.5% and 11% lower, respectively, year over year. Investors should keep an eye on two things: Ritchie's revenue rate and online sales statistics, as online is where all the action will be for Ritchie going forward.What a remarkable comeback it has been for Textainer shares this year: the stock has exactly doubled year to date as of this writing. This comes after nearly two painful years when Textainer shares crumbled as global trade slowed down and cheap intermodal containers flooded the market creating a supply glut.The situation has changed dramatically in recent months, with steel prices rebounding, outlook for the shipping industry improving, and lease rates recovering. Peer  recently  for its first quarter, which sent the stock surging double-digits.Meanwhile, Textainer also announced plans to prepay part of debt worth $424 million through a new debt facility, which could ease interest expenses to some extent. As Textainer is a highly leveraged company, its deleveraging plans, if any, is among the key things investors should watch for in its upcoming earnings release on May 4, 2017.The last data-point to keep in mind is the rate of recovery of containers from Hanjin, the South-Korean shipping giant that went bankrupt last year. The costs of recovering, however, could dent Textainer's bottom line this year. As for operating metrics, analysts are expecting 5% lower revenue and losses worth $0.13 per share versus a profit of $0.11 earned in Q1 2016.

Toyota engineers have installed a prototype of the system in a heavily modified Kenworth 18-wheeler that will soon begin operating in a test in California.This big rig is powered by electricity generated by Toyota fuel cells. Image source: Toyota.Toyota's surprise announcement came less than a week after  (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk announced that  :Musk's tweet led at least one analyst to  of heavy-truck maker  (NASDAQ: PCAR) and diesel-engine giant  (NYSE: CMI) on concerns that Tesla could emerge as a dominant player in the market for zero-emission heavy trucks. (That seems awfully premature, given that Tesla hasn't even shown its truck, much less explained how, when, or in what factory the truck will be built.)Toyota's announcement is a big warning for Tesla: The Silicon Valley upstart isn't going to be the only player in that game. And unlike Tesla, Toyota actually has a working electric truck to show off right now.Tesla's electric truck will almost certainly be powered by a battery pack, similar to those used in its cars. But unless Tesla has come up with a dramatic breakthrough, its battery-powered heavy truck is likely to have a couple of drawbacks:In theory at least, fuel cells get around those disadvantages. A fuel cell is a device that chemically converts the energy in hydrogen gas to electricity. The only \"exhaust\" is water vapor, and that can be collected and reused (it's just clean water). A fuel cell system scaled for a tractor-trailer isn't huge or heavy -- and it can be \"recharged\" in minutes, as long as there's a hydrogen refueling station nearby.Toyota's electric fuel cell truck will be tested in daily service in southern California starting this summer. Image source: Toyota.Of course, unless you're in southern California, there aren't likely to be hydrogen stations nearby. But while that's an obstacle for fuel cell passenger cars, it seems like less of an obstacle for long-haul tractor-trailers owned by a fleet operator that can build its own strategically located stations along its routes.That's the bet Toyota is making.Toyota's system was developed over the last several months by a secret \"skunk works\" team in Michigan. Working under the code name \"Project Portal,\" the team drew on the fuel cell technology developed for Toyota's Mirai sedan to create a system capable of powering a 80,000-pound \"Class 8\" 18-wheeler in a manner comparable to industry-standard diesel engines.The resulting system uses two of the fuel cell \"stacks\" developed for the Mirai, along with a 12 kilowatt-hour battery pack. The system powers a single heavy-duty electric motor that produces more than 670 horsepower and 1,327 pound-feet of torque. That's right in the same neighborhood as Cummins' latest diesel engines for tractor-trailer applications.Toyota's electric truck uses the fuel cell technology developed for its Mirai sedan. Image source: Toyota.But unlike those diesels, Toyota's fuel cells don't pollute the air. That makes air-quality regulators in California happy -- and it's no coincidence that Toyota's prototype will be tested in southern California. The Project Portal truck will begin operating at the Port of Los Angeles in a feasibility study this summer, as part of the Port's ongoing Clean Air Action Plan.That's not clear yet. Toyota doesn't currently build Class 8 heavy trucks, though it does build light and medium commercial trucks under its Hino Trucks brand. It could tool up to build fuel cell heavy trucks on its own, or it could choose to partner with an established truck builder. (It might be worth noting that Toyota's prototype is installed in a Kenworth truck. Kenworth is a PACCAR brand.)While it seems (very) likely that electric heavy trucks will be coming to America's highways in the not-too-distant future, most efforts to develop them are still in the early stages. It's impossible to say right now how the competition will take shape. But it's likely that Toyota's size, scale, and reputation for quality will make it an instant major contender in this emerging market --  it chooses to enter.I think we'll know a lot more in a year or so, after Toyota has had a chance to thoroughly evaluate its fuel cell truck in daily operation -- and after we get a look at what Tesla and others might be planning.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Elon Musk is building an electric truck, and at least one analyst thinks that could spell doomsday for Cummins and PACCAR.The news first broke last week, when  (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO  that he has a \"Tesla Semi truck unveil set for September.\" That may have been a lot sooner than investors were expecting, given that Tesla doesn't even have its Model 3 sedan on the market yet. It certainly seems to have spooked investment banker Piper Jaffray, which responded by downgrading shares of both PACCAR and Cummins this morning.Here are three things you need to know about why it did that.Image source: Cummins.PACCAR builds semis -- the enormous tractors that pull the trailers that make up the 18-wheelers on our highways, carrying goods to and fro. Cummins builds internal combustion engines to power those semis. As such, Musk's intention to build an electric truck capable of doing the same work that PACCAR's trucks do, and with a power source that could be more efficient than Cummins' and that will certainly look \"greener\" to environmentalists, poses a direct threat to the business models of both PACCAR and Cummins.Piper Jaffray makes no bones about this. In a downgrade reported this morning on  , the analyst warns that Tesla's new \"Class 8\" electric truck will have a \"potential disruptive impact\" on PACCAR.That makes sense. Even if Musk only unveils a model truck in September, and does not actually begin offering one for sale, PACCAR could see an impact on its own sales and profits, as truck companies hedge their bets and potentially put off purchases of old-tech trucks in order to be able to spend that money on battery-powered Tesla semis later.This could be the reason Piper is cutting $0.02 from its earnings projection for PACCAR this year, and $0.07 more next year, ratcheting back estimates to $3.74 in 2017, and $4.43 in 2018. It's also downgrading PACCAR stock to neutral and cutting its price target by 8%, to $66.The news is no better for Cummins. As  writes, Piper is worried that \"companies like Tesla are aiming to supplant [Cummins'] products.\" And while intention isn't accomplishment, Piper believes the risk is real enough to begin taking chips off the table.After all, Cummins shares are up 25% over the past 52 weeks, versus only a 15% gain for PACCAR stock. Piper Jaffray believes that \"Cummins' multiple has expanded to a fair level,\" and there's little left to be gained by buying the stock -- and perhaps a lot to be lost if Tesla succeeds in supplanting Cummins' internal combustion engines as the standard for powering semis.Curiously, at the same time as Piper is downgrading Cummins stock to neutral, and cutting its price target by 10% (to $144 per share), the analyst is raising its estimates for the company's earnings both this year (to $8.14) and next ($9.59). These are strange moves in a downgrade, but perhaps Piper sees the risk from Tesla as farther out, and not so immediate as the risk posed to PACCAR.The one thing Piper doesn't spend a lot of time on in making either of these downgrades is pointing out that while Tesla may pose a threat to PACCAR and Cummins, that doesn't necessarily make  a better investment than  of them.Remember: Even if Piper is cutting profits estimates for PACCAR and Cummins this year, it still expects both companies to be firmly profitable this year, and next year as well. In contrast, Tesla --  -- is not expected to earn any kind of profit either this year or next, and may only earn as little as $0.20 per share in 2019.So even if I agree in general with Piper's assessment that Cummins stock costs too much at 18 times earnings, and that PACCAR costs  too much at 44 times trailing earnings (and I do agree), that doesn't necessarily make Tesla a buy at infinity-times-negative earnings. Small consolation to Cummins and PACCAR investors, I know -- but the numbers don't lie.Even if Cummins and PACCAR stocks are not buys, I don't believe that Tesla stock is, either.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

PACCAR, maker of the Peterbilt 379 truck that plays the protagonist in the  movies, is partnering with the chip giant to bring self-driving technology to trucks.PACCAR and NVIDIA recently revealed in Berlin that they have already developed a prototype self-driving truck based on the chipmaker's DRIVE PX 2 platform. What's more, the test truck is fully capable of driving itself without the need for any human intervention, thanks to a  automated driving system.Image source: NVIDIA.NVIDIA's steps in self-driving trucks could be a big deal, as it is targeting a 300-million-strong market that's expected to move toward autonomy. IHS Automotive (a subsidiary of  ) forecasts that annual sales of self-driving Class 8 trucks could hit 60,000 units in 2035, accounting for 15% of the total trucks in this segment.The U.S. is expected to lead the way, as states are pushing for laws that will allow platoon testing of trucks on open roads. Platoon testing is a concept in which several trucks drive together in a tight formation, with the pack being controlled by the lead truck at the head of the formation and the rest being driven autonomously.This would allow the fleet to enhance fuel efficiency by 15% thanks to lower wind resistance. What's more, the autonomous capability of the followers in the pack would drive down labor costs and also address driver shortages. The benefits of the platoon concept are encouraging states like Arkansas, Iowa, South Carolina, and California to modify driving laws to allow for testing.In Los Angeles, for instance, earlier this month, three Volvo trucks were tested on a busy freeway. The trucks were just 50 feet apart from each other, with computers controlling the pedal functions on two of them. This indicates that serious efforts are being made to prove that autonomy can exist in self-driving trucks.NVIDIA's technology can go a long way in enhancing autonomous trucks, as its DRIVE PX 2 platform is based on artificial intelligence and deep learning. The platform's deep neural networks allow the cameras and sensors on autonomous vehicles to process data in real time, which enables the vehicle to locate itself on a high-definition map and judge the path ahead.This means that NVIDIA's self-driving platform teaches itself to drive using real-world inputs, so it stands to gain a lot from testing on both closed and open roads. What's more, the scalability of NVIDIA's DRIVE PX 2 platform means that it can be deployed in heavy vehicles using a multichip configuration, capable of processing more data per second and making quicker decisions.NVIDIA's  makes it clear that it has made tangible progress with the technology in partnership with PACCAR, giving it a jump-start in this potentially fertile market.Earlier this year,  (NASDAQ: AMZN) was  for a technology allowing self-driving vehicles to communicate with each other. The e-commerce giant's plans for the patent are not yet clear, but gradual moves toward automating the delivery process provide a hint that Amazon might consider developing or deploying self-driving trucks.Amazon needs to reduce outbound shipping costs, which have gone through the roof in recent years. The use of autonomous trucks to lower driver-related costs and improve fuel efficiency will provide a tool to curtail these expenses. In the past, Amazon has purchased truck trailers to exert greater control over its fulfillment process and expedite deliveries between warehouses. So, it won't be surprising if it considers buying PACCAR trucks powered by NVIDIA technology in the future.NVIDIA is definitely not the first mover in developing autonomous truck technology.  (NASDAQOTH: VOLVY) , for example, has taken big steps in this area by demonstrating that its self-driving trucks can drive in  such as underground mines. What's more, the Swedish automaker's self-driving trucks were involved in a European Union-backed cross-border platoon challenge last year, indicating that it is making tangible progress.Volvo's moves are a boon for NVIDIA, as the company has been using the chipmaker's technology to power its self-driving ambitions. The DRIVE PX 2 platform is playing a mission-critical role in the automaker's autonomous-car project, so it won't be surprising if Volvo deploys the platform in its trucks.Clearly, NVIDIA's hardware expertise has helped it strike partnerships with big names in heavy-duty trucks. Therefore, the acceptance of its self-driving platform by truck manufacturers such as Volvo and PACCAR could make this a happy hunting ground for the chipmaker.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

Sensing the potential, a wide array of automotive and technology companies are moving headlong into a driverless-car \"arms race.\"Although there are plenty of companies worthy of analysis, here we'll focus on the autonomous-vehicle efforts at work at two technology companies --  (NASDAQ: BIDU) and  (NASDAQ: NVDA) . Let's dive deeper into two companies leading the way in driverless cars.Chinese search giant Baidu is well known for its aggressive investment spending over the past several years, a strategy that  but which has weighed on the company's near-term margin and share price. In perhaps its most ambitious goal to date, Baidu has said it hopes to have its internally developed driverless cars on Chinese roads  , though probably in semi-contained areas such as airport park loops.Even if it doesn't meet that deadline, Baidu remains well situated to benefit from the rise in self-driving cars. Not only is China the world's most populous country, but it's also the world's largest automotive market, with 23.9 million autos sold last year. Of course, the company will have to compete with global rivals, both tech and automotive, that are all vying for leadership positions in this market.Complicating matters somewhat, Baidu recently lost its chief scientist, Andrew Ng, whose artificial-intelligence research efforts many saw as critical to getting Baidu's driverless-car ambitions off the ground. However, the company's research efforts have grown from nothing to employing roughly 1,300 people since 2014, and its now-established body of intellectual-capital and subject-matter experts should help Baidu remain a force in self-driving cars as trends continue to unfold.Image source: NVIDIA.The largest news to come from the semiconductor market this year has been  's(NASDAQ: INTC)  of  . The deal was a shot across NVIDIA's bow that Intel intends to become a major player in the self-driving-car space as well. However, Intel's Mobileye deal distracted from several impressive announcements that reiterate NVIDIA's strength as a leading provider of autonomous-vehicle technology.Two weeks ago, NVIDIA announced that it will partner with leading car-part maker  to create an in-car artificial-intelligence supercomputer. The deal will place NVIDIA's forthcoming Xavier system-on-a-chip into in-car hardware manufactured by Bosch, a deal both companies' executives believe will help accelerate the adoption of mass-market autonomous vehicles. According to NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang, this partnership will allow NVIDIA to provide turnkey solutions for Level 3 self-driving -- defined as semi-autonomous, whereby a driver can still use the controls if needed -- by the end of 2017. Level 4 autonomous driving -- involving systems-controlled driving in all situations -- would be ready in 2018. The company also announced that it has partnered with commercial-truck manufacturer  to integrate NVIDIA's self-driving chips into its production vehicles.The commercial opportunity is impressive. NVIDIA noted that analysts think 150 million automobiles with various levels of self-driving capabilities will be deployed by 2025, far more than the BI Intelligence estimates. In touting its PACCAR deal, NVIDIA also noted that roughly 300 million commercial trucks operate worldwide. With Intel's purchase of Mobileye, which also has partnerships with many automakers and suppliers, the battle lines for dominance in the self-driving-car space appear to be hardening. Thankfully for investors in either Intel or NVIDIA, the market for autonomous vehicles appears to be large enough to provide plenty of profits for both companies.There are plenty of interesting ways to invest in the rise of driverless cars, but Baidu and NVIDIA are two clear leaders in this increasingly important tech market.Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

In particular, weakness in North America has weighed on PACCAR's results in recent quarters, and coming into Tuesday's fourth-quarter financial report, PACCAR investors were prepared to see more declines in revenue and net income. PACCAR wasn't able to make its top and bottom lines grow, but it did continue to see important market share gains in key areas. Let's look more closely at PACCAR to see what its latest report says about the truck maker's future.Image source: PACCAR.PACCAR's fourth-quarter results showed the continuing cyclical headwinds that the truck and parts manufacturer faces. Revenue from areas outside the financial services unit fell more than 7% to $3.77 billion, and that was even worse than the 5% drop that most investors were looking to see. All told, net income was down 17% to $288.8 million, and that produced earnings of $0.82 per share. That figure was below the $0.86 consensus forecast among those following the stock.Looking more closely at PACCAR's results, the company blamed the earnings shortfall on lower truck deliveries within the North American market. That definitely showed up in the company's segment numbers, which showed much bigger revenue declines in the U.S. and Canada, compared to smaller drops in Europe and small gains in PACCAR's rest-of-world region. New truck deliveries saw the same trends, with a decline of 1,500 units to 14,400 in the U.S. and Canada. European deliveries fell just 200 to 14,800, and deliveries elsewhere were up 200 to 4,700.From a business-unit perspective, the truck segment suffered 9% lower sales that cost it nearly 30% in pre-tax profit declines. By contrast, parts revenue was up almost 2% and sent pre-tax profit for the segment up almost 10% from year-ago levels. The financial services unit has mixed performance, with gains in revenue but a double-digit percentage drop in pre-tax income.Yet despite tepid financial performance, PACCAR still managed to gain market share. The company's Kenworth and Peterbilt divisions boosted their share of the Class 8 retail truck market by more than a full percentage point to 28.5%, and the DAF unit saw almost as much improvement in the above 16-tonne market in Europe, boosting share to 15.5%.CEO Ron Armstrong was concise in his praise for the company. \"PACCAR's financial results reflect the company's premium-quality products and services, increased European truck deliveries, higher truck market share, and good aftermarket parts and PACCAR Financial Services results,\" Armstrong said.Looking forward, PACCAR has a lot of enthusiasm about its immediate future. In the words of its CEO, the company is \"well-positioned for long-term growth with investments in new state-of-the-art DAF, Kenworth, and Peterbilt vehicles; durable PACCAR engines; innovative aftermarket parts and service capabilities; factory enhancements; and truck technologies that increase vehicle fuel-efficiency and reliability.\" In particular, the company pointed to several accomplishments over the past year, including the new Kenworth T610 truck's introduction in Australia, a new parts distribution center in Washington state, and the planned construction of a new paint facility in Belgium with environmentally friendly features.One thing to keep in mind is that PACCAR's financial services unit is an integral part of its overall business. The division has a portfolio of 178,000 trucks and trailers, the value of which exceeds $12 billion. Offering lease options to customers is essential to maximize their financial flexibility in making use of PACCAR-built equipment, and even though pre-tax profit for the unit was down from 2015 levels, the company's strong balance sheet nevertheless puts it in a good position to keep customers coming in the door.PACCAR investors weren't entirely satisfied with the truck maker's results, sending the company's stock down about 2.5% at the beginning of regular trading following the announcement. Nevertheless, despite normal cyclical oscillations, PACCAR appears to have everything in place to keep moving forward with innovative products, efficient operations, and smart strategic vision that can tap into global growth in the years to come.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Moreover, the company undertakes active capital deployment.PACCAR is well positioned in the key markets due to its strategic investments.

As I write, Navistar stock is up more than 250% year to date. The question now is what to expect from 2017.As you can see in the chart below, stocks in the trucking sector fell on average by 45% in 2015, but then (excluding Navistar) rose by 46% in 2016:DATA SOURCE: YAHOO FINANCE. CHART BY AUTHOR.However, if you thought the upturn in 2016 was a consequence of improving truck sales and production, you would be wrong. In fact, it was a tough year for the industry, with conditions deteriorating in the second half: data by  .It appears the market saw in 2015 the signs of deteriorating 2016 truck markets, and quickly priced them in. Moving into 2016, valuations got low enough to tempt buyers into buying cheap stocks in what they hoped was a cyclical low. Of course, it didn't quite work out like that, and conditions in North America worsened as the year progressed.For example,  (NYSE: CMI) , a maker of truck engines, parts and components, started the year forecasting NAFTA heavy-duty truck production (Class 8, Group 2) of 220,000 units in 2016, only to lower it to 200,000 units at the time of its third-quarter results. Although Cummins's forecast for the key China market for heavy and medium truck sales actually improved from 720,000 units to 870,000 units, it wasn't enough to stop the company guiding toward the low end of its original full-year total sales guidance range, for a decline of 5% to 9%.No matter: The market kept buying the sector, and in particular kept buying Navistar stock. data by  . (NYSE: MTOR) , a supplier of axle, brake, and suspension components, forecasts heavy-duty Class 8 truck production in the range of 190,000 to 210,000 for its fiscal year to September 2017, compared to 253,000 in fiscal 2016. Meanwhile, Navistar's recent end market guidance calls for its core-markets industry production in 2017 to fall to a range of 305,000 to 335,000 units, from 346,500 in 2016. Other industry forecasters are calling for North American Class 8 production to be roughly flat before increasing to double digits in 2018.IMAGE SOURCE: NAVISTAR INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION.With the strong rise in 2016 out of the way, fortunes for Navistar and trucking stocks in general are likely to be dictated by U.S. industrial production and concomitant freight growth in 2017 and beyond. If freight picks up, then demand for trucks will go up, and the trucking sector will do well, as estimates for truck production will probably increase.All told, if you are confident that a Donald Trump presidency can spur U.S. GDP in 2017, and that China can avoid a hard landing, then trucking stocks will be attractive. If not, then they are best left alone.

Image source: PACCAR.Trucking markets might be losing steam, but  (NASDAQ: PCAR) isn't taking a breather: The stock's up almost 38% this year as of this writing, lagging peer  's(NYSE: CMI) staggering 56% gains but outperforming the broader market by a big margin.While I'm hugely surprised by Cummins' rally given the headwinds facing the engine maker, PACCAR appears to be in a stronger position going by what CEO Ronald Armstrong said during the truck maker's recent . Here are four encouraging quotes from Armstrong that should also give you an idea about what lies ahead for PACCAR.Like most leading truck manufacturers, PACCAR is cautious about the North American trucking markets: It projects industry Class 8 truck sales to be 200,000-230,000 units in 2017, slightly lower than the 2016 midpoint estimate but significantly down from 2015 sales of 278,000 trucks.However, PACCAR continues to grow its market share despite the challenges. As Armstrong explained: \"[W]e continue to increment the product lineup. And we'll continue to do that, as we have done for 20 years. And we think that will lead to continued share growth over the long term.\"Image source: PACCAR's Q3  presentation.By the end of the third quarter, PACCAR's flagship brands Kenworth and Peterbilt had cornered 31% of the North American Class 8 trucking market, up almost 4 percentage points from 2015. That's encouraging, and investors perhaps shouldn't fear much about the weaker end markets going forward as long as PACCAR continues to grow.Can you guess PACCAR's strongest market this year? Surprise, surprise: It's Europe, despite Brexit concerns. The region accounted for roughly 28% of PACCAR's total revenue during the first nine months of the year, with sales jumping 14% year over year. Armstrong is looking forward to strong growth in Europe: \"We've raised our 2016 forecast for Europe's greater than 16-tonne market to a range of 290,000 to 300,000 units, reflecting strong demand in a steady economy.\"For PACCAR, DAF is doing in Europe what Peterbilt and Kenworth are doing in North America. DAF's share in the European heavy-duty market improved a percentage point to hit 15.6% as of the end of the third quarter. DAF started off with a market share of only about 9% when it was acquired by PACCAR two decades ago. Gaining market share in a market ruled by local giants like Daimler and Volvo is no mean feat.Weak end markets haven't deterred PACCAR from investing in growth: It expects to spend $375 million to $425 million on capital projects and $270 million to $300 million on research and development in 2017, both of which are higher than its 2016 estimated spending.Armstrong elaborated where the company will put all that money: \"These investments will enhance PACCAR's integrated powertrain, deliver advanced driver assistance and truck connectivity technologies, and add additional capacity and efficiency to the company's manufacturing and parts distribution facilities.\"Backed by a strong balance sheet and cash flow, PACCAR has invested more than $6 billion in capital projects in the past decade. Higher spending during a downturn reflects the company's intent to build a strong foundation for the future. Going forward, I expect PACCAR's increased investments in powertrain could particularly prove beneficial, as I explain next.Not many know that PACCAR manufactures engines as well and is, ironically, turning out to be a major threat to Cummins, one of its key engine suppliers.Image source: PACCAR's Q3  presentation.You can see how rapidly PACCAR has ramped up its engines business in recent years. As of the third quarter, PACCAR's own engines powered 47% of its Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks. Its long-term goal is to power 80% to 85% of its trucks on in-house engines, which should greatly reduce its dependency on Cummins.If that isn't enough, PACCAR launched its propriety axle last quarter in what can be considered yet another step toward vertical integration. Armstrong revealed his plans during the call: \"If you look out probably a year or two down the road, this axle will probably be 30%, 40%, 50% of the axles that we put on our North American vehicles. And, of course, the axles we put on DAF products are 100% PACCAR axles.\"From trucks to engines to parts, PACCAR has come a long way, displaying its innovative leadership all along. Even if end markets weaken, PACCAR's disciplined capital allocation and focus on growth should steer it ahead in 2017 and beyond.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In the last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 1.01%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.PACCAR is well positioned in the key non-U.S. markets due to its strategic investments. The company continues to expand its global network of strategically located parts distribution centers. These factors should drive fourth-quarter earnings.Moreover, in 2016, industry sales in Europe's above 16-ton truck market are expected in the range of 290,000-300,000 units, higher than 269,000 units sold in 2015. The market is benefiting from positive economic growth and increased freight activity. Higher industry sales should translate into higher sales for the company as long as it maintains or increases its market share.However, Class 8 industry retail sales in the U.S. and Canada are projected in the range of 215,000-225,000 units for 2016, lower than the prior projection of 220,000-240,000 units as well as 278,000 units sold in 2015. This indicates the possibility of a year-over-year decline in the fourth quarter as well, which may adversely impact the company's results.Our proven model does not conclusively show that PACCAR is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below: The Earnings ESP for PACCAR is -3.45% because the Most Accurate estimate is 84 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at 87 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our  . |  PACCAR carries a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company's negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.PACCAR has outperformed the Zacks categorized  industry in the last one year driven by benefits from a sizeable market share in the U.S. and Canada along with active capital deployment. The company's expansion plans as well as rising European sales also drove the share price. The company's shares have increased 43.7% over a year, compared with a 31.9% gain recorded by the industry.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Wabash National Corporation  has an Earnings ESP of +2.63% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is slated to report fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 results on Jan 31. You can see Autoliv Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +3.85% and a Zacks Rank #3.

As you can see in the chart below, the whole sector -- including Dana's customers such as  (NYSE: NAV) and  (NYSE: CMI) , and rivals such as  (NYSE: MTOR) -- reported very strong gains. The question is: Can its run continue in 2017? data by  .Before analyzing the company's growth drivers, let's look at how Dana makes money. A good way to start is by breaking out its EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) for the first nine months of 2016. As you can see, most of Dana's EBITDA comes from its light-vehicles segment.Data source: Dana Incorporated presentations. Chart by author. Amounts in millions of U.S. dollars.Key customers for Dana's axles and driveshafts in the light-vehicle market include  -- its largest customer, contributing 20% of total 2015 sales -- and, to a lesser extent,  ,  , and  . Within commercial vehicles, customers include  (NASDAQ: PCAR) -- Dana's second-largest customer, contributing 8% of total sales in 2015 -- Ford, and Navistar.  and  are customers in off-highway, and the power technologies segment sells to Ford, Cummins,  , and others. Meritor is a key competitor.Its customer list is almost a who's-who of the automotive industry. That said, I would pick out three key customers/end markets worth closely following:Ford and PACCAR are obviously important because of their contribution to current sales/earnings, but Navistar is likely to be in the future, too. Dana and Navistar recently signed a multiyear sales agreement granting Navistar access to all Dana's driveline product offerings.  's investment in and collaboration with Navistar  and product range, and Dana looks like it's also set to benefit.Data source: Federal Reserve. Chart by author. Seasonally adjusted annual rate. Amounts in millions of units.However, the outlook for heavy-duty truck sales is mixed. Many forecasters, including Dana, are predicting another decline in class 8 North American truck production in 2017, to around 200,000 units from 228,000 in 2016, only to bounce back to double-digit growth in 2018. In other words, conditions will get worse before they get better.Acquisitions and deals, such as the Navistar agreement discussed above, are also expected to spur growth. For example, Dana is in the process of purchasing the power transmission and fluid power businesses of Brevini Group, adding off-highway technologies for tracked vehicles, which is forecast to add around $400 million in sales in 2017, on top of Dana's continuing business revenue of around $5.9 billion.Finally, in the long term, Dana's management sees its technologies benefiting from the drive toward greater efficiency created by increasing sales of all-wheel-drive vehicles (which tend to be heavier) and toward automakers' needs to meet fuel-efficiency standards.One of Dana Incorporated's axles used in the agricultural sector. Image source: Dana Incorporated.Frankly speaking, if you can say with a high degree of confidence that Dana will hit its 2019 targets of $360 million in free cash flow and diluted adjusted EPS of $2.60, then the stock is a buy. Those figures would mean Dana trades at a 2019 P/E ratio of 7.4 times earnings and that it would generate 9.7% of its enterprise value in free cash flow in 2019.The problem is that this belief requires confidence in current forecasts for light-vehicle and truck sales -- not an easy thing to have when both appear to be faltering in the near term. It also needs Dana to have a trouble-free year in terms of completing acquisitions and integrations. Furthermore, 2017 is set to be a year of heavy capital spending, and therefore a dip in free cash flow to around $60 million, representing just 1% of sales compared to 2% in 2016.In other words, the stock looks like a good long-term value, but anxious investors, beware: It's going to take at least a couple of years of solid execution and favorable market conditions before the stock looks cheap on a headline basis. This isn't a stock for an impatient investor.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

After all, the guy's not in the Oval Office and hasn't even picked a lot of his Cabinet members yet! But based on his promises and proposals during the campaign, there are some hints as to what industries might pay off for investors on Trump's watch -- and specialty truckmaker  (NYSE: OSK) shows signs of potentially being in the sweet spot for investors.Here 's why Oshkosh could be the ultimate company to own while Trump is in the White House.Fire trucks are just one of Oshkosh's many business lines. Image source: Getty Images.Trump has called for large  to \"transform America's crumbling infrastructure.\" In fact, he's even put a price tag on his plan: $1 trillion in spending over the next decade.But although the common shorthand for infrastructure spending is \"roads and bridges,\" Trump's plans, as detailed on his campaign website, go even further. He proposes \"investments in transportation, clean water, a modern and reliable electricity grid, telecommunications, security infrastructure, and other pressing domestic infrastructure needs.\" In another statement, Trump also listed mass transit and high-speed rail among his infrastructure priorities. He's also lamented that American airports are \"like [those] from a third-world country.\"No matter which of these particular proposals are included in an eventual infrastructure package, Oshkosh probably has a specialty truck available for the job. It services the general construction industry with vehicles like telehandlers (think forklifts on steroids) and concrete mixers, sales of which would benefit from all forms of construction. Sales of the company's aerial work platforms would benefit from improvements to the telecommunications and electricity grids. And the company would even benefit from spending on airports and security infrastructure through its fire and emergency division, which sells -- among other things -- airport fire control vehicles and homeland security apparatus.Trump has made no secret of his plans to increase the size of the military. In a speech at the private club Union League of Philadelphia, he lambasted Congress and the Obama administration for cutting 10% of the defense budget through sequestration. On his website, he pledges to \"[w]ork with Congress to fully repeal the defense sequester and submit a new budget to rebuild our depleted military.\"That's good news  , but even better for Oshkosh is the fact that Trump wants to raise the number of active duty soldiers in the U.S. Army to 540,000, or an increase of about 60,000 troops. According to Trump and Gen. Mark Milley, the Army's chief of staff, such an increase is needed to meet current threats. Trump also wants to grow the U.S. Marine Corps to 36 battalions.Some of Oshkosh's defense division's best-selling products are personnel transporters, and all of the manufacturer's offerings are designed -- naturally -- to support ground operations. So the more troops in the U.S. Army, the more need there will be for Oshkosh products like the mine-resistant ambush protected all-terrain vehicle or the joint light tactical vehicle the company is currently developing.But what if Trump's plans don't come to fruition? Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has stated that an infrastructure spending bill wouldn't be a high priority for the Senate. Budget hawks in Congress could scuttle Trump's proposals to increase military spending. Other issues could come to the forefront that demand time and energy, putting these proposals on the back burner.The good news for Oshkosh investors is that the company had a strong outlook for 2017 even before Trump's election. And while the stock has jumped since Nov. 8, the company had just reported  , and management was already projecting increased net sales and earnings for 2017.Over the past five years, the stock has outperformed standard truckmakers like  ,  construction equipment manufacturers like  , and even defense contractors like  . It's done so again since the election. But don't be fooled by what looks like an unreasonable jump in Oshkosh's price. The lower chart shows the companies' performance in November: data by  .Still a big jump, but not an unreasonable one, given the company's excellent prospects under a Trump administration. The company also pays a dividend, currently yielding 1.22% after the stock's big surge.Oshkosh seems to be the perfect company to capitalize on Trump's election. But a perfect company isn't always a perfect investment. Clearly, the market has already caught on to Oshkosh's prospects and has bid the stock price up more than its peers; which makes sense, given that Oshkosh stands to benefit handsomely from infrastructure spending and defense spending.So investors should be cautious here. If Trump's infrastructure or defense plans don't pan out because of congressional resistance or some other factor, the stock price is likely to fall in the short term. A thesis for buying Oshkosh at this price -- currently more than 23 times earnings -- assumes that Trump's ambitious agenda will play out.Looking beyond the upcoming administration -- which any long term investor should be doing-- there is still reason to believe Oshkosh is a good investment. Even if increased infrastructure and defense spending doesn't materialize on Trump's watch in the next four or eight years,  with a bright future. Investors who buy in now should be prepared for potential short-term setbacks in the event that the Trump administration thesis doesn't pan out, but the company does look to be on the road to long-term success.When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

(Symbol: PCAR) have crossed above the average analyst 12-month target price of $58.07, changing hands for $60.33/share. When a stock reaches the target an analyst has set, the analyst logically has two ways to react: downgrade on valuation, or, re-adjust their target price to a higher level. Analyst reaction may also depend on the fundamental business developments that may be responsible for driving the stock price higher - if things are looking up for the company, perhaps it is time for that target price to be raised.There are 15 different analyst targets contributing to that average for PACCAR Inc., but the average is just that - a mathematical average. There are analysts with lower targets than the average, including one looking for a price of $44.00. And then on the other side of the spectrum one analyst has a target as high as $70.00. The standard deviation is $7.573.But the whole reason to look at the  PCAR price target in the first place is to tap into a \"wisdom of crowds\" effort, putting together the contributions of all the individual minds who contributed to the ultimate number, as opposed to what just one particular expert believes.

Nearly 20% of the sector's companies had posted results as of Oct 21. These companies recorded a year-over-year decline of 8.8% in earnings and 0.6% in revenues, per our  report. In comparison, total S&P 500 companies that have reported so far posted a 3.3% increase in earnings and a 1.8% rise in revenues.Following a strong Q2, overall projections for the auto sector are looking bleak for Q3. By the end of the earnings season, auto sector earnings and revenues are expected to be down 19.7% and 4.7%, respectively. This will place it among the worst performers in the 16 Zacks sectors. In comparison, total S&P 500 earnings are projected to improve 0.1%, with revenues rising 1.5% year over year.A large part of the projected earnings decline in the auto sector is expected due to Ford Motor Company  , which will record a $640 million recall-related expense in the quarter. Moreover, the fall in U.S. auto sales over the last two months is expected to weigh on the results of many automakers. The pressure to maintain attractive incentives and deals may also strain their margins. Further, expenses related to safety recalls as well as the negative impact of foreign currency translation remain headwinds for the sector.However, there are a few positives as well.

In the last quarter, the company had delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.91%. Further, PACCAR posted positive earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 1.65%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.PACCAR is well positioned in the key non-U.S. markets due to its strategic investments. The company continues to expand its global network of strategically located parts distribution centers. These factors should positively impact third-quarter earnings.Moreover, in 2016, industry sales in the above 16-ton truck market in Europe are expected in the range of 280,000-300,000 units, up from the prior range of 260,000-290,000 units, and higher than 269,000 units sold in 2015. The market is benefiting from positive economic growth and increased freight activity. Higher industry sales should translate into higher sales for the company as long as it maintains or increases its market share.However, Class 8 industry retail sales for the U.S. and Canada are expected to be in the range of 220,000-250,000 units in 2016, lower than the prior projection of 230,000-260,000 units as well as 278,000 units sold in 2015. This indicates the possibility of a year-over-year decline in the third quarter as well, which may adversely impact the company's results. Moreover, the company faces stiff competition in the commercial truck market.Our proven model does not conclusively show that PACCAR is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below: The Earnings ESP represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. PACCAR has an Earnings ESP of -2.02% because the Most Accurate estimate is 97 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 99 cents. |  PACCAR's Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Here are some auto companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Fox Factory Holding Corp  has an Earnings ESP of +2.56% and a Zacks Rank #1.

(Symbol: PCAR) presently has an excellent rank, in the top 25% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most \"interesting\" ideas that merit further research by investors.But making PACCAR Inc. an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Friday, shares of PCAR entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $56.25 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100.

Image source: Getty Images.The outlook for  (NYSE: OSK) is good: the company has  , positive  , and solid fundamentals, including a relatively low P/E as compared to peers like  (NASDAQ: PCAR) and  (NYSE: CAT) .However, even a company with a good outlook can be derailed. And Oshkosh has certain risk factors that could prove problematic for investors. Here are the ones to be most concerned about.Although Oshkosh Corporation has many diverse clients for its vehicles, much of its revenue is dependent on government spending. That doesn't just mean the federal government, although at 15% of the company's 2015 revenue, the U.S. government is the company's largest client. The company also sells fire and safety equipment to municipal governments, and other products like garbage trucks and cement mixers to companies that use those machines to work on government contracts.So if government spending goes down, revenue for Oshkosh could follow. Traditional truck makers like PACCAR don't have that problem.Of these government-spending-related risks, changes in the U.S. defense budget would probably have the most significant impact on the company. And many things could cause spending by the Department of Defense to drop. Weakness in the U.S. economy, further troop withdrawals from Iraq and Afghanistan, or additional budget sequestration could each have an impact on overall DoD spending. And even if overall spending remains the same or increases, the military could reallocate resources away from tactical wheeled vehicles -- Oshkosh's primary military product -- and into other areas.Even if federal government spending were to stay the same, if overall municipal spending were to drop due to an economic recession or similar reason, it would likewise have an impact on the company's bottom line. That said, sometimes government spending goes up during a recession. In 2010, for example, during the Great Recession, Oshkosh's revenue actually increased, almost entirely because of federal government contracts, which made up 72% of the company's overall revenue that year.Many of the industries in which Oshkosh operates are cyclical, so declines are not only possible, they're expected.This is particularly true of the defense segment. Until 2013, the company was riding a defense spending boom that began with the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq in 2001 and 2003, respectively. Such events usually arise quickly and unexpectedly, along with the business they produce for Oshkosh.But for every boom, there's a bust, and for Oshkosh it was the major troop withdrawals from Iraq in 2011 and from Afghanistan in 2014. With the troops went the need for new trucks, replacement parts, armoring, and other associated goods and services that Oshkosh provided.But it's not just defense: The company's access equipment market is also highly cyclical, dependent on factors as diverse as housing starts, oil and gas activity, and equipment-rental company consolidation. Broadly, though, the segment is tied to the health of the global economy, which has been recovering very slowly since the 2008 financial crisis.In fact, the slow recovery has had a negative impact on Oshkosh's sales volume relative to its historical levels in all of its non-defense areas. Lower housing starts are bad enough for Oshkosh on their own, but they also affect municipal tax revenues, which leads to lower sales of garbage trucks and fire trucks. If the recovery continues to be this slow -- or, worse, starts going in reverse -- then Oshkosh will be in big trouble.However, in a cyclical industry, even bust cycles have an end, and investors can be rewarded for buying a cyclical company near the end of one.The specialty vehicles market is a fragmented market, with Oshkosh sandwiched between small regional companies on one end and divisions of global giants like Caterpillar on the other.Oshkosh tries to use its medium size to its advantage by utilizing economy of scale over its smaller competitors, and its flexibility and ability to customize equipment over its larger ones. For the most part, this seems to be working.But there's no guarantee that it will keep working indefinitely. A larger competitor -- or even a smaller one -- could start manufacturing equipment at a low enough price that even a client wanting a customized option can't say no. A smaller competitor -- or even a larger one -- could successfully develop a new product that cuts into Oshkosh's sales. Consolidation among multiple smaller rivals, or a larger rival buying up smaller players, could create a new entity that more directly competes with Oshkosh across multiple business lines, taking away some of its competitive advantages (and some of its sales).While there's no indication that any of this is going to happen, product innovation often comes as a surprise, meaning investors might not hear about such a development until it was already upon them.When government spending decisions have as much of an impact on a company as they have on Oshkosh, the stock can be a risky proposition for investors. Fickle political winds can shift at any time, causing a company's prospects to change abruptly. Sometimes, like in the early 2000s, those changes work to the company's advantage; other times, they don't.However, Oshkosh's management has managed to steer it pretty ably through the ups and downs of the past five years: data by  .That said, investors considering buying Oshkosh stock need to understand the risks. Looking at the above chart, you can see that 2013 and 2016 were great years to own Oshkosh...and 2014 and 2015 were absolutely terrible. Don't consider buying Oshkosh unless you are willing to hang on for the ride.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Image source: Getty Images.Okay, let's get one thing out of the way right up front: No,  (NYSE: OSK) does not make children's overalls, by gosh. Those Oshkoshes are currently made by  . Instead, this Oshkosh (based, unsurprisingly, in Oshkosh, Wisconsin) manufactures specialty vehicles like fire trucks, garbage trucks, and cement mixers. It also has a robust defense unit that makes military equipment.Although it would be tempting to lump Oshkosh in with other truckmakers like  (NYSE: NAV) or  (NASDAQ: PCAR) , Oshkosh Corporation has unique strengths all its own.Navistar and Paccar make most of their money from selling similar vehicles: medium- and heavy-duty trucks (think 18-wheeler cabs) under Paccar's Kenworth and Peterbilt brands and Navistar's International brand. Oshkosh, on the other hand, sells a huge variety of specialty vehicles, none of which are 18-wheelers.Oshkosh's operations fall into four segments. The first, access equipment, sells tow trucks, telehandlers (think forklifts on steroids), and aerial work platforms through the company's JLG and Jerr-Dan brands. Its fire and emergency segment not only sells fire trucks but also snow removal vehicles and simulators. The commercial segment sells concrete mixers, garbage trucks, truck-mounted cranes and other vehicle components. Finally, the company's defense segment sells military vehicles to the Department of Defense -- and has for more than 90 years.This wide variety of products helps insulate the company against a slowdown in any one segment. A long spell of mild winters may result in fewer snow removal vehicle purchases...but it won't affect the need for concrete mixers or garbage trucks.It probably goes without saying that Oshkosh's clients aren't generally consumers looking to put a gift-wrapped aerial work platform under the Christmas tree. So it probably won't surprise you to learn that many of Oshkosh's clients are government entities. 15% of Oshkosh's 2015 revenue came from the U.S. federal government alone. Still other Oshkosh clients -- waste management companies, for example -- are not governments themselves but work primarily for government clients.That might seem like a weakness rather than a strength. After all, having a diverse pool of clients is important for a company. However, the percentage of revenue the company derives from the U.S. government is way down, having peaked at 72% in 2010 during the Great Recession.But it's also a strength, for one simple reason: A government can't choose to stop providing essential services to its citizens (at least, not without a substantial backlash). So, while a municipal government might decide to delay purchasing a new fire truck for a few \"lean years,\" it's never going to just stop putting out fires. Which means that eventually, that government is going to have to buy a new fire truck, making it a potential Oshkosh customer.Being a market leader or \"top dog\" in one's industry is a huge advantage to a company's success. And this particular  is quite large. According to a 2014 report by BCC research, the  for specialty vehicles is expected to grow from an estimated $67.6 billion in 2015 to $82.6 billion by 2020. Oshkosh claims to hold leading market shares in all of its businesses, but with only about $6 billion in total annual revenue, there's clearly plenty of additional market share to be tapped.Oshkosh's unique mix of vehicles means it doesn't really have a single direct competitor. Of course, its individual businesses have competitors (Navistar, for example, has a military vehicle segment that competes with Oshkosh), but no other single company competes with Oshkosh in all or even most of its business segments. In fact, the company recently benefited from competing fire truck manufacturer American LaFrance ceasing operations in 2014.Most of these markets are very fragmented, split among a few large -- often multinational -- companies and numerous smaller or regional manufacturers. This puts Oshkosh in a unique position in which it can compete against its larger peers on product quality, design expertise, and manufacturing flexibility, while also retaining volume advantages over smaller manufacturers that allow Oshkosh to utilize moving assembly lines and cross-product purchasing power.Oshkosh Corporation is a Fortune 500 company that sits in a unique niche as a manufacturer of specialty trucks. Unlike fellow truckmakers Paccar and Navistar, it derives its revenue from many different product lines and vehicle types. Better still, it operates in a massive  in which competition is heavily fragmented. These strengths, among others, have made some analysts  .The stock currently trades at a P/E of just over 20, compared to Paccar's 32, and sports a modest 1.35% dividend yield -- just lower than Paccar's 1.6%, but better than Navistar's lack of a dividend at all. For investors looking to put an equipment manufacturer into their portfolios, Oshkosh is worth digging into.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money - maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both. So when stocks turn up that see insider buying, and are also top ranked, investors are wise to take notice. One such company is PACCAR Inc. (Symbol: PCAR), which saw buying by CFO Robert J. Christensen.Back on May 6, Christensen invested $18,844.20 into 342 shares of PCAR, for a cost per share of $55.10. In trading on Wednesday, shares were changing hands as low as $57.35 per share, which is 4.1% above Christensen's purchase price. It should be noted that Christensen has collected $0.48/share in dividends since the time of their purchase, so they are currently up 5.0% on their purchase from a total return basis.

Image source: Getty Images.It looks like 2016 is proving to be a stellar year for  (NYSE: CMI) , with the stock gaining almost 40% year to date as of this writing. Surprisingly, the optimism doesn't quite match up with the engine maker's weak operational performance thus far -- or the challenges it faces. Investors appear to have turned hopeful after both Cummins' key customer,  (NASDAQ: PCAR) , and its rival,  (NYSE: CAT) , delivered better-than-expected second-quarter numbers. However, while Caterpillar lowered its full-year guidance and extended its restructuring program, PACCAR now projects lower truck sales in the U.S.Given the backdrop, investors might prepare to be disappointed when Cummins reports its second-quarter numbers on Aug. 2. While analysts expect its earnings per share to drop nearly 18% on 10% lower revenue, investors need to worry if Cummins fails to deliver in the following three key areas in Q2.Cummins' engines business derives almost 70% of its sales from the U.S. and Canada and is heavily reliant on the heavy-duty truck market. If the company starts losing grip on its key market, you have every reason to be worried.In 2015, Cummins' share in the North American heavy-duty market slipped 2 percentage points to 33%. Conditions worsened during the first quarter when Cummins' market share slumped to 29%. The company even lowered its full-year market share projections to 27%-30% from 30%-33% as key customers -- including PACCAR and  -- continue to replace Cummins' engines with their own. Needless to say, if Cummins' market share drops further in Q2, it could mean trouble ahead.Despite a challenging first quarter, Cummins maintained its operating margin above the 10% mark. Comparatively, Caterpillar reported a mid-single-digit percentage margin in both its first and second quarters.While components was Cummins' most profitable segment in Q1, a weaker North American trucking market could hit segment profits and send the company's Q2 and full-year margins lower. Cummins last projected its 2016 margins will range between 11.6% and 12.2%, despite a 5% to 9% decline in sales. It remains to be seen whether it'll be able to reiterate and meet its guidance at a time when  . Daimler expects its 2016 sales to be \"significantly\" lower than 2015, and PACCAR confirmed slower order rates in Q2.In the Q2 report, investors must also watch for updates about Cummins' restructuring plans, as any effort to rein in costs will come in handy. Watch for trends in its selling, general, and administrative expenses: In Q1, Cummins lowered SG&A by 5% year over year. If the company can reduce costs further to boost margins, that should reinstate investors' faith in management.Cummins derives nearly 40% of its sales from markets outside the U.S. and Canada, which isn't good news. On one hand, Caterpillar reported a substantial drop in sales from Latin America, Asia-Pacific, and the EAME regions in Q2. On the other, PACCAR projects industry truck sales in Brazil to slump almost 65% from peak levels this year. The real dampener could be off-highway markets, like oil and mining, both of which played a major role in sending Caterpillar's sales tumbling 16% in Q2.With nearly every end market under pressure, it'll be important for Cummins to find ways to generate steady cash flow in order to meet its commitment of returning 75% of its operating cash flow to shareholders this year. Investors needn't worry much on that front, though, as the company just raised its dividend. However, dividends may grow at a slower clip in the future if Cummins' profits and free cash flows decelerate.

Image source: PACCAR subsidiary DAF.Heavy-duty truck manufacturer  (NASDAQ: PCAR) reported financial results for its second quarter on July 26 using the same incredibly boring term to describe this quarter as it did the first quarter: \"good.\" What exactly does that even mean?Apparently, it means something like \"better than bad, but not as good as last year.\" Let's dig into the financial and operating results and see if we can get to the heart of PACCAR's results.Revenue, net income, and adjusted net income in millions.*There were no adjustments reported to Q2 2015 net income or EPS.Data source: PACCAR.If you go back to the  , you'll remember that PACCAR reported a $430 million loss after taking a huge $942.6 million one-time charge related to a major European Commission investigation into price fixing by heavy-truck manufacturers. As a result, the company reported both GAAP and adjusted earnings in order for investors to more easily review the company's operating performance without the impact of the charge to cover potential fines.Fast-forward to the second quarter, and PACCAR has settled with the EC, and for $109 million less than it had set aside in the first quarter. So we have another one-time adjustment this quarter, but with the key difference: This one is a positive adjustment, adding $109 million to profits, while last quarter's charge was a loss on the books.Again, PACCAR has given us both GAAP and adjusted net income to better evaluate operating performance without the boost of the positive adjustment.CEO Ron Armstrong talked about the relative strength of the U.S. economy driving a solid year for heavy-duty truck sales:He also pointed out that PACCAR continues to maintain 28% of market share in sales so far this year, while also making up more than 30% of total orders across the industry. Yes, sales are down, but they're down from the best year in North American truck sales in more than a decade. Europe has been especially strong for PACCAR's DAF unit. Armstrong again:The continued strong order activity following the Brexit vote is worth noting. The U.K. is PACCAR's biggest market in Europe, and it's unclear what (if any) impact the Brexit could have on DAF, which has production facilities in the U.K., Belgium, and the Netherlands.Even with slightly higher operating costs, and the overall decline in revenues after a decade-best 2015 in North America, PACCAR's financial and operating results in the second quarter were, well, good -- just as the company described it. The company also moved past the EC investigation, and though it paid a very steep $800 million-plus fine, PACCAR can now move on, and focus on capturing more market share, and driving down its manufacturing costs.Looking at the rest of 2016, Armstrong said he expects similar unit sales in North America in the third quarter, and reiterated continued strong demand in Europe following the Brexit vote. While it's unclear what the impact will be in coming years, PACCAR seems to be avoiding any short-term pains -- at least so far.PACCAR will always be subject to the cyclical ups and downs of its industry, as demand for new trucks follows bigger macroeconomic trends. But from a long-term perspective, PACCAR's history as a market-beating investment has been a result of two things:The market in North America won't be as good in 2016 as it was last year, and early estimates are that truck sales could decline again in 2017. That's not good news if you're looking for a short-term investment. For long-term investors, however, the way PACCAR management has run the business through every part of the cycle has paid off very well. Don't expect that approach to change anytime soon.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Image Source: PACCAR Inc.With orders for heavy-duty trucks in North America hitting near six-year lows in June, all eyes are on  's(NASDAQ: PCAR) second-quarter earnings report, scheduled for release on July 26. As a leading truck manufacturer, PACCAR's numbers -- particularly truck delivery and order rates -- can not only provide insight into the health of the trucking industry, but also act as a precursor for investors in engine maker  (NYSE: CMI) , which counts PACCAR among its key customers and is set to report its Q2 numbers early next month.Given the weak end-market conditions, it's safe to expect a weak quarterly report from PACCAR. Analysts project its Q2 sales and earnings per share to dip around 13% and 19%, respectively. However, investors shouldn't stop at PACCAR's sales and profit numbers, or outlook about North America, as there are several other factors that could affect the company's profits going forward. Keeping an eye on the following three updates, in particular, in the upcoming earnings report should be helpful.PACCAR's first-quarter loss took investors by surprise, but it had nothing to do with the company's fundamentals. The European Commission has been investigating leading truck makers, including PACCAR, for some years for price fixing. The judgement was not favorable and, accordingly, PACCAR recorded a charge worth $942.6 million in the first quarter for fines, which hit its profits.Fortunately, investors needn't expect a rerun in PACCAR's second quarter as the final penalty just announced by the European Commission is within the $942.6 billion that the company set aside. However, PACCAR may still have to pay damages to trucking operators, which could run into big amounts. Investors shouldn't miss any information that management may provide in PACCAR's upcoming  for the simple reason that any such payout will pressure the company's bottom line at a time when sales are already soft.Amid the sluggishness in the North American trucking markets, PACCAR is betting on Europe for growth. Its nameplate DAF achieved record market share of 16.6% in the first quarter as truck deliveries climbed 30% year over year.Unfortunately, the Brexit vote has added a great deal of uncertainty to growth in the U.K. and the European Union, and the economic relations between the two. The International Monetary Fund has already slashed its growth forecast for U.K. for 2017. That bodes ill for PACCAR as Europe is its second-largest market after the U.S., with the U.K. being DAF's primary market.Needless to say, investors should look for any warning signs in PACCAR's Q2 earnings report, especially order rates from Europe and management's viewpoint about Brexit's impact on the company. While I'm still expecting PACCAR to deliver strong numbers from Europe for Q2, it's the long-term implications that worry me, and that's the area investors should also focus on.One of the key takeaways from PACCAR's first-quarter  was the progress of its engines business. PACCAR is aggressively replacing outsourced engines -- many of which come from Cummins -- with its own. During the first quarter, nearly 46% of PACCAR's trucks ran on its own engines, compared to 42% in the fourth quarter of 2015.While management mentioned during PACCAR's Q1  that it is targeting 80%-85% penetration in the long term, investors should look for further clarity in the upcoming call, especially on whether the company is also looking to sell its engines to other truck manufacturers. That could be a big growth catalyst for PACCAR in the years to come.All said, investors should look beyond PACCAR's quarterly numbers when it reports its Q2 earnings and focus on how it plans to tackle challenges, as that'll hold the key to its growth.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Including this, net income came in at $481.3 million or $1.37 per share.Revenues declined 14% year over year to $4.12 billion but exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.06 billion.

In the last quarter, the company had delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.21%. Further, PACCAR posted positive earnings surprises in three of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 3.07%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.PACCAR is well positioned in the key non-U.S. markets due to its strategic investments. The company continues to expand its global network of strategically located parts distribution centers. These factors should positively impact second-quarter earnings.However, Class 8 industry retail sales for the U.S. and Canada are expected to be in the range of 220,000-250,000 units in 2016, lower than the prior projection of 230,000-260,000 units as well as 278,000 units sold in 2015. This indicates the possibility of a year-over-year decline in the second quarter as well, which may adversely impact the company's upcoming results.Moreover, DAF, owned by PACCAR was recently charged 752.7 million euros ($829.4 million) by the European Union regulators for illegally forming a cartel with a few other truck makers. The company will pay the charge out of the 850 million euros ($936.6 million) provision it created earlier.Our proven model does not conclusively show that PACCAR is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below: The Earnings ESP represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. PACCAR has an Earnings ESP of -0.98% because the Most Accurate estimate stands at $1.01, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.02. PACCAR currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Westport Fuel Systems Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +9.09% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

In the last quarter, the company had delivered a negative earnings surprise of 4.85%. However, PACCAR posted positive earnings surprises in 3 of the trailing 4 quarters with an average beat of 3.52%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.PACCAR has a record of generating net profit for 77 consecutive years. We expect the company's first-quarter 2016 results to maintain this trend. Further, PACCAR is well positioned in the key non-U.S. markets due to its strategic investments. The company continues to expand its global network of strategically located parts distribution centers. These factors should positively impact earnings during the quarter.However, Class 8 industry retail sales for the U.S. and Canada are expected to be in the range of 230,000-260,000 units in 2016, lower than the prior projection of 240,000-270,000 units as well as 278,000 units sold in 2015. This indicates the possibility of a year-over-year decline in the first quarter as well, which may adversely impact the company's upcoming results.Moreover, PACCAR will record a charge of 850 million euros ($950 million) in the first quarter as a provision related to the ongoing investigation by the European Commission into anticompetitive practices by all major European medium- and heavy-duty truck manufacturers. This will significantly affect the company's financials.Our proven model does not conclusively show that PACCAR is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below: The Earnings ESP represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. PACCAR has an Earnings ESP of -2.11% because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 93 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 95 cents. PACCAR's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Ford Motor Co.  has an Earnings ESP of +4.55% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is expected to report first-quarter 2016 results on Apr 28.Autoliv, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +1.33% and a Zacks Rank #3.

Familiar to Americans from its Kenworth and Peterbilt brands, it's a significant factor in Europe through its DAF subsidiary (14% market share), as well as Mexico (44%), Canada (30%), and Australia (23%). Most of its revenue, however, comes from the U.S. and Canada: 68%. Its European share, where DAF confronts powerful competitors such as Daimler, Volvo, and  /MAN, is more valuable than it sounds: European road freight is more important and more fleet-oriented than North American trucking, since European rail is primarily a passenger service, and independent owner-operators are comparatively rare.Although its shares have been volatile, until recently the market clearly appreciated PACCAR's virtues. But since July 22 it has lost 8.2% percentage points in relative performance.Data source: Yahoo! Finance.While this is not extraordinary underperformance for an industrial share in the current environment, it is strangely inappropriate: PACCAR is one of very few industrials that should be performing in line with, if not better than, the  Index. Analysts' pessimism about its outlook is misplaced, and seems to be based on drawing analogies with some of PACCAR's competitors that aren't appropriate. It isn't obvious why PACCAR's share price has suffered lately: The company's Q2 report, released July 28, was better than expected, as was its Q3 report. After a dip in late summer, U.S. truck sales resumed their previous upward trend. All of which led up to full-year results that set a record, with strong demand both in North America and Europe, which accelerated in Q4.Reports from peer  seem to have spooked investors. Cummins is a supplier of engines not only to the North American trucking industry, but internationally and to heavy-equipment manufacturers. The slowdown in China has seriously crimped sales in both, but especially the latter category. The continued inability of  to produce income in a strong truck market can't have helped PACCAR, either. MAN and Daimler Benz have reported sharp reductions in Chinese demand, which is quite important to both of them.However, PACCAR is different. It has little exposure to China (it sells to Taiwan but only purchases components from China) or to extractive industries or heavy construction (the engines it sells to third parties are not for use in off-road applications). So developments that affect Cummins and others in truck manufacturing aren't major issues for PACCAR.Nor is there any reason for investors to transfer concerns about peak passenger-car sales to the heavy-truck market. Many commentators feel that unit car and light truck sales won't increase beyond 2015 levels (although changing mix will continue to favor manufacturers) for a variety of reasons relating to used markets and financing. But heavy trucks are a very different business from cars, shaped by unrelated dynamics. PACCAR expects worldwide demand to increase 2% annually through 2019, with North America growing 1% and Europe 5%. This is a conservative outlook compared with forecasts from  and other sources. While last summer's dip in sales indicates that sales growth won't be entirely smooth, there are solid reasons for optimism about PACCAR. The fairly steady growth in heavy-truck sales over the past five years has largely made up for an earlier dearth of investment: Major acceleration in sales is not to be expected, but the increase we've seen recently represents the realization of postponed investments rather than overinvestment. PACCAR's conservative estimate will be achieved if sales continue at their normalized rate.Not least of the reasons to expect this are extraordinary levels of utilization. Trucks may be tough, but the more ton-miles driven, the more rapidly they must be replaced. Low fuel prices have encouraged utilization and have delayed any threat from intermodal transportation (which is probably exaggerated, in any case: Intermodal is certainly growing, but it's only fair to point out that it has been touted as the \"next big thing\" for 30 years).). High utilization and low fuel costs mean that times are comparatively good for owner-operators, and they should be in a financial position to replace their rigs if necessary.Heavy-truck businesses that aren't reliant on weak markets, such as Latin America, or oversaturated and weakening markets, such as China, are in an attractive position relative to others in the industry, or to capital goods producers generally. Granted, PACCAR sells in Latin America and will be affected by weakness in Brazil. But surely this isn't enough to account for the 11% decline in Yahoo! Finance's  estimate for 2016: Analysts must be expecting U.S. sales to deteriorate. I have yet to encounter strong arguments in support of this opinion. While Volvo's Mack Truck unit seems to have seen weak orders in Q4, PACCAR had precisely the opposite experience and forecasts continued growth in 2016.If PACCAR's earnings are merely flat in 2016, it's trading at 12.3 times Yahoo! Finance's  estimate, a rather attractive price for such a solidly financed asset.

At the same time, the company behind the Kenworth, Peterbilt, and DAF brands maintained strong market share and also increased its profit margins.But as PACCAR moves forward into 2016, U.S. and Canadian heavy-duty truck sales are expected to decline between 10% and 20% this year, meaning it's likely that sales and profits will slide this year. Let's take a closer look at the company's results from 2015 and what management expects for 2016.Fourth quarter results:\n  \nRevenue and net income in millions. Data source: PACCAR earnings release.As you can see above, slowing truck sales have already started affecting PACCAR, with revenue and earnings both falling by double digits in the fourth quarter. With that said, it's worth noting that the fourth quarter of 2014 was one of the best quarters ever for heavy-duty truck deliveries. In other words, it was both a slowing of sales and a very tough comp quarter.For the full year:\n  \nRevenue and net income in millions. Data source: PACCAR earnings release.The fourth-quarter slowdown didn't keep PACCAR from breaking 2014's record for revenue or its prior-best EPS of $3.97 back in 2007.A lot of people in the trucking industry are expecting heavy-duty truck sales in U.S. and Canada to decline about 20% in 2016, to what would be a still-strong 225,000-230,000 units, while PACCAR is forecasting for a higher 230,000-260,000 truck this year. Two PACCAR executives talked about why they are expecting higher sales this year.Director of Investor Relations Ken Hastings:PACCAR CEO Ron Armstrong highlighted the company's strength in the vocational segment, which is experiencing strong demand:Maintaining margins can be challenging for manufacturers when production declines as it is expected to do in 2016, but PACCAR expects to see similar margins as last year. Armstrong again, on why:On Europe's truck market on track to grow in 2016:PACCAR continues to be an industry leader and one of the most profitable truck makers in the world, but this doesn't make it immune from the cyclical effects of demand on its revenues and profits. Furthermore, while the growth in Europe will help offset some of the likely decline in North America, a strong U.S. dollar will limit the benefit there as well.Uncontrollables like forex and cyclicality aside, management continues to execute on the things it can influence, such as product development, and stringent cost management, and that continues to keep PACCAR's nameplates at the front of buyers' minds and driving market share. Over time, that's been great for long-term investors.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

In fact, some key performance metrics that the truck maker highlighted in its earnings report may have even gone unnoticed, but could play a big role in its growth going forward. For instance, Paccar currently sources the majority of the engines for its trucks from  .

Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.PACCAR has a record of generating net profit for 76 consecutive years. We expect the company's full-year and fourth-quarter 2015 results to maintain this trend. The guidance for industry sales in the above 16-ton truck market in Europe has been raised to 255,000-265,000 units for 2015 from the previous projection of 240,000-260,000 units. This is also higher than 227,000 units sold in 2014. Higher industry sales should translate into higher sales for the company as well.However, PACCAR expects heavy-duty truck demand in South America of around 70,000-80,000 units for 2015, down from 129,000 units sold in 2014. This will adversely impact the company's upcoming results.Our proven model does not conclusively show that PACCAR is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below: The Earnings ESP represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. PACCAR has an Earnings ESP of -1.92% because the Most Accurate estimate stands at $1.02, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.04. PACCAR carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Autoliv, Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +8.02% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Revenues of the Truck, Parts and Other segment as well as the Financial Services segment deteriorated in the quarter.PACCAR, the third-largest manufacturer of heavy-duty trucks in the world, is likely to be affected by the declining heavy-duty truck industry sales in South America. PACCAR expects heavy-duty truck demand in South America to range around 70,000-80,000 units in 2015, down from 129,000 units sold in 2014. Demand is expected to be around the 2015 level next year as well.Although Class 8 industry retail sales for the U.S. and Canada are anticipated to rise to 275,000-285,000 units in 2015, the figure is expected to drop to 240,000-270,000 units in 2016.Moreover, PACCAR's earnings outlook does not seem promising. Earnings per share are expected to decline 5.06% year over year in fourth-quarter 2015, while the figure is projected to fall 4.4% in the first quarter of 2016.In fact, analysts do not seem too hopeful about PACCAR's performance in 2016. Over the past month, the Bellevue, WA-based company has witnessed 7 downward revisions in its 2016 earnings estimates.

There's absolutely no news out there to point at as an explanation for Navistar's sharp sell-off today, which is happening on exceedingly high share volume that's more than triple the three-month average. There's also not anything on the newswire about competitor  that could affect Navistar's stock price today.Chances are, what we are seeing is a combination of factors. This time of year, it's not uncommon to see individual investors and large funds and money managers offload stocks that are down for the year. Not only are there tax benefits from so-called tax-loss selling, but funds often sell off their losers to make their portfolios look better.For a stock like Navistar's, which is now down more than 71% this year, it's a prime end-of-year selling candidate. Sometimes momentum can take over, too, when a little bit of selling sends a stock lower, which leads to more selling. Before you know it, a beat-down stock gets even more beaten down. I think that's the situation here. With that said, I don't think Navistar is necessarily a candidate to buy on the dip. The company is still struggling, frankly, and competitor Paccar makes for a much better investment at these prices.Paccar's stock is also down this year -- about 28% -- but its business is performing quite well, especially compared to the struggling Navistar: data by  .The heavy-truck business has rebounded strongly over the past 18 months, but Navistar has failed to benefit from that recovery, unlike Paccar, which has seen revenue and earnings increase by 23% and 61%, respectively, since the start of 2014. Over the same period, Navistar's revenue has declined 13%, and the company continues to report a net loss, though it has reduced its losses.Nonetheless, the heavy truck market is expected to remain relatively strong, with a solid U.S. economy and a healthy construction industry driving domestic results, and a steadily improving European economy lifting sales across the pond.Bottom line? Better to go with the higher-quality business in Paccar, versus the more beaten-down, still-struggling Navistar.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

After this year's big beat-down, all three are set up to be top industrial stocks for 2016. Let's take a closer look at why.Diesel engine leader Cummins is dealing with an interesting set of challenges. With more than one-third of the company's sales coming from overseas, the strong U.S. dollar is hurting its profits. Cyclical weakness in a number of major industries Cummins serves has also slowed growth.The resurgence of the North American truck market has been more than offset by cyclical downturns in a number of industries around the globe, including mining, oil and gas, and pretty much everything in China.But despite it all, Cummins has maintained a strong business, and turned in results that should be lauded. data by The company has managed to hold revenues steady -- even after currency exchange impact -- and grow earnings per share 5% in the midst of an ugly demand environment. Cummins also has an incredibly strong balance sheet, with $1.7 billion in cash, and about the same amount in low-cost long-term debt. Yet in its fear, the market threw the baby out with the bathwater this year.Income-seekers should be lining up looking to buy. After a dividend hike earlier this year, Cummins is yielding 4% at recent stock prices, and the company has a 20-year history of regular increases. Even if business does slow a bit, that dividend makes it easier to wait for the next growth cycle.Canadian National Railway has seen shipments of coal, iron, and oil fall, as commodity demand weakens and prices plummet. Gross ton miles -- a measure of \"total stuff carried -- actually fell 5% last quarter.Yet in that weakening demand environment, the railway, which operates in Canada and the U.S., has done an excellent job lowering costs and focusing on efficient operations.CN managed to increase revenue a modest 3% with price increases and growth in key segments like car shipments, and pump up earnings per share an impressive 18%. Freight per train load increased 2%, miles per car of freight increased 10%, and the decline in  that hurt shipments also cut the company's fuel costs significantly.Add it all up, and CN recorded a best-ever 53.8% operating ratio in the quarter. For context regarding how good CN is at leveraging its assets, competitor  also reached a record-best operating ratio in Q3, at 68.3%. Lower is better, and CN is simply the top railroad when it comes to efficient operations.Furthermore, CN is also setting itself up for years of steady business and growth. Most recently, the railroad has firmed its ties with multiple Gulf Coast ports, setting itself up to be a shipper of choice for companies looking to take advantage of the huge upgrades at the Panama Canal, which will significantly increase the amount of freight going to and coming from Asia via those ports for years to come. data by Canadian National also has a pretty extensive history of regular dividends and increases. But since that dividend is based on Canadian dollars, what you receive -- if you're an American investor -- will fluctuate with exchange rates, and could be subject to some additional taxes. Nonetheless, those minor concerns don't make CN any less of a strong investment for the long-term.PACCAR is a dominant player in medium- and heavy-duty truck sales in North America and Europe, with its Peterbilt, Kenworth, and DAF brands all commanding significant market shares. Every quarter this year, PACCAR has reported record sales and earnings results in what has become the best year for truck sales on both continents since before the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. Yet Mister Market has continued to sell off the PACCAR stock like there's no tomorrow.Or more accurately, like there'll be no truck sales tomorrow.In fairness, most industry estimates are that North American truck sales will slow a bit in 2016, though they may grow in Europe. Yet whether they stabilize, slow, or grow slightly, PACCAR remains the top dog, very profitable, and its stock has just gotten plain-and-simple cheap. data by It can be challenging to invest in cyclical industrial stocks -- especially if you invest on the wrong side of the demand cycle, or buy a stock that's overvalued. It can also be difficult to follow industry trends, doubly so when a company sells into multiple industries all over the world. Investors in even these three excellent companies have learned those lessons in recent years.But it's gotten to the point where the market is simply undervaluing all three, and by a pretty wide margin. If you're looking for top industrial stocks to buy for 2016, look no further than these three.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .According to a federal bankruptcy judge's ruling, people charging  (  ) for faulty ignition switches may demand punitive damages. This will cost the company a hefty charge of more than millions of dollars.Due to unfavorable economic conditions and a rapid decline in sales, the company had filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on Jun 1, 2009. Pursuant to this, the New GM was formed by acquiring most of the assets and assuming certain liabilities of the Old GM, and some of its direct and indirect subsidiaries. The new company is not responsible for the liabilities of the old one.However, the federal bankruptcy judge pointed out that there was a transfer of employees and knowledge between the companies. Moreover, General Motor was aware about the faulty ignition switches for more than a decade but announced the recall in Feb 2014. Thus, the plaintiffs can demand punitive damages if they can justify that the New General Motors was aware about the faulty ignition switches.In addition, Texas attorney Robert Hilliard stated that the New General Motors had admitted knowing about the ignition switch issue around 20 months before informing the federal safety regulators in Feb 2014, in an agreement to settle criminal charges with the Justice Department. Thus, the automaker will not be able to contradict the agreement legally.Given the situation, Hilliard said that the judgment was a clear victory for the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs can also claim compensation for the decrease in the value of their vehicles as a result of these faulty ignition switches.General Motors has been facing the heat for delaying the recall of 2.6 million vehicles with defective ignition switches, which can lead to shutting down of the engine and preventing deployment of front airbags in the event of a crash. The company issued a recall in Feb 2014, although the problem was identified back in 2001. Lawfully, automakers are supposed to alert The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration about any safety concern in vehicles within five business days of recognizing the problem. However, General Motors failed to do so.

Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 5.33%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.CarMax pursues an aggressive store growth policy, driven by improvements in the sales environment in the U.S. New stores help the company penetrate into new markets, thereby boosting sales.In addition, CarMax places greater emphasis on the used-car market, which helps it to outperform other players in the industry. The company is among the strongest operators in its peer group. Also, CarMax's car-buying appraisal strategy is commendable as this enables it to offer a wide inventory of models, reflecting the taste of each market. All these factors are likely to drive the company's third-quarter fiscal 2016 results.However, CarMax is under considerable pressure as the used-car market in the U.S. is highly fragmented and competitive, with the used-car inventory witnessing an increase.Our proven model does not conclusively show that CarMax is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below: CarMax has an Earnings ESP of -1.47%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 67 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 68 cents. CarMax's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:AB Volvo  has an Earnings ESP of +5.26% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is expected to release fourth-quarter 2015 earnings results on Feb 4, 2016.PACCAR Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +0.94% and a Zacks Rank #3.

But after falling about 9% to start the week following last Friday's announcement that the company would cut 190 jobs from its Con-Way acquisition, shares are up almost 15% since the 2nd. Shares of XPO have largely traded down over the past year, as XPO has shifted from an asset-light business that relied on third-party contractors, to acquisition-driving growth of its in-house shipping and trucking operations. The recent Con-Way job cuts are part of a planned cost reduction, as the company integrates that business with other in-house operations and acquisitions. The XPO release described the jobs it was cutting as mostly back-office, administrative, and management -- largely redundant to what the company had in place before the acquisition and not simply cuts for the sake of cutting cost alone. The move up in the past couple of trading days does correspond to  releasing its fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 2. UPS reported its highest-ever fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.57, up 26% from the prior year and full-year 2015 EPS up 14% to $5.43, also the company's best-ever for a full year.XPO says it's not trying to be a UPS or  , and instead is focused on more logistics and trucking operations, and  's earnings release last week supports that there is still strong demand for trucking in both North America and Europe.PACCAR reported declines in truck units and revenue in North America in the fourth quarter, but just finished up its most profitable year, with $19.12 billion in sales driving $1.6 billion in net income. The company said that 278,000 class-8 heavy-duty trucks were sold in U.S. and Canada in 2015, the most in a decade, and that 269,000 of the corresponding class of trucks were sold in Europe, the most there since 2008.And while truck sales are expected to decline in 2016 in North America, it is still likely to be one of the best years in the past 10, and there remains strong demand for trucking. On the PACCAR , Director of Investor Relations Ken Hastings said that freight tonnage levels in North America are at some of the highest levels and are estimated to grow 2%-3% in 2016. CEO Ron Armstrong said that European economic growth in 2016 is expected to be around 1.7%, which would support continued demand for shipping and trucking services.These things may not be the direct cause of today's stock pop, but they are good for XPO Logistics' prospects heading into 2016 and beyond.

That put shares of PACCAR down 25% since the beginning of the year:  data by  .The year 2015 is shaping up to be one of the best that the company has ever had, but the decline in revenue from last year's quarter has the market spooked. What gives? In short, there's a disconnect between the company's results so far this year and a stock market that's become convinced that heavy-duty truck sales are set to dry up after recovering strongly.Let's take a closer look at PACCAR's results. The stock has been beat up this year, but the business is performing exceptionally well.\n  \nThe decline in revenue, along with murmurs throughout the industry that heavy-duty truck sales are set to decline in North America, have spooked investors. Diesel engine manufacturer  also reported earnings on October 27, and reported that sales of engines for heavy trucks declined 9% in the third quarter. PACCAR makes a lot of its own engines, but Cummins is a major supplier of engines to the company.Cummins also announced that it would be making some restructuring moves, starting with the elimination of 2,000 U.S. white-collar jobs. Like PACCAR, Cummins stock has been punished this year, down more than 23% as of this writing. And while PACCAR doesn't have the exposure to mining and Asia that Cummins does, both are major industrials, with big exposure to cyclical factors outside of company control.ACT Research, a leading reporter of automotive and trucking data, reported that North American Class 8 truck orders in September came in at 19,400. This was less than the 20,200 orders reported in August, which is typically one of the lowest months of the year. The bottom line is that, after a huge bounce-back period that really began about this time last year, truck orders appear to be cooling off.While there is some uncertainty about the near term, PACCAR had a solid third quarter.CEO Ron Armstrong addressed the big concern: The outlook for heavy-duty trucks looking forward. Some estimates are that class 8 truck sales will fall as much as 20% in 2016 -- but Armstrong disagrees, based on the fundamentals of the economy:PACCAR's own estimates for U.S./Canada class 8 truck sales next year is between 240,000 and 270,000, which -- depending on where 2015 final numbers come in -- works out to between a roughly 6% and 15% decline from this year's results.On the other side of the pond, PACCAR is expecting heavy-truck sales to increase 5%-10% in 2016. Armstrong again:A concern with businesses like PACCAR, which operate in cyclical industries, is that the company's exceptional margins are going to get compressed if sales do fall next year. Armstrong responded to an analyst question about this, saying that margins could \"track volume a little bit,\" but would be \"flattish\" compared to 2015 margins.Despite a fantastic year, Mister Market has been anticipating a slowdown in truck sales pretty much all year, keeping shareholders from benefiting from an excellent year of sales and operations.A company like PACCAR really proves its chops when sales are down. Most companies can make money when things are good. The great companies show their stuff when things aren't perfect. If the early forecasts pan out, and truck sales fall measurably in North America, PACCAR's management will have a chance to prove their worth.Overall, the business improvements and efficiency gains -- you can see their impact on profits and margins -- during the past few years more than likely indicate that PACCAR is well positioned for a minor slowing of truck sales.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

But after a strong run that saw the company's stock outperform the  in 2014, concerns about a slowing economy -- and the potential impact on truck sales -- has led to poor returns this year. Year to date, PACCAR's stock is down nearly 20%: data by  .With earnings set for release on Oct. 27, what should we expect? Let's take a closer look.While PACCAR's stock has sold off in 2015, the company's business results have been pretty stellar. Over the past year-plus, heavy-duty truck sales -- a major source of business for PACCAR's Peterbilt and Kenworth brands in the U.S. and DAF in Europe and parts of South America -- have finally rebounded, leading PACCAR to report its second most profitable year ever and its best since the financial crisis. The first half of 2015 has been even better, with revenue and profits in the second quarter at the highest ever for that period.However, market fears of an economic slowdown, as well as the impact of cheaper fuel costs potentially leading to some fleet operators delaying investments in newer, more fuel-efficient trucks, has affected the stock over the past several months.Recent earnings releases from competitors  (ADR) and  have also raised short-term concerns as well.Volvo Group -- which makes Volvo and Mack medium- and heavy-duty vehicles -- reported a 3% increase in truck deliveries in its third quarter. Sales were weak in South America, but increased by 13% in Europe and 10% in North America. That's the good news. Volvo reported a 15% decline in orders for new trucks and a more than one-third decrease in order for construction equipment. Looking specifically at U.S. factory orders, Volvo reported a 50% decline in its Mack brand and 30% fewer orders for Volvo trucks in North America in the quarter.This probably sounds a lot worse than it really is, as Volvo management said much of the reduced factory order activity was a result of dealer focus on reducing inventory, saying that retail activity was still relatively strong. After all, U.S. freight activity has remained relatively high on strong automotive business and a residential construction market that has steadily improved over the past couple of years.Navistar reported earnings back in early September, and management said that class 8 truck sales only increased about 3% in the third quarter, a disappointment for the company, especially in a strong market. However, Navistar's problems are more likely tied to its efforts to rebuild its image and reattract customers after years of below-average reliability with some of its core products.PACCAR is well on track to having its best year ever in terms of profits, but the market has been fearful that an economic slowdown will stop the music and end the party early. And while that's quite possible, there's more to consider.Yes, PACCAR operates in a highly cyclical industry: data by  .As you can see, industrial production of heavy trucks tends to peak before economic recession (gray columns), and then rebound sharply after. The cycle repeats as truck fleet operators halt spending in bad economies -- corresponding to reduced demand for the transportation of goods -- before ramping up spending to both meet increased demand and to replace older equipment when things improve. The table above also shows us that the current rebound is still below the two prior cyclical peaks.That's not to say that sales  to go higher before they eventually do fall, but it's a reminder that the U.S. economy (a major source of PACCAR's business) is larger now than it was before either of the most recent economic downturns, and truck sales are still below 2007 levels. So there is likely still pent-up demand for new and replacement trucks, but that's not a promise that PACCAR's sales and profits are going to keep improving, if the current uncertainty about the economy turns into a reality.The bigger point? PACCAR operates in a cyclical business, but management has proven very capable at capital allocation, cost containment, and building a strong business in both peaks and declines of the industry cycle. Case in point: Class 8 truck sales have rebounded sharply, but are still well below 2007 levels, yet PACCAR is on pace to have its most profitable year ever: data by  .The key reasons? Management has done an admirable job of getting costs down, which has led to strong growth in margins, cash flows, and operating income, but just as much emphasis has been placed on building reliable, fuel-efficient, and cost-competitive products. These steps won't make PACCAR immune to the next inevitable industry downturn, but they will certainly make it easier for management to navigate it.PACCAR is likely to report strong revenue and profits on the 27th, but like its competitors, it may have some disappointing news about new orders. But looking at the big picture, the company remains one of the strongest in its industry, with a solid management team navigating the ups and downs.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Standing at the end of September, tremors of the sell-off are still perceptible. The major U.S. indexes - S&P 500, NASDAQ Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average - are currently yielding negative year-to-date returns in the range of 4-10%.The equity markets have become extremely volatile. The primary reasons are continuous downward pressure on  and slowing Chinese economy, along with weaknesses in several economies such as Europe, Russia, Japan and Brazil. The Federal Reserve's \"no rate hike\" decision over similar concerns as well as low inflation in the U.S. has added fuel to the fire.While the domestic economy is showing signs of growth, global concerns are making investors jittery. Also, concerns pertaining to divergent monetary policies across major economies have made matters worse.Amid all these, investors are becoming increasingly skeptical about entering the market. Nevertheless, with extreme volatility leading to substantial valuation correction in several stocks, you have chances to turn the tide in your favor. But one should be careful and not get caught into a 'value trap.' When investors put their money in a stock simply because the company is trading at an artificial discount, they usually end up as a victim of the value trap.In order to avoid falling into a value trap, you must select stocks with strong fundamentals. With several large cap stocks currently yielding negative year-to-date returns, this is a good time to bet on stocks that hold solid growth potential.With the help of our  , we have shortlisted 5 large cap stocks (market cap more than $5 billion) trading at year-to-date negative return of more than 20% and carrying a Value Style Score of 'A' or 'B,' with projected long-term growth rate of 8% or higher. Further, all these stocks sport a favorable Zacks Rank.Our  helps locate stocks that have a solid upside potential. Our Value Style Score condenses all valuation metrics into one actionable score that helps investors steer clear of 'value traps' and identify stocks that are truly trading at a discount.

Also, the company estimates its 2015 EBIT margin in the 13.5%-14% range, higher than 13.2% recorded in 2014. These raise expectations of higher revenues and margins in the third quarter of 2015 as well. Cummins has the potential to benefit from increased use of its engines by a number of original equipment manufacturers.However, the company anticipates revenues from the Power Generation segment to be flat to down 4% in 2015.

Cummins is witnessing a challenging situation in Brazil, where truck production is expected to decline.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cummins is likely to beat earnings this quarter.

Management is also focusing on improving operations with its Lean initiative that focuses on shorter lead times and faster product turn time, which will drive increased profitability. Polaris' revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the past five years has been higher than 20% and if management continues to design quality products and enter new markets overseas, the company should be well poised to reward investors over time.: Few American investors have heard of Japan's  . Fuji Heavy is the corporate descendant of a company that once made aircraft for Japan's military. Fuji Heavy still makes some aircraft and helicopter parts for military use. But nowdays, most of its income comes from a subsidiary that you  heard of: Subaru.By global automaker standards, Subaru is pretty small. It's not even in the top fifteen automakers by sales. Mighty  (which owns a stake in Fuji Heavy, by the way) out-sold it by more than 10 to 1 last year. It has just three assembly plants -- two in Japan and one in the United States.

The company has what is probably the  in the industry -- and an operating profit margin  '.

With a slate of businesses that include power generation, emissions-related components, and an extensive distribution network to get needed parts and components to customers as efficiently as possible, Cummins has built itself a strong reputation for quality. Yet the company remains exposed to cyclical movements in the industry economy, and Cummins has struggled to find traction as demand from key customer markets has fallen. Cummins is slated to release its third-quarter financial report on Tuesday, and investors would like to see signs that despite its falling share price, the company can survive the current cyclical downturn and thrive in the long run. Let's look more closely at how Cummins is likely to fare and what's ahead for the engine maker going forward.\n  \nSource: Yahoo! Finance. In recent months, investors have remained nervous about Cummins earnings prospects, especially over the long run. Although the decline in projections for the third quarter have fallen by only about 1%, a 6% cut to full-year 2016 expectations reflects the ongoing uncertainty about how quickly the industrial economy can turn around. The stock has mirrored that nervousness, with shares falling 11% since late July.Cummins' second-quarter results revealed how different parts of the engine-maker's business are seeing widely disparate industry conditions. Overall, Cummins' revenue rose 4%, with the North American business leading the way with double-digit percentage sales growth. Yet internationally, Cummins has run into substantial problems, with sales falling due in large part to weakness in Brazil. Component sales have been the star among Cummins' segments, but the vital engine segment only saw a 2% rise in revenue, again with poor global demand holding the company back from bigger gains in its home North American market.Still,  in just about every part of its business. Some analysts believe that the heavy-duty trucking segment could be peaking in North America, and that could remove what has been a key source of support for Cummins. Poor conditions in the agricultural and mining industries have cut demand for products for off-highway use. Moreover, several current customers have sought to bring engine production in-house, with  being just one example of the trend toward vertical integration. PACCAR is planning to bring one of its key engine products to North America within its Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks, and in turn, it will make an existing award-winning engine more broadly available worldwide. If major customers take their business away from Cummins, it will make it even more important for the company to stay on the cutting edge with innovative new products that customers simply can't replicate on their own.One area where Cummins continues to remain strong is in natural-gas engine technology. The companies Cummins Westport joint venture announced in early October that it would offer a version of its ISL G natural gas engine that has nearly no emissions of nitrogen oxide gases, which are a key pollutant that contributes to poor air quality in urban areas. Even though plunging  have removed some of the immediate benefits of having engine customers shift toward natural-gas-burning engines, Cummins nevertheless has made itself a leader in alternative-fuel technology, and that could serve the company well if oil prices start to spike upward again even as plentiful natural gas remains available.In the Cummins earnings report, investors need to see signs that corporate managers are on top of the increasingly troubling situation in some of the company's key markets and have a strategy to avoid major disruptions going forward. Without a plan in place, it could be hard for shareholders to have the confidence they need in order to bring the stock's long decline to a halt.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

However, the deal is subject to fulfillment of certain terms by Pure Energy Minerals, including those related to timing and quality. Moreover, Pure Energy Minerals will conduct a preliminary economic assessment to gauge the viability of the mining operation.Subject to the fulfillment of these terms, Tesla or its authorized purchasers will buy a specified amount of lithium hydroxide from Pure Energy Minerals over a five-year period. Also, Tesla will purchase the lithium hydroxide at a set price, which is below the current market rate.Tesla will use the lithium hydroxide to produce lithium-ion battery cells in its Gigafactory. It is worth noting that the Nevada Lithium Brine Project is located only 3.5 hours away from the Gigafactory site. Moreover, the agreement is not exclusive, which means that Tesla can purchase lithium hydroxide from other suppliers as well.The deal is very similar to a long-term agreement the electric carmaker signed last month with Bacanora Minerals and Rare Earth Minerals for purchasing lithium hydroxide from their Sonora lithium project mine in Northern Mexico, subject to certain conditions. The lithium hydroxide supplied from the mine will also be used for the manufacture of lithium-ion batteries in Tesla's Gigafactory.The conditions for the agreement include supplying the quantity of lithium required by Tesla at the speed it needs. The automaker has set certain performance milestones that the mine should achieve over the next two years. On attainment of these milestones, the deal will be effective for five years from the date of the first order, with the option to extend it for another five years.Another requirement is that Bacanora Minerals and Rare Earth Minerals will raise capital for the project, as well as build the mine and a lithium processing facility. It is expected that the companies will be able to extract 35,000 tons of lithium compounds from the mine, with the potential to increase the quantity to 50,000 tons.The demand for lithium will go up significantly once the construction of Tesla's Gigafactory is completed. By 2020, the automaker expects the annual lithium-ion battery production of the Gigafactory to exceed the global production in 2013. The factory will produce enough battery packs to allow Tesla to build around 500,000 electric cars by 2020. Thus, it is expected that Tesla will ink more lithium supply deals by the time the Gigafactory becomes operational. (Read:  )Tesla currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

But since January, PACCAR shares are down almost 16%, and it's looking more and more like one of the few bargains to be found. Let's talk about why.Heavy-truck sales tend to go through cycles lasting years at a time, like many other industrial and durable goods. This is because they can last a decade or more before needing to be replaced, and because of the expense and long-lived nature of these assets, operators tend to go through very long and deliberate cycles of use and replacement.And it tends to correlate heavily with larger economic patterns; after all, these vehicles exist, essentially, only to convey the goods that drive the economy. Whether it's a truck taking a load of goods to a grocery store, hauling cars to a dealership, or taking an intermodal container from a port to a train depot, these trucks are moving the goods that drive the economy.So, when the economy isn't growing, truckers don't replace or expand their fleets, and often will delay things as long as possible, waiting for business to improve, before investing in new gear. Conversely, this can create significant pent-up demand when things do recover, and frankly, that's where we are today, especially in North America. And that bodes very well for PACCAR.Coming into 2014, North American class 8 truck sales were around 200,000 annually for the prior several years, significantly below the 250,000 that is generally regarded as indicative of a healthy heavy-truck market. Sales really began ramping up at the end of last year, and most estimates put 2014 sales well over 250,000, and orders over the past 12 months closer to 300,000.PACCAR commands strong market share in North America with its Peterbilt and Kenworth nameplates, with a combined 28% of the U.S. and Canadian markets. In Europe, the company's DAF Trucks holds about 15% market share. In short, PACCAR will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of this rebound.The company reported record earnings in the second quarter, with earnings per share of $1.26, a 40% increase from the year-ago quarter. Since then -- July 28 -- PACCAR's stock is down almost 11%.The thing is, it's not like investors should be \"calling a top\" here, either. After all, PACCAR -- and most of the rest of the industry -- is predicting full-year sales in both North America and Europe to outpace last year's totals. Europe is expected to see 240,000-260,000 heavy-duty trucks sold in 2015, while North American truck sales could top 290,000 on strong demand.There's a two-fold reason why PACCAR is a great buy today. First, the company's business prospects are incredibly strong. Not only is there several years' worth of pent-up demand for replacement vehicles, but shipping volume -- especially in North America -- is up. PACCAR CEO Ron Armstrong noted on the last  that U.S. freight tonnage is at record levels, being driven by strong auto sales, and a 10% increase in housing starts versus last year.Armstrong also noted that freight mileage is up in Germany over the past year and that the U.K.'s economy is expected to grow more than 2% this year. These two are notable because Germany is Europe's strongest economy and a major manufacturing hub, and the U.K. is PACCAR's largest market in Europe.Additionally, the sell-off over the past nine months has put PACCAR shares on sale: data by  .Here's a more short-term look, to highlight the message: data by  .What does it tell us when a company's stock price falls sharply, but valuation metrics like price to earnings and enterprise value to EBITDA fall even more?In short, it tells us that a company's earnings power hasn't declined over that period and that it might have actually increased. That's actually the case for PACCAR, having reported record earnings in recent quarters, while the market sold off its stock, pushing the price down.While sometimes this is the \"correction\" of a stock that got ahead of itself and is now falling back to a more rational value, in this case it looks a lot like a market that's created a great opportunity to buy.With a trailing price to earnings multiple of below 13, PACCAR is definitely in bargain territory, especially if truck sales hold up -- and grow -- over the next few years, which looks likely. Mix in a 3.3% dividend yield that's likely to grow in coming years and PACCAR looks even more enticing.Here's the caveat: The company is exposed to a cyclical industry. So, while it looks to be on an upswing -- and I'm relatively convinced that's going to be the case for the next several years -- it's a stock that will go through cyclical ups and downs. But with solid management, strong market share, and a loyal customer base, PACCAR -- at these valuations -- should make for a solid long-term investment.The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something at its recent event, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The limited number of charging stations and low range of most electric cars are the main reasons for this anxiety.In Mar 2015, Tesla announced a new software update that added two applications to the Model S to end the range anxiety of owners. The Range Assurance application communicates with Tesla's Superchargers and destination chargers, and warns a Model S driver before the car drives out of one's range. The navigation system also displays a map of the suitable charging locations and guides the car to the nearest one. The Trip Planner application figures out the best route to a destination, based on the charging stations along the way.Tesla currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Through this, the automaker plans to reduce the risks associated with the faulty Takata-made air bags.This deal will help Toyota's production capacity as the automaker will be purchasing almost 13 million inflators from Nippon Kayaku till 2020. Nippon Kayaku is a century-old company that produces chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Toyota was forced to undertake this strategy due to the biggest automotive recall, covering 10 automakers and tens of millions of vehicles since 2008.So far, automakers have faced considerable problems owing to the defective Takata air bags which may explode, shooting metal fragments, in case of a crash. Long-term exposure to heat and high humidity might result in a sudden and forceful deployment of the air bags. The vehicles recalled are at least five years old. Frequent product recalls dampen consumer confidence and also add to expenses. There have been reports of 8 fatal accidents and 100 cases of injuries caused by the air bag problem.U.S. authorities have ordered an immediate recall of all the vehicles equipped with Takata air bags. It is estimated that about 50 million vehicles are presently equipped with these air bags.Toyota did not reveal the deal value but it is being estimated that the average price of an inflator will be around $100-$150 million. To date, Toyota has recalled over 12 million vehicles with the airbag defect.The company will start with replacing the old inflators, which are more prone to damage. Meanwhile, Toyota will continue its business relations with Takata.Toyota currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Other favorably-ranked automobile stocks include Ford Motor Co.  , PACCAR Inc.  and Harley-Davidson, Inc.  .

Fisker Automotive used to produce the luxury plug-in electric hybrid Karma, which sold nearly 2,500 units despite a steep price of $100,000. However, the vehicle had some issues in the battery, which resulted in a recall, leading to the company's bankruptcy.Thereafter, Fisker Automotive was acquired by China's largest auto parts company, Wanxiang Group, for $149 million. The latter also acquired battery-maker A123, which was a supplier to Fisker Automotive, for $257 million.Fisker Automotive has now signed an 11-year, $30 million lease for a large factory in Moreno Valley that will be used to produce plug-in electric hybrid vehicles. The company hopes to bring the vehicles to the market by mid-2016.Fisker Automotive has several similarities with Tesla. Apart from being the producers of popular but niche luxury alternative-fuel vehicles, both companies aim to produce an affordable, mass-market electric vehicle. Tesla is developing the highly-anticipated Model 3, while Fisker Automotive was close to launching a lower-priced luxury hybrid when it went bankrupt.Fisker Automotive has the advantage of entering a matured electric vehicle market, while Tesla had to create a market for its vehicles and even build a network of charging stations to attract buyers. However, the electric car market has not grown as rapidly as expected. People are still apprehensive about the range offered by such cars, while the absence of a global network of charging stations limits the market expansion of electric carmakers. The fall in gas prices has made matters worse.Despite these negatives, Tesla has created a loyal customer base through its focus on providing the best products and service as well as improving already sold vehicles via free software updates. The company's sales volume has been growing every quarter and is expected to rise further with the launch of the Model X later this quarter.Fisker Automotive, on the other hand, will have to start from scratch and face the daunting task of trying to attract customers in the niche luxury alternative-fuel vehicle market in which Tesla is now a heavyweight.Tesla currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

However, the loss was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.39.The company's second-quarter 2015 adjusted results exclude the impact of non-cash interest expenses related to convertible notes and other borrowings of 14 cents per share, and deferred gross profit of 49 cents for Tesla's Model S cars due to lease accounting. On the other hand, Tesla's second-quarter 2014 adjusted results had excluded the impact of non-cash interest expenses related to convertible notes and other borrowings of 17 cents per share and deferred gross profit of 13 cents for its Model S cars due to lease accounting. Including these items, the company reported net loss of $1.45 per share in the second quarter of 2015, compared with net loss of 44 cents per share in the second quarter of 2014.Adjusted revenues improved a strong 40% to $1.2 billion in the reported quarter and steered past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.16 billion. On a reported basis, revenues increased 24.1% to $955 million.Tesla delivered 11,532 cars in the reported quarter, almost in line with the expectation of 11,507 deliveries. Meanwhile, Tesla manufactured 12,807 vehicles in the quarter, 46% higher year over year and also above the projected production of 12,500 vehicles.Revenues (on a reported basis) from Automotive sales jumped to $878.1 million in the quarter from $727.8 million a year ago. Revenues benefited from improved vehicle deliveries, partially offset by a decrease in vehicle prices. Revenues on an adjusted basis were $1.12 billion in the reported quarter. In the second quarter of 2015, the electric automaker directly leased 631 cars worth $63 million. The company partnered with more banks thus reducing the percentage of vehicles directly leased by Tesla.Revenues (on a reported basis) from the Services and other segment increased 85% to $77 million from $41.5 million in the year-ago quarter.Tesla's second-quarter 2015 adjusted gross margin was 23.4%. Also, the second-quarter automotive gross margin (excluding ZEV credits) was 23.9%. Quarterly gross margin was marred by higher manufacturing and part costs related to the ramp of the small drive unit line and the deferral of revenue recognition. Second-quarter Services and other segment's gross margin were pegged at 2.2%. Gross margin benefited from efficient production and improved margins from services and merchandise sales.Tesla had cash and cash equivalents of $1.15 billion as of Jun 30, 2015, compared with $1.91 billion as of Dec 31, 2014. Long-term debt totaled $2.6 billion as of Jun 30, 2015, versus $2.4 billion as of Dec 31, 2014.Cash outflow from operating activities amounted to $291.3 million in the first half of 2015, compared with cash inflow of $57.1 million in the year-ago period. Capital expenditures increased to $831.2 million from $317.1 million in the first half of 2014.Tesla will launch the Model X in Sep 2015.Tesla is optimistic about growth opportunities in 2015. Production volume for the third quarter of 2015 is expected to cross 12,000 vehicles, highlighting a 60% increase year over year. In the third quarter, the company expects to deliver same number of vehicles as in second quarter. Tesla also expects to directly lease the same number of vehicles as it has leased out in the second quarter. The company also plans to sell about $45 million of its regulatory credits in the third quarter, including about $30 million of ZEV credits.However, revenues in the third quarter will be affected by a decline in average transaction price due to the strengthening of the dollar against other currencies and shifts in delivery mix. The company will focus on reducing the production costs in order to compensate for the low selling price. Thus, automotive gross margin (excluding ZEV credits) is expected to be lower than second quarter owing to low selling prices.On Apr 30, 2015, the automaker launched a $250/kWh industrial Powerpack and a $350/kWh residential Powerwall. Tesla will start high volume production of these products by the third quarter of 2015 at its Fremont factory. With this, Services and other segment revenues will likely increase in the third quarter of 2015 and gross margin from the segment will be in line with the Q2 level. The company will also expand its Energy battery module and pack production at the Gigafactory in the first quarter of 2016.For full-year 2015, Tesla expects to deliver about 50,000-55,000 Model S and Model X globally. The company is continuing with its final testing of Model X. As Model S and Model X are produced in the same assembly line, the challenges faced in producing Model X will hamper Model S' production.In the third quarter, operating expenses are expected to increase 5%-10% sequentially. For 2015, operating expenses are anticipated to rise 45%-50% compared with the 2014 level. The expense hike will likely arise from increased investments in product development, including Model 3 and sales capability expansion. The company expects capital expenditures of $1.5 billion in 2015 for the expansion of production capacity, Model X tooling purchase, the building of the Gigafactory and expansion of stores, service centers and the Supercharger network.Currently, Tesla carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The company expects capital expenditures of $1.5 billion in 2015 for the expansion of production capacity, Model X tooling purchase, the Gigafactory construction and expansion of stores, service centers and the Supercharger network.To make matters worse, Tesla has been incurring significant losses, chiefly due to high expenses. The company reported adjusted loss (excluding one-time items other than stock-based compensation expense) of 82 cents per share in the second quarter of 2015, much wider than adjusted loss of 14 cents in the year-ago quarter. Per a recent article by Reuters, Tesla is losing over $4,000 for every Model S sold.As a result, the company's cash balance is dwindling. Tesla had cash and cash equivalents of $1.15 billion as of Jun 30, 2015, compared with $1.91 billion as of Dec 31, 2014. Moreover, cash outflow from operating activities amounted to $291.3 million in the first half of 2015, compared with cash inflow of $57.1 million in the comparable year-ago period. Further, the company may not generate positive cash flows till first-quarter 2016, per CFO Deepak Ahuja.The aforementioned factors raise questions regarding Tesla's plans to finance its expenses. While we know that the company has a senior secured asset-based revolving credit agreement, will that in combination with the available cash balance be enough to fund Tesla's planned capital expenditures while maintaining a reasonable level of liquidity?Tesla and its Dutch subsidiary, Tesla Motors Netherlands B.V., entered into a five-year senior secured asset-based revolving credit agreement in Jun 2015. Per the agreement, Tesla can withdraw up to $500 million to meet its working capital and general corporate needs. The amount can be extended to $750 million if the company meets certain conditions. Tesla has already drawn $50 million on the credit line.While Ahuja claimed that Tesla is \"comfortable with the cash levels,\" CEO Elon Musk did not deny the possibility of a capital raise during the company's second-quarter . Musk said that a capital raise would be beneficial from a risk-reduction perspective.There is certainly a precedent for it. Tesla had raised $222.1 million in capital through a public offering in Oct 2012 for general corporate purposes.

The company posted adjusted earnings of 28 cents per share that increased 55.6% from 18 cents recorded in the comparable quarter of 2014. Earnings also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 15 cents.Net income on reported basis stood at $6.5 million or 24 cents per share compared with $5 million or 18 cents in the year-ago quarter.Superior Industries' second-quarter results were affected by lower costs due to the closure of the Rogers, AR manufacturing facility and reallocation of production to other plants like the newest facility in Mexico. Meanwhile, earnings benefited from the cost efficiency at the other manufacturing facilities of the company.Revenues for the quarter decreased 7.6% year over year to $183.9 million and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $186 million. The decline resulted from lower volume, partially offset by higher aluminum prices. Unit shipments decreased to 2.7 million from 3 million units recorded in the prior-year quarter.Gross profit increased 26.6% to $19.9 million (10.8% of sales) from $15.7 million (7.9% of sales) in the prior-year quarter. The increase can be attributed to improved operating costs and savings from the closure of the manufacturing facility and reallocation of production to other cost-efficient plants of the company. However, this was partially offset by lower unit volume.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $8.9 million (4.8% of sales) in the quarter from $7.3 million (3.7% of sales) in the prior-year quarter. The increase was due to higher legal and general consulting fees related to the current year proxy contest and higher employee termination costs.Operating income was $11 million (6% of sales) compared with $8.4 million (4.2% of sales) a year ago.During the second quarter of 2015, Superior Industries completed the repurchase of 285,966 shares for $5.5 million. From Jan 1 through Aug 3, the company bought back 557,643 shares for $10.4 million, under its previously announced repurchase program worth $30 million, announced in Oct 2014.In the reported quarter, Superior Industries announced a quarterly dividend payment of 18 cents per share.For the six months ended Jun 28, 2015, Superior Industries' cash flow from operations was $25.2 million compared with $1.5 million in the first half of 2014. The increase in cash flow was driven by favorable changes in accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable.In 2015, Superior Industries expects net sales in the range of $725-$800 million. Value-added sales, which are the net sales less the value of aluminum that is passed through to customers, will likely be in the range of $325 million to $360 million. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margins are expected to increase by 100-200 basis points over 2014. Adjusted EBITDA margin, as a percentage of value-added, is anticipated to increase 350 to 500 basis points year over year.

The year-over-year decline was due to unfavorable currency impacts, partially offset by increase in volume in Asia and North America.Excluding the impact of currency exchange and commodity movements, revenues increased 4% year over year.

The increase was driven by favorable foreign currency translation effects. Unit sales in the segment went down 1.2% to 1.56 million.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:As concerns over a sharp rate hike fade, housing stocks like  are coming back into focus. Companies like DHI stand to benefit from the continuation of low mortgage rates, while a stronger economy is making homeownership a reality for more people as well.These positive trends can be seen in DHI's recent earnings report as homebuilding revenues for the company moved higher by 37% year-over-year, while net orders rose 22% as well. If that wasn't enough, the backlog appears to be quite nice for DR Horton, including a 12% increase, suggesting that there is plenty of pent up demand for housing right now.This strong demand trend is making for an impressive earnings outlook for DHI as current quarter EPS is expected to grow over 30% (year-over-year) while the full year looks to grow earnings over 25%. But before you get concerned over these lofty growth expectations, consider that DHI has posted three straight beats, and the company has averaged a 6.5% earnings beat in the past four quarters.For these reasons, we currently have DHI as a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and are looking for more growth out of the company in the near future. The stock has already crushed the S&P 500 so far in 2015 and we are looking for a similar trend to close out this volatile year too.We actually also have a 'B' grade for DHI on its growth metrics making it of particular interest to investors looking for this type of stock. This is due to ROE that is better than the industry, current cash flow that beats out its peers, and then projected sales growth that is nearly double the industry average too. :Railroad operators like  have been operating in a difficult environment for quite some time now. Commodity prices have been weak, while concerns over a strong dollar have also dulled foreign demand.We saw just this trend in KSU's recent earnings report as the company met estimates, but struggled to match up to revenue expectations thanks in large part to their commodity business. In fact,  investors saw energy revenues crash 46% year-over-year, while agricultural and minerals were down about 9% (yoy) too. Shares of KSU are down about 10% in the past six months thanks to this bearish trend, but there could actually be more pain ahead for KSU in the near future.This poor stretch could definitely have some more room if you look to recent earnings estimates for KSU. The trends for both the current quarter and the current year have been decidedly lower and are pushing current consensus estimates into EPS contraction territory when looking at year-over-year figures.The magnitude of these estimate changes has also been pretty intense as the current quarter figures have fallen from $1.33/share to $1.21/share in the past month, while we have seen a slide from $4.74/share to $4.48/share for the current year over the same time frame.With this kind of pressure on earnings estimates, it shouldn't be surprising to note that KSU has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). That means we are looking for more underperformance from this company and really the industry at large in the near term too.If that wasn't enough KSU doesn't exactly have great metrics on the growth or value fronts either. The stock has a 'C' grade for growth and an 'F' grade for value, largely thanks to its higher-than-average forward PE and weaker than industry readings on projected sales growth and projected EPS growth. (  ) announced that it will offer an incentive of $1,000 to new car buyers who are referred by the owners of its Model S. The owners who bring in the referral are also entitled to receive an incentive of $1,000 in their Tesla account which they can use to purchase a new vehicle or accessories, or for accessing certain services.This additional $2,000, being offered as incentive, is equal to the cost incurred by Tesla to sell a car through a company-owned store. The electric automaker believes that by offering the incentive, it is merely passing the costs as benefits to its customers. If this plan proves successful, it will drive sales for the company.Tesla announced that orders for the new vehicle need to be placed by Oct 31 to avail this offer. The company considers this incentive plan as a guerrilla tactic which will help it counter the auto dealer franchise laws that restrict it from selling its luxury electric vehicles directly to customers.In addition to the incentive, Tesla announced that the first owner who persuades 10 friends to buy the Model S in North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific regions will receive a Model X SUV free of cost. Also, the next person to provide 10 successful referrals will be able to purchase the special version of the Model X called the Founders Series, which will not be accessible to the general public. The automaker further assured that customers providing five referrals will receive an invitation to visit its Gigafactory in Nevada along with a guest.Tesla is witnessing growing sales due to the strong performance and impressive design of its products. The company delivered 10,045 vehicles in the first quarter of 2015, representing an impressive 55% improvement from the first quarter of 2014.Tesla delivered 11,507 vehicles in the second quarter of 2015, representing an improvement of 52% from the year-ago quarter. The company expects to deliver about 55,000 Model S and Model X vehicles globally in 2015, up 70% from the 2014 level. Tesla anticipates annual sales of 500,000 units by 2020. Thereafter, the company hopes to double its production every year for a few years to attain annual sales of several million vehicles by 2025.Currently, Tesla carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Other well-ranked automobile stocks include Ford Motor Co. (  ) and PACCAR Inc. (  ). All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The revenue figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.98 billion. The year-over-year improvement can be attributed to higher demand in on-highway markets and distributor acquisitions in North America, partially offset by currency headwinds mainly because of a strengthening U.S. dollar.Operating income increased 18.1% to $723 million from $612 million a year ago.

The segment's EBIT increased to $341 million (12.2% of sales) from $311 million (11.3% of sales) a year ago.Sales at the Components segment grew 9% to $1.4 billion on the back of strong on-highway demand in China, Europe and North America, partially marred by sluggish demand in Brazil.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because PACCAR is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings-with the most up-to-date information possible-is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for PCAR in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.18 per share for PCAR, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.16 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for PCAR, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 1.72% heading into earnings season.A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more  ).Given that PCAR has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for PACCAR, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

The highlights:PACCAR continues to report big growth in the U.S. and Europe. Source: PACCARLeading North American medium- and heavy-duty truck builder  reported second quarter earnings on July 28 and delivered yet another record-breaking result. The highlights:Much like the company's strong first quarter, Q2 is further evidence that 2015 is shaping up to be the best year in the company's history. Let's take a closer look.Truck deliveries in the company's biggest market -- North America -- increased 31% in the quarter while Europe jumped an impressive 26%:Source: PACCAR earnings releaseThese are the two dominant markets for the company and are expected to remain so for years to come -- especially in the current demand cycle. If there's one weak spot in the company's business, it's South America, which is a large part of the \"Other\" segment. This market is expected to remain weak this year, with truck sales falling due to economic weakness in major markets like Brazil.For now, though, the U.S. and European truck markets are expected to generate strong demand for the next several years. PACCAR management -- as well as other industry experts -- are calling for 270,000-290,000 trucks to be delivered in North America this year, up from 250,000 in 2014 and several sub-200,000 years on the tail of the recession. In Europe, the expectation is for 240,000-260,000, also up big from the prior six years of lagging sales. data by Yes, the industry has been on the growth side of the cycle since late 2009, but by all indications, there remains a lot of pent-up demand for new trucks after several years of very slow sales, as well as very high shipping volume on both sides of the pond.While it's important to keep an eye on the demand curve for a cyclical business like PACCAR's and acknowledge that weakening economic conditions will have an impact on sales, demand is still very strong.Things are going great with PACCAR, but there is one uncertainty that the company is dealing with. Last November, the European Commission -- which is the trade authority for Eurozone countries -- issued a Statement of Objection, essentially accusing the major truck makers in Europe of price fixing. These are serious charges that most of the industry is fighting, but Daimler, which sells the most trucks in Europe, has already set aside 600 million euros (more than $700 million U.S.) to prepare for potential fines. Some expect total fines across the entire industry to top 4 billion euros, or more than $4.5 billion. PACCAR management says DAF -- the company's primary European brand -- is preparing its response and that any ruling would be subject to appeal. But at this point the company says it's unable to estimate the financial impact.The company has more than $3.2 billion in cash and short-term securities on hand, so the company is in great shape to deal with the impact of fines without putting the company at risk, but it sounds likely to cost the company, depending on how involved DAF was in the alleged price-fixing scheme.The recovery in truck sales has been slow coming, but 2015 is turning into a record-breaking year for PACCAR. But it's important to note that total truck sales in both North America and Europe are still short of levels before the recession, so it's probably too early to call the top just yet.With that said, PACCAR's financial and operational strength continue to shine, as the company's strong earnings growth this quarter and last indicate. The company does carry more than $8 billion in debt, but even that deserves proper context, as it is largely tied to the company's financing business. In other words, even that debt helps the company make money since it's able to profit on the \"spread\" between what it pays in interest on the debt and what it charges its customers.The company also recently increased its dividend 9% to $0.24, a 165% increase since the recession. But even after all the dividend growth, the company will pay out a similar percentage of earnings in dividends in 2015 as it did in 2012 when the dividend was half the current level.Overall, PACCAR is taking full advantage of the strong rebound in truck sales and putting a huge amount of that growth on the bottom line and back in shareholder's pockets.Bad news for your credit card company. The plastic in your wallet may soon be gone forever. And once it is, it could cost major credit card companies as much as $18 million a day! Good news for you.

In the last quarter, the company posted a 0.00% surprise. Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Genuine Parts has undertaken various initiatives to boost sales and earnings, such as product line expansion, penetration into new markets and cost-saving activities. The company relies on a diverse product portfolio for top- and bottom-line growth. Moreover, the recent acquisitions, including those of JAL associate and Miller Bearing, should drive sales. Also, acquisitions under the Automotive segment and the Electrical segment should augment revenues in the second quarter.However, Genuine Parts expects to face challenges in the Electrical/Electronic Materials segment in 2015 owing to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar that will likely impact exports and also result in deflation in copper pricing.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Genuine Parts is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3(Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is currently pegged at 0.00%. This is because both the estimates stand at $1.32. Genuine Parts carries a Zacks Rank #2. Though a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 increases the predictive power of ESP, the company's ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:PACCAR Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +1.72% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company will report second-quarter 2015 financial numbers on Jul 28.Group 1 Automotive Inc.  has an Earnings ESP of +4.42% and a Zacks Rank #2.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  the  (  ),  (  ),  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .Negotiations in Greece and volatility in China have dominated headlines. They have weighed on investor sentiment, arresting the upward movement in U.S. stocks. However, second quarter earnings is poised to grab the spotlight starting this week. They are expected to come in below par and may be hampered by a strong dollar and weak  , much like first quarter earnings.Weakening demand from China has impacted world oil demand significantly. Since June, the country's stock market has crashed around 30% which prompted the government to adopt emergency measures. Global demand for oil has been hit significantly since the country us the second largest consumer of oil in the world after the U.S.Meanwhile, Iran is presently negotiating a nuclear deal with major global powers. If the agreement goes through, all sanctions against the country will be lifted and Iran will work toward stepping up its crude export.This spells more trouble as Iran already possesses the world's fourth biggest oil reserve, and the latest agreement will boost oil production further in the oversupplied market. In fact, an Iranian official recently stated that the country is willing to double crude exports after obtaining necessary approval.Consequently, as was the case in Q1, the Energy sector may be the biggest drag in Q2 as well. Total earnings for the sector may decline by 62.2% on a 40.4% reduction in revenues. Excluding Energy, total earnings for the S&P 500 would be essentially flat from the period last year.Strength in the U.S. dollar had a huge impact on the trade deficit over the first quarter. While a stronger dollar dragged down the export demand in the first quarter, it also boosted import demand as it made foreign goods cheaper.Weakness in first quarter earnings numbers was attributed to the strength of the dollar. Large-cap S&P 500 companies earn about 40% of their revenues from outside the US. Total first quarter earnings for the 498 S&P 500 members were up 2.4% on 3.3% lower revenues. Only 62% could beat EPS estimates and only 42.4% outperformed revenue expectations.A stronger dollar may hurt earnings this time too. In the run up to the second quarter, markets were mostly worried about the Greece debt deal crisis as well as China's weak markets and volatile equity markets.The recent deal reached between Greece and its creditors have led to optimism that this issue will no longer weigh on investor sentiment. However, the country's prime minister faces a tough task in pushing these reforms through parliament.To qualify for the bailout, Greece needs to broaden its tax structure, reform pensions, increase privatization, strengthen the financial sector, improve labor market conditions and modernize the Greek administrative system. This is a tall order and may face stiff domestic opposition.Meanwhile, China's markets have lost $3.9 trillion within less than a month. A series of government measures are being consistently unveiled, but their effects were initially limited to large state-owned enterprises. On Tuesday, small-cap stocks gained the most since 2008, raising hopes that the rout had been stemmed.However, the extent of market volatility has been demonstrated by today's 1.2% decline in the benchmark index. Losses come ahead of data to be released on Wednesday which may possibly indicate that economic growth has declined.Despite the skepticism surrounding second quarter earnings, some sectors are tipped to experience earnings growth. Medical is expected to have the strongest growth, with total earnings for the sector expected to be up 5.5% on 7.1% higher revenues. Total earnings for the Finance sector are expected to increase by 2.7% despite a 0.5% decline in revenues. Some other sectors are also expected to enjoy earnings growth, according to our estimates.Below we present five stocks set to benefit from this trend.

With the summer's earnings season now in full swing, a host of fresh dividend declarations have hit the market.As ever, last week more than a few of these represented increases over  . We've got quite a few to choose from in this installment, and whittling the number down to three was tough. Regardless, here are the winners:Some companies habitually lift their distributions occasionally... and some do it every time they declare a payout.Enterprise Products Partners is very much in the latter category. It just declared a $0.38-per-unit distribution, although that only represents a 1% increase over the previous payout.The partnership didn't have much more to distribute, because its latest quarterly results were weak. Revenue cratered by 45% on a year-over-year basis to $75 billion, while the bottom line slid 20% to $636 million. Neither met analyst expectations.The obvious culprit for the declines was the comparatively lower prices for oil, which have had a ripple effect across the broader oil and gas industry. A relatively mild winter that helped keep prices low wasn't a boon, either.Despite that, Enterprise is still in a very good position on the market. It provides many of its services on the basis of long-term, fixed-fee contracts, insulating against some of the wilder swings of the commodities it specializes in.So I think its distribution is safe. We probably won't see the big quarter-over-quarter raises in the payout as we did previously, but it should rise nevertheless. Meanwhile, in terms of operations and management, the partnership is among the most solid in its industry.Enterprise's upcoming disbursement will be paid on August 7 to holders of record as of July 31.Paccar, which concentrates on the manufacturing of heavy trucks, has been motoring along smoothly in recent times. Excellent results fuel a rising dividend; last week, the company raised this by 9% to $0.24 per share.Following a fiscal 2014 where Paccar notched an all-time record revenue figure, it also reported a strong Q1 2015. Net profit rose a mighty 38% over the year-ago result to hit $378 million, while the top line advanced by 10% to $4.8 billion. Both beat analyst expectations.A rising economy needs the vehicles to move its goods. Paccar has benefited from new purchases and refurbishments of existing trucks, and it anticipates it'll continue to do so.The company's lifted its forecast for North American unit truck sales slightly, to 260,000 to 290,000 vehicles (up from the previous 250,000 to 280,000).Paccar's strengthening business will add to its cash and equivalents position, giving it the increased financial muscle to keep that dividend on the road. By the way, it's paid a distribution consistently since 1941.Paccar's next dividend will be dispensed on September 4 to shareholders of record as of August 14.This popular dividend stock is delivering for income investors, with the company enacting the latest in a series of annual raises. It's hiked the payout by 4% to nearly $0.83 per share.Duke Energy's fundamentals have been mixed of late, however. It  that missed revenue expectations, but trounced bottom-line estimates. Although domestic operations are doing well, its international unit suffered a steep income drop during the quarter.On our shores, Duke has gotten itself in hot water over environmental issues, specifically its disposal of coal ash in North Carolina. It's already paid fines totaling over $100 million for this.As an eager and generous dividend payer, the company might struggle to keep that distribution up if those negatives worsen.But I think it considers its payout to be of utmost importance, plus over the years it's managed to raise it on a consistent basis. Those factors considered, I think the dividend is secure for now.Duke Energy will pay out its new distribution on September 16 to stockholders of record as of August 14.A Seattle couple recently discovered some little-known Social Security secrets that can boost many retirees' income by as much as $60,000. They were shocked by how easy it was to actually take advantage of these loopholes. And although it may seem too good to be true, it's 100% real. In fact, one MarketWatch reporter argues that if more Americans used them, the government would have to shell out an extra $10 billion... every year! So once you learn how to take advantage of these loopholes, you could retire confidently with the peace of mind we're all after, even if you're woefully unprepared.  that details how you can take advantage of these strategies.The article  originally appeared on Fool.com.Copyright \u00a9 1995 - 2015 The Motley Fool, LLC.

The automaker will reconfigure the plant with a new paint shop and body shop and will also upgrade the general assembly area. The company will start the construction work this summer and expects to complete the process in the next three years. General Motors also clarified that the construction work will not affect the production schedules for Chevrolet Tahoes and Suburbans, GMC Yukons and Yukon XLs and Cadillac Escalades.General Motors aims to manufacture and supply the best SUVs in the market.

In Apr 2015, the company announced plans of putting in $5.4 billion for the improvement of its plants in the U.S. over the next three years. The investment in the Arlington Assembly Plant is part of this larger strategy. As of now, the company has made an investment proposal of approximately $4.5 billion. Plans for the remaining $900 million are expected to be announced by the end of this year.Post bankruptcy since Jun 2009, General Motors has announced an investment of $17.8 billion in U.S. facilities.

Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.General Motors is focusing on the emerging markets, particularly Brazil, China and India, to enhance its global sales by increasing capacity investment to meet the growing demand. The company is focused on the Chinese market, which is expected to become the world's largest luxury vehicle market, later this decade. All these factors should drive the second-quarter results of the company.However, General Motors is facing a challenging situation in Russia on account of declining sales owing to a weak economy. Meanwhile, Venezuela is facing challenges on account of low  and currency controls which have led to a decline in the value of dollar in South America.

Stocks recently featured in the blog include  the  (  ),  (  ) and  (  ).Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.  .With second quarter earnings season heating up for the S&P 500 this week, the focus is squarely on stock valuations. Results are widely expected to come in below par and exorbitant valuations are emerging as clear and present danger to the U.S. markets. However, the failure of various metrics to accurately estimate valuations is causing confusion.According to Thomson Reuters estimates, the forward P/E for the S&P 500 stood at 16.5 midway through Friday's trading session. This is 10% higher than the historic mean of 15. The metric is significantly lower than the dot-com boom record of 24.5 back in 1999. But it is the highest level experienced in more than a decade.The two most popular value metrics are forward P/E and TTM P/E. Those investing using the second approach are skeptical about the accuracy of forward estimates. They say that incorrect assumptions, bias of analysts and a generally bullish approach lead to a variety of errors.However, both approaches seem to be converging when it comes to concerns about overvaluation. One estimate, released by  last week showed that both of these measures were hovering above their medians. Forward P/E for the S&P 500 was at 19, higher than the median value of 17.9. Meanwhile at 17, TTM P/E was higher than its median value of 14.8.The third most popular approach makes allowances for real price levels. In this case, the inflation-adjust price of the S&P 500 is divided by the moving average of the last 10 years earnings to arrive at a metric with a long-term perspective on valuation. US CPI is utilized to account for inflationary changes.The idea behind utilizing 10 years of earnings is to smooth out the effects of business cycles. This gives us the cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio or CAPE ratio. Some call this the Shiller ratio after Nobel laureate Robert Shiller who has popularized it.In this case, the results are similar in the sense that they also indicate that stocks are overvalued. However, there is one significant difference. Thomson Reuters estimates from the end of June indicate that the CAPE or Shiller ratio was nearly 27, compared to the TTM ratio of around 19 for the S&P 500. Now, the debate becomes not one about direction, but one centered on magnitude.Naturally, there are skeptics about the efficacy of the CAPE approach as well. Shiller himself is also unable to explain the various issues surrounding the debate. However, he does point toward the one factor which has created several distortions in the first place.This is the prevalence of a low interest rate regime across most of the developed world. Low interest rates in turn originate from the low levels of inflation being experienced. In fact, both of these indicators are nearly 65% lower than average levels, according to one estimate. This usually leads to high P/E ratios.It seems the primary reason for such exorbitant P/E ratios is weak earnings growth. This requires a separate discussion, but most of first quarter earnings weakness can be traced to the energy sector. In the short run, it seems that stocks are indeed overvalued, but not to a degree which can be termed as excessive. This is due to the distortions being experienced by valuation metrics due to the effects of low inflation rates.However, it would be wise to remain wary about valuations, since they do remain higher than usual. Below we present three domestic S&P 500 stocks that have a favorable Zacks Rank. They also acquit themselves creditably on several valuation metrics, including our Value Style Score.Finding a great value stock can be a tough task. But thanks to our new  we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for value investors in the near term. The Value Style Score condenses all valuation metrics into one actionable score that helps investors steer clear of 'value traps' and identify stocks that are truly trading at a discount.Our research shows that stocks with Value Style Scores of 'A' or 'B' when combined with Zacks Rank # 1 (Strong Buy) or Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) offer the best investment opportunities in the value investing space.

The Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) P/E is 13.69. (  ) is the third-largest manufacturer of heavy-duty trucks in the world and has substantial manufacturing exposure to light/medium trucks.Apart from a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), PACCAR has a Value Style Score of 'A.' The company has expected earnings growth of 18.7% for the current year and a P/E (F1) of 13.88x and TTM P/E of 15.42.

The company has expected earnings growth of 5.4% for the current year and a P/E (F1) of 9.7x and TTM P/E of 10.35.Current stock valuations may not seem as exorbitant as they appear on first glance.

Vehicles covered under this recall mainly include Buick Enclave of model years 2008 to 2012 and Chevrolet Traverse of 2009 to 2012. The recall also covers GMC Acadia from 2007 to 2012 and Saturn Outlook from 2007 to 2010.General Motors fears that dirt may enter the gas struts which support the power rear hatches of these vehicles, causing the lift gates to prematurely wear and fail. There is a rod system which has been designed to close the hatches slowly if the strut fails, but that may not work as the software controlling it may fail to detect the issue. The automaker further stated that the struts have been positioned differently in the SUVs manufactured since Mar 2012, making them less vulnerable to this problem.Dealers will be replacing the faulty struts and updating the lift gate control motor software of the recalled vehicles. There have been reports of 56 injuries related to this issue so far.The problem was first reported in Sep 2010, when a driver reported lift gate failure. As the rate of incidents was low, the automaker started monitoring the issue without announcing any recall. However, in Nov 2014, two more cases were reported, following which the automaker started investigating the issue. When the injury toll reached 56, General Motors announced the recall.General Motors is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

If the agreement goes through, all sanctions against the country will be lifted and Iran will work toward stepping up its crude export.This spells more trouble as Iran already possesses the world's fourth biggest oil reserve, and the latest agreement will boost oil production further in the oversupplied market. In fact, an Iranian official recently stated that the country is willing to double crude exports after obtaining necessary approval.Consequently, as was the case in Q1, the Energy sector may be the biggest drag in Q2 as well. Total earnings for the sector may decline by 62.2% on a 40.4% reduction in revenues. Excluding Energy, total earnings for the S&P 500 would be essentially flat from the period last year.Strength in the U.S. dollar had a huge impact on the trade deficit over the first quarter. While a stronger dollar dragged down the export demand in the first quarter, it also boosted import demand as it made foreign goods cheaper.Weakness in first quarter earnings numbers was attributed to the strength of the dollar.

In the run up to the second quarter, markets were mostly worried about the Greece debt deal crisis as well as China's weak markets and volatile equity markets.The recent deal reached between Greece and its creditors have led to optimism that this issue will no longer weigh on investor sentiment. However, the country's prime minister faces a tough task in pushing these reforms through parliament.To qualify for the bailout, Greece needs to broaden its tax structure, reform pensions, increase privatization, strengthen the financial sector, improve labor market conditions and modernize the Greek administrative system. This is a tall order and may face stiff domestic opposition.Meanwhile, China's markets have lost $3.9 trillion within less than a month. A series of government measures are being consistently unveiled, but their effects were initially limited to large state-owned enterprises.

Losses come ahead of data to be released on Wednesday which may possibly indicate that economic growth has declined.Despite the skepticism surrounding second quarter earnings, some sectors are tipped to experience earnings growth. Medical is expected to have the strongest growth, with total earnings for the sector expected to be up 5.5% on 7.1% higher revenues.

Results are widely expected to come in below par and exorbitant valuations are emerging as clear and present danger to the U.S. markets. However, the failure of various metrics to accurately estimate valuations is causing confusion.According to Thomson Reuters estimates, the forward P/E for the S&P 500 stood at 16.5 midway through Friday's trading session. This is 10% higher than the historic mean of 15. The metric is significantly lower than the dot-com boom record of 24.5 back in 1999. But it is the highest level experienced in more than a decade.The two most popular value metrics are forward P/E and TTM P/E. Those investing using the second approach are skeptical about the accuracy of forward estimates. They say that incorrect assumptions, bias of analysts and a generally bullish approach lead to a variety of errors.However, both approaches seem to be converging when it comes to concerns about overvaluation. One estimate, released by  last week showed that both of these measures were hovering above their medians. Forward P/E for the S&P 500 was at 19, higher than the median value of 17.9. Meanwhile at 17, TTM P/E was higher than its median value of 14.8.The third most popular approach makes allowances for real price levels. In this case, the inflation-adjust price of the S&P 500 is divided by the moving average of the last 10 years earnings to arrive at a metric with a long-term perspective on valuation. US CPI is utilized to account for inflationary changes.The idea behind utilizing 10 years of earnings is to smooth out the effects of business cycles. This gives us the cyclically adjusted price-earnings ratio or CAPE ratio. Some call this the Shiller ratio after Nobel laureate Robert Shiller who has popularized it.In this case, the results are similar in the sense that they also indicate that stocks are overvalued. However, there is one significant difference. Thomson Reuters estimates from the end of June indicate that the CAPE or Shiller ratio was nearly 27, compared to the TTM ratio of around 19 for the S&P 500. Now, the debate becomes not one about direction, but one centered on magnitude.Naturally, there are skeptics about the efficacy of the CAPE approach as well. Shiller himself is also unable to explain the various issues surrounding the debate. However, he does point toward the one factor which has created several distortions in the first place.This is the prevalence of a low interest rate regime across most of the developed world. Low interest rates in turn originate from the low levels of inflation being experienced. In fact, both of these indicators are nearly 65% lower than average levels, according to one estimate. This usually leads to high P/E ratios.It seems the primary reason for such exorbitant P/E ratios is weak earnings growth. This requires a separate discussion, but most of first quarter earnings weakness can be traced to the energy sector. In the short run, it seems that stocks are indeed overvalued, but not to a degree which can be termed as excessive. This is due to the distortions being experienced by valuation metrics due to the effects of low inflation rates.However, it would be wise to remain wary about valuations, since they do remain higher than usual. Below we present three domestic S&P 500 stocks that have a favorable Zacks Rank. They also acquit themselves creditably on several valuation metrics, including our Value Style Score.Finding a great value stock can be a tough task. But thanks to our new  we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for value investors in the near term. The Value Style Score condenses all valuation metrics into one actionable score that helps investors steer clear of 'value traps' and identify stocks that are truly trading at a discount.Our research shows that stocks with Value Style Scores of 'A' or 'B' when combined with Zacks Rank # 1 (Strong Buy) or Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) offer the best investment opportunities in the value investing space. produces, distributes and markets chicken, beef, pork, prepared foods and allied products.Tyson Foods holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a Value Style Score of 'A.' The company has expected earnings growth of 17.7% for the current year. The forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) for the current financial year (F1) is 12.42. The Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) P/E is 13.69. is the third-largest manufacturer of heavy-duty trucks in the world and has substantial manufacturing exposure to light/medium trucks.Apart from a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), PACCAR has a Value Style Score of 'A.' The company has expected earnings growth of 18.7% for the current year and a P/E (F1) of 13.88x and TTM P/E of 15.42. is one of the world's largest tire manufacturing companies, selling under Goodyear, Kelly, Dunlop, Fulda, Debica, Sava and various other \"house\" brands as well as private-label brands.Goodyear holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a Value Style Score of 'B.' The company has expected earnings growth of 5.4% for the current year and a P/E (F1) of 9.7x and TTM P/E of 10.35.Current stock valuations may not seem as exorbitant as they appear on first glance.

The company also manufactures the model in China, Argentina, Germany, Russia and Thailand.However, U.S sales of Focus and C-Max were adversely affected by the slump in gas prices. Thus, the automaker retrenched 700 employees at the Michigan Assembly Plant from its total strength of 4,700 workers. The company decided on the job cut to avoid the overproduction of small cars.Meanwhile, the United Auto Workers is planning to launch formal negotiations for a new labor agreement to raise wages.

The recalled vehicles comprise 17 models like Fit subcompact, Stream minivan and CR-V sport utility cars produced in the 2007--2011 period.For investigative purposes, Honda had collected 1,000 Takata-made air bag inflators from cars which were not covered under the previous recalls. After analyzing the cars, Takata found discrepancy in the density of gas-producing chemicals in inflators, which may lead to faulty deployment of air bags. On the basis of the findings, Honda has announced the latest recall.This 4.5 million vehicle recall adds to the May 14 recall wherein Honda had recalled 4.89 million vehicles with faulty airbags. Of these, 1.72 million cars of model years 2004-2008 were from Japan. The automaker also concluded that a leak can occur in these vehicles when in motion, which may cause a rupture and cause the airbag to explode. However, there have been no reports of any injury related to this issue.With the latest recall, the total number of vehicles recalled due to faulty Takata air bag inflators increased to 57.5 million worldwide. Of this, 33.8 million inflators are from the U.S., which affected 32 million vehicles produced by 11 automakers including the likes of Honda, BMW and Toyota Motor Corporation  . Notably, Honda has been affected the most by the Takata air bag defect.Automakers are facing considerable problems owing to the defective Takata air bags which can explode, shooting metal fragments, in case of a car crash. Also, frequent product recalls not only reduce consumer confidence in a brand, but also add to a company's expenses. There have been cases of 8 fatal accidents and 100 injuries because of the faulty air bags. Honda had to restate its financial results for the business year ended Mar 2015 due to additional costs from the Takata air bag recalls.Currently, Honda carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

These vehicles are identical to the Toyota Matrix, which was previously recalled.General Motors announced this recall after Japan-based Takata, which is one of the leading global suppliers of automotive safety systems and products, conceded to declare that 33.8 million of its airbags are defective, last month. This announcement almost doubled the number of vehicles and trucks recalled due to the faulty airbag issue. Moreover, it will be the largest auto recall in the U.S. Takata was forced to announce the recall due to pressure from the U.S regulators.The airbags manufactured by Takata use ammonium nitrate for inflation in the event of a crash. After testing, it was found that airborne moisture can get into the inflators and cause the ammonium nitrate to burn hotter than expected. Thus, when an airbag is deployed, the inflator can explode and shoot out metal fragments into the vehicle. There have been reports of 7 deaths and 100 injuries globally due to these faulty airbags.This defect covers both the passenger- and driver-side airbag inflators in vehicles produced by 11 automakers.

During the 2009 bankruptcy and restructuring, the automaker had committed the mistake of overproduction, which it does not want to repeat.General Motors had invested $545 million in the Orion Assembly plant for the production of the Verano and Sonic vehicles.

ROE declined to 2%, down 7% from the prior quarter.Net income per share was $0.09, badly missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.63 per share. According to the management, results were adversely affected by a combination of factors, including lower than expected performance in the distressed loan portfolio, higher prepayment speeds that negatively affected MSR and ESS valuations, and hedge losses related to mortgage spread widening in the MBS portfolios.Due to disappointing results, quarterly and annual estimates have been revised sharply downwards in the past few weeks by analysts.Zacks Consensus Estimates for the current and next fiscal year now stand at $1.75 per share and $2.48 per share, from $2.58 per share and $2.73 per share, before the results. The company has missed Zacks Consensus Estimates in three out of last four quarters, with an average quarterly negative surprise of 18%.Retail sales seemed to have shed off the first quarter gloom after extending gains into the third successive month.

It was also reported that retail sales rose 2.1% year over year through March to May period.Meanwhile, March's gain was revised upward to 1.5%, marking the highest monthly gain in almost five years. Strong gains in retail sales indicated that the economy is recovering at an impressive rate after having a disappointing first quarter.Sales at gasoline stations rose 3.7% in May, in contrast with April's loss of 0.6%. It was the biggest gainer among the segments, signaling a gradual recovery for the energy sector after the rampant slump in  over the past one-year period.Sales in auto sector also played an important role in boosting sales in May.

The auto industry witnessed its best May ever in terms of light vehicle sales. Strong demand for light trucks along with crossovers and SUVs boosted auto sales in May. Low level of oil prices and a low-rate environment helped the auto sector to register strong gains.Separately, most of the housing data released in May were encouraging, which indicated that the housing market has rebounded strongly after getting affected by a severe winter in the first quarter.

With trucks moving 69% of total U.S. freight tonnage today, the industry often serves as a leading indicator of the state of the economy. So holding some trucking stocks could be a great way to play economic upturns (Basic facts surrounding the trucking industry can be found  ).In fact, according to recent industry statistics, this could be a good time to bet on trucking stocks. Here are three factors to consider:Now that you have a fair idea about the trucking industry, here are two great stocks to consider.A Fortune 500 company, Paccar is one of the largest truck manufacturers in the world. Through well-known brands including Kenworth, Peterbilt, and DAF, Paccar has established solid presence in global truck markets, particularly in the key heavy-duty segment. The following chart shows how Paccar's market share in important heavy-duty truck markets has grown over the past decade.Source: Paccar Q1 2015 investor presentation.As you can see, Paccar has cornered at least a quarter of the heavy-duty truck market in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and Australia. Meanwhile, its DAF brand is making good headway in Europe, commanding nearly 14% share in 2014.Paccar is deftly exploiting its strong foothold in the truck markets: Its revenue surged 11% to hit an all-time high of nearly $19 billion last year, and net income climbed 16% to $1.36 billion -- the second-best figure in the company's history.What could really set Paccar apart from traditional truck manufacturers is an increasing focus on manufacturing its own engines. While the company still sources majority of its engines from  , self-reliance is among its primary goals. The progress is already visible: Paccar's MX-13 engines made their way into 37% of its Kenworth and Peterbilt heavy-duty trucks in the fourth quarter. The company is now gearing up to launch its 11-liter engine in North America by early next year.Well-planned strategic investments have helped Paccar generate a 9.5% return on invested capital on average over the past four years, with return on equity topping 20% currently. The company has paid a dividend every year since 1941.In a nutshell, industry leadership, strong financials and shareholder returns, and aggressive growth plans make Paccar a compelling story. Cummins is not building trucks, but it supplies essential components without which trucks would not run, such as diesel and natural-gas engines, filtration, and fuel systems. The company thus caters to the key supply side of the trucking industry.Cummins is among the world's top engine makers, having gained solid traction over the years. For perspective, it commanded one-third of the heavy-duty and a staggering 80% of the medium-duty truck engine markets in North America in its last quarter. Its share in the high-potential Chinese market grew to 17% in the first quarter from 11% a year ago.Cummins' engines are sought-after worldwide, largely because of the \"fit-for-market\" strategy under which it designs and customizes engines and components to suit a region's specific requirements. That notably addresses region-specific emission standards. Furthermore, through its long-standing joint venture with natural-gas engine technology expert  , Cummins  is well positioned to cash in on growing demand for the alternative fuel.The solid foothold in its industry is reflected in Cummins' numbers: Its revenue jumped 11% last year to a record high of $19.2 billion, and net income climbed 11% to $1.65 billion. What's more, the engine maker boasts a solid balance sheet, rapidly growing free cash flow, and a large war chest to support long-term debt that is well under control. Take a look: data by  .A good chunk of that free cash flow goes into shareholders' pockets: Cummins has increased its dividend by threefold since 2010, including a 25% boost last year. The company also announced a fresh $1 billion share repurchase program last year to top an existing $1 billion buyback program. Cummins' return on equity topped 20% in 2014.Overall, Cummins comes across as a finely managed and fundamentally solid company that has what it takes to reward patient investors handsomely in the long run.One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide Web to bed. And if you act quickly, you could be among the savvy investors who enjoy the profits from this stunning change.

This investment will enable the automaker to qualify for maximum tax credits in the state. These tax credits will help the company to expand its business in Michigan.The Michigan Strategic Fund has approved an amended tax agreement with Ford, under which the state will be responsible for business tax credits of $9.5 billion till 2031. Most of these credits were issued during the recession, when Detroit's major automakers, including Ford, General Motors Company  and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V.  had guaranteed jobs in the state. The state had to make budget cuts due to these larger-than-expected tax credit redemptions. Thus the recent deal restricts the state's liability for incentives issued to retain auto jobs there.The new deal further combines and revises four previous agreements between Ford and the former Michigan Economic Growth Authority, signed over the period 2009-2011. The deal maintains the previous estimate that Ford can retain a maximum of 40,200 new jobs. However, it restricts the total credit value at $2.3 billion through 2025. Ford's total investment is anticipated to double to $6.2 billion.Over the years, Ford has made investments in Michigan to expand its business. In 2014, the automaker invested $1 billion for modifying plants in Dearborn and near Kansas City, MO. The automaker also invested in a Michigan metal stamping factory for the production of the new F-150 pickup truck. In 2013, Ford had invested $555 million in the Flat Rock plant, where the new Mustang is produced.Ford will have to periodically predict the estimated tax credits received. Additionally, there may be unspecified limits on the credits that can be claimed in the year. However, the state has discontinued the process of awarding new business tax credits from the beginning of 2012 under a new tax code. The state will nonetheless reimburse the old credits.Ford currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). PACCAR Inc.  , carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is a better-ranked stock in the auto industry.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

The deal is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and completion of Sumitomo Rubber's labor agreement with the United Steelworkers union for the Tonawanda plant.The alliance comprises four joint venture operating companies.

Test driving of the car is currently in progress and the CEO is happy with the results. However, the company wants to ensure that certain key features, including the Falcon wing doors, are functioning properly.According to Musk, Model X will have a low center of gravity due to the location of the heavy battery pack on the car's floor. This will ensure that the possibility of a vehicle rollover in the event of a crash is nearly zero.Musk also stated that Tesla will permit some Model S owners to test a new autopilot feature by June end. This feature will allow the car to drive autonomously at highway speed as well as park itself on private property. Moreover, vehicle owners will not have to walk up to a parked car if it is on their private property as they will be able to beckon it.The autopilot feature will be provided as a software update on recent versions of Model S as well as Model X.

Hence, the automaker will be allowed to sell cars through its retail stores in Maryland. However, Tesla will be permitted to open a maximum of four stores in the state.Tesla is facing opposition to its direct-selling model in some U.S. states such as Texas, Arizona, Michigan and West Virginia that have banned the direct sales of vehicles by any automaker. Many other states that had earlier imposed a ban on direct selling, have now allowed it.Last week, the Governor of Georgia signed a bill that removed a sales cap of 150 cars per year. The bill also increased the limit on the number of Tesla's stores to five from three.In March, the Governor of New Jersey signed a bill allowing direct selling by zero-emission vehicle manufacturers, provided they run a service center in the state.

The charges pertain to the delay in recall of vehicles with a faulty ignition switch that has apparently caused 104 deaths.Manhattan U.S. attorney Preet Bharara is examining evidence related to the safety defect, with assistance from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in New York. The attorney is investigating whether there was any violation of law on the part of the company or its executives. If proven guilty, investigators can sue the automaker or General Motors' workers. The investigative body may even impose a fine on the company and make it ammend its operations going forward.The fine, if imposed, might be in excess of the compensation that General Motors owes to the victims of the safety glitch. The costs associated with the replacement of the 2.6 million switches in older-model cars will be an additional burden.General Motors has already launched a program to compensate the victims and families affected by crashes caused by the ignition switch defect. To assess the claims and deploy funds, General Motors has appointed Kenneth Feinberg, who is dealing with the claims registered between Aug 1, 2014 and Jan 31, 2015.Other automakers which have suffered along similar lines as General Motors include Toyota Motor Corporation  . The company was fined when found guilty of hiding safety defects related to uncontrolled acceleration. The Japanese automaker had agreed to pay a fine of $1.2 billion in this regard.On its part, General Motors had hired Attorney Anton Valukas, the chairman of Chicago law firm Jenner & Block, to investigate the reason for the delay. He pointed that lack of urgency among engineers and in-house lawyers had resulted in the delay.General Motors is facing the heat for delaying the recall of 2.6 million vehicles with defective ignition switches, which can lead to engine shut-down and hinder deployment of front air bags in the event of a crash. The company issued a recall in Feb 2014, although the problem was identified long back in 2001. Lawfully, automakers are supposed to alert The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\"NHTSA\") about any safety concern in vehicles within five business days of recognizing the problem. However, General Motors had failed to do so. The automaker has faced multiple investigations (including a criminal probe) and lawsuits on account of this delay.CEO of General Motors, Mary Barra, has faced the Congress several times in the past, apologizing for the delayed recall. She has maintained that the company is determined to resolve the issue in the least possible time.General Motors currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

These stocks should at least be going well on a long-term basis. We screened companies that take a balanced approach to dividends and buybacks and possess a good growth story as well. The stocks identified should be held onto three to five years from now based on their positive earnings momentum.The first stock is  (  ), which makes commercial trucks under the nameplates of Kenworth and Peterbilt in North America. The company's earnings per share (  ) are expected to record $4.36 this year, which is up 14% compared to 16% growth last year. Besides that the company can give a potential dividend of 88 cents and even considering that investor's got a special dividend of $1 in January. In addition, the company possesses $2.9 billion, which is rare to the industry it belongs. (  ) is the second stock to look at too, which makes ETCH and deposition machines. They are very important to manufacturing memory and other chips. In addition, a year ago the company initiated a small dividend and authorized $850 million for buybacks over two years. Analysts are hoping to see more buybacks. Moreover, a return on invested capital over 12% suggests the company's spending on itself would be more lucrative.The third stock to be looked at is  (  ), which is a supermarket and is known as big capital spender. The company put $2.8 billion to work last year while spending $1.6 billion on dividend and buybacks. The company is adding more private label products, which would bring in more than one-quarter of sales at above average margins. Moreover, stores are being remodeled with new fresh food sections as the company continues to develop its website and food ordering. Furthermore, invested capital stock with a return of over 12% has plenty of growths ahead. (  ) is the fourth stock, which makes safety equipment for cars. The business is dominated by so-called passive devices such as airbags and safety seatbelts. Growth is constrained as overall consumer demand increases for more cars, which has rebounded to healthy levels in the US but not in Europe yet. Still, market share gains and outlook are promising. Company sales expectation is expecting fall within the 6.5% range this year. The company pays a powerful 1.8% dividend. Moreover, analysts are touting that EPS may increase by 9% to $6.47 this year.The fifth stock to be looked at is  (  ), which is a grain processor. It has tripled its dividend in the past 10 years. This year, the company plans to return $2.2 billion to $2.9 billion to shareholders in dividends and intends to carry out repurchases amounting from 7.2% to 9.5% of its stock market value. Moreover, the company also plans to devote $1.1bn to $1.3bn into capital investments. (  ) is the sixth stock to look at, which lost out to Dollar Tree in the bidding of Family Dollar stores early this year. Dollar General has a payback period of just a year and a half, when it opens new stores. Wall Street expects the store base to grow 6% to 7% a year over the next three years.The seventh stock to be looked at is  (  ). This company reiterated with an outperformance rating. The outcome was very positive around the storage pricing bringing a compelling takeaway. The consensus does not expect revenue or earnings to see material changes near term but the consensus there sees the value of Tesla has accomplished over the past six months being underappreciated.Knowing which stocks to hold on to is vital if one is to make money as an investor on the stock exchange.

Not only are there a wide range of choices, but the space can be extremely volatile and fraught with risk as well. But thanks to our new  we have been able to identify a few growth stocks which have incredible potential in the near term.One such company that stands out in this regard is undoubtedly  (  ). Not only does this company have a favorable growth score, but it is ranked as a buy too. And while there are numerous reasons why PCAR is so attractive right now, we have highlighted three of the most important-and pertinent to growth investors-below:Arguably nothing is more important than earnings growth as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, earnings growth in the double digits is definitely necessary and it is often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) ahead for the company in question.While PCAR has put up a historical EPS growth rate of 43.48%, investors should really focus on the projected growth. Here, PCAR is looking to grow at a rate of 17.77%, thoroughly crushing the industry average which calls for EPS growth of just 9.54% in comparison.Cash is the lifeblood of any business, but especially so for growth oriented companies. A positive figure here indicates that cash is flowing into the business (obviously a good thing), while a negative reading here means that net cash is exiting the company.Right now, PCAR's current cash flow growth is an impressive 14.86%, a level that is far higher than many of its peers, and the industry average. In fact, the industry average sees cash flow growth of just 11.61% in comparison, suggesting that PCAR is a better pick from a cash flow look.If the metrics outlined above weren't enough investors should also consider the positive trends that we are seeing on the analyst estimate revision front. Analysts have been raising their estimates for PACCAR lately, and now the earnings picture is looking a bit more favorable for the company.Over the past 30 days 13 EPS estimates have been revised higher compared to no lower, at least for the current year time frame. And the magnitude of these revisions has also been impressive, as the consensus estimate for the full year has surged from $4.37 per share to $4.51 per share today.For the reasons outlined above, investors shouldn't be surprised to note that PACCAR has earned itself a growth score of 'B' as well as a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This means that we believe PACCAR stock is a potential outperformer that is an impressive choice for growth investors, making it a security that you need to keep on your radar in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

In recognition of the Nasdaq-100\u2019s 30th anniversary, the Nasdaq () research team took a detailed look at this iconic index. The findings are outlined here.The index includes 100 of the largest domestic and international non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market based on market capitalization. Considered a premier large-cap growth index, the Nasdaq-100 plays a crucial role informing the investment community of performance trends for leading non-financial companies and perhaps, more importantly, provides a basis for numerous investable products. Approximately $50 billion in exchange traded products (ETPs) are benchmarked to the Nasdaq-100.Throughout the past three decades the Nasdaq-100 has evolved from the industry\u2019s \u201cTechnology Index\u201d into a leading barometer for strong, growth companies at the forefront of innovation. Companies included in the Nasdaq-100 have helped drive the modern economy and the evolution of the Index, and is a reflection of how the business world has shifted in the 21st century.When launched in 1985, the Nasdaq-100 was intended primarily to showcase the top stocks listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. It was one of two indexes launched at that time (the other being the Nasdaq Financial-100) intended to create a subset of the Nasdaq Composite Index to better support creation of derivative trading instruments such as options and futures.The Nasdaq-100 was designed as a market capitalization-weighted index, meaning the weight of a given component or company is proportional to its market cap. As indicated by the index name, the number of companies is set at 100. Since inclusion is based on rankings tied to ever-changing market capitalization, the components are periodically reconstituted. In its early years, the addition and removal of components was carried out at various points in time. That changed in 1998, when rebalancing started occurring on an annual basis in late December of each year. The additions and deletions are wholly determined by the market cap rankings, which is why many experts have stated that \u201cinvestors determine the membership of the Nasdaq-100.\u201d There is no committee making membership determinations, as is the case with other well-known indexes.From the launch of the Index on January 31, 1985, to the end of 2014, a total of 448 stocks have been members of the Nasdaq-100 at one time or another. Of the original members at launch, seven are still in the current index: Apple (), Costco (originally Price Club) (), Intel (), KLA-Tencor (), Micron Technology (), PACCAR (), and Seagate Technology (). In recent years, on average, between seven and 15 stocks are added or removed from the index each year, most of which occur at the annual rebalance date.Today\u2019s Nasdaq-100 is considered a large-cap index; however, that was not always the case. Taking a look back at the market cap of index components, one can clearly see the rapid growth in company size from 1985 to today.Since the index is made up of 100 companies, it is easy to calculate the average size of each. At launch, this figure was only about $580 million, compared with an average value of about $48 billion as of December 31, 2014, approximately an 80-fold increase. In the early days, Nasdaq was in the process of moving beyond a trading utility for non-listed OTC stocks into a distinctly recognized and branded stock market. Companies listed on Nasdaq tended to be fairly new and smaller in size, compared to the companies on NYSE or AMEX. Nasdaq's largest component was a relatively new company, Intel (IPO in 1980), with a market cap of $3.5 billion. The second and third largest were MCI and Apple, with market caps of $2.3 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. The smallest components had market caps in the range of $200 million. (By contrast, the smallest issuers in the index as of December 31, 2014 had market caps exceeding $7 billion.)It is no secret that the Nasdaq-100 is commonly viewed as the \u201cTechnology Index.\u201d In 1985, Technology was the largest, single Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB) in the Nasdaq-100, but the 23 Technology components only made up 25% of the market cap of the index. Technology was followed by Consumer Services at 21% and Industrials at 15%. The following table shows the percentage of index weight made up by Technology stocks, as well as the second largest industry by weight over the years.At the beginning of the 1990s, the Technology weight had increased to 31%, and by the middle of the decade, when the tech boom was well underway, it was up to 57%. November 1998 is noteworthy for two reasons: the continued acceleration of the bull market and the special rebalance of index weights mentioned above. At that time, Technology stocks accounted for 70% of the market cap of the index. The rebalancing reduced that weight to 61%, the value shown in the table. By the start of 2003, the market bubble had burst, but the weighting of Technology stocks remained high. The sector that saw a major decline was Telecom, which experienced a dramatic shift from about 15% down to 2% of the total weighting.The current index is still solidly Technology weighted, led by issuers such as Apple, Microsoft (), Google (), Intel and Facebook (). Still, the Nasdaq-100 is by no means a pure technology index. In fact, the current technology weight is comparatively low by historical standards. Some of the top non-technology components include:\u00a0\u00a0Nasdaq, itself a relatively new market, is generally thought of as the home for younger, growth-oriented companies. For example, 25% of the index weight for the Nasdaq-100 is from components incorporated before 1985. Half the index weight is from components incorporated after 1993, and 25% of the weight is from companies incorporated after 2000. The following table shows summary statistics for the three-year average revenue growth. The sales growth of the Nasdaq-100 components is higher on average than that of the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), but there is much more variability among these components.But, what does this all mean for the end investor? While the Nasdaq Composite Index is more widely cited in the media as a standard benchmark, the Nasdaq-100 is much more widely used as the basis for tradable products. The index has been specifically structured to promote the creation of tradable products in two ways. First, the index has a comparatively small number of components, each of which is a highly liquid security compared with indexes of 500 or 2000 components. Second, to meet diversification standards, the weighting system uses an as-needed modified market cap approach to prevent a single stock or group of stocks from having too much weight.In the late 1990s, Nasdaq began to consider the possibility of developing an exchange traded fund (ETF) patterned after the successful SPDR S&P 500 ETF that was launched in 1993. Following a slight change in the index\u2019s methodology due to tax regulations to support financial products, Nasdaq introduced the  in March 1999. At launch, the Nasdaq Stock Market was the ETF sponsor, a role that would be transferred to Invesco PowerShares in 2007. The QQQ ETF experienced astonishing growth during its first few months of operation, a clear sign showcasing investor demand for accessing a highly-liquid basket of Nasdaq companies as well as a harbinger of the forthcoming growth in the number of exchange traded products.On March 10, 1999, QQQ was launched with a per-share net asset value of about $100. At the close of that day, the fund had about $15 million in assets. By the end of March that figure had risen to $658 million. \u201cThe Qs,\u201d as it had become known, surpassed $1 billion by the middle of April and rapidly grew to over $2 billion by the middle of August. By the time of the market peak in March 2000, fund assets reached $10 billion. The ETF did a 2-for-1 split at that time, an interesting irony in light of the forthcoming market drop.The fund grew rapidly from fall 2000 through spring 2001 in spite of the market meltdown occurring at the time. It may be conjectured that the demand from investors for the ETF was far beyond that as a buy-and-hold investment vehicle. The ETF ended up being used as a hedging or speculation vehicle for traders wanting exposure to \u201ctech\u201d stocks. Evidence in this regard can be seen by looking at the \u201cturnover,\u201d defined as the dollar value of trading divided by the value of the fund. From September 2000 through April 2001, the daily turnover of the ETF averaged about 17%, an astonishingly high number for a single security. (By comparison, the daily turnover of the most active common stocks may average only 1-2%.) It is clear that QQQ, as has been the case for some other ETFs, has become a useful trading vehicle as well as investment vehicle.Currently, there are 46 ETPs tracking the Nasdaq-100 accounting for approximately $50 billion in assets. These products support a wide variety of investment objectives and range from using different index weightings, leveraged strategies, and derivatives and can be found in 13 countries including China and Singapore. The index has truly become a global staple of the financial markets, showcasing the enduring relevance of a rules-based benchmark that tracks innovative, growth-oriented companies.Going forward, investors can expect to see new products that are tied to the index, particularly as the ETF industry continues on a path of rapid expansion to one day potentially rivaling the asset base of mutual funds. And, just as the index has evolved into the world\u2019s preeminent large cap growth index over the past 30 years, the Nasdaq-100 will continue to be home to companies at the very forefront of their industries for decades to come.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["n trading on Wednesday, shares of PACCAR Inc.

Plunging fuel prices and easy credit conditions were other factors directly powering good times for these companies. This trend is likely to continue into this year as well with major automakers reporting strong January sales numbers, according to research firm Autodata Corp.During January, all of the Detroit Three automakers reported sales increases in the double digits year-over-year. Trucks and SUVs led the sales gains, fuelled by cheap gasoline prices, which have hit $2-per gallon. This, in turn, has raised demand for these vehicles, in turn pushing up margins and transaction prices. Overall, truck and SUV sales increased 19.3% making up 54% of total sales.General Motors Company (  ) experienced an 18% year-over-year increase in sales. Most of these gains have come from truck and SUV models introduced last summer. At this time, fuel prices were just beginning to move lower. Over January, SUV and pickup truck sales have jumped 36% and 43%, respectively.Additionally, sales increased 15% for Ford Motor Co. (  ) last month. The company experienced its highest level of January sales for its F-series pick-up trucks in more than 10 years. Meanwhile, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (  ) experienced a 14% jump in sales during last month.However, this sales spike came at the expense of a loss in sales for more fuel-efficient cars. President Obama had aimed to have 1 million electric vehicles on U.S. roads by the end of this year. But this looks increasingly distant because of plunging fuel prices. One of the cars Obama had cited as a model for the industry, the Chevrolet Volt, suffered a 41% loss in sales during the period.Similarly, sales for Tesla Motors, Inc.'s (  ) Model S came in flat, while Nissan Motor Co.'s electric car Leaf experienced a 14.5% decline. It seems that tax breaks and large installed production facilities for such vehicles are failing to spur production. This is also borne out by the composition of sales. While passenger car sales have increased 7.7%, electric vehicles comprise less than 1% of these sales.Auto companies outside the U.S. are finding it difficult to remain profitable in most countries except China. Additionally, the rise of the dollar has helped importers mop up profits. Margins for cars imported from Europe and Asia have improved. This in turn has helped the likes of Subaru, the automobile division of Fuji Heavy Industries and BMW AG.Meanwhile, Toyota Motor Corp. (  ) has also experienced impressive sales during January. Sales for its three U.S. brands increased 16% during January. U.S. sales of Hyundai Motor Co. improved 1% year-over-year while Nissan reported a 15% jump in sales last month.Below we present two stocks which will gain from these trends, each of which also has a good Zacks Rank.

Its product portfolio consists of a full range of models from passenger cars and minivans to trucks as well as related parts and accessories.Apart from a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Toyota has expected earnings growth of 15.2%. It has a P/E (F1) of 10.05x.Last month's performance indicates that this year will be a particularly good one for the auto industry. Meanwhile, oil prices continue to decline even as the job market improves. Given these factors, adding these stocks to your portfolio would be a prudent choice.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

The latest numbers from Gallup indicate that 46% of those surveyed like the way Obama is handling his presidency. A gradually resurgent economy and falling  seem to have delivered a much-needed boost to his administration. However, the details in the data indicate why he has lost the approval of Congress as a whole in the recently held midterm elections.It now emerges that the middle class may account for the lowest percentage of people who approve of his presidency. Expectedly enough, 52% of those earning under $2,000 per month approve of the way President Obama functions. However, the lowest approval percentage doesn't come from the rich as was widely expected, but from the middle class. Only 44% of those earning between $5,000 and $7,499 per month approve of the job he is doing.This may seem counterintuitive at the outset, but not upon deeper reflection. Undoubtedly, Obama's administration has done much to address the middle-class' priorities. This includes improving elemantary and high school-level education and consumer protection, as well as lowering the cost of healthcare and college education. However, this may have done little to please this section of the populace because of one factor which outweighs all others: stagnant wage growth.Despite an improving job market, wage growth remains slower than inflation. Official government data indicates that the average U.S. household is only as well off as one in the last years of the 20 th century. Wages and income increased at a sluggish pace over the last decade before slumping during the financial crisis.There are several reasons for the current situation. Globalization has led to competition with workers across the world. Additionally, improvements in technology have led to a lower human participation rate. While the rest of the world improves its educational standards, a slowdown in educational attainment is taking place in the U.S. Meanwhile, economic power is incrementally moving toward executives and away from workers.The Obama administration proposes to tax wealthy individuals and mop up nearly $320 billion over a period of 10 years. This will be done by raising the highest rate on capital gains. Additionally, capital gains tax will be imposed on transfers made at death. The White House has characterized the current situation on this account as \"the largest capital gains loophole.\"The proceeds will be utilized to increase tax credits on higher education and child care and provide tax relief for double income households. For example, a tax credit of $500 will provided to married couples if both spouses are working. Further, the maximum tax credit for child care up to $300 for children below five years of age will be increased three-fold. A number of education tax credits will be consolidated into one single tax break of $2,500. These are among some of the new provisions being proposed.Despite a hostile Congress, it is possible that common ground may be found on the tax breaks.

Crude prices have fallen in excess of $60 since June to near $45 levels. Now, Societe Generale SA, Bank of America Corporation (  ) and The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (  ) say that prices need to remain around the $40 level during 1H15. This is essential for the oil industry so as to prevent further investment which would add to oversupply.Soceite Generale SA believes that prices will fall below $40 during 1H15. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs had reduced its three-month price forecast for West Texas Intermediate (\"WTI\") to $41 per barrel from $70 and Brent crude price forecast to $42 per barrel from $80. For six-months, WTI price forecasts have dropped to $39 from $75.Moreover, it has reduced full-year 2015 estimates for WTI and Brent to $47.15 and $50.40 from $73.75 and $83.75 respectively. The investment management firm believes that crude prices should remain low for a long period in order to ease out the supply glut.Following the projection cuts, WTI crude fell about 5% to $46 per barrel, a six-year low. Brent crude also fell nearly 6% to about $47.Prince Alwaleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia has said that a $100 price for oil may never again be witnessed globally. The Saudi prince has said that countries \"were caught off guard\" by the steep fall in prices. He added that the decline was a not a result of OPEC's actions in 2014.Further, he defended his country's decision to maintain output at current levels. Meanwhile, in an attempt to increase its presence in the U.S. market, Saudi Aramco, the state oil firm, had lowered crude's selling price to Northwest Europe by $1.50 for February, the fifth consecutive monthly cut.The decline in prices has impacted the U.S., especially those companies engaged in production of shale oil though fracking. Stocks such as Chevron Corp. (  ) and Exxon Mobil (  ) have taken a pounding. This is expected to continue, with Texas in particular expected to slip into a recession in the near future.However, consumers are expected to benefit from a decline in oil prices. Given the fact that 70% of the country's GDP is attributable to consumer spending, this phenomenon could result in an increase of 1% in GDP. This is because discretionary spending will increase.Auto sales may already have picked up due to the slump in oil prices. Car sales in 2014 increased 5.9% for the industry as a whole. According to WardsAuto.com, it has also caused consumers to opt for cars which have lower fuel efficiency. In 2014, trucks and SUVs contributed 52.1% of total vehicle sales. This is a significant increase over the 47.3% witnessed in 2009.Additionally, average fuel economy for light vehicles is on the decline. This metric has declined to 24.7 miles per gallon (MPG) in December, the lowest level recorded since 2013. In 2014's spring average fuel economy had touched a high point which was in excess of 25 MPGs.Fuel costs account for a considerable portion of expenses of trucking companies. The U.S. trucking industry is currently poised to benefit from two ways. Lower oil prices will reduce their operating expenditure, thereby boosting the bottom-line. On the other hand, capacity constraint in the form of driver shortage and new government regulations will drive top-line growth.A decline in oil prices is probably even more crucial for airlines. Lower jet fuel prices have been a boon for the airline industry given the inversely proportional relation between crude prices and the value of aviation stocks. This has benefited airline stocks immensely as the cut in oil prices has reduced their operating expenses significantly, thereby aiding the bottom line.Below we present three stocks which will gain from these trends, each of which also has a good Zacks Rank. (  ) is primarily a trucking company which has two operating segments. Celadon has two operating segments, the asset-based segment and an asset-light segment.

State legislators across the country have considered whether to allow direct sales by automakers. Last year, Pennsylvania's Governor signed legislation allowing Tesla to open five dealerships in the state. However, Michigan's Governor signed a legislation banning direct car sales by automakers in the state. The law mandates that new vehicles need to be purchased from dealerships. According to Tesla, this law will adversely affect consumers in the state as dealers will increase the prices of vehicles.Tesla also faced issues related to direct selling in Massachusetts. In 2014, the state's highest court rejected a lawsuit demanding a ban on direct sales of Tesla. Currently, the automaker sells its vehicles at a mall in Natick, MA. Tesla has faced sales restrictions in New Jersey and Missouri, as well.Tesla argues that a ban on direct sales will help dealers create a monopoly.

In Nov 2014, the automaker admitted that it had failed to report 1,729 complaints for deaths and injuries, recorded from Jul 2003 through Jun 2014. Honda also failed to report warranty claims and claims registered under customer satisfaction campaigns during the same 11-year period.As a result, the company will be paying two $35 million fines, totaling $70 million. This will be the largest fine paid by any automaker as a result of an investigation conducted by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA). The first $35 million fine is due to the automaker's failure to report the death and injury complaints, and the other $35 million fine has been imposed for not reporting the warranty and customer satisfaction claims. Both these fines are the maximum that the government can impose.The complaints were mainly related to the faulty air bags produced by Japanese auto supplier, Takata Corp., along with a few other defective parts. Since 2008, Honda has recalled more than 5 million vehicles in the U.S. to fix the airbag issue. The air bags manufactured by Takata have an inflator that was produced with a faulty part. Thus, when an air bag is deployed, the inflator can explode and shoot out metal fragments into the vehicle.Automakers are supposed to report the NHTSA about any defects, deaths and injuries, or damage and warranty claims made by consumers as soon as possible. The safety regulators consider delay in reporting as a major offence as it hampers their agenda of protecting the public and may even lead to deaths. They also consider that this amount of fine is quite low and should be increased to $300 million.Under the present Early Warning Reporting system, automakers are required to provide quarterly updates on deaths, injuries and warranty claims related to any potential defects. These are then investigated and it is decided whether a recall is needed. In 2014, the NHTSA had imposed fines of more than $126 million due to violation of this law by automakers. Honda is now taking steps to improve upon the shortcomings and has started new training programs for its workers.Last May, General Motors Co.

Last quarter, it posted a surprise of -25.5%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.General Motors's global sales in the third quarter of 2014 rose 2% year over year to 2,449,595 vehicles. The improvement was driven by the company's upbeat performance in China and U.S. together with improved market traction of the Opel brand and launch of vehicles.However, General Motors has been facing the brunt of a delayed recall involving 2.6 million vehicles with defective ignition switches. The company has increased the approved death claims associated with the recall to 27 with apprehensions of a further rise. Kenneth Feinberg, who was hired by the company to assess death claims and deploy funds, stated that nearly 151 other fatality claims are presently under review. Consequently, General Motors is anticipating incurring costs of around $0.4-$0.6 billion. However, the expenses can scale even higher.In addition, General Motors has been recalling vehicles in large numbers. The automaker has announced 75 recalls covering about 30 million vehicles in only North America so far this year. Owing to the series of recalls made, the company recorded a $2.5 billion charge for recall-related repairs in the first half of 2014.Our proven model does not conclusively show that General Motors is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. Earnings ESP represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. General Motors' Most Accurate estimate stands at 93 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 96 cents. Hence, the difference stands at -3.13% for the company. General Motors has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:PACCAR Inc. (  ) has an earnings ESP of +1.04% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). PACCAR will be reporting third-quarter 2014 earnings on Oct 28.Meritor, Inc. (  ) has an earnings ESP of +37.5% and a Zacks Rank #3.

The company reported a +1.67% earnings surprise in the last quarter.Cummins' earnings per share increased 10.5% to $2.43 in the second quarter of 2014 from $2.20 in the year-ago quarter. Earnings also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.39 per share. Net income came in at $446 million compared with $414 million in the second quarter of 2013.For 2014, Cummins raised the revenue guidance to 8-11% from the previous projection of 6-10%. The upside was driven by improving North American on-highway demand and synergies from distributor acquisitions. Meanwhile, Cummins expects its 2014 EBIT margin in the 12.75-13.25% range. The company also anticipates earnings to increase at a higher rate than revenues and expects product launches to enhance profitability.Cummins is focused on enhancing shareholders' value by pursuing aggressive share repurchases and increasing dividend payouts. The company has committed to return 50% of its full-year operating cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In Jul 2014, Cummins' board authorized a share repurchase of up to $1 billion after the completion of the current $1 billion program. Cummins also announced a 25% increase in dividend to $0.78. The company has returned $659 million to shareholders in the first half of 2014.Moreover, Cummins is positioned to benefit from planned acquisitions. The company plans to acquire its North American distributors, which is expected to generate incremental revenues of $500 million and increase earnings per share by 30 cents.However, weakness in the operating markets is considerably affecting the results of Cummins. The company is witnessing a challenging situation in China and Brazil and apprehends lower truck production in the countries in 2014.Cummins also operates in a highly competitive environment.

The Eurozone has been struggling with slowing growth, deflation threats and double-digit unemployment.The study, conducted between Sep 22 and Oct 1, revelead that 51% of the participants feared the slowdown in the Eurozone will have a \"significant\" or \"minor\" adverse effect on their businesses. While 46% still believed it will not have any impact, just 3% believes the Eurozone trouble will have a positive effect. The number of businesses worried about the Eurozone has now increased from a similar July poll. Then, 62% were confident that the global concerns would have no effect on their businesses.The slowing European economy threatens US firms with high sales exposure to the Old Continent. For example, a good deal of material companies, including the likes of E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (  ) and The Dow Chemical Company (  ), earn revenues from the Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region. While cyclical stocks too look to be affected, certain defensive stocks and particularly the food, beverage & tobacco stocks deriving most of their revenues from the region may be in a bad spot.Nonetheless, investors need not worry if they can identify the risks now and adjust their portfolios accordingly. Before helping investors focus on some of those stocks, let's look into the European growth concerns in detail.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expressed concern over stagnant growth in the Eurozone in its latest global economic outlook. Weakness in the Eurozone has also led the IMF to downgrade its global economic growth forecast this year.According to the IMF, the Eurozone's probability of re-entering a recession in the next six months has nearly doubled to 38% since April. This is more than rest of the world's chance of 33%. There is also a 30% possibility of the Eurozone sliding into deflation during the same period. IMF stated inflation in the Eurozone has moved south, \"indicating risks of outright deflation or a protracted period of very low inflation.\"Additionally, IMF expects the Eurozone's GDP to grow a meager 0.8% in 2014. This is way below the U.S. and Britain's projected growth rate of 2.2% and 3.2%, respectively.\n  \nMeanwhile, the Eurozone's business expanded at the slowest rate this year in September. The final composite PMI for the Eurozone touched a 10-month low of 52, last month. Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: \"The PMI suggests the Eurozone economy remained stuck in a rut in the third quarter.\"Another survey by Sentix showed investor sentiment in the Eurozone was negative 13.7 in October, hitting the lowest level since May 2013.Economic data from Germany, France, Italy, among others, have also been weak. Germany, the Eurozone powerhouse, reported biggest drop in industrial output since 2009, also Markit's retail purchasing managers' index (PMI) showed Germany's retail sector scored 47.1 in September, worst level in the last 53 months.Growth worries in major economic blocks have negatively impacted their respective currencies. Most of these currencies have become weaker against the U.S. dollar as economic growth in the U.S. has outperformed the sluggish growths in these major economies.The latest minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) Sep 16-17 meeting noted that while stronger dollar will make U.S. exports less competitive by inflating export prices, it will also reduce import prices. This is quite evident from declining trend in import prices over the past three months.The Fed minutes noted: \"Some participants expressed concern that the persistent shortfall of economic growth and inflation in the euro area could lead to a further appreciation of the dollar and have adverse effects on the US external sector.\" (Read:  )The weakness threatens the US companies having high sales exposure to the continent. The study we spoke of earlier by the National Association for Business Economics also revealed that less numbers of corporate are upbeat about their third quarter sales. Only 49% of respondents said that their sales improved from July through September. This is a significant drop from the second quarter sales increase of 57%.Things were a lot better in the second quarter as Europe made little impact then. In fact, FactSet had reported that more than 70% companies reporting revenues from Europe had score yearly improvements. However, the situation now seems to be on the dismal side and companies having high sales exposure may face trouble.Let's look at some US firms deriving a significant portion of their sales from Europe. : Nike, Inc.'s (  ) impressive $7,982 million sales in first quarter 2015 saw a 26.4% contribution from Europe. McDonald's Corp.'s (  ) second quarter comparable sales had declined 1.0% and operating income remained flat in Europe. August's comparable sales decreased 0.7% in August in Europe, wherein UK offset weakness in Russia.The Coca-Cola Company (  ) reported net operating revenues of $12, 574 million in second quarter 2014, of which 12.5% was contributed by Europe. Coca-Cola will release third quarter numbers on Oct 21.Of the $1,797 million second quarter net sales for Owens-Illinois, Inc. (  ), Europe had contributed $790 million, or about 44%. Philip Morris International, Inc.'s (  ) third quarter net revenue dropped 0.9% to $7,856 million. Of the total revenue, European Union accounted for 30% and Eastern Europe, Middle East & Africa contributed 31%.In addition to the grim European economic condition, consumer spending environment, foreign exchange headwinds and declining unit volumes have been affecting the consumer sector.Nike is the only stock among the ones discussed here that carries a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). While McDonald's and Coca-Cola carry a Zacks Rank #4, Owens-Illinois and Philip Morris currently hold a Zacks Rank#5 (Strong Sell).

Dow Chemical will release results on Oct 22. Caterpillar Inc. (  ) reported a 17% plunge in August sales in Europe, Africa and the Middle East (EAME). Caterpillar will release third quarter earnings report on Oct 23.While Caterpillar and Dow Chemical carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) now, DuPont carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Separately, automobile giant Ford Motor Co.'s (  ) second quarter revenues of $35.3 billion had a 22.7% contribution from Europe. Premium truck manufacturer PACCAR Inc. (  ) reported second quarter 2014 revenues of $4,569 million. Of these, Europe had accounted for 25.3%.Ford carries a Zacks Rank #5 and PACCAR has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). While Ford is scheduled to release its next earnings numbers on Oct 24, PACCAR will release results on Oct 28.The prevailing situation seems to be an almost replica of what happened exactly two years back. Back in Oct 2012, Europe's economic woes was blamed to be among the ones affecting US corporate earnings. China's economy too back then was going through troubled waters, but US firms recognized Europe to be the weakest link.So, investors should keep an eye on the stocks having high exposure to Europe. Coupled with that, the Zacks Ranks may help investors to identify the potential losers and gainers.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We'd like to hope so, but there might be some big roadblocks between Cummins and its goals. We recently looked at  , but it's important to consider all the angles of a stock before diving in. Let's dig deep into Cummins today to find some threats to its continued success and determine if they're enough to keep its shares from growing in the future.Cummins' engine segment accounts for roughly 60% of its revenue in any given year, which makes its performance vital to the company's continued success. Sales spiked after suffering through the recession, but have declined in each fiscal year since 2011:\n  \nSources: Cummins annual reports.Cummins still expects engine segment revenue in the 6% to 8% range this year, but that would merely bring that segment back in line with its position in 2012.The company has enjoyed rapid growth in China over the past few years, but executives noted in their latest quarterly conference call that industry demand for heavy- and medium-duty trucks dipped by 10% in the second quarter, with significant softening in year-over-year demand in May and June (11% and 20% lower, respectively). China is Cummins' second-largest market after the U.S., and the country accounted for 7% of the company's total revenue last year, so any prolonged sales weakness there would have a large impact on Cummins' performance.Several of the truck makers that comprise the bulk of Cummins' engine sales are also shifting toward more in-house engine production, and other truck makers that have historically focused on building their own engines are gaining share in the overall truck market. , which primarily uses its own engines, and its Mack truck subsidiary, which exclusively features in-house engines, grew their combined market share to 17.5% last year, up from 16.5% a year earlier.  , which has long been a major user of Cummins engines, accounted for 7.9% of the engine market in 2013, up from just 5.2% the year before. PACCAR's MX line of engines claimed 35% of the North American market for 13-liter engines, according to company executives during their latest conference call. The company is targeting 50% share in the MX's engine classes, which certainly poses a threat to Cummins' continued growth if PACCAR's move toward more in-house engine production accelerates.Cummins' fundamentals have boomed and its shares have tripled over the past five years as the trucking industry slowly but steadily recovers from the financial crisis. In fact, Cummins' growth matches rather closely with the overall growth of heavy- and medium-duty truck assemblies (new units built) over the past five years: data by  .Why is that a risk? Well, the automotive industry, particularly commercial truck manufacturing, is sensitive to economic shifts, and no economic expansion can continue forever. The truck assemblies statistic dates to the late 1970s, and while the most recent period of expansion still records significantly fewer units than the pre-crash period, it's also one of the longest periods of uninterrupted volume growth in more than 30 years: data by  .On the plus side, history shows that the truck assemblies statistic has historically been well on its way to a bottom by the time recessions are officially declared, and the current period of expansion shows no sign of reversal yet. But even the roaring '90s endured a stretch of declining volume, so unless this time really is different, Cummins could find itself at the mercy of macroeconomics in the near future.Commercial transportation today is more or less the same as trucking 50 years ago. Routes might be mapped by computers and shipments tightly controlled by algorithm, but the basic outlines of getting stuff from point A to point B haven't changed since entrepreneurs realized that the nation's highways were a great way to move goods. That might change in the next few years in ways that could devastate Cummins' core business.Electric vehicles have received a great deal of attention, but virtually all of it has been focused on the consumer side. There's a good reason for that: Trucks and other heavy-duty vehicles are on the road for long hours, pulling large loads, while the typical car owner drives less than half an hour at a time and might never haul anything heavier than a load of groceries. Thus far, all efforts to develop commercial transportation on an electric drivetrain have failed. But battery-powered commercial transport is bound to get a big push as electric successes from  and other well-known manufacturers establish the viability of electric transportation in the public mind. This is years down the line, but it could be a long-term threat to Cummins' internal-combustion engines.Cummins is already developing alternative-fuel engines with  (Nasdaq: WPRT), but slow adoption rates for these natural gas engines --  -- show the clearer near-term challenge in moving the world away from its reliance on diesel fuel for truck-based transport. Cummins could also branch out into EV development on its own, but this is an area where it has no technological expertise and no clear path forward. The company's move into nat-gas engines was a natural extension of its work on diesel engines, but it's yet to show a similar interest or aptitude in EV development.Self-driving vehicles are another significant long-term danger to Cummins' growth. While this might not seem to be a problem, one simply has to consider the limitations of human-driven trucks to see why an automated trucking fleet would dent Cummins' bottom line.  , and the general consensus among those who have analyzed this technology's potential is that it would likely result in far fewer vehicles on the road.Trucks today are limited by the ability of their human drivers to navigate large containers full of goods down busy highways. To protect truck drivers and other drivers on the road, the government has lately been implementing several tough restrictions on truckers' work, including a mandate for speed limiters on large trucks, and a workweek restriction that forces truckers to drive no more than 60 hours per seven days and to take 34 hours off if they reach this limit earlier in the week. Truck designs must also take human sensory limitations into consideration.Trucks that drive themselves would have no such restrictions -- a self-driving truck could be on the road 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and could haul multiple trailers that could individually adapt to road conditions as necessary. That would mean that fewer trucks, and thus fewer Cummins engines, would be on the road at any given time, since the entire trucking fleet could operate at maximum efficiency. Trucks are in use far more often than cars, but even so, it's worth considering that even the most dedicated truck drivers in the United States are only  to be on the road for 40% of the hours in any given week. If every truck were active the other 60% of the time, we wouldn't need as many of them to handle the same amount of shipment volume.If self-driving trucks become a reality -- and the arguments against this continue to dwindle year by year -- Cummins' business would be at real risk. This threat is the most distant among those cited in this article, but it's also potentially the most dangerous.Two of these risks pose a near-term threat to Cummins' continued gains, but the third risk, while set farther in the future, could present an existential threat to a company that was built around an engine that rose to prominence more than a century ago. Cummins has weathered economic downturns many times before, but it has never yet faced a technological challenge that could actually usurp diesel engines as the prime mover of commercial transportation. Will this risk be enough to hold shares down, or will Cummins find a way to thrive in a new transportation reality, whatever that reality might look like in the end? A major technological shift is happening in the automotive industry. Most people are skeptical about its impact. Warren Buffett isn't one of them. He recently called it a \"real threat\" to one of his favorite businesses. An executive at Ford called the technology \"fantastic.\" The beauty for investors is that there is an  this megatrend.  to access our exclusive report on this stock.The article  originally appeared on Fool.com.Copyright \u00a9 1995 - 2014 The Motley Fool, LLC.

Earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 89 cents.Net income surged 9.5% to $319.2 million from $291.6 million in the year-ago quarter. The improvement was led by higher truck sales in the U.S. and Canada, along with better global results for aftermarket parts and financial services. Revenues rose 6% to $4.57 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.45 billion.PACCAR has a strong market share in the U.S. and Canada.

Class 8 industry retail sales are also expected to increase to 230,000-250,000 vehicles in the U.S. and Canada in 2014 from 212,000 in 2013 due to the ongoing replacement of the aging truck population, economic growth and higher fleet capacity.Moreover, PACCAR expects the demand for heavy-duty trucks in South America to range between 140,000-150,000 units in 2014, up from 149,000 units in 2013. Further, it is expanding in key non-U.S. markets and deploying capital regularly to boost earnings.However, PACCAR faces intense competition in the commercial trucks market and the Financial Services segment.

And for technical investors there is some hope when looking at PCAR given that, according to its RSI reading of 23.11, it is now in oversold territory.RSI stands for 'Relative Strength Index' and it is a popular indicator used by technically focused investors. It compares the average of gains in days that closed up to the average of losses in days that closed down; readings above 70 suggest an asset is overbought, while an RSI below 30 suggests undervalued conditions are present.Yet, PCAR's low RSI value isn't the only reason to have some optimism over a coming turnaround, as there has been plenty of positive earnings estimate revision activity as of late. This is especially true when investors take a deep dive into some of these estimate revision stats and recent changes to PACCAR's earnings consensus.Over the past two months, investors have seen 1 earnings estimate revision move higher, compared with none lower, at least when looking at the key current year time frame. And the consensus estimate for PCAR has also been on an upward trend over the past 60 days, as estimates have risen from $3.65/share two months ago to just $3.66/share right now.If this wasn't enough, PACCAR also has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) which puts it into rare company among its peers.

After gaining nearly 32% in 2013, the stock has been surprisingly flattish this year.Source: Cummins.Interestingly, there has been no major setback to Cummins' business in recent months, nor have the company's development plans hit a hurdle. In fact, Cummins is a lot more optimistic about its business conditions today than it was at the start of the year. So what's holding its shares back?Cummins' operational performance so far this year leaves no room for complaints. The company raised its 2014 revenue guidance in  of the past two quarters, encouraged by 9% growth in its top line during the first half of the year. Cummins now sees its full-year revenue growing between 8% and 11% versus its earlier projection of 4% to 8% growth.Perhaps investors haven't taken too kindly to Cummins' cautious margin outlook. Despite the upward revisions in revenue, the company left its operating margin guidance unchanged at 12.75% to 13.25% for the year, which is only marginally better than its 2013 EBIT margin of 12.5%.That may sound uninspiring, but I'm not too worried. Going by the ongoing strength in Cummins' key end market, trucking, it looks like the company is only being conservative, and that there's a fair chance that it will end the year on a brighter note. Delving deeper into the company's financials, you'll realize that power generation is its only business that's showing some signs of weakness. Take a look at the table below, which shows Cummins' 2014 projections for each of its segments.\n  \nSource: Cummins' Q2 earnings presentation.Nevertheless, a weak power generation business shouldn't hurt Cummins much since it contributes less than 15% to the company's total revenue. Moreover, even a slight uptick in demand from key international markets like China and India could boost sales from the division. Meanwhile, the company's primary businesses -- engines and components -- should find easy avenues to grow, thanks primarily to the ongoing strength in the trucking industry.Trucks make up more than 60% of Cummins' engine sales, and nearly 46% of the company's components products, such as emission solutions, filtration, and fuel systems, go into its own engines.

And the company has a clear objective in mind: Even in a low-growth scenario, it expects to hit $25 billion in revenue and 16% in operating margin by 2018. For perspective, Cummins generated $17.3 billion in revenue and 12.5% EBIT margin last year.Long story short, Cummins' operational performance doesn't warrant weakness in its share price. Perhaps its numbers didn't meet Street expectations, but you know better than to read too much into analysts' estimates. As a company that dominates the global diesel engine market and is making headway in the natural-gas market, Cummins remains a compelling growth story,  get stricter.But perhaps the biggest reason to get bullish about Cummins is its close connection with the industry that nearly  : trucking. As long as Cummins remains a key supplier to trucking companies, it should continue to grow. And there's no reason that growth story shouldn't reflect in Cummins' share price going forward.

While the proportion of subprime loans to total auto loans is significantly lower than 25-30% in the pre-recession period, it is still a concern due to the fact that auto loans rank third among loan groups, following mortgages and student loans, in terms of America's outstanding debt.Moreover, originations of subprime auto loans (loans to borrowers with credit scores below 620) are increasing at a faster pace compared to the rest of the auto loans. Originations of loans to the other credit score groups increased merely 50% since 2009. In fact, auto loan originations to the super-prime group (borrowers with credit scores above 759) increased only 43.1% to $27.9 billion in the second quarter of 2014 from $19.5 billion at the end of 2009.A majority of the subprime auto loan originations can be attributed to auto finance companies. In fact, these companies issued three times the dollar value of subprime loans issued by banks during the second quarter of 2014. Needless to say, this is helping boost sales of the associated auto companies.Easy availability of auto loans with lower interest rates and longer repayment periods is one of the chief reasons for the rising U.S. auto sales. Auto loan balances (including leases) have been increasing consistently in the past 13 quarters and auto loan originations in the second quarter of 2014 climbed to an eight-year high. Buoyed by this, U.S. auto sales on a seasonally adjusted annualized rate (SAAR) remained above the 16 million mark in the last 5 months. In fact, in Jun 2014, the SAAR of sales reached 17 million for the first time since Jul 2006.As the automobile industry is a major contributor to the U.S. economic growth, improving auto sales is also benefiting the overall U.S. economy. However, concerns about the subprime auto loans are rising.Recently, federal prosecutors started a civil investigation into the matter. They are concerned that auto loans are possibly being issued without adequate background checks and adherence to standards. They are also looking into possible violations of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act.Earlier this month, General Motors Co. (  ) received a subpoena as a part of this investigation, requesting documents related to the origination and the securitization of subprime loan contracts since 2007. The United States attorney for the Southern District of New York will consider other auto companies as a part of the investigation as well, per media reports. Most major auto and truck manufacturers such as General Motors, Ford Motor Co. (  ), Toyota Motor Corp. (  ), Honda Motor Co. Ltd. (  ), PACCAR Inc. (  ) and Tesla Motors Inc. (  ) provide financing and leasing to customers.While subprime auto loan originations are increasing rapidly, so are the total auto loan originations. Consequently, the proportion of subprime auto loan originations to total auto loan originations has not increased significantly. Moreover, the 90-day delinquency rates for auto loans is only 3.3%, on par with home equity lines of credit and lower than all the other loan groups as well as the average delinquency rate.In fact, economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York believe that the increase in subprime auto loans is not extreme, given the rising auto sales. They also reason that since subprime auto loans witnessed the maximum decline during the recession, the present rise in this loan group is more pronounced than other groups.Thus, the increasing subprime auto loans should not pose any abnormal risk unless their proportion to total auto loans starts increasing significantly or the civil investigation reveals any major negligence in conforming to loan standards.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks ?

In 2014, the momentum has slowed, but the stock is still up more than 2.2% as of this writing, which shows that investors feel upbeat about the stock and the company's future prospects. This is not surprising given the company's strong operating performance in the first half -- revenues were up 9% to $8.95 billion and net profits were up 12% to $593.1 million. These results are backed by some very favorable developments like improving prospects in the domestic truck segment, encouraging performance in the Parts segment, and the flurry of new products that PACCAR is bringing to the market. Let's dig deeper. The heavy- and medium-duty truck market is booming in North America. This is great news for PACCAR, which holds a 28% market share in the heavy-duty Class 8 segment in the U.S. and Canada. Industrywide sales for Class 8 trucks surged 33.1% in August to 19,627 units, from 15,288 units last year. This led to big sales gains for most truck makers. PACCAR's sales increased a healthy 28.6% in the month. In the first eight months of 2014, deliveries for Class 8 trucks in the U.S. have climbed 18.7% to 138,210, from 116,468 in the year-ago period.Demand is fueled by replacement of old trucks and also some fleet expansion as domestic manufacturing activity gathers steam.  August purchasing managers' index, or PMI, increased 3.3% to 59, the best-ever level since the 59.1 recorded in March 2011, signaling a recovering U.S. economy. The PMI is calculated by taking into account different indicators for orders, production, employment, deliveries, and inventories.PACCAR executive vice president Dan Sobic said, \"Our customers are benefiting from record levels of freight tonnage, good freight rates, and the excellent operating efficiency of the new Kenworth and Peterbilt trucks for the on-highway and vocational segments.\" Sobic expects industrywide sales of Class 8 trucks to range between 230,000 and 250,000 units in 2014, compared to 185,000 units in 2013.PACCAR has 16 parts-distribution centers to provide after-sales support to over 2,000 DAF, Kenworth, and Peterbilt dealer locations. Parts revenue rose 9% to $1.5 billion in the first six months of the year over the same period last year. During this period, the size of the parts business increased to 17% of total revenues compared to 16% in 2013 and 15% prior to that. This is having a positive impact on the company's overall profitability as the parts business carries more margins than the core trucks business. In the first six months of the year, the parts business had a pre-tax profit margin of 16%, which is more than double the 7% margin fetched by the trucks business.With higher truck production, new dealer marketing programs, improving fleet utilization, and the aging North American truck fleet, PACCAR senses a good opportunity in further expanding this business. The company plans to add more distribution capacity in the U.S., where most of the action is taking place. Construction of a 176,000-square-foot distribution center in Renton, Washington, is in the cards, which will replace an existing center with approximately half the capacity. The project is scheduled to be completed around mid-2015. According to PACCAR Parts' assistant general manager Tony McQuary in the Q2 press release, the expansion would \"more than double the distribution capacity for our dealers and customers in northwestern United States and western Canada.\"The past three years have seen PACCAR invest over $2.1 billion in new product and facility launches that are now showing results. The company has launched several new trucks in the past quarter that could boost sales in the latter half of 2014. It's rolled out the new Euro 6 CF and XF four-axle trucks and tractors for heavy-duty functions to reinforce its offerings in the container, construction, and refuse segments. These new products come at a time when buyers in Europe are \"gradually adjusting to the increased prices of Euro 6 trucks,\" according to management.PACCAR has also introduced new medium-duty Kenworth and Peterbilt brand cab-over-engine distribution trucks, which come with several refreshed exterior and interior features and improvements. The company has given special attention to increasing the turning radius and shortening the overall length of the Kenworth K270 and K370 and the Peterbilt Model 220 so that they are more efficient in city delivery services.The company has set aside around $250 million to $300 million as capex, and plans to spend $200 million to $225 million on R&D in 2014 for upgrading operations at assembly facilities and powertrain development research, implying better-quality products and services are on the way. These should help PACCAR further leverage the momentum in the truck market in North America and elsewhere.The improving manufacturing activity in the U.S. is boosting industrywide freight volumes and spurring truck demand. PACCAR is riding this trend well and turning in strong operating performances. Not only is it selling more trucks, it's also expanding its high-margin parts business to ensure a steady supply of parts and components to support dealers. The new launches provide an added incentive for buyers to upgrade their old vehicles and think about fleet additions. With these reassuring trends, PACCAR's performance could get even better with time and create more value for investors. \"Made in China\" -- an all too familiar phrase.

So when the economy is booming and you want to play the upturn, trucking stocks certainly belong in your portfolio.But is the trucking industry only about companies that build trucks? What drives the industry, and how does it work? How big is the industry, and what is its growth potential? Read on for the answers to these critical questions before taking the plunge.Put simply, trucks are large motor vehicles designed to carry cargo over long distances. Trucks are broadly classified into three classes, depending on their gross vehicle weight, as shown in the following table:\n  \nSo while most of us use the generic names, industry experts refer to trucks according to their classes.While the U.S. boasts some of the biggest truck brands in the world -- think  's Peterbilt and Kenworth,  and  's  International Truck -- European brands, especially Freightliner Trucks (a subsidiary of Daimler AG) and Volvo, have made huge headway in recent years. For perspective, Daimler and Volvo  nearly 55% of the North American heavy-duty truck market last year according to a Bloomberg report.Interestingly, none of these companies rule the global truck market today; in actuality, Chinese manufacturers take the lead. China is currently the world's largest truck market, accounting for nearly half of the heavy-duty trucks sold worldwide.Now that you know who the biggest truck makers in the world are, you must also understand that trucking is much more than just companies that manufacture and sell trucks.Truck manufacturing is only one of the components of the trucking industry. Source: PACCARTrucking is a hugely diversified industry, and freight trucking is an even bigger part of the equation than truck manufacturing. Think of companies like  ,  , and  . The amount of freight that these fleets move around is among the biggest determinants of truck demand. I'll soon tell you how big this part of the industry is -- you'll be amazed.Another key aspect of the trucking industry is the supply side. After all, trucks can't run without engines, fuel systems, axles, and other critical parts. While companies such as  and  supply a wide range of engines and components,  and others focus on specific technologies such as natural gas engine platforms.In a nutshell, you can view the trucking industry from three angles: manufacturing, supply, and services.While that's a difficult question to answer given the diversity of the industry, some facts should help you gauge its size:While truck and engine manufacturing are capital-intensive industries, transportation companies are service-based and hence more labor-intensive.Truck and engine companies spend huge amounts of money across their value chains, from research and development to manufacturing to distribution of products. Companies rely heavily on dealership networks for sales, and seasonality isn't much of a concern since demand is primarily driven by economic conditions.The trucking industry witnessed a phase of consolidation over the past two decades, with big players acquiring rivals to outgrow the competition. Thanks to cyclicality and stiff competition, truck producers have branched out, both geographically and operationally. So nearly every truck manufacturer today offers parts, value-added services like maintenance, and lease financing. In fact, truck rental and leasing is a big market today.Interestingly, the line between truck and engine manufacturers is also blurring, with most truck manufacturers having vertically integrated to produce their own engines. That has compelled engine specialists like Cummins to focus more on niche areas such as alternative-fuel engines.Manpower is a key asset for logistics companies. Source: XPO Logistics.Services are relatively non-asset-based businesses, as the key to sustainability lies in efficient execution and delivery of customer orders or packages. Logistics and transportation companies operate a mix of leased and purchased vehicles to transport goods.Some, like XPO Logistics, act only as intermediaries and subcontract transportation services to independent carriers. Therefore manpower is their biggest asset. The level of economic activity directly impacts the service side, and hence the trucking industry.The trucking industry is highly sensitive to business cycles. It's a simple equation: When the economy grows, and consumer spending and manufacturing activity gather steam, there's a greater need to move goods and haul freight. That means brisk business for logistics companies, and thus greater demand for trucks. That explains why the recession year of 2008 counts among the worst years for the U.S. trucking industry.Trucking is also one of the most regulated industries: From weight rules and emission standards for vehicles to safety and work hour policies for drivers, companies must comply with strict government rules throughout the value chain.Emission regulations, in particular, hold great significance. Every time a new emission standard comes into force, truck and engine manufacturers have to upgrade their products accordingly. That's costly, but also mandatory. Likewise, transportation companies scramble to upgrade their fleets to meet emission standards, which is why a new environmental regulation generally means greater business for truck and engine manufacturers.Cyclicality and its associated volatility may put an investor off trucking stocks, but an industry that virtually runs the economy doesn't stay under the weather for long. And with emission regulations becoming more stringent, this industry looks like a great place for investments.

I know it sounded a little strange to you, given that most people think a trade is over when you exit your position and book either a gain or a loss. However, that\u2019s far from the case. Remember that investing is a process, and only by performing this autopsy-like analysis will you understand what went right and why. How can you hope to repeat good behavior and avoid past mistakes if you don\u2019t recognize them?That\u2019s why this week I want to share with you another part of my in-depth analytical process that helps me watch for signposts along the investing road. These signposts act as confirmation points or warning flags, depending on how things are progressing in the industry, at the company, at one of its competitors or, sometimes, from an unexpected area.What I\u2019m talking about here is the pre-trade analysis. Compared to the postmortem analysis, the pre-trade analysis entails identifying those key factors that influence a company\u2019s business, recognizing the current and longer-term trends in the those drivers and what potential disruptions lie ahead.While today we have GPS navigation in many devices, this approach is much like the way many of us used to drive -- by watching the road and checking a map for markers, or even asking for directions and looking for signposts along the way. Much like those driving experiences, as you see the markers and signposts, you have a growing confidence that you are on track. If you don\u2019t see those markers, after a while you\u2019re going to wonder where you are and how far off you are.Think of it this way: if you were to construct a map that sketches out directions for a friend, you would be sure to include the key sites they would see on their way, and these would let them know they were on course or signal them that a change in direction was nearing.The same is true for investing, except we have to develop our own markers and signposts that tell us whether a position is on track or if we are off course and need to cut said position. To the novice investor, I admit this may sound a little daunting, but the reality is that it\u2019s not impossible to do. All it takes is making sure you understand the company\u2019s business and competitive factors, which is something you should be doing anyway before you buy its shares. I know this because it\u2019s something I do with every stock I recommend in my investment newsletter, , and for every position I invest in for my Thematic Growth Portfolio.Let me share an example or two with you. If you thought the economy was picking up steam and that boded well for the shipping of goods (products, sub-assemblies and components) from supplier to factory, factory to port, port to customer and their distribution facilities and so on, you would be right. One industry to invest in would be the trucking industry, and upon noticing the average age of the heavy truck fleet -- those 18 wheelers you see traveling down interstate 95 on the Eastern seaboard, the 5 that cuts through California or I-70 -- you would think, \u201cWow, there is a real need to replace these trucks!\u201dAfter doing some preliminary research, you would realize there were several companies that manufactured medium- and heavy-duty trucks, including Paccar (). In your pre-trade analysis, you would be digesting all you could about the company, learning about its business, where it conducts its business, who its competitors are, key inputs that go into building a heavy-duty truck and so on. You\u2019d also learn about the company\u2019s dividend payout history and even its annual special dividend that it pays out in December.Along the way, you might read about several truck trends and data points -- build rates, order rates, backlog levels, truck tonnage and more -- as well as sources for those data points. Some of those data points are easy to obtain, like  and , as well as truck tonnage information, while others you would have to be more diligent in collecting, such as monthly industry statistics for truck order and build levels. While ACT Research sells that data, some detective work lets you uncover what you really need. .Once you\u2019ve identified these items, you have to watch the vector and velocity -- what direction they are traveling in and how fast. If the data is favorable, like when truck orders are rising faster than production while the economic data continues to improve, that\u2019s a good thing. If orders fall below build levels for a sustained period of time, it likely signals weaker production levels ahead. That\u2019s not a good sign, one that should have you thinking about trimming the position back or exiting altogether.Other data to watch, such as steel, aluminum and other input prices, helps you gauge if costs are rising and what that may mean for margins and earnings. The same criteria still apply -- are the costs of these inputs rising quickly and likely to impact margins and earnings, are they stable or are they falling?By building this list of items to watch -- signposts, as I call them -- you can keep tabs on the business in a far easier fashion because you know what you\u2019re watching for. Here\u2019s the best part: like any muscle that you exercise, the more you do this, the stronger your aptitude will become. Want some more good news? Here goes -- the more you do this, the more pitfalls you\u2019ll avoid, because your signposts will help keep you on course.In case you missed it, I encourage you to read my PowerTrend Brief article from last week about how  can improve your investing process. I also invite you to comment in the space provided below my  commentary.Sincerely,Christopher VersaceEditor, Editor, Editor, Host, The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["uring the last few weeks, I\u2019ve shared some  and  that I do for each recommendation in my investment  and for positions in my Thematic Growth Portfolio. If you aren\u2019t doing these, you need to go back and get started by re-reading these two bulletins.Since those two articles were published, I\u2019ve received more than a few questions about what should be done in between the pre-trade and post-trade analysis.I thought that was a great question. But before I answer it, let\u2019s consider the difference between a movie and a photograph.There are many aspects between the two that are very similar -- getting the right positioning of the subject or subjects, making sure the lighting is just right, ensuring the wardrobe is appropriate, adjusting for weather conditions and, oftentimes, wrestling with multiple takes from multiple angles. If you\u2019ve ever taken family photos or videoed an event, you know that to do either well takes a lot of hard work.Despite those similarities, the two are very different. A photograph is a snapshot of a moment in time. It is something preserved for eternity. A movie, on the other hand, is a collection of photographs over time. Think about it: movies may be digital today, but originally, they were a spool of thousands or millions of photographs that told a story over time.That\u2019s the biggest difference between a photo and a movie -- one is a snapshot of a moment in time, while the other is a story that unfolds over time. If you were a buy-and-forget-it investor, your style would resemble something like a photograph. The problem is that buy-and-hold investing, or, as I tend to call it, buy-and-sleep investing, is as dead as the VCR or an 8-track tape.Maybe it\u2019s the impact of the Internet and the constant news cycle, or maybe Twitter and other social media like StockTwits, but the days of buy-and-sleep investing are long over. That doesn\u2019t mean you need to be an active trader. What it does mean, however, is that you need to be an active investor -- one who is checking and re-checking key data points, supplier and competitor commentary and more. In other words, one who is monitoring those key signposts that were identified in the pre-trade analysis to see if your investment is tracking as you thought or hoped it would.Like any good movie, particularly an edge-of-the-seat drama, there are bound to be a few twists and turns along the way. That\u2019s why the pre-trade analysis is so important. It helps you plot your signposts and build your investment roadmap. Combined with your ongoing monitoring, you\u2019ll know if you are on your way to profits, or, if the signposts turn up sour, then you may need to trim back or even exit that security in favor of another one -- or even cash depending on the situation and the state of the stock market, as well as the economy.Let me share an example of this with you. The company, and the shares, that I talked about in the pre-trade analysis discussion was heavy truck manufacturer Paccar (). As I reported, the signposts to watch included industry-specific data like build rates, order rates, backlog levels and truck tonnage, as well as several economic indicators like monthly industrial production, purchasing managers order data and even rail traffic statistics. How else other than by truck will goods get to and from a rail port to a company or distribution center?During the last several months, the data has pointed to improving industrial activity in the second quarter of 2014. That means more goods, parts, components, sub assemblies and more are traveling across American roads and highways. Even if you\u2019re concerned that Amazon.com () may be taking market share from brick-and-mortar retailers, the reality of the situation is those packages and parcels need to get to you. That means using trucks.Aside from the favorable fundamental data, two other signposts confirmed that truck demand would continue to be strong for months to come. First, data from Polk show the average age of light trucks to be more than 11 years old -- the highest it's been during the last 10 years -- while recent data from Experian Automotive show the mean age of all medium-duty vehicles is 11 years, while heavy-duty vehicles averaged 12.3 years. That suggests we could be at the start of a replacement cycle for heavy- and medium-duty trucks -- a good thing for Paccar and other companies that serve those markets.Second, President Obama announced he would order the Environmental Protection Agency and the Transportation Department to create new fuel-efficiency and greenhouse-gas standards for trucks by the end of March 2016. The draft of the new regulations would be in place by March 2015, thus giving companies 12 months to digest, comprehend and act on them.Yes, that's more than two years away -- but keep in mind that the term \"truck\" refers to the combination of tractors, pickup trucks and vans, as well as vocational vehicles. As proposed, those vehicle types will be required to reduce fuel consumption and emissions by between 10% and 20%. The White House claims the requirements, if passed, will save a projected 530 million barrels of oil and save owners and operators more than $50 billion in fuel costs.From an investor's perspective, the obvious question is, \u201cWhat does it all mean for my portfolio?\u201dLooking back over a number of years, we see that new emissions regulations such as these have tended to spur engine and truck demand, only to pull it forward ahead of the compliance date. Once the compliance date passes, demand tends to deteriorate.Why? Well, the answer is rather simple. First, because of the higher costs associated with meeting those new emission standards, we see higher engine and vehicle costs -- costs that consumers, companies, fleet owners and truck owner-operators look to avoid.Combine that pending compliance with the high average age of trucks, and it all adds up to the likelihood that we'll see robust replacement demand during the next two years.PCARWhen you track the favorable and confirming data points and anecdotal commentary from supplier and competitors, you can understand why Paccar shares have climbed more than 22% since early February... and that\u2019s before dividends are factored into the return calculation.Did the shares pull back in April and May when Wall Street was concerned about the impact of the harsh winter weather and what it meant to the pace of the economy during the first quarter? They did, but the shares remained well above early February levels, in part because the data for truck demand remained robust. It pays to listen to the data about Paccar shares, which have climbed nearly 10% since the May low.Now that\u2019s one example, but there are literally dozens and dozens of others, if not hundreds out there. Do yourself and your capital a favor. Be sure to follow the pre-trade analysis I shared with you and stay abreast of the signposts you\u2019ve identified to build your roadmap.If that sounds like a lot of work, well, that\u2019s because managing your own portfolio takes a lot of work. No one said it was going to be easy.From my perspective, I see the required work much like your muscles -- the more you use them, the stronger they become; if you don\u2019t use them, they atrophy. Some people need some outside help to get them going -- a group class or personal trainer for example. Those same resources are available to you as an individual investor, and I\u2019ll be touching on more of that next time.In case you missed it, I encourage you to read my PowerTrend Brief article from .

(Symbol: PCAR), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true \"apples-to-apples\" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of Delphi Automotive plc (Symbol: DLPH), the market cap is now $21.95 billion, versus PACCAR Inc. (Symbol: PCAR) at $21.79 billion.Below is a chart of Delphi Automotive plc versus PACCAR Inc. plotting their respective size rank within the S&P 500 over time (DLPH plotted in blue; PCAR plotted in green):    Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of DLPH vs. PCAR:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and \"tosses out\" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller \"up-and-comers\" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at  find value to putting together these rankings daily.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, DLPH and PCAR collectively make up 1.59% of the First Trust Large Cap Growth AlphaDEX Fund ETF (  ) which is lower by about 0.9% on the day Tuesday.At the closing bell, DLPH is up about 0.2%, while PCAR is off about 1.2% on the day Tuesday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], [" (  ) has been charged with an $89,000 fine for seven safety violations with regards to one workplace incident that injured three workers. The fine has been levied by the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health.In Nov 2013, Tesla reported an incident of hot metal spill at its Fremont factory. Failure of an aluminum casting press led to the accident, spilling hot metal on workers and injuring three of them.The employees were admitted to the Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in San Jose with second and third-degree burns. While one was badly injured with hand, stomach, hip, lower back and ankle burns, the other two suffered minor injuries.However, there was no report of fire in the plant. The factory was formerly jointly-owned by  (  ) and  (  ). It was taken over by Tesla four years ago and was transformed into a state-of-the-art production facility.Lack of safe operating condition of the low-pressure die casting machine caused the mishap. The safety interlock was broken when the machine was being operated, leading to the hazardous situation. Lack of proper training about the perils of the operations and the absence of adequate face and eye protection aggravated the situation.Tesla will be appealing against the fine. To its defense, the automaker said that it gives safety utmost importance and will focus on ensuring that such a disastrous incident doesn't recur.

The automaker intends to break ground for construction work at the sites simultaneously, although only one will be used for construction of the Gigafactory initially.This unusual move is being made to avoid any last-minute problem in construction of the plant. Tesla wants to ensure that the factory is ready to supply lithium-ion battery packs within three years.This decision will increase the costs of Tesla. However, the company seems to be laying emphasis on preventing a delay in construction of the factory. Moreover, Tesla might require more than one Gigafactory in the future, according to CEO Elon Musk.Tesla is expanding its operations and plans to increase the production of Model S vehicles by 56% this year. The Gigafactory will produce low-cost battery packs to help the automaker launch less expensive vehicles in market on time.In Feb 2014, Tesla announced its plans to build a Gigafactory to supply lithium-ion batteries to the company's Fremont, CA, assembly plant. It expects the factory to provide economies of scale and reduce production costs based on innovative manufacturing techniques, reduced logistic wastes, optimization of co-located processes and lower overhead costs.Earlier, Tesla analyzed 500 to 1,000-acre sites in Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas for the construction of the factory, which will be employing around 6,500 people.By 2020, Tesla expects the annual lithium ion battery production at the Gigafactory to exceed the global production recorded in 2013. The factory is likely to manufacture enough batteries required to build around 500,000 electric cars by 2020. Also, by the end of the first year of manufacture, per kWh cost of production of the battery packs is expected to be down by over 30%. Eventually, the facility will also supply battery packs to  (  ).The construction of the factory will require an investment of $5 billion. Tesla intends to finance the construction from the proceeds of a senior notes issue. The company raised $2.3 billion from convertible note sale in Mar 2014.Tesla is also focusing on the launch of the third-generation car in 2015. The vehicle is likely to be priced on par with a BMW 3-Series sedan or at about half of the base price of Model S.Recently, Tesla celebrated the opening of the 100th supercharger station in Hamilton, NJ. Superchargers help to charge the Model S faster, facilitating long-distance travel. At present Tesla have 87 Supercharger stations in North America and 14 in Europe.

In the last quarter it posted a +10.71% surprise. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Ford is pursuing a major expansion plan in the emerging markets, primarily in Argentina, Brazil, China, India and Thailand. The company has plans to launch 15 new models in China by 2015. The popularity of the expanded product line-up boosted the automaker's sales in China by 45% in the first quarter.However, sales in the U.S. declined in the first 2 months of 2014, resulting in a 2.6% fall in Ford's U.S. sales in the first quarter of 2014, despite a 3.4% increase in March. Moreover, the company's structural costs are increasing due to higher volumes as well as expansion and improvement of its product line-up.Further, wholesale volume in North America is expected to be lower than the 2013 figure due to production downtime associated with model changeovers. Ford is also experiencing weakness in South America due to economic problems and uncertainties in Venezuela and Argentina and weakness in the Brazilian economy.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Ford is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive  and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below. The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -3.13%. That is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 31 cents while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is higher at 32 cents. Ford's Zacks Rank #3 when combined with a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult. We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and #5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum.Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: (  ), with Earnings ESP of +2.59% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

(Symbol: PCAR) has taken over the #195 spot from Delphi Automotive plc (Symbol: DLPH), according to  .Market capitalization is an important data point for investors to keep an eye on, for various reasons. The most basic reason is that it gives a true comparison of the value attributed by the stock market to a given company's stock. Many beginning investors look at one stock trading at $10 and another trading at $20 and mistakenly think the latter company is worth twice as much - that of course is a completely meaningless comparison without knowing how many shares of each company exist. But comparing market capitalization (factoring in those share counts) creates a true \"apples-to-apples\" comparison of the value of two stocks. In the case of PACCAR Inc. (Symbol: PCAR), the market cap is now $21.19 billion, versus Delphi Automotive plc (Symbol: DLPH) at $21.06 billion.Below is a chart of PACCAR Inc. versus Delphi Automotive plc plotting their respective size rank within the S&P 500 over time (PCAR plotted in blue; DLPH plotted in green):    Below is a three month price history chart comparing the stock performance of PCAR vs. DLPH:Another reason market capitalization is important is where it places a company in terms of its size tier in relation to peers - much like the way a mid-size sedan is typically compared to other mid-size sedans (and not SUV's). This can have a direct impact on which mutual funds and ETFs are willing to own the stock. For instance, a mutual fund that is focused solely on Large Cap stocks may for example only be interested in those companies sized $10 billion or larger. Another illustrative example is the S&P MidCap index which essentially takes the S&P 500 index and \"tosses out\" the biggest 100 companies so as to focus solely on the 400 smaller \"up-and-comers\" (which in the right environment can outperform their larger rivals). So a company's market cap, especially in relation to other companies, carries great importance, and for this reason we at  find value to putting together these rankings daily.According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, PCAR and DLPH collectively make up 1.87% of the S&P 500 High Beta Portfolio ETF (  ) which is higher by about 0.7% on the day Thursday.At the closing bell, PCAR is up about 1.1%, while DLPH is up about 0.5% on the day Thursday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["Shutterstock photoThe  is up 8.78 to 3,386.51.

Recently, a House subcommittee released documents showed that the automaker is reluctant to address the safety problems.In Feb 2014, General Motors announced the recall of 2.6 million older-model small cars associated with 31 crashes and 13 front-seat fatalities due to faulty ignition switches. The recalled vehicles mainly include Chevrolet Cobalts and Saturn Ions. Considerable costs associated with the repair are a potential reason behind the delayed recall. If replaced in 2007, the switches would have cost the automaker $100 million. However, the expenses will be much higher now with higher prices of parts.General Motors identified the switch problem in 2001. The engineers provided different options to rectify the defect but none of them were accepted due to cost concerns.  (  ), the parts supplier of General Motors, also said that the ignition switches did not match the GM specifications.According to General Motors, a heavy key ring or uneven roads can cause the ignition switch to shift away from the run position, thus turning off the engine and electrical power. In such a situation, the front air bags will not inflate in case of a crash.The documents also confirm that the present CEO of General Motors, Mary Barra, has been aware of the faults in the Saturn Ion power steering since Oct 2011. However, the company recalled the vehicles more than two years later.The U.S. senators requested the Department of Justice to take steps which will hinder the efforts taken by General Motors to avoid financial responsibility related to the late recall of vehicles with faulty ignition switch.The senators want General Motors to create a victims compensation fund which will ensure that consumers are warned about cars with potential ignition switch problems. General Motors will record a $750 million charge in the first quarter of 2014 due to the increased number of recalls. The expenses include a $300 million charge incurred on three recalls in March and the ignition switch recall.Recently, Mary Barra had to face a congressional committee hearing due to the delayed recall of vehicles with faulty ignition switches. Barra revealed that the company is determined to resolve the issue without further delay.Barra also announced that it has hired Kenneth Feinberg, known for handling the compensation funds for the victims of 9/11, the Boston Marathon bombing and the BP oil spill, to find out ways to compensate the victims of the accidents.

The question is: would it work?Last May in the wake of a potential credit default from Greece, the euro zone member was given a 110 billion euro bailout jointly from the IMF and other members of the euro zone. When Greek interest rates did not improve and signs of contagion in other euro zone countries began to emerge, the EU set up a 750 billion euro bailout program with the IMF that included 440 billion euros in credit guarantees from the euro zone countries.But questions have since been circulating whether the size of the bailout was large enough to shore up confidence in the markets. Interest rates for Greek, Italian, and Portuguese debt have remained severely elevated; several euro zone countries have since dealt with drastic credit ratings downgrades; and Greece has failed to meet certain deficit requirements of their bailout package. The  continues to watch the euro zone daily.Peter Boone and Simon Johnson (via the blog ) provide some interesting insights. They note that although some expect that such a large bailout would \u201cawe\u201d the market into submission, and that the 4 trillion euro fund would not actually be used, they suggest this is implausible.They argue that if Italian rates (for instance) fall to more normal levels, many private sector holders would quickly sell to lock in gains, requiring outflows from the euro zone members and the emergency fund to acquire significant amounts of Italian (and Spanish and Portuguese) debt. And Germany would not like having the fund be responsible for financing those countries\u2019 continuing budget deficits.Of course, they also say that Germany and others must agree in the first place to this strategy of \u201cborrow and leverage\u201d to expand the bailout fund, a large uncertainty by itself.So, which U.S. companies stand to lose the most if the 4 trillion euro stability fund proves to be a fantasy?For ideas,  has created a list of the top ten US stocks that derive a large portion of their revenue from European countries:1.  of all companies mentioned2.  mentioned below3.  mentioned Edwards Lifesciences Corp. a leader in advanced cardiovascular disease treatments, is the number-one heart valve company in the world and the global leader in acute hemodynamic monitoring.

The main concern, according to a report from , is protecting \u201cbanks and other investors holding the debt while keeping the crisis from spreading to other nations in the currency bloc.\u201d This means a restructuring of Athen\u2019s debt with specific terms, while keeping banks properly capitalized when they have to write down the Greek debt on their books.\u201cThe markets have already figured out Greece is defaulting; that\u2019s what all the bond spreads tell you\u2026. What they are really worried about is whether the system in Europe will get impaired,\u201d said Jason Pride of Glenmede Investment and Wealth Management.\u201cI think the world can absorb an orderly default of Greece at this point, and I think it would be a great relief to the market when it actually takes place. I think investors should be positioned opportunistically for that,\u201d chief market strategist at LPL Financial Jeff Kleintop told MarketWatch.Analysts believe that if the markets positively responded to an orderly Greek default, markets could see a shift away from the flight to safety.

Supervalu made its view public along with other retail giants urging the takeover would leave \"only two significant competitors in a highly concentrated industry.\"The National Association of Chain Drug Stores (of which Supervalu is a member), the National Community Pharmacists Association, and few retail pharmacy companies have filed a lawsuit at US District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania appealing that the merger should be stopped.Express Scripts wants to takeover Medco Health Solutions for $29.0 billion. The two pharmacy chains are big players in the field of Pharmacy Benefit.Given the large purchasing power, the Pharmacy Benefit Managers (  ) negotiate and reduce employers, government agencies and other clients' spending on prescription drugs.If the merger takes place, St. Louis-based Express Scripts and New Jersey-based Medco would create the largest U.S. PBM, controlling prescriptions of more than one in three Americans. Thus, the pharmacy groups are worried that the merger will hurt several retail pharmacy chains, specialty chains and huge employers who need pharmacy benefits.We note, earlier this year that another retail bigwig  (  ) had refrained from renewing its license with Express Scripts.Therefore, customers who were registered with Express Script had to refill their prescriptions at new pharmacies or pay for them out of their own pocket.Supervalu's Shop n Save with 50 stores in Illinois and Missouri, and 34 pharmacies planned to hire more workers and enhance its pharmacy services to welcome patients with Express Scripts prescription plans.It has urged the Express Script customers to transfer prescriptions well ahead of time, as then the pharmacist at the Shop n Save stores can arrange for the medicines in advance.Supervalu holds a Zacks #3 Rank that implies a short term Hold Rating.With a view to improving its product lines,  (  ) has launched high technology aerodynamic trucks at the Mid-America Trucking Show in Louisville, Kentucky. It took nearly 4 years and $400 million to launch these trucks under the Kenworth T680 and Peterbilt 579 brand names.The trucks, powered with the company's own fuel efficient and high horse-power diesel engines, have a cab width of 2.1 meter. These trucks form part of the heavy-duty class-8 segment and are available at low price.In the fourth quarter of 2011, PACCAR achieved a record Class 8 retail market share of 28.1% in the U.S. and Canada. Class 8 industry retail sales in the U.S. and Canada improved 56% to 197,000 units in 2011 from 126,000 in 2010.The company reported earnings of 91 cents per share in the quarter, up from 46 cents per share in the year-ago quarter and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 79 cents per share. Net sales and financial service revenues in the quarter surged 58% to $4.85 billion, which is the highest quarterly revenue in the company's history. It also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.21 billion.PACCAR expects the truck market to improve in 2012 driven by recovery in the housing market. With the improvement of the truck market and introduction of new vehicles, revenues are expected to reach higher levels in the coming quarters.Want more from Zacks Equity Research?

Can that be true?Faced with the possibility of a Greek default and an already overwhelming financial crisis to overcome, the difference between Europe today and 2008 US is political unity, says Soros.While America - a single entity with a single government and single leader - created a focused and cohesive goal to solve the problem, Europe is a mess of countries, problems, and goals, and lacks the unity in leadership to deal with the crisis at hand. As the saying goes, \"there are too many cooks in the kitchen.\"The authority that the US used to handle the crisis is lacking in Europe. The U.S. Treasury Department in 2008 \"helped devise and implement the myriad liquidity programs used to recapitalize big banks and reassure investors when questions arose over their stability and integrity of deposits.\" (via )Soros suggests a similar unified Treasury would go a long way in helping Europe get back on track. For Europe to do this, an institution needs to be in place that is \"more creative\" than the European Financial Stability Facility, which is understood to be improperly equipped to handle such an event. \"I very much hope the heads of state of the member countries will recognize that,\" he said. \"That will open the way to containing the crisis.\" (via CNBC)He emphasizes the key necessity is to have liquidity in the event of a Greek default because timing liquidity with market crashes could prevent a chain reaction.So, in the event Soros' predictions come to pass (Greece defaults and the European community finds itself unprepared for the consequences) and his advice goes unheeded, we were wondering: which companies have a big exposure to European downturn?Fortunately,  has created a list of the top ten US stocks which derive a large chunk of their revenue from European countries:1.  of all companies mentioned2.  mentioned below3.  mentioned Edwards Lifesciences Corp. a leader in advanced cardiovascular disease treatments, is the number-one heart valve company in the world and the global leader in acute hemodynamic monitoring.

Keeping sales stable and expenses at a minimum enables them to survive until the  gets back on its feet. But select companies are able to take advantage of these challenging times, aggressively seeking ways to boost sales.I screened the entire membership of the S&P 500  to find companies that have been able to defy the slowdown and keep powering the top line to new heights.The screen revealed a number of oil and gas names that are expected to derive higher sales from firming energy prices in 2011. But it's unclear if the economic growth will be sufficient to boost energy prices enough to help these companies sharply boost sales in 2011, as analysts currently suspect. So, I've removed names such as  ,  ,  ,  and others from this list.As the table below highlights, all of these companies are expected to boost sales at least +20% in the next  . Any further economic weakness could cause these forecasts to slip, so it pays to do further research on the companies before deciding to buy these stocks. Some companies such as  and  are not economically sensitive, while others such as  and  certainly are.\n  \n vs. The table highlights a stark contrast between these two tech giants. Both companies are expected to boost sales roughly +25% in 2011, but Amazon's  ratio based on 2011's projected  is roughly 150% higher than Apple's. That's counter-intuitive when considering Apple recently just surged past analyst forecasts, while Amazon lagged them. Some suggest Apple is the one that deserves to trade with a far richer forward multiple.But just looking at 2010 and 2011 results is not the best way to assess these stocks. Instead, you need to look at where these companies are in terms of their long-term growth cycle. Are they close to reaching a peak in terms of profits? Or do they possess substantial growth prospects into the middle of this decade? Also, do near-term profits truly reflect the long-term value being created?To its credit, Apple has indeed been a remarkable growth story -- which should continue into next year -- but competition continues to build, especially from Google, as I've noted before. [See:  ]Yet in relation to those questions just asked, Amazon has established a long-term growth plan that requires large amounts of upfront spending, but could yield the next multi-billion dollar growth categories. Amazon's CEO Jeff Bezos is fully aware that as a customer relies on the company for more and more goods, it becomes even easier to lure them into new categories. Already buying books and lawn furniture from Amazon? Why not add cosmetics to your order and have Amazon hold off on further shipping charges?This is why the company keeps testing new concepts -- in hopes of eventually selling so many goods that the delivery guy comes by once or twice a week. In fact, Amazon is now testing delivery of groceries. Others have tried and failed before, but Amazon may finally have reached the necessary scale. [  ]Health care stocks can offer a high degree of safety in tough markets, and sector plays that are in the midst of a strong growth spurt can help investors play offense and defense at the same time. One of my favorite health care names -- thanks to its steady growth -- is Celgene, which focuses on treatments for auto-immune disorders and various cancers. The company's drug portfolio is anchored by Revlimid and Thalomid, both of which treat myelomas -- blood cancers that emanate from bone marrow.Management rode the coattails of those drugs and saw sales rise at least +50% in 2006, 2007 and 2008. Sales growth cooled to +19% last year, so the company acquired Gloucester Pharma, which has an approved drug for the treatment of t-cell lymphoma, in January, 2010. Celgene's $3 billion acquisition of  should also close in coming weeks, which should give the company greater exposure to the breast cancer treatment market. Back in June, when the deal was announced, Citigroup's Yaron Werber noted that \"the deal is not cheap but has attractive commercial potential in an overlooked asset. This is exactly the right time and kind of asset to invest in.\"Those deals, along with continued organic growth among its existing drugs, should push sales up more than +25% in 2011, according to analyst's forecasts. The company still has ample cash left to find additional tuck-in acquisitions to keep sales moving higher in 2012. Sooner or later, Celgene is going to be the target of larger suitors in the pharmaceutical industry, thanks to its increasing heft. These companies are finding ways to grow during tough times, which means that if economic conditions improve beyond 2011, any headwinds become tailwinds and set the stage for further growth. Amazon's stock is a risky, but potentially game-changing play and should hold appeal to investors looking for one of the best potential growth stories during the next five years. Celgene, in contrast, represents a solid investment in terms of near-term results and reasonable fundamentals.Disclosure: Neither David Sterman nor StreetAuthority, LLC hold\npositions in any securities mentioned in this article.-- David StermanDavid Sterman started his career in equity research at Smith Barney, culminating in a position as Senior Analyst covering European banks.

About 3,500 October 41 calls were bought at the same time for $0.05, but volume was below open interest in that strike.That indicates that an existing short position was closed and rolled forward by one month, which let the investor earn income in return for agreeing to spend more time in the trade. He or she probably owns PCAR shares and is using the options as part of a  .The strategy frequently appears when stocks have high option premiums after a big drop. For example, PCAR's  has climbed to more than 50 percent versus about 30 percent in July. (See our  section)The stock rose 3.46 percent to $35.60 yesterday but is still down sharply from three months ago when it traded around $50. The first negative catalyst was a weak earnings report on July 26, followed by weakness in the broader market.Overall option volume was 6 times greater than average in the session.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["accar appears to be rolling over after a 16 percent bounce, and now one trader is positioning for a push lower. optionMONSTER's Depth Charge tracking system detected the purchase of about 1,300 November 39 puts for approximately $2.10 and the sale of a matching number of November 49 calls for $2.20. Volume was more than 12 times open interest in both strikes.The transaction, known as a bearish risk reversal, cost about $0.10 to implement and will deliver major leverage if PCAR falls below $39 by expiration. It will lose money if the truckmaker climbs over $49 and produce no return if the stock closes between those two levels.PCAR rose 1.90 percent to $44.48 yesterday and has rallied back from as low as $38.50 earlier in the month. The shares peaked at $48.65 in two months ago, so the trader may now consider that level resistance and feel comfortable writing calls at the $49 strike.Yesterday's trade may also have been implemented by a shareholder as part of a so-called collar strategy, which will protect against a major selloff and while capping the upside at $49.PCAR crushed analysts' forecasts on both revenue and earnings the last time it issued results on April 20. The next release hasn't yet been scheduled but will likely occur in the second half of July.Overall option volume in the name was seven times greater than average yesterday.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."], ["ne investor is giving Paccar more time to rebound.optionMONSTER's tracking programs detected the sale of 2,737 December 45 calls for $5.08. An equal number of November 45 puts were purchased at the same time for $4.85, but volume was below open interest.That suggests that an existing  in the puts was closed and rolled forward by one month. The investor had probably sold the November contracts when PCAR was at a higher price, looking to earn income. With expiration looming tomorrow, he or she adjusted the position to avoid being assigned to buy shares.The trader also collected an incremental $0.23 of income and stands to profit from upside in the shares. (See our  section)PCAR is up 0.65 percent to $40.55 today but has lost about 19 percent of its value in the last six months. Most of that drop followed a weak earnings report by the truck maker in July, but the last release on Oct. 25 was better than expected.Overall option volume in the name is twice the average amount so far today.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc."]], "Title": ["Bullish Two Hundred Day Moving Average Cross - PCAR", ["Paccar Inc (PCAR) Q1 2020 Earnings Call Transcript"], ["How Big Is the \"Big Rig\" Market Tesla and Nikola Are Chasing, Anyway?"], ["First Week of June 19th Options Trading For PACCAR "], ["How Big Is the \"Big Rig\" Market Tesla and Nikola Are Chasing, Anyway?"], ["Validea Benjamin Graham Strategy Daily Upgrade Report - 5/5/2020"], ["Truck maker Volvo profit falls less than expected amid pandemic pain"], ["First Week of July 17th Options Trading For PACCAR "], ["Ex-Dividend Reminder: PACCAR, American Water Works and Equitrans Midstream"], ["How The Pieces Add Up: QQQ Targets $234"], ["Paccar Inc.
